BeforeCombat: >-
  The boggard wardens cast speak with animals once they fear combat is about to
  begin so they can more effectively order their frog companions around in
  battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  Boggard wardens prefer to attack humans, dual-wielding their trident and
  handaxe and preferring to fight while standing in mud or tangled bogs so they
  can use their swamp stride ability to an advantage.
Morale: Boggard wardens fight to the death.
