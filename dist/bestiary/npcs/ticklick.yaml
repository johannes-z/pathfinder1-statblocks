SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hatred (Ex)
    description: >-
      Mites receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the
      dwarf or gnome subtype due to special training against these hated foes.
  - name: Vermin Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy, save that a mite can use
      this ability only on vermin. A mite gains a +4 racial bonus on this check.
      Vermin are normally mindless, but this empathic communication imparts to
      them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing mites to train Medium
      vermin and use them as mounts. Vermin empathy treats swarms as if they
      were one creature with a single mind-a mite can thus use this ability to
      influence and direct the actions of swarms with relative ease.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ticklick uses Rapid Shot as often as he can. If he is mounted, Ticklick's
  centipede mount moves before the attack to give him a clear line of fire, and
  it moves again after the attack to avoid retaliation.
Morale: >-
  If brought to 7 hit points or fewer, Ticklick drinks a potion of cure light
  wounds. If Ticklick is unable to heal or his centipede dies, the mite flees at
  top speed and likely ambushes the PCs from elsewhere in the estate.
Gear: potions of cure light wounds (2), tanglefoot bags (2)
