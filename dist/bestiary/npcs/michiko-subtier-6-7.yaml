SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Channel Destruction (Su)
    description: >-
      Any weapon Michiko wields seethes with energy and deals an additional 1d6
      points of cold damage.
  - name: Devastating Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, Michiko may unleash a 30-foot cone of ice as a
      standard action. This blast deals 4d6 points of cold damage (DC 18 Reflex
      half). Eastern Weapon Training Akina's training allows her to treat
      katana, naginata, and wakizashi as martial weapons.
  - name: Phantom Mount (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per hour, Michiko can summon a skeletal horse similar to a phantom
      steed. This mount is more real than a typical phantom steed, and can carry
      one additional rider. The mount's powers are based on her total Hit Dice
      rather than caster level. A graveknight's mount looks distinctive and
      always appears the same each time it is summoned. If the mount is
      destroyed, it can be summoned again with full hit points 1 hour later.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      One day after a graveknight is destroyed, its armor begins to rebuild the
      undead horror's body. This process takes 1d10 days-if the body is
      destroyed before that time passes, the armor merely starts the process
      anew. After this time has elapsed, the graveknight wakens fully healed.
  - name: Ruinous Revivification (Su)
    description: >-
      At the time of its creation, a graveknight chooses one of the following
      energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. This choice influences
      several of its special abilities. Michiko chose cold.
  - name: Undead Mastery (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Michiko can attempt to bend any undead creature
      within 50 feet to her will. The targeted undead must succeed at a Will
      save or fall under her control. This control is permanent for
      unintelligent undead; an undead with an Intelligence score is allowed an
      additional save every day to break free. A creature that successfully
      saves cannot be affected again by her undead mastery for 24 hours. Michiko
      can control up to 35 HD worth of undead; if she exceeds this number, the
      excess from earlier uses of the ability becomes uncontrolled, as per
      animate dead.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: Michiko summons a phantom mount and prepares for battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  Michiko attacks with her katana, focusing on frightened opponents and those
  who display holy symbols of good deities first.
Morale: >-
  Michiko's hatred for the living and trust in her armor to revive her undead
  form drive her to fight until she is destroyed.
