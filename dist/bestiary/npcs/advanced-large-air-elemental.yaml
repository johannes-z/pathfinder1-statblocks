BeforeCombat: >-
  If the elementals have been alerted to intruders, one of them hides inside the
  hollow altar (Stealth +13). Otherwise, they fly lazily just below the dome's
  apex.
DuringCombat: >-
  One elemental begins by transforming into whirlwind form, attempting to lift
  PCs into the air and drop them onto the hall below (from up to 60 feet high).
  The other uses Flyby Attack to harass PCs on the balcony, ending each of its
  turns with as much cover as possible.
