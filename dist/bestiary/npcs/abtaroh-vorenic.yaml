BeforeCombat: >-
  Abtaroh casts endure elements, false life, mage armor, misdirection (onto her
  dagger), shield, and unseen servant before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Abtaroh tries to keep her cultist followers between herself and the enemy,
  casting black tentacles to prevent the PCs from approaching. She uses her wand
  of mirror image as soon as it appears that she'll be in melee combat or is
  otherwise targeted by attacks. Abtaroh would prefer to capture the PCs alive,
  and uses charm person to help secure their alliance&#8211;she hopes to use the
  PCs to investigate the crash site, and whether they do so as charmed minions
  or beaten foes who have bargained for their lives matters little to her.
Morale: >-
  Abtaroh casts dimension door if reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, fleeing
  to the surface above. She then casts beast shape I to assume the shape of an
  eagle and flies to Dustpawn&#8211;she's never been seen in town, so she can
  resume her true form once there to go into hiding. When the Emissary arrives,
  Abtaroh comes out of hiding to present herself to the alien creature.
  Unfortunately for her, the Emissary has no more use for her at this point and
  attacks Abtaroh, perhaps giving the PCs a round or two of respite before it
  turns its attention to them.
