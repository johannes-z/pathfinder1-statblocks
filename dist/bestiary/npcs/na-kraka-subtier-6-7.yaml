SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ink Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per hour as a standard action, a cecaelia can emit a 10-foot-radius
      sphere of ink while underwater. This ink cloud provides total concealment
      and persists for 1 minute.
  - name: Tentacle Sense (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a swift action while swimming and while it is not grappled or
      grappling, the cecaelia can spread its tentacles wide to form a sensory
      net around it. This grants blindsight to a range of 10 feet and lasts as
      long as the cecaelia concentrates. While this effect lasts, the creature
      cannot attack with its tentacles or move.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Should the Sea Witch be alerted to the presence of interlopers in its lair, he
  immediately casts mage armor and false life.
DuringCombat: >-
  Na-Kraka attempts to grapple the first visible opponent with its tentacles
  before rushing out into the flooded antechamber. While still grappling his
  opponent, the Sea Witch moves into the water where he attempts to drown
  grappled opponents. If an enemy breaks a grapple, the Sea Witch lets out an
  ink cloud and proceeds to use spells to wear down opponents before striking
  with melee attacks.
Morale: >-
  Despite thinking himself superior to humans, Na-Kraka is not completely
  reckless. If reduced to 20 or fewer hit points, the Sea Witch begs for his
  life, offering to serve the PCs, surrendering the Celestial Song, and doing
  anything else he can think of to avoid being slain. If during negotiations the
  sealed doors of the southern tunnels in the antechamber open and release the
  water back into the tunnel system, the Sea Witch attempts to make an escape
  using his jet ability.
