SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Vermin Empathy (Su)
    description: >-
      A blight druid can improve the attitude of vermin as a normal druid can
      with animals. Vermin have a starting attitude of unfriendly. A blight
      druid can also improve the attitude of animals and mindless undead
      creatures that were formerly animals, but takes a -4 penalty on the check
      unless the animal or undead has a disease special attack.
  - name: Miasma (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a blight druid is adjacent to a creature at the beginning of its
      turn, the creature must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or become
      sickened for 1 round. A creature of the animal, fey, or plant type that
      fails its save is nauseated for 1 round and sickened for 1 minute
      thereafter. If the creature makes its save, it is immune to this effect
      for 24 hours, as are creatures that are immune to disease.
  - name: Plaguebearer (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature that strikes a blight druid with a touch attack, unarmed
      strike, or natural weapon must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or
      contract a disease, as the contagion spell. If the creature makes its
      save, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ferocleus casts antilife shell, longstrider, and freedom of movement once he
  becomes aware of the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ferocleus depends on magic as his primary weapon, preferring to avoid melee
  and attack with ranged spells. If possible, he isolates a single PC with a
  wall of stone, allowing his fellow escapees to focus their attacks on a single
  target. If melee is unavoidable and he has no more touch or close-range
  spells, he wild shapes into a huge earth elemental.
Morale: >-
  Ferocleus knows what his future holds if he's recaptured and placed back in
  temporal stasis, and he fights to the death to avoid such a fate.
