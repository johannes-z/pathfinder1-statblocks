Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Gelviel casts mage armor and false life every day, extending them with his
  metamagic mastery ability. As soon as he hears combat elsewhere in the ship,
  he casts bear's endurance, stoneskin, and shield to prepare for battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  Gelviel's first act in combat is to flee to the bow of the ship and cast
  repulsion, shrieking for the "treacherous mutineers" to "stay away!" He
  follows this up by casting summon monster V to conjure 1d3 Medium air
  elementals, after which he casts displacement. He follows this up with his
  ranged attack spells, trusting his elementals to keep foes from entering melee
  with him. If he is forced into melee, he uses his wand of vampiric touch.
Morale: Gelviel Zorriah fights to the death.
Gear: wand of vampiric touch (9 charges)
