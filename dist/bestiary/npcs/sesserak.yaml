DuringCombat: >-
  Sesserak hangs back in combat, using her bow while the other two kobolds
  attack in melee. She resorts to melee attacks only if cornered.
Morale: >-
  If reduced below 10 hit points, Sesserak asks to parley. If the PCs agree, she
  reveals that the tunnel in area A15 leads to the quarry and the lair of her
  tribe. This betrayal shows she has no plans to return, now that she's failed
  twice. Sesserak says nothing about Aeteperax, nor does she reveal the exact
  location of the kobold lair. She claims that she was working for Hunclay to
  bring down the Witch Tower, but insists that an "accident" resulted in the
  wizard's death.
