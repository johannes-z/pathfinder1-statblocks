BeforeCombat: >-
  Oaca does everything to pass themself off as a harmless and nervous halfling,
  not because they don't want a fight, but because they love the look of
  surprise when they catch opponents unaware.
DuringCombat: >-
  Oaca prefers to open any fight by using jester's jaunt to throw one enemy
  outside before beginning their bardic performance of cruel jokes and barbs.
  The dandasuka prefers to attack with tooth and claw, but casts mirror image if
  reduced below 100 hit points.
Morale: Oaca fights to the death.
Gear: silent metamagic rod, wand of acid arrow (47 charges)
OtherGear: house keys, emerald brooch (worth 400 gp)
