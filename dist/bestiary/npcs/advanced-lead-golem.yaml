  - name: Divination Screen (Ex)
    description: Divination spells cast within 60 feet of a lead golem automatically fail.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A lead golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell
      resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against a lead
      golem, as noted here. 1. A magical attack that deals acid damage instead
      coats the lead golem, granting its slam attacks an additional 1d6 acid
      damage for the following 1d4 rounds. 2. A gust of wind or neutralize
      poison spell directed at the lead golem dissipates any clouds created by
      its retributive miasma ability and prevents it from using that ability for
      1d6 rounds.
  - name: Intractable Density (Ex)
    description: >-
      The weight and sturdiness of its form grants the lead golem a +8 racial
      bonus on CMD versus bull rush and reposition combat maneuvers.
  - name: Retributive Miasma (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any attack that overcomes the damage reduction of the lead golem causes
      fine lead particles to fill the air within a 5-foot radius of the lead
      golem. This cloud of lead persists for 1 round; any creatures within the
      area or that pass through the cloud are exposed to the cloud's poisonous
      effects. Subsequent attacks damaging the golem increase the duration of
      the cloud by 1 round each. Poison Cloud-inhaled; save Fort 16; frequency
      1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Constitution and 1d3 Wisdom damage; cure
      2 saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The lead golem attempts to corner melee opponents, hoping to inflict its
  retributive miasma on as many foes as possible. It does not generally pursue
  foes that leave the room, unless attacked from outside the room.
Morale: The lead golem fights until it is destroyed.
