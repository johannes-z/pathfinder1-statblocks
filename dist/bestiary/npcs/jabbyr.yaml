BeforeCombat: As soon as combat begins, Jabbyr rages.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jabbyr follows Pilts's commands exactly, attacking whomever the emperor orders
  him to. Left to his own devices, Jabbyr tends to focus on whatever enemy is
  closest. The single exception to this is gnomes, as Jabbyr attacks other
  gnomes only in response to being attacked by one of them first. Pilts knows
  better than to order the insane barbarian to attack another gnome, in any
  event.
Morale: >-
  Jabbyr fights to the death. If he discovers that Pilts has been killed, he
  freezes in shock for 1 round before continuing his rage (this round of no
  actions still depletes his available rounds of raging as normal). On the other
  hand, if Pilts surrenders in Jabbyr's presence, something inside the gnome
  snaps and he focuses his wrath on the ex-emperor. Surrendering is tantamount
  to treason in Jabbyr's mind, and he'd rather have his master slain at his own
  hands than live with the ignominy of such a defeat. He might even demand that
  the PCs help him put Pilts into the Tall Knife, although whether the PCs can
  understand the demented little gnome's tongueless babbling is left for you to
  determine (at your discretion, this may require a successful DC 20 Sense
  Motive check).
