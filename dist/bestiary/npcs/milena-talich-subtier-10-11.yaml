BeforeCombat: >-
  Milena casts mage armor and shield prior to the start of combat, and true
  strike the round before combat to increase her chances of hitting with an
  opening onslaught. If she has time, she uses her spider climb ability to climb
  the wall and gain a view of the doorway.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round, Milena casts quickened ray of enfeeblement on the first
  creature through the door, then follows up with black tentacles to trap the
  party. Thereafter, she alternates damaging spells like magic  missile, cone of
  cold, scorching ray, and lightning bolt with control spells like dispel magic,
  slow, and glitterdust. In melee, she prefers vampiric touch to her slam
  attacks, knowing that her chances of hitting are higher.
Morale: >-
  If the situation takes a turn for the worse and Milena sees no hope of her
  survival, she attempts to dominate the strongest PC and instructs him to
  defend her. She fights until destroyed, knowing that the Pathfinders already
  have access to her coffin.
