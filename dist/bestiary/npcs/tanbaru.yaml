SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mask Symbiosis (Ex)
    description: >-
      A spirit oni can be worn as a mask by a willing Small or Medium creature.
      While worn in this way, the wearer can see through the oni's eyes and
      speak through its mouth, although the wearer retains its own senses and
      voice. The spirit oni remains a separate creature, and must detach from
      its host's face (as a move action) if it wishes to take any action of its
      own (including attacking or using a spell-like ability). While a spirit
      oni is worn as a mask, it grants a +2 insight bonus on its host's
      Perception checks.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Gore-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3
      Cha; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Tanbaru uses his at-will invisibility to remain invisible and attaches himself
  to the face of an iron statue.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tanbaru directs one of the two iron sculptures that have been specially
  designed to animate with his guidance. If the PCs destroy that sculpture, he
  flies over to the other sculpture that he can animate and directs it instead.
  He does not use his own offensive spell-like abilities, because such actions
  would break his invisbility. Animating the iron sculptures to attack the PCs
  does not break his invisbiliity.
Morale: >-
  If the PCs defeat the duergar sentinels, Tanbaru drops his invisibility and
  attempts to parley (see Development). If the PCs destroy the sculptures that
  Tanbaru can animate before they defeat the duergar, he flies invisibly above
  the fray and waits. After the combat, he offers the PCs assistance in
  navigating the fortress (see Development). If the PCs refuse his offer, he is
  suddenly overcome with rage. He curses at them in Tien and begins a new
  combat. He uses any remaining iron statues to fight the PCs, and then attacks
  them with his spell-like abilities (except permanent image, which he cast
  earlier in the week). In this second combat, Tanburu fights to the death.
