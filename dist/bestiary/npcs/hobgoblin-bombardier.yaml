  - name: Alternate Racial Features (Ex)
    description: >-
      The bombardier has the engineer racial trait in place of sneaky, granting
      him a +2 bonus on Craft (alchemy) and Knowledge (engineering) checks. He
      also employs the hobgoblin alternate favored class option for his alchemy
      levels, granting him four additional uses of his bomb ability each day.
      Both of these racial options can be found on page 121 of the Pathfinder
      RPG Advanced Race Guide.
DuringCombat: >-
  The bombardier hurls bombs at enemies, or uses directed blast if the foes are
  grouped closely together. He uses unstable accelerants with the bombs that
  seem most likely to hit. He saves most of his alchemical items to use with the
  alchemical weapon ability if he gets stuck fighting in melee range. In this
  circumstance, he drinks his mutagen before attacking.
