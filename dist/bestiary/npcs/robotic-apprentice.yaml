SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Electromagnetic Casting (Su)
    description: >-
      A robotic apprentice infuses its spells with electromagnetic energy. A
      creature targeted by a robotic apprentice's spell or within the area of a
      robotic apprentice's spell when it is cast takes 1d6 points of electricity
      damage and 1d6 points of force damage in addition to experiencing the
      effects of the spell, regardless of whether the creature succeeds or fails
      its saving throw (or whether a saving throw is allowed).
DuringCombat: >-
  The apprentices use web to block the exit from this room and perhaps catch a
  few PCs, then use stinking cloud and glitterdust against foes to try to
  minimize reprisals. A robot isn't above casting grease on itself to aid it in
  moving through its own web spell if needed. The apprentices prefer to refrain
  from entering melee until they outnumber foes capable of fighting back, and
  focus their attacks on spellcasters first. The apprentices attempt to
  immobilize and detain foes rather than kill them, hoping to deliver enemies
  stripped of gear and   bound with rolls of ion tapeTG to their master's
  personal laboratory in the dungeon.
Morale: >-
  The robotic apprentices fight until destroyed, but do not pursue foes out of
  this room.
