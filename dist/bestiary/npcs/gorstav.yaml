DuringCombat: >-
  Although Gorstav retains his military training, he fights without emotion of
  any kind, almost as if he were little more than a construct programmed to
  mimic an accomplished fighter's skills. He wields his warhammer two-handed in
  order to maximize his Strength bonus to damage.
Morale: Gorstav fights until destroyed.
