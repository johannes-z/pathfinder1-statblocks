  and a potion of rage. If time permits, he drinks his other potion of rage
  before engaging the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  The barbarians focus their attacks on Thurl's minions, allowing the PCs to
  fight the dwarf directly. Once they lead the PCs away and turn their attacks
  on them, they focus their attacks on other melee combatants. The shadow demons
  ride within their hosts and direct them to fight recklessly with no care for
  the hosts' bodies.

  Arastrax casts' deeper darkness to protect himself from direct sunlight.
