SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dream Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A primordial demon has no physical form and only exists in the
      subconscious realm of dreams. Because it exists only as thought and
      concept, it can neither leave this realm nor exist in any other plane,
      realm, or reality. Any creature slain by a primordial demon does not die
      in the material plane. Instead, the individual falls unconscious and is
      forced from the dream realm (see above).
  - name: Psychic Implosion (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a primordial demon can constrict his tendrils to
      psychically rend the mind of a grappled victim. The attack deals 8d6
      points of psychic damage, though the victim may attempt a DC 21 Will save
      for half damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The primordial demon begins combat by using its weird ability on all of the
  PCs. Starting on the second round, it attacks a single target each round with
  its tendrils, grappling when possible and then using its psychic implosion
  ability until that target is "killed" and ejected from the dream
  realm&#8211;it then selects another target, likely the one dealing the most
  damage to it, and hits that target and so on.
Morale: The primordial demon fights to the death.
