DuringCombat: >-
  Militia members try to flank at any opportunity and attack using their saps.
  If attacked for lethal damage, they switch to their short swords. If three or
  more are attacking the same target, one attempts to demoralize the opponent
  instead of attacking.
Morale: >-
  These are not the bravest of Oppara's guards; they flee if reduced to 5 hit
  points or below.
