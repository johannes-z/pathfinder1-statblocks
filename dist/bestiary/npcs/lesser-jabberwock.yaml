SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burble (Su)
    description: >-
      A lesser jabberwock can burble once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action.
      This blast of strange noises and shouted nonsense in the various languages
      known to the jabberwock (and invariably some languages it doesn't know)
      affects all creatures within a 60-foot-radius spread-these creatures must
      make a DC 28 Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. Alternatively,
      the lesser jabberwock can focus its burble attack to create a 60-foot-line
      of sonic energy that inflicts 20d6 points of sonic damage (DC 28 Reflex
      save for half). The confusion effect is mind-affecting; both are sonic
      effects. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Damage Reduction (Ex)
    description: >-
      A lesser jabberwock's damage reduction can be bypassed only by weapons
      with the vorpal weapon enhancement.
  - name: Eye Rays (Su)
    description: >-
      The lesser jabberwock can project beams of fire from its eyes as a ranged
      touch attack as a standard action. It projects two beams, and can target
      different creatures with these beams if it wishes as long as both targets
      are within 30 feet of each other. A creature that takes damage from an eye
      beam suffers burn.
  - name: Fear of Vorpal Weaponry (Ex)
    description: >-
      A lesser jabberwock knows that a vorpal weapon can kill it swiftly. As
      soon as it takes damage from a vorpal weapon, a lesser jabberwock becomes
      shaken. If it is hit by a critical threat from a vorpal weapon, whether or
      not the critical hit is confirmed, the jabberwock is staggered for the
      following round.
  - name: Whiffling (Ex)
    description: >-
      A lesser jabberwock's wings and violent motions create a significant
      amount of wind whenever it makes a full attack action. These winds
      surround the monster to a radius of 30 feet, and are treated as severe
      winds-ranged attacks suffer a -4 penalty to hit a lesser jabberwock when
      it is whiffling, and Medium creatures must make a DC 10 Strength check to
      approach the creature. Small or smaller creatures in this area that fail a
      DC 15 Strength check are blown away. See page 439 of the Pathfinder RPG
      Core Rulebook for further details on the effects of severe winds.
DuringCombat: >-
  The lesser jabberwock races into the midst of the PCs on the first round of
  combat to make a vital strike with its bite. On the second round, it burbles
  to confuse the PCs that surround it. On following rounds, it makes full
  attacks-preferably against the PC wielding Briar. If the monster is reduced to
  fewer than 200 hit points, it takes to the air and circles, firing one eye ray
  per round with Vital Strike while it heals back up to at least 300 hit points
  before landing and entering melee again. If denied this level of mobility, the
  monster simply focuses its full attacks on single targets, hoping to take the
  PCs down one at a time. At your discretion, if the monster defeats the wielder
  of Briar, it could scoop up the weapon and take to the air. The gate through
  which Nyrissa sent the creature into the Material Plane is closed, so it must
  return to the First World via the portal at the Castle of Knives-it flies
  toward that site with all due haste, eager to return the hated weapon to its
  mistress.
