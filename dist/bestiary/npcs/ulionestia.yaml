BeforeCombat: >-
  Knowing this operation was set to happen today, Ulionestia put her physical
  enhancement in Constitution (this has already been included in her stats). She
  cast mage armor before the PCs arrived.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ulionestia initiates combat by dropping a glass as a free action to signal her
  allies of her oncoming assault and then casts pyrotechnics on the bar's
  torches to blind the PCs. She follows up with web and grease to hamper their
  movement while they pursue Shoalo as he attempts to escape with the Society's
  artifact. If she needs to make an escape, she casts shatter on the aquarium
  and dives into the harbor through the hole in the floor of the broken tank.
Morale: >-
  Ulionestia fights until Shoalo makes his escape or until she is reduced to
  fewer than 8 hit points. She flees through the shattered aquarium into the
  harbor if possible; otherwise, she leaves by whatever means she can.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure light wounds, scroll of spider climb, wand of magic missile (25
  charges)
OtherGear: >-
  dagger, cloak of resistance +1, aquamarine amulet worth 50 gp, spell component
