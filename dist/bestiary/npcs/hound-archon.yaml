    description: >-
      A hound archon can assume any canine form of Small to Large size, as if
      using beast shape II. While in canine form, the hound archon loses its
      bite, slam, and greatsword attacks, but gains the bite attack of the form
      it chooses. For the purposes of this ability, canines include any dog-like
      or wolflike creature of the animal type.
