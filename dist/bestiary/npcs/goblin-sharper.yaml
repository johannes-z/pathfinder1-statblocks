DuringCombat: >-
  Although the goblins carry bows, they quickly switch to lobbing alchemist's
  fire at PCs who fall in the pit. The goblins throw their nets at PCs at the
  edge of the pit or balancing on a ledge to entangle them, then try to knock
  them into the pit.
Morale: >-
  The goblins flee if more than one PC makes it across the pit or if more than
  half their number are slain.
