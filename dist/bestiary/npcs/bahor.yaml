Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Bahor casts mage armor as soon as the prospect of combat looms (such as upon
  hearing a palace alarm activated). He uses his third eye to check the various
  rooms in his palace for intruders. As soon as his foes seem to be drawing
  near, he casts shield and protection from good.
DuringCombat: >-
  Bahor favors spellcasting in combat, and reverts to his true form only if his
  enemies know that he isn't human. If his spells are exhausted or proving
  useless, he uses a charge from his wand of haste, then resorts to melee
  tactics. He prefers to fight with allies so he can perform sneak attacks. In
  such a situation, Bahor tries to remain mobile, moving in and out of combat by
  using Spring Attack to make a single bleeding sneak attack against a foe each
  round. On his own, he tries to make full attacks so he can add a bite and a
  claw to his kukri strikes, using Arcane Strike to gain a +1 bonus on all
  damage rolls.
Morale: >-
  Bahor has little interest in risking everything on bad luck. If reduced to
  fewer than 100 hit points, he  attempts to flee with the aid of invisibility.
  If he escapes, he retreats to the Cerulean Society guildhall below Old Korvosa
  to wait things out, and may end up seeking revenge on the PCs at a later
  date-especially if the PCs interact with the Cerulean Society. Bahor stays
  behind to fight to the death only if his enemies show that they know of his
  true nature; allowing anyone to escape his clutches with this knowledge is the
  thing he fears the most.
