BeforeCombat: >-
  The thugs use Bluff to attempt to feint as they draw weapons to catch targets
  flat-footed.
DuringCombat: >-
  The thugs use hit-and-run tactics, moving throughout the lodge and trying to
  confuse and delay pursuers. They throw furniture about to create obstacles and
  barricades (treat as difficult terrain).
Morale: >-
  The thugs fight until one of them is slain or all drop below 2 hit points, at
  which point they throw down their weapons in surrender. Pleading for mercy,
  they admit to thievery and offer their spoils in exchange for their lives
  (area F5). If asked about the lodge or its former occupants, the thugs quickly
  explain that they found their slain corpses when they arrived, and swear they
  aren't murderers. As proof, they offer to let the PCs inspect the corpses and
  reveal that they stuffed the bodies into barrels on the cold porch (area G8).
