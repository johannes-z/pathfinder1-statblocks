  - name: Sudden Charge (Ex)
    description: >-
      When making a charge attack, an axe beak makes a single bite attack. If
      successful, it may also attempt to trip its opponent as a free action
      without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the axe
      beak is not tripped in return.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jikon follows Kwankhonu's lead, setting him up for ride-by attacks. Later,
  when he closes to melee, she makes bite attacks at his target.
Morale: >-
  If Kwankhonu is killed before Jikon, she flies into a frenzy and exclusively
  attacks the opponent who killed him until she dies.
