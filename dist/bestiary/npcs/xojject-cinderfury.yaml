SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Size (Sp)
    description: >-
      Twice per day, an efreeti can magically change a creature's size. This
      works just like an enlarge person or reduce person spell (the efreeti
      chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the
      efreeti. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
  - name: Heat (Ex)
    description: >-
      An efreeti's body deals 1d6 points of fire damage whenever it hits in
      melee, or in each round it grapples.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Earlier in the day, Xojject cast mage armor on himself, which is included in
  his statblock.
DuringCombat: >-
  As a swift action, Xojject casts quickened scorching ray to blast the PCs from
  afar. After, Xojject uses his dimensional slide arcanist exploit to position
  himself next to a PC, allowing him to use Vital Strike to obliterate his
  target.
Morale: >-
  Unwilling to be known as a coward, Xojject viciously fights to the death in
  the hopes of taking one or more of the Pathfinders with him.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure serious wounds, potion of bull's  strength, potion of
  protection from cold
OtherGear: >-
  +1 battleaxe, aegis of recoveryUE, cloak of resistance +1, ring of protection
  +2, spellbook
