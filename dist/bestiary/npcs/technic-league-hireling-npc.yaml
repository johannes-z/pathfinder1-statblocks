      This electronic lockpick allows the user to attempt Disable Device checks
      against electronic devices and grants its user a +1 competence bonus on
      the check. Thieves' tools do not apply to Disable Device checks against
      electronic devices. An e-pick has 10 charges; using the e-pick as part of
      a Disable Device check consumes one charge. An e-pick weighs 1 pound and
      is worth 100 gp.
  - name: Implanted Tracker Chip (Ex)
    description: >-
      This chip allows its carrier to be tracked remotely with a chipfinder (see
      Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide). Finding evidence of it
      requires a full-round search of the carrier and a successful DC 30
      Perception check. Extracting the chip requires a slashing weapon and deals
      1 point of damage to the carrier.
