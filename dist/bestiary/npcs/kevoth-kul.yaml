  - name: Addicted (Ex)
    description: >-
      Kevoth-Kul has been an addict of the strange Numerian fluids provided to
      him by the Technic League for many years. The Black Sovereign's long
      addiction to these fluids has resulted in a tolerance to their effects,
      but he's constantly in a state of mild delirium and takes a -5 penalty on
      Perception checks and Sense Motive checks, as well as a &#8211;2 penalty
      on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. Curing his addiction is a
      difficult task because of the length of time he's spent addicted to the
      fluids. His current addiction is severe, with a save DC of 40 due to his
      continued exposure to the drugs. Remove disease can cure his addiction
      with a successful DC 40 caster level check. Heal automatically cures his
      addiction. If cured of his addiction, the Black Sovereign loses the
      penalties detailed above, along with the current side effects he's
      under&#8211;he doesn't lose his bonuses to Strength, Dexterity, or
      Constitution or his immortality, though, as these are permanent effects
      (see Side Effects, below). If cured of his addiction, the Black Sovereign
      may become a potent ally of the PCs against the Technic League&#8211; or
      he might immediately attack them&#8211;see Campaign Role below to
      determine his reaction to being cured.
  - name: Side Effects (Ex)
    description: >-
      Over time, the Black Sovereign's exposure to Numerian fluids has resulted
      in a permanent +2 increase to his Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution
      scores. Perhaps more impressively, the fluids have granted him
      immortality: Kevoth-Kul takes no penalties from aging effects and won't
      die from old age. Each time the PCs encounter the Black Sovereign, roll
      randomly on the Numerian Fluids table on page 29 of Pathfinder Campaign
      Setting: Numeria, Land of Fallen Stars to determine what additional effect
      the man is experiencing at that particular time, re-rolling results of 01
      or 100. If you aren't using that book, instead roll d%. On a result of
      01&#8211;75, Kevoth-Kul is sickened; on a result of 76&#8211;100, he gains
      fast healing 5.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: Kevoth-Kul ingests a dose of Numerian fluids before combat (see Addicted).
DuringCombat: >-
  Kevoth-Kul uses his magical throwing axe to fight at range, but vastly prefers
  to fight in melee with his greatsword&#8211;a devastating weapon that grows
  more powerful when he rages. He uses Vital Strike on rounds when he must close
  with a target, but when he makes a full attack, he uses Power Attack to gain a
  +12 bonus on damage at the cost of a &#8211;4 penalty on attack rolls. His
  first attack in a round is always a sunder attempt, as he knows that a foe
  deprived of a weapon is easier to defeat.
Morale: >-
  While raging, Kevoth-Kul fights to the death. The Black Sovereign is a proud
  and arrogant man, but he has also grown tired of his role as puppet leader of
  Starfall. If he is captured alive (or reduced to 15 or fewer hit points while
  not raging), he throws down his weapons and demands in an uncharacteristically
  weary voice for his victors to finish him off. He is not interested in
  becoming a prisoner of yet another group, and if he gets the impression that
  the PCs want to keep him alive, he'll attack again, hoping to earn a final
  death in combat. If cured of his addiction to Numerian   fluids, though, his
  reaction is much different&#8211;see the Campaign Role section on the next
  page for more details.
