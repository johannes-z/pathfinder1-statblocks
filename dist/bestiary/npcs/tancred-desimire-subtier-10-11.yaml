SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Energumen (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Tancred can open his soul to a demonic spirit as a free
      action. The spirit possesses him for 3 rounds, granting a +4 profane bonus
      to an ability score of his choice. In addition, he gains electricity
      resistance 10 and a +4 bonus on all saving throws against poison. When
      this possession effect ends, Tancred becomes confused for a number of
      rounds equal to his demoniac level. At the start of each round of
      confusion, Tancred can attempt a DC 25 Will save to end the effect
      immediately. Energumen is negated by protection from evil or protection
      from chaos. Tancred (or the PCs) can prevent or end the confusion side
      effect by having one of these spells cast upon him when (or before) this
      ability ends, but being affected by such a spell before this ability has
      run its course also causes the benefits to end prematurely. Killer's
  - name: Finesse (Sp)
    description: >-
      Tancred's demonic boon from Shax allows him to cast invisibility twice per
      day as a spell-like ability.
  - name: Life in Blood (Su)
    description: >-
      Tancred treats bleed effects as fast healing. For example, if he suffers
      an effect that causes bleed 5, he does not take any damage from the effect
      and instead gains fast healing 5. This effect ends when he is fully
      healed.
  - name: Summon Demon (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Tancred can use summon monster VI once per day to conjure
      one succubus, 1d3 babaus, or 1d4+1 brimoraks to serve him.
Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: transmutation, enchantment
BeforeCombat: >-
  This morning, Tancred cast extended mage armor and performed his obedience to
  Shax. Before the PCs ascend the stairs to area C3, he drinks a potion of
  bear's endurance, a potion of cat's grace, and a potion of bull's strength. If
  he has the time he also uses a scroll of greater magic weapon on his cane.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Tancred casts haste, including any of his allies
  in range. He then casts black tentacles on the ground floor, followed by
  summon monster VI to summon 1d3+1 babaus or a shadow demon. If a PC can deal
  bleed damage, Tancred tries to draw their attacks to gain healing from his
  Life in Blood boon. If threatened, he uses his scroll of displacement and then
  he uses his energumen special ability to boost his Constitution score.
Morale: If reduced below 18 hit points, Tancred flees using teleport.
