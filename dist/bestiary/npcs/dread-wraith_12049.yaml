SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      A humanoid slain by a dread wraith becomes a wraith in 1d4 rounds. These
      spawn are less powerful than typical wraiths, and suffer a -2 penalty on
      all d20 rolls and checks, receive -2 hp per HD, and only drain 1d2 points
      of Constitution on a touch. Spawn are under the command of the dread
      wraith that created them until its death, at which point they lose their
      spawn penalties and become free-willed wraiths. They do not possess any of
      the abilities they had in life.
  - name: Constitution Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures hit by a dread wraith's touch attack must succeed on a DC 25
      Fortitude save or take 1d8 points of Constitution drain. On each
      successful attack, the wraith gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Lifesense (Su)
    description: >-
      A wraith notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if
      it possessed the blindsight ability.
  - name: Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)
    description: A wraith caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered.
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of a wraith, unless a
      master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check.
