    description: >-
      Any creature that is slain by a grue becomes a full strength, free-willed
      grue itself in only 1d4 days. They do not possess any of the abilities
      they had in life.
  - name: Darkness (Ex)
    description: >-
      Grues are constantly surrounded by an aura of pitch black darkness. This
      darkness is not magical, but innate to the grue itself, thus it cannot be
      dispelled or negated by any means. Because of its aura of darkness, a grue
      always has total concealment (50% miss chance).
  - name: Feast (Ex)
    description: >-
      A grue heals 1 hp for each hp it deals with its bite attack. These are not
      temporary hit points, and the grue cannot exceed its normal maximum hp.
      Vulnerable to Light Grues have the light blindness weakness, and must
      succeed on a DC 20 Will save or be panicked for 1d4 rounds if a source of
      bright light is adjacent to them.
