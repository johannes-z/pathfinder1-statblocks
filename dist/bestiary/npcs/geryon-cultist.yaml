    description: >-
      The cultists' infernal patron, Geryon, has blessed them with thick, scaly

BeforeCombat: >-
  The cultists cast bull's strength and shield of faith on themselves before
  entering combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The cultists open combat by each attempting to cast silence on PCs, starting
  with obvious spellcasters. They then move in to attack in melee, using
  Stunning Fist on their first attack each round and making disarm attempts on
  their second attack each round if facing foes who wield weapons. When a
  cultist is reduced to 25 or fewer hit points, he retreats from battle to cast
  healing magic on himself before returning to the fight.
