  - name: Bladed Defense (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature that strikes Kor-Ahn-Tuk with a non-reach melee weapon, an
      unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d6+5 points of slashing damage
      from the thicket of outward facing blades set within the gorgon's armored
      scales.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kor-Ahn-Tuk takes great pleasure in smashing its petrified victims. It uses
  its breath weapon as often as possible, and as long as any petrified victims
  are nearby, the mummified gorgon focuses its violence on them, attacking and
  trampling statues until they're destroyed. Only if it's waiting for its breath
  weapon to recharge and there are no statues to crush does the Rubble Maker
  attack living foes.
Morale: Kor-Ahn-Tuk fights until destroyed.
