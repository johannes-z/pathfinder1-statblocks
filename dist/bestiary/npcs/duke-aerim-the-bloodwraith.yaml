SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Constitution Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      Creatures hit by the Bloodwraith's touch must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude
      save or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain. On each successful attack,
      the Bloodwraith gains 5 temporary hit points. These hit points are lost
      after 1 hour. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Create Devouring Mist (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the Bloodwraith can
      cough up a devouring mist. He can do this up to three times per day, but
      must wait one minute before he can produce another.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoid slain by the Bloodwraith rises as a sword wight in 1d4+1
      rounds. Spawn are under the command of the Bloodwraith and remain enslaved
      until his destruction. They do not possess any of the abilities they had
      in life.
  - name: Lifesense (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Bloodwraith notices and locates living creatures within 60 ft., just
      as if he possessed the blindsight ability.
  - name: Malevolence (Su)
    description: >-
      The Bloodwraith has a limited ability to seize control of the bodies of a
      creature on the Material Plane, similar to a ghost. He can only use this
      ability on creatures possessing, carrying, or wielding his remains or any
      of the gear found with them. This ability is similar to magic jar (CL
      12th), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability,
      the Bloodwraith must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the
      attack with a successful DC 22 Will save. A creature that successfully
      saves is immune to the Bloodwraith's malevolence ability for 24 hours. Any
      bonuses to saves the target possesses derived from the Bloodwraith's
      equipment are ignored when making this Will save.
  - name: Object Teleportation (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, the Bloodwraith can teleport himself, as with the
      greater teleport spell (CL 20th), but he can only teleport to a location
      adjacent to his remains or an item looted from his remains that has not
      been cleansed of his taint. He can use this ability while possessing
      another creature with malevolence, but doing so instantly ends the
      malevolence effect.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      Even if his incorporeal form is destroyed, the Bloodwraith is not
      permanently destroyed, and reforms in 2d4 days. To be permanently
      destroyed his remains must be properly interred and all his magical gear
      cleansed of his evil taint; see sidebar for further details.
  - name: Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)
    description: If caught in sunlight, the Bloodwraith cannot attack and is staggered.
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Ex)
    description: >-
      Animals do not willingly approach within 30 ft. of the Bloodwraith, unless
      a master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check.
