SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animate Rocks (Su)
    description: >-
      A stone maiden can animate rocks within 180 feet at will, controlling up
      to two rocks at a time. These animated rocks are posted as guardians in
      area J1.
  - name: Earth Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone maiden gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both she and
      her foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne,
      the stone maiden takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls.
  - name: Immunity to Earth Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone maiden is immune to all spells and spell-like abilities with the
      earth descriptor, including spells of the Earth domain. She is also immune
      to the supernatural abilities of creatures that possess the Earth subtype.
  - name: Stone Glide (Su)
    description: >-
      This functions as the earth elemental's earth glide ability, except the
      stone maiden can move through stone, dirt, crystal, and metal.
  - name: One with the Earth (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone maiden is so closely tied with the earth that any damage she takes
      from the natural attacks of a creature with the Earth subtype or a
      creature made primarily from stone or earth (such as a stone golem or clay
      golem) is treated as nonlethal damage.
  - name: Veil (Su)
    description: >-
      Each stone maiden is mystically bound to her veil and never lets it out of
      her possession. If she is ever more than 1,000 feet from it, she takes a
      &#8211;4 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, and dies within
      4d6 hours, crumbling to dust. If her veil is destroyed (hardness 3, hp
      10), she dies in 1 minute. A stone maiden's veil does not radiate magic.
