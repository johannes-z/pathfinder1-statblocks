SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cold (Su)
    description: >-
      A yeti's body generates intense cold, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage to
      any creature that contacts it with a natural attack or an unarmed strike,
      or whenever it hits a foe with its claws.
  - name: Frightful Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures within 30 feet that meet Shang Xu's gaze must succeed at a DC 13
      Will save or stand paralyzed in fear for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting
      fear paralysis effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be
      affected again by Shang Xu's frightful gaze for 1 day. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Shang Xu uses his frightful gaze attack to paralyze as many foes as possible
  at the beginning of the battle, then enters a rage and charges the nearest
  foe. Shang Xu uses any available items as weapons in areas F5 and F6, or
  simply attacks with his claws and spear if no improvised weapons are at hand.
Morale: >-
  Unless he has the obvious advantage, Shang Xu attempts to flee combat once he
  can no longer sustain his rage or if he falls below 10 hit points. He then
  attempts to hide until he recovers from any fatigue, before trying to ambush
  his foes again. Otherwise, Shang Xu fights to the death.
