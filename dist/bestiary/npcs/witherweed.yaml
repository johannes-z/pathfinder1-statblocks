    description: >-
      A witherweed looks like normal grass and weeds when at rest; it takes a DC
      20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in
      Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of
      Perception to notice the plant. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice the
      subterranean version.
  - name: Death Smoke (Ex)
    description: >-
      A witherweed that takes at least 1 point of damage from a fire effect
      releases a cloud of deadly smoke that billows forth and quickly fills a
      20-foot radius surrounding it. Creatures within the area must succeed on a
      DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage. One minute
      later, another Fortitude save (same DC) must be made to avoid another 2d6
      points of Constitution damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based. The
      cloud remains for 1 round per HD of the witherweed but a strong wind (21+
      mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round.
