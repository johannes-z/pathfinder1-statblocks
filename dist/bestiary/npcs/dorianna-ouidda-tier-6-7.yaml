BeforeCombat: >-
  Ouidda cast glibness before giving her speech to the People's Council, and the
  effects are still active. She casts eagle's splendor as she flees to her
  quarters (the effects of which are included in her stats). When she hears
  someone approaching the door, she casts greater invisibility and drinks her
  potion of haste.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ouidda initiates combat by casting dominate person on the most heavily armored
  foe and turning him on his fellow Pathfinders. She follows up with slow,
  confusion, and deep slumber to keep her enemies off balance or out of combat.
  If forced into melee, she uses cause fear, hideous laughter, and hold person
  to eliminate immediate threats.
Morale: >-
  Ouidda is not stupid and knows when she's beaten. She can exact revenge on the
  PCs if she can simply get away, which she attempts to do if reduced to fewer
  than half her total hit points.
Gear: potions of cure moderate wounds (2), potion of haste
