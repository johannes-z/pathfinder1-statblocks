    description: >-
      Mother Grim Moon's meditations on the end times have granted her the
      unique means to substitute her own health and sanity in place of material
      components for her spells. As a full-round action before casting a spell
      with an expensive material component, Mother Grim Moon can open herself to
      the madness of the multiverse to ignore the required material component.
      However, for every 500 gp worth of material components she ignores, she
      has a cumulative 5% chance of developing a debilitating madness or
      physical malady equivalent to the effects of bestow curse; these effects
      are permanent and can be removed only with miracle or wish. Mother Grim
      Moon already suffers from three such afflictions: one reduces her Strength
      by 6, another causes her to grow painful bone spurs that prevent her from
      wearing armor, and the third muddles her senses in combat, giving her a
      25% chance each round of performing no actions. These afflictions reduce
      her effective Challenge Rating by 2. In place of sacrificing her
      well-being, she can instead destroy magic items or valuables whose market
      price is at least twice the cost of the material component. Such items
      crumble into nonmagical ash after Mother Grim Moon finishes casting the
      spell, and only miracle or wish can restore them.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If she expects combat, Mother Grim Moon    overland flight, aura of doom, and
  shield of faith in that order.
DuringCombat: >-
  When fighting alongside other ash giants, Mother Grim Moon uses her spells and
  domain powers to debilitate her foes and let her allies do the fighting. If
  her allies are struggling, she casts righteous might and wades into melee. She
  strongly prefers using Greater Vital Strike or Great Cleave to make one
  powerful attack, loudly praising Groetus's unstoppable might as she does.
Morale: >-
  Once reduced to 80 hit points or fewer, Mother Grim Moon acknowledges her
  foes' power and offers a truce so that all might enjoy the imminent apocalypse
  in peace. If denied, she fights to the death.
