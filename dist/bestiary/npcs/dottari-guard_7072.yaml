  Dottari guards use lethal force in battle, but try to stabilize any fallen
  foes if they have the chance  (mostly because the paperwork for dead rioters
  is more complicated than the paperwork for live arrests). They do not pursue
  rioters who flee.
Morale: A dottari guard fights to the death.
Gear: chain shirt, light steel shield, heavy mace, longbow with 20 arrows, 11 gp
