BeforeCombat: Origa casts invisibility on herself before approaching any potential conflict.
DuringCombat: >-
  Origa attacks from a distance while her ogre hunters engage enemies. She opens
  combat invisibly with a volley of arrows easily mistaken for lightning
  strikes. Origa has developed an uncharacteristic fondness for her ogre scouts,
  and won't use her cone of cold unless she's sure she won't hit one of them.
Morale: >-
  Having no intention of dying for a band of ogres, Origa retreats to the main
  camp for reinforcements if her scouts fall. She leaves the valley entirely if
  all her minions are slain and she is reduced below 30 hit points.
Gear: potion of displacement
OtherGear: >-
  +1 mithral chain shirt, +1 shock composite longbow (+5 Str) with 30 arrows,
  mwk greatsword, belt of incredible dexterity +2
