SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Distracting Babble (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, Ellot can mutter in a manner other creatures find
      distracting. All creatures within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 18 Will
      save or take a -2 penalty to AC for 1 round. Creatures that successfully
      save cannot be affected by Ellot's distracting babble for 24 hours. This
      is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The festering spirit attempts to trample as many of the PCs as possible. If a
  PC is particularly effective against the festering spirit, it ceases its
  trampling and instead focuses on that PC with its incorporeal touch attacks.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, the festering spirit retreats back
  into the ceiling to sulk and moan about how badly the PCs hurt it.
