BeforeCombat: >-
  Jethzerai casts mage armor before returning to area B2 and activating the
  portals with his trigger device.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jethzerai stays airborne with his jetpack, casting ranged spells. He favors
  targets that appear to be tinkering with his portals, and he saves toppling
  magic missile for spellcasters or anyone standing in a dangerous location
  (such as near flowing lava). Against fire-resistant foes, Jethzerai uses his
  zero pistol. He draws his spear and fights in melee if he runs out of spells.
Morale: >-
  If the gate to the Plane of Fire is open and Jethzerai is brought to fewer
  than 30 hit points, he flees through the gate, using his jetpack's secondary
  ability to gain a fly speed  of 90 feet (clumsy). If the gate isn't open,
  Jethzerai refuses to abandon his precious portals; he fights to the death.
