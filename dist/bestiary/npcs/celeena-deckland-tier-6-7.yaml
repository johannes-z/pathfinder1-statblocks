BeforeCombat: >-
  When the PCs attack or talk to the mercenaries in area A5, Celeena is alerted
  to their presence. At this point she uses her scroll of mage armor and her
  scroll of shield, casts eagle's splendor on herself, and hides behind the
  northwest shelf. Once she thinks the PCs have either allied with her
  mercenaries or killed them, she casts summon monster IV and summons a hell
  hound, directing it to stand in the square just north of the door and attack
  the first PC who enters.
DuringCombat: >-
  Celeena casts black tentacles and glitterdust first, hitting the PCs fighting
  the hell hound. She then uses her wand of magic missile, casts scorching ray
  and acid arrow for ranged attacks, and casts suggestion, color spray, and
  burning hands once the PCs get closer. If the hell hound falls and she has
  time, she summons another to block the PCs from reaching her.
Morale: >-
  Celeena is obsessed but not stupid&#8211;if reduce to five hit points or
  fewer, she surrenders.
