  blinking operates continuously.
DuringCombat: >-
  The barbarian begins combat with Dazzling Display and terrifying howl. Against
  a small group, he makes Flyby Attacks, using Lunge and potions of enlarge
  person to extend his reach and avoid attacks of opportunity, and Great Cleave
  against targets clustered together. In close combat, he uses intimidating
  glare along with Great Cleave attacks, using knockback to force enemies into
  close quarters. He relies on his ring of blinking to avoid most attacks, and
  with his tireless rage he exits and re-enters rage whenever it's convenient to
  regain the use rage powers he can use only once per rage.
