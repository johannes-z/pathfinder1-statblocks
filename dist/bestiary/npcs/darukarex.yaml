SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Binding Contract (Su)
    description: >-
      Darukarex is surrounded by a gentle whirlwind of parchments. At
      Darukarex's will, these parchments fuse together into a long whip, which
      he can use to attack, disarm, and trip foes. The binding contract
      functions as +1 whip, except that unlike a normal whip, it always deals
      lethal damage and doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity when used.
      Darukarex adds his Wisdom modifier instead of his Strength modifier to
      attack and damage rolls with his binding contract. When the binding
      contract hits its mark, it wraps around the target, providing Darukarex
      with a free grapple attempt. If he succeeds at the grapple attempt, the
      restrained creature is considered grappled, though Darukarex is not.
      Additionally, Darukarex takes only a -10 penalty on his CMB check to
      maintain the grapple in subsequent rounds, instead of the normal &#8211;20
      penalty. If Darukarex is disarmed, he can produce a new binding contract
      as an immediate action.
  - name: Impale (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, Darukarex can impale an opponent grappled by his
      binding contract, dealing 2d8+6 points of piercing damage.
  - name: Infernal Contract (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, Darukarex can produce an infernal contract for a
      single living mortal creature. This contract can grant a wide range of
      abilities and effects. To receive any of these bonuses, however, the
      mortal must sign its true name upon the document of its own free will.
      Upon doing so, that mortal's soul is sworn to the contract devil,
      condemning the soul to an eternity of servitude in Hell. Only a miracle or
      wish can restore such a damned creature to life, and if anyone casts a
      spell for that purpose, Darukarex automatically gains the benefits of a
      discern location spell with the caster as the target. Breaking a contract
      with Darukarex is difficult and dangerous (see page 29 for more on such
      contracts).
  - name: Infernal Investment (Su)
    description: >-
      Darukarex can use greater scrying at will upon any creature that has
      signed one of his infernal contracts. The target creature always fails its
      save against the devil's scrying attempt&#8211;this ability otherwise
      functions at caster level 20th.
