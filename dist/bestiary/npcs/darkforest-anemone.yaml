    description: >-
      When at rest, a darkforest anemone looks like a bed of kelp or seaweed. As
      a result, a DC 20 Perception check is required to notice it before it
      attacks for the first time. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge
      (nature) can use either of those skills instead of Perception to notice
      the anemone.
