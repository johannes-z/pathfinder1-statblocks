  If directing her chariot, Helskarg prefers to  try to overrun her foes
  (Ultimate Combat 177), periodically taking shots with her autograpnel. If one
  of her ogres is slain or she takes more than 60 points of damage (30 points if
  her foes are using fire or acid), Helskarg abandons her chariot and moves in
  to attack with her bite and claws, hoping to finish the fight swiftly. If the
  PCs confront her without the chariot, she prefers to fight from her stage
  (area Q2) with her autograpnel, reeling in one foe to attack in melee and
  forcing the others to scramble if they want to confront her. If reduced to 30
  or fewer hit points, she retreats to area Q3 to call her pet ogres into the
  fight.
Morale: Helskarg fights to the death.
