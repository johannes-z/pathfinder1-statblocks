BeforeCombat: >-
  Chanukrah casts mage armor, fly (from her wand), and bull's strength on
  herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Chanukrah casts invisibility on the first round of combat. She then casts
  summon monster III each round, switching to summon monster II once she's out
  of the more powerful spell, hoping to overwhelm the PCs with conjured
  monsters. She prefers summoning dretches and multiple giant fiendish spiders
  with summon monster III and lemures and multiple dire rats with summon monster
  II. She uses her ranged spells and wands against foes who seem to be able to
  see her or otherwise counter her invisibility, resorting to melee only as a
  last resort, using arcane strike with each attack to deal an additional +2
  points of damage with her guisarme.
Morale: Chanukrah fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  wand of acid arrow (11 charges), wand of fly (9 charges) wand of lightning
  bolt (6 charges)
OtherGear: +1 guisarme, silver crown worth 800 gp
