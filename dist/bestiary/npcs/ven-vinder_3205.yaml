DuringCombat: >-
  Ven always uses Power Attack when pummeling foes. Although he's enraged to
  find his beloved daughter in the arms of a "thug," he won't continue beating
  on a foe once his target is unconscious&#8211;but neither will Ven attempt to
  stanch a beaten foe's bleeding.
Morale: >-
  Ven is enraged, but if reduced below 5 hit points, he drops to his knees and
  begs for mercy. Of course, if granted mercy, Ven's anger remains, and he'll
  nurse a grudge against the PC once he's had a chance to recover and foster
  fresh anger
