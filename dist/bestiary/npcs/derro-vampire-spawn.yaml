DuringCombat: >-
  Each round, one of the four derro vampires attempts to hook a drunkard and
  start the process of unraveling his chains, as detailed on page 13. The other
  three derros focus their attacks on other PCs, ganging up as they can to flank
  foes. A PC in the process of pulling a dangling drunkard to safety is
  considered to be flat-footed against a derro's sneak attack.
Morale: >-
  The derro vampires fight until destroyed. If destroyed, a derro vampire
  reverts to gaseous form and retreats to its coffin in area A9.
