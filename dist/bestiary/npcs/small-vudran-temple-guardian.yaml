SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A caryatid column is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. A transmute rock to mud
      spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to a caryatid column,
      with no saving throw. Transmute mud to rock, on the other hand, heals any
      lost hit points. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the
      column's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic
      for 1 full round.
  - name: Shatter Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a character strikes a caryatid column with a weapon (magical or
      nonmagical), the weapon takes 2d6 points of damage. Apply the weapon's
      hardness normally. Weapons that take any amount of damage in excess of
      their hardness gain the broken quality.
  - name: Statue (Ex)
    description: >-
      A caryatid column can stand perfectly still, emulating a statue (usually
      one that is holding up the ceiling, like a carved column). An observer
      must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to notice the caryatid column is
      alive.
