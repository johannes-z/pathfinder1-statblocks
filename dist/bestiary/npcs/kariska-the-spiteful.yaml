SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Despair (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures within a 30-foot radius that see a mummy must succeed at a
      DC 18 Will save or be paralyzed by fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the
      save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same
      mummy's despair ability for 24 hours. This is a paralysis and
      mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Mummy Rot (Su)
    description: >-
      Curse and disease-slam; save Fort DC 18; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha; cure &#8211;. Mummy rot is both a curse and a
      disease and can only be cured if the curse is first removed, at which
      point the disease can be magically removed. Even after the curse element
      of mummy rot is lifted, a creature suffering from it cannot recover
      naturally over time. Anyone casing a conjuration (healing) spell on the
      afflicted creature must succeed at a DC 20 caster level check or the spell
      is wasted and the healing has no effect. Anyone who dies from mummy rot
      turns to dust and cannot be raised without resurrection or greater magic.
      The save DC is Charisma base.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite&#8211;Injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
      1d2 Str; cure 2 saves.
Gender: Female
