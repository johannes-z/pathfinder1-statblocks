  Strike)
Source: Master of the Fallen Fortress
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Challenge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, you can challenge a foe to combat. As a swift action, you
      choose one target within sight to challenge. Your melee attacks deal +1
      extra damage whenever the attacks are made against the target of your
      challenge. You can use this ability once per day. Challenging a foe
      requires much of your concentration. After issuing a challenge you take a
      -2 penalty to your Armor Class, except against attacks made by the target
      of your challenge. The challenge remains in effect until the target is
      dead or unconscious or until the combat ends. Your challenge also includes
      another effect, which is listed in the Order of the Cockatrice section.
  - name: Mount (Ex)
    description: >-
      You gain the service of a loyal and trusty steed to carry you into battle.
      This mount functions as a druid's animal companion, using your cavalier
      level as your effective druid level. You do not take an armor check
      penalty on Ride checks while riding your mount. The mount is always
      considered combat trained and begins play with Light Armor Proficiency as
      a bonus feat. Your mount does not gain the share spells special ability of
      an animal companion. Your bond with your mount is strong, and you have
      learned to anticipate each other's moods and moves. Should your mount die,
      you may find another mount to serve you after 1 week of mourning. This new
      mount does not gain the link, evasion, devotion, or improved evasion
      special abilities until the next time you gain a level.
  - name: Order (Ex)
    description: >-
      At 1st level, you must pledge yourself to a specific order. The order
      grants you a number of bonuses, class skills, and special abilities. In
      addition, each order includes a number of edicts that you must follow. If
      you violate any of these edicts, you lose all benefits gained from your
      order for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM
      interpretation.
  - name: Tactician (Ex)
    description: >-
      At 1st level, you receive a teamwork feat as a bonus feat (you have the
      Precise Strike feat, see below). As a standard action, you can grant this
      feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear you. Allies retain
      the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds. You can use this ability once per
      day.
