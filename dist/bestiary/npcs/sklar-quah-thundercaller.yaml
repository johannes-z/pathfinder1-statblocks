SpecialAbilities: []
BeforeCombat: >-
  A thundercaller puts on his war paint and uses his wand of cat's grace once a
  fight seems likely.
DuringCombat: >-
  One thundercaller activates his inspiring rage while the others engage in
  melee. The first thundercaller supports the melee fighters with healing magic
  or casts ranged spells; when a thundercaller in melee is reduced to 30 or
  fewer hit points, that skald falls back and swaps position and roles with the
  previous thundercaller.
Morale: >-
  As long as Krojun lives, the thundercallers fight to the death. If Krojun dies
  or is otherwise incapacitated, the thundercallers abandon the acropolis
  immediately-in this case, they speak ill of the PCs.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds (2), wand of cat's grace (15 charges), wand of
  cure light wounds (30 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 hide armor, +1 totem spear, totem spears (3), Shoanti war paint (silver, 2;
  see page 436), 35 gp
