SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Absorb (Ex)
    description: >-
      To use this ability, the proto-shoggoth must begin its turn grappling a
      creature or must trample. The proto-shoggoth may attempt to absorb as many
      creatures as it grapples or tramples in a round. This ability otherwise
      functions as swallow whole, save that a creature that cuts its way out of
      a proto-shoggoth leaves no hole in the protoplasmic creature's body.
      All-Around
  - name: Vision (Ex)
    description: A proto-shoggoth sees in all directions at once. It cannot be flanked.
  - name: Maddening Cacophony (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a protoshoggoth can give voice to sounds and words sane
      life was not meant to hear. All creatures in a 60-foot radius must make a
      DC 22 Will save or be confused for 1d6 rounds. Each round a creature is
      affected, it takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. A creature that saves
      cannot be affected by the same proto-shoggoth's maddening cacophony for 24
      hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The proto-shoggoth attacks any creatures that approach the aqueduct,
  attempting to drag them over the edge to absorb or constrict them underwater
  while they drown. If wounded, it quickly climbs out of the aqueduct and uses
  its maddening cacophony before trampling and absorbing any remaining
  opponents.
Morale: >-
  The proto-shoggoth pursues potential meals throughout the slums and as far as
  the ramps leading to area A3&#8211;even collapsing some of the slab hovels at
  area A1, if necessary, in an attempt to trap prey before it can escape. The
  proto-shoggoth flees back into the water if reduced to 60 hit points or fewer.
