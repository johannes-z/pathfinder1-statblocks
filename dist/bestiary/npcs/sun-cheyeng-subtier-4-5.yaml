DuringCombat: >-
  Cheyeng activates his bardic performance to inspire courage on the first
  round, reciting jingoistic prose to spur his allies into combat. In subsequent
  rounds, he uses spells such as hideous laughter and sleep to disable PCs. He
  uses his light crossbow to attack foes from afar, and if drawn into melee, he
  moves to flank with the border guards, maintaining his bardic performance
  while attacking with his longsword. If reduced to 12 hit points or fewer, he
  applies the bonus from Combat Expertise to his AC.
Morale: >-
  Cheyeng attempts to flee once all his guards are slain or he is reduced to 8
  hit points or fewer. Failing that, he surrenders and begs the PCs to spare his
  life.
