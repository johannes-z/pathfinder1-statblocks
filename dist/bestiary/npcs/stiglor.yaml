  Stiglor casts an audible alarm on his tent every night. Before combat he casts
  barkskin and longstrider on himself.

  attempting to make Two-Weapon Rend attacks on a single opponent. He pauses to
  use his healing magic when necessary, behind the cover of his underlings.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 30 hp, Stiglor retreats to take pot shots with his bow from a
  position of cover. If reduced below 0 hp, he retreats into the forest, not to
  be seen again in this adventure (after all, he'll need to hide not only from
  the PCs, but from the Council's new leaders as well).
