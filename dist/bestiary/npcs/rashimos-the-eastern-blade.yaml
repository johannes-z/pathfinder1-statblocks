    description: >-
      Rashimos received the unholy blessing of the demon lord Ibdurengian,
      transforming her into a half-fiend. Unlike other half-fiends, Rashimos
      received a swim speed instead of flight. She also gains the aquatic
      subtype and the amphibious special quality.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If alerted to threats, Rashimos casts protection from good prior to entering
  combat. She uses her fiendish boon to provide her weapon with the wounding
  weapon special ability along with increasing its enhancement bonus by an
  additional +2.
DuringCombat: >-
  Rashimos engages her foes in melee, using Power Attack and positioning herself
  to make full attacks against opponents. She prefers to attack those displaying
  obvious divine regalia or with obvious martial prowess.
Morale: >-
  With nowhere else to go, and unwilling to accept that the force that
  transformed her into a demon is dead, Rashimos fights until slain.
Gear: >-
  +2 light fortification mithral breastplate, +3 heavy steel shield, Empire's
  Fall (+2 unholy throneglass bastard sword), sparkling blue rhomboid ioun
  stone, iron unholy symbol of Ibdurengian
