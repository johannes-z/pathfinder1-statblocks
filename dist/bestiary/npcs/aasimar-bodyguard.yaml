  - name: s Bounty (Ex)
    description: >-
      As is the case of most of the temple's inhabitants, the constant ingestion
      of heresy's bounty from the corrupted banquet table of the autumn feast
      has resulted in ongoing Wisdom damage to the aasimar guards, reducing
      their Wisdom scores to 7.
DuringCombat: >-
  Unless convinced of Dakang's blasphemy, the bodyguards fight loyally to
  protect the priest and defend his quarters from intrusion.
Morale: As long as they remain faithful to Dakang, the bodyguards do not surrender.
