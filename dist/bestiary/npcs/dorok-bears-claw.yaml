SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ursine Prosthesis (Ex)
    description: >-
      Dorok is able to use his prosthetic "hand" to help him perform two-handed
      tasks. He takes no penalties on skill checks due to his condition unless
      the task requires fine detail or careful manipulation. He is also able to
      wield two-handed weapons with the aid of his prosthesis, albeit with a -2
      penalty on attack rolls.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Dorok's tactics are simple but efficient; he begins to rage as soon as combat
  begins and targets any obvious arcane casters first. While raging, Dorok's
  right hand transforms into a vicious bear-like claw, similar to the claw
  strapped to his left arm. Dorok frequently uses Power Attack as he claws
  enemies apart, relying on his rage powers to overcome magical defenses.
Morale: >-
  With the pride of the Red Winter tribe at stake, Dorok fights to the death
  unless otherwise commanded to stand down by one of the tribe's leaders.
Gear: potions of cure moderate wounds (2)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 hide armor, mwk longspear, javelins (5), amulet of mighty fists +1, cloak
  of resistance +1, ring of protection +1, antitoxin, backpack, bedroll,
  climber's kit, rope, 46 gp
