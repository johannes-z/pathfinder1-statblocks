BeforeCombat: >-
  Vavana casts mage armor, shield, cat's grace, false life, and unseen servant
  and uses a charge from her wand of bear's endurance before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vavana uses her +3 defending dagger to bolster her Armor Class but remains
  within 5 feet of the false Ileosa at all times. She casts displacement on the
  first round of combat, followed by mirror image. She uses a scroll of mind fog
  on the third round. On the fourth round, she uses her offensive spells against
  the PCs, using dominate person on non-spellcasters (ordering them to leave the
  combat and await further instructions to serve, later, as her personal
  assistants) or feeblemind on spellcasters. She's fond of using suggestion and
  charms to compel victims to discard their gear or remove armor-discarded items
  are carried away by her unseen servant. She saves the use of her wands for
  tormenting prisoners or training new Gray Maidens, and is loath to use them in
  combat.
Morale: >-
  Vavana retreats to area A56 via dimension door if the false Ileosa is slain,
  or if she herself is reduced to fewer than 20 hit points. From there, she
  gathers her spellbooks before attempting to flee the castle and seek shelter
  with the Arkonas.

  disfiguring touchUM (15 charges), wand of magic missile (CL 9th, 20 charges),
