DuringCombat: >-
  If threatened, or if a PC attempts to open the throne room portal, the
  axiomites shift to their crystalline dust forms as a free action and cast mage
  armor on the first round of combat. On the next round, two of them revert to
  solid form to flank the PC who tried to open the door and attack with their
  swords while the third stays in dust form and uses spell-like abilities. An
  axiomite that is brought below 100 hit points reverts to dust form to enjoy
  the protective effects of incorporeality, replaced in combat by the third, who
  assumes solid form while the wounded one regenerates and casts spells.
Morale: >-
  The axiomites fight to the death and pursue foes throughout the palace, but do
  not pursue enemies out of the palace.
