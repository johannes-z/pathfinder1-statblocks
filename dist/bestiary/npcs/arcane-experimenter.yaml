BeforeCombat: >-
  The barbarian uses her wand of shield before most battles, but also uses her
  wand of mirror image if she expects a difficult fight or a battle against a
  strong lone enemy.
DuringCombat: >-
  The barbarian closes quickly to make full attacks with her hooked hammer,
  using the thundering pick end as her primary weapon and the hammer as her
  off-hand attack. If she has to charge or otherwise move between attacks, she
  makes a single two-handed Power Attack with the pick end. She uses moment of
  clarity to trigger a wand or scroll if the situation demands, such as in an
  encounter with a flying or invisible foe. She prefers to reserve her boots of
  speed for when she is already in melee, to facilitate full attacks or to close
  the distance on faster enemies.

  scroll of protection from good, scroll of true strike, wand of fly (10
