SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Damaged Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      Aubrin can see relatively clearly for 10 feet, but she takes a -2 penalty
      on Perception checks and attack rolls against targets within 10 feet due
      to her damaged vision. From 10 feet to 30 feet, her vision is severely
      clouded. She takes a -5 penalty on all Perception checks beyond 10 feet,
      and all targets at that range have concealment from her. Past 30 ft., all
      targets have total concealment from Aubrin.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Aubrin uses her strength surge or touch of good on an ally just before the
  ally rushes into combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Aubrin can assist in combat, but has trouble targeting threats and is hesitant
  to close to melee. She prefers to support others, using her domain abilities
  and spells such as bull's strength. She channels positive energy and dispenses
  potions to help, but would rather reserve her spells to boost other people's
  abilities rather than cast curative spells; an ounce of prevention, to her, is
  worth far more than a meager healing spell.
Morale: >-
  Though older and wiser, Aubrin remains impulsive and will fight to the death
  to protect others.
Gear: >-
  oil of magic weapon (2), potion of cure light wounds (5), scroll of cure
  moderate wounds, scroll of delay poison (2), scroll of protection from evil,
  antitoxin (2), healer's kit, holy water (2)
