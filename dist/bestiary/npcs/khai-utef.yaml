SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Knockdown (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a gypsosphinx who's raking a foe hits that foe with its additional
      claw attacks, it can attempt a combat maneuver check to trip the foe as a
      free action. The gypsosphinx gains a +4 bonus on this check if both
      additional claw attacks hit.
  - name: Mystic Sight (Su)
    description: >-
      A gypsosphinx sees death coming and can often foretell the manner of a
      person's death. A gypsosphinx frequently uses this power to threaten
      creatures, but it can also use the ability to grant warnings to some. To
      use either version of this ability, the gypsosphinx must concentrate on
      the targeted creature for 1 round, after which it speaks a short, usually
      cryptic phrase that alludes to a likely future death for the creature in
      question. The threat or warning must be issued verbally to the target
      within 1 round of this concentration period, and the target must be within
      30 feet for the effects to occur. A creature can negate the effects
      granted by the threat or warning (see below) with a successful DC 25 Will
      save. When a gypsosphinx issues a threat or warning, you should frame it
      in vague terms but be explicit enough that the proclamation can be
      interpreted as a specific and possible deadly event-use what you know is
      coming in the creature's future, based on yet-to-occur events in the
      campaign, to narrow in on possible deaths that may exist. A gypsosphinx is
      fond of issuing veiled (or outright blatant) threats to creatures who know
      it possesses mystic sight, even when the sphinx hasn't actually used the
      power to foretell a possible future death&#8211;in these cases, you need
      not link the threat or warning to likely future events and can make up
      whatever you wish, since neither has actual supernatural weight behind the
      words. Issuing a trick or warning is a language-dependent curse effect.
      The save DC is Wisdom-based. Threat: If a gypsosphinx issues a threat, an
      affected target becomes convinced that death awaits in that form; the next
      time the victim is confronted with something that could be interpreted as
      being the predicted deadly threat, it becomes staggered with fear as long
      as the threat persists. If the victim survives this threat alive, it may
      attempt a new DC 25 Will save to end the effect; otherwise, the threat
      persists until the next time such an event comes to pass. A threat is a
      fear effect. Warning: If a gypsosphinx issues a warning, an affected
      target mentally prepares to face death in that form; the next time the
      victim is confronted with something that could be interpreted as being the
      predicted deadly threat, it gains a +4 morale bonus on all saving throws
      and Constitution checks to stabilize as long as the threat persists. If
      the victim survives the event that triggered the warning, the effect ends
      and the victim does not gain the bonus the next time this type of event
      occurs. A warning is a morale effect.
DuringCombat: >-
  Khai-Utef starts combat by attempting to use slay living on the party's most
  obvious healer. He then moves on to physical attacks, using pounce to move
  quickly from foe to foe and thus maximizing his full attacks while
  simultaneously limiting others' opportunities to do the same. If reduced to
  fewer than 175 hit points, he fights using Combat Expertise.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, Khai-Utef flees the Slave Trenches and
  does not return for months.
