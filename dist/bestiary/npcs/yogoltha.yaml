DuringCombat: >-
  Yog'oltha uses veil to mask its actual appearance, taking the illusory form of
  a serpentfolk wizard before it initiates combat with the PCs via a projected
  image from behind an illusory wall. The aboleth uses dominate monster to try
  to control the most heavily armored PCs, ordering them to attack their allies
  (this use allows a second saving throw to throw off the effects). The aboleth
  then uses other illusions to try to trick the PCs into using valuable
  resources fighting against fantasies. If the PCs see through the ruse, the
  aboleth attacks physically, focusing its wrath on obvious divine spellcasters
  first.
Morale: >-
  If reduced below 40 hit points, Yog'oltha flees into the depths of the central
  lake, using illusions to cover its retreat and, upon finally reaching a hiding
  place, placing an illusory wall to hide behind. It lingers in hiding until it
  is healed, then ventures out to dominate new targets to use them against the
  PCs in an attempt to kill them from afar. If directly confronted and reduced
  to 40 or fewer hit points a second time, it flees again but does not attempt
  further vengeance. In time, Yog'oltha may seek a way to escape Saventh-Yhi and
  return to the sea.
