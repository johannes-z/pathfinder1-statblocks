Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If the PCs engage any other blighted fey on this floor, the handmaidens are
  aware of the intruders thanks to their blighted unity; they cast bear's
  endurance and mage armor but aren't immediately aggressive.
DuringCombat: >-
  The handmaidens trust the intoxicating stench and enticing head-fruit of the
  jinmenju to deal with most trespassers, and reinforce the attraction by
  casting beguiling gift. If the PCs resist these efforts or attack immediately,
  the three use their coven hex to support individuals unleashing mass pain
  strike and enervation. If one member of the coven dies, the remaining two cast
  twilight knife and beast shape II to become tigers, then leap to attack.
Morale: >-
  If two dryads are slain, the remaining one uses tree stride to flee to
  Arlantia's side and warn her of the intruders, eventually fighting by her
  mistress's side when the PCs arrive.
