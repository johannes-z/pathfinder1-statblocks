DuringCombat: >-
  The Malebolgian cerberi attacks the closest foe each round, abandoning this
  tactic only if someone attempts to move through the secret door to the east-
  anyone attempting to go deeper into the dungeon becomes its primary target.
  Tormented from beyond its reach, the cerberi can attempt to break the chain
  with a Strength check each round.
Morale: The cerberi fights to the death.
