BeforeCombat: >-
  Each Grundlescorn casts mage armor before entering combat. If they are
  expecting the PCs, in addition to using their coven spell-like abilities to
  create a mirage arcana and control weather, they cast call lightning storm and
  mind blank.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Grundlescorns begin combat with their coven spell-like abilities, using
  forcecage to capture and isolate PCs, starting with healers and spellcasters.
  If they manage to whittle the PCs down to  one free foe, they then focus their
  attacks on that lone victim. Killing a sister or forcing at least one of them
  more than 10 feet away from the others prevents them from using coven magic.
  Likewise, the hags abandon this tactic if faced with a foe in melee, since the
  full-round casting time makes coven magic a poor choice in such circumstances.
  On the first round of melee combat, or just before they attack, each
  Grundlescorn sister casts mirror image on herself before scattering and using
  her offensive magic. A Grundlescorn sister who can't get away from foes that
  threaten her instead calls down a bolt of lightning with call lightning storm,
  uses a hex to put the threatening foe to sleep, or uses dimension door to
  reach a position of safety from which to continue spellcasting. Melee attacks
  are options of last resort for the Grundlescorns.
Morale: >-
  As soon as one Grundlescorn sister is slain, the surviving hags fly into a
  frenzy and focus all of their attacks on the person who killed their sister.
  If a second witch is killed, the surviving Grundlescorn sister flees,
  preferably via dimension door. Whether or not she returns to vex the PCs in
  the future is left up to you.
