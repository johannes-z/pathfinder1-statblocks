SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Agonized Wail (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Jezeletrix can unleash a terrifying shriek. This
      affects all creatures with fewer than 8 Hit Dice within a 120-foot burst.
      Affected creatures must make a DC 16 Will save or become shaken until they
      move more than 120 feet away from Jezeletrix. Those who successfully save
      are immune to this attack for 1 minute. This is a mind-affecting fear
      effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Baleful Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature within 60 feet who meets Jezeletrix's gaze must succeed on a
      DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Strength drain, 1d4 points of
      Constitution drain, and 1d4 points of Charisma drain. Whatever the result
      of the saving throw, a creature cannot be affected by the same broken
      soul's baleful gaze more than once per minute. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Bardic Knowledge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Jezeletrix gains a +4 bonus on all Knowledge checks, and can make
      Knowledge checks untrained.
  - name: Lay on Hands (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Jezeletrix can heal 4d6 points of damage by touch (a
      standard action, unless she targets herself, in which case it's a swift
      action). This ability otherwise functions like the paladin's lay on hands
      ability.
  - name: Torturous Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Jezeletrix can attempt this touch attack. The
      creature touched must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 2d6 points
      of slashing damage and 1d6 points of Dexterity damage. In addition, the
      touched creature collapses to the ground in pain, falling prone and
      writhing on the ground, helpless, for 1d4 rounds. All of these effects are
      negated with a successful save. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Tormented (Ex)
    description: >-
      Jezeletrix takes a -10 penalty on concentration checks due to her wracking
      pain. Her wracking pains have also removed her vulpinal calm emotions
      aura.
BeforeCombat: If she hears intruders approaching her den, Jezeletrix becomes invisible.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jezeletrix lost all of her gear, and without something to use flame arrow on,
  she opens combat with holy smite, followed by charm monster, in an attempt to
  neutralize the most heavily armored PC. She saves her agonized wail to use
  whenever she's surrounded, and in melee abandons her spells to focus on using
  her torturous touch.
Morale: Jezeletrix fights to the death.
