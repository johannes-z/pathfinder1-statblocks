DuringCombat: >-
  Jaagrath is perhaps a bit overconfident in his fighting prowess, but that
  certainly doesn't mean he's a pushover. He rages on the first round of combat,
  then focuses his attacks on humans, saving other races for "clean up."
Morale: >-
  If Jaagrath is brought below 25 hit points, he attempts to flee to area B30 to
  recruit aid, drinking both of his potions as soon as he gets a chance. Once at
  area B30, Jaagrath fights to the death.
Gear: potions of cure serious wounds (2)
