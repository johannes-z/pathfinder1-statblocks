DuringCombat: >-
  Maukui casts cat's grace and mage armor near the start of combat&#8211;if it
  can, it does so before a fight begins. The effects of these two spells is
  included in the statistics here. Once combat begins, the intellect devourer
  casts mirror image, then prefers to use spiked pit, hold person, and web to
  scatter its enemies and limit their mobility. Given the   chance, it uses body
  theft on a target that has been held. Remember that in intellect devourer
  form, Maukui cannot cast spells unless it augments them with Silent Spell.
Morale: >-
  Maukui attempts to flee if reduced to fewer than 30 hit points. If it does so,
  it abandons the Dominion entirely and is unlikely to attempt to confront the
  PCs again. If prevented from fleeing, it fights to the death.
