BeforeCombat: >-
  The simulacrum casts shield, false life, and fly on himself if he suspects a
  confrontation.
DuringCombat: >-
  Like the true Whispering Tyrant, the simulacrum prefers to open up combat with
  a show of force, rising into the air and unleashing a finger of death at
  whoever seems to be the party's leader and following it with a quickened magic
  missile. He follows with area effects such as waves of fatigue and cone of
  cold before focusing on specific opponents with spells like disintegrate,
  empowered enervation, and empowered scorching ray.
