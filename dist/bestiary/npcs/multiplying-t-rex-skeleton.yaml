    description: >-
      When a multiplying skeleton is reduced to 0 hit points, its bones reform
      1d4 rounds later into two smaller multiplying skeletons with half the Hit
      Dice of the original. Each resulting multiplying skeleton continues to
      reform into smaller and smaller sizes. A multiplying tyrannosaurus
      skeleton reforms into two Large skeletons with 9 HD each, each of which
      then reforms into two Small skeletons with 4 HD each. When these four
      Small skeletons are killed, the skeleton no longer multiplies and is
      finally destroyed.
