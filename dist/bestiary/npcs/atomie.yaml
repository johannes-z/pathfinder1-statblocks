DuringCombat: >-
  The atomie becomes invisible and flies into the air at the first sign of
  trouble, asking the wolfhound to intercept intruders. The atomie uses reduce
  person on lightly-armored PCs, then darts invisibly into combat wielding its
  rapier.
Morale: >-
  The atomie sees combat as a game. When reduced to 4 hit points or fewer, she
  gracefully surrenders, calls her wolfhound to stand down, and begs leave to
  depart. The atomie is genuinely shocked if the PCs do not accept her
  surrender.
