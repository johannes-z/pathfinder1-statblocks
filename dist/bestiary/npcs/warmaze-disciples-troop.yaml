SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Javelin Barrage (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a move action, a Warmaze Disciples troop can hurl a barrage of
      javelins. This attack takes the form of up to four lines with a range of
      100 feet. These lines can start from the corner of any square in the
      troop's space. All creatures in one of these lines take 4d6 points of
      piercing damage (Reflex DC 19 half). The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Natural Cunning (Ex)
    description: A Warmaze Disciples troop can never be caught flat-footed.
  - name: Powerful Charge (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a Warmaze Disciples troop can move in a straight
      line up to its speed. If the troop moved at least 10 feet and did not
      cross any difficult terrain, its troop damage increases to 8d6+8 until the
      end of the round.
  - name: Rage (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a free action, a Warmaze Disciples troop can whip itself
      into a frenzy, increasing all damage it deals by 1d6, gaining a +2 bonus
      on Fortitude and Will saving throws, and gaining 32 temporary hit points.
      While raging, the troop takes a -2 penalty to AC and can't use any ability
      that requires patience or concentration, or any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or
      Intelligence-based skills other than Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and
      Ride. These effects last for 16 rounds or until the troop dismisses them.
