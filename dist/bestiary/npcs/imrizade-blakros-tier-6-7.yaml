SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fungoid Umbilicals (Ex)
    description: >-
      Five 20-foot-long fungoid umbilicals connect Imrizade to the Gate of
      Beyond (and to the mind of Kubburum Ishme-dagan), attached to her hips,
      shoulders, and the base of her skull, cumulatively providing her with fast
      healing 5. The umbilicals may be individually attacked using the sunder
      combat maneuver. Each umbilical has hardness 5 and 10 hit points. Each
      severed umbilical inflicts 1d6 points of damage to Imrizade, and reduces
      her fast healing by 1. Severing all five umbilicals disconnects Imrizade
      from the Gate but she remains possessed by Kubburum.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: aberrant
BeforeCombat: >-
  Imrizade casts shield and spectral hand (losing 2 hit points) as soon as she
  hears the alarm from area 8.
DuringCombat: >-
  Imrizade begins by casting black tentacles from her scroll, then directs her
  zombies to engage grappled opponents. She stays behind the zombies and
  delivers touch spells with her spectral hand. She uses ghoul touch against
  other spellcasters and against foes who come within range of the yellow musk
  creeper's attacks, and targets obvious warriors (especially wearing metal
  armor) with shocking grasp and ray of enfeeblement from her wand. If it looks
  like enemies might get past her zombies, Imrizade creates more undead from her
  robe of bones. If forced into melee, she uses her long limbs to deliver
  unarmed strikes with touch spells from beyond her opponents' reach, making
  sneak attacks if possible. Imrizade uses vampiric touch to replenish her hit
  points as needed.
Morale: >-
  Possessed by the ghostly brain of Kubburum Ishmedagan, Imrizade fights to the
  death. If Kubburum's cylinder is destroyed, however, Imrizade is freed from
  possession and surrenders.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds, scroll of black tentacles, wand of ray of
  enfeeblement
OtherGear: >-
  +1 mithral shirt, masterwork rapier, hand crossbow and 10 bolts, cloak of
  resistance +1, headband of alluring charisma +2, robe of bones, backpack,
  masterwork thieves' tools, signet ring (200 gp), pouch with 120 gp, papyrus
