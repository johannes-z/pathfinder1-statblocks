SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Swarming (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ratfolk are used to living and fighting communally, and are adept at
      swarming foes for their own gain and their foes' detriment. Up to two
      ratfolk can share the same square at the same time. If two ratfolk in the
      same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that
      foe as if they were in two opposite squares.
BeforeCombat: >-
  If the pagoda guards hear the PCs' approach, they drink their potions of
  bull's strength.
DuringCombat: >-
  As quickly as possible, one guard fires a screaming bolt to alert her
  compatriots within the pagoda. The guards otherwise keep their distance
  initially in order to use their special bolts and alchemical items.
Morale: >-
  When reduced to 10 or fewer hit points, the pagoda guards flee and seek our
  reinforcements.
