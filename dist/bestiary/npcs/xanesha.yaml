SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      If the PCs recover Xanesha's skull from area A11 and either destroy it or
      sanctify it by casting consecrate or hallow in the skull's vicinity,
      Xanesha is put to rest permanently. Simply removing the skull from the
      Gecko frees her to go where she wishes, in which case she returns to
      haunting the Shadow Clock.
  - name: Tolling Tumult (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever Xanesha moves at least 30 feet in a round, once she ceases her
      movement for that round, a 30-foot-spread area around her fills with the
      deafening sound of immense bells tolling. Each living creature in this
      area must succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw or become staggered by the
      overwhelming sound for the following round. The sound of the tolling
      tumult does not extend beyond this 30-foot reach at all. This is a
      mind-affecting sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Wrathful Wail (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, Xanesha can unleash a wail of
      anguished wrath. All creatures in a 30-foot burst must succeed at a DC 25
      Will save or become consumed with rage. An affected creature can take no
      action on its turn other than to physically attack an adjacent target with
      a melee weapon (or an unarmed strike, if no melee weapon is available). If
      there are no adjacent targets, the enraged creature must charge the
      nearest available target. This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds. This is a
      sonic, mind-affecting, emotion effect; the save DC is Charisma-based.

  approaching.

  Xanesha casts invisibility and mirror image as soon as she notices the PCs
  approaching.   Xanesha starts combat by flying toward the PCs, charging if
  necessary, to trigger her tolling tumult to affect as many PCs as possible. If
  she can,  she attacks with her corrupting touch at the end of that movement,
  or otherwise uses her wrathful wail if there are no adjacent targets. She
  continues to make melee attacks until she is reduced to fewer than 100 hit
  points, at which point she retreats into the wall of the Gecko for cover,
  casts inflict wounds spells on herself to heal, and then emerges at range to
  use her spells against foes. She's particularly fond of casting deep slumber
  on climbing characters. She continues to use her wrathful wail as often as
  possible, enjoying the sight of foes fighting each other, and stays mobile to
  trigger her tolling tumult each round she can while she continues to cast
  spells.
Morale: Xanesha fights until destroyed.
