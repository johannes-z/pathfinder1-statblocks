SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Shadow Blending (Su)
    description: >-
      Attacks against a fetchling in dim light have a 50% miss chance instead of
      the normal 20% miss chance. This ability does not grant total concealment;
      it just increases the miss chance.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Mazzel Gol hears the sounds of combat in the next room, she immediately
  drinks her mutagen and her bear's endurance potion, employing one of her daily
  uses of her extend potion discovery (already included in her stats). If time
  further permits, she drinks her extracts of spider climb and invisibility, and
  readies her haste extract.
DuringCombat: >-
  Mazzel Gol initiates combat by throwing an acid bomb into the largest group of
  PCs she can target. She fights recklessly with her claws and bite, climbing up
  the walls if she's cornered or facing an opponent she can neither hit nor
  effectively damage, and then resorting to bombs from range.
Morale: >-
  If reduced below 25 hit points, the fetchling flees up the wall and drinks her
  false life extract, then resumes combat. While under the effect of her
  extract, Mazzel Gol is maniacal and fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  potion of bear's endurance, potion of cure moderate wounds, alchemical grease*
  (2), weapon blanch (adamantine)*
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork studded leather, masterwork dagger, cloak of resistance +1, ring of
  protection +1, alchemist's lab, 238 gp
