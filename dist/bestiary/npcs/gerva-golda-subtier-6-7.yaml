BeforeCombat: >-
  Gerva cast mage armor on herself during the initial attack, and it remains
  active. In addition, if she hears combat (such as the PCs fighting the
  gearsmen in area B1), Gerva consumes her potion of bear's endurance.
DuringCombat: >-
  If intruders ignore her warning, Gerva hurls her bang grenade to hopefully
  scare them off, then she opens fire with her laser pistol. Once the pistol's 4
  charges are depleted, she switches to her shortbow, reserving her shock arrows
  for any mechanical creatures or particularly difficult foes. Gerva uses the
  pod to her advantage, gaining improved cover when it comes to sniping enemies.
Morale: Once combat begins, Gerva fights until slain or subdued.
