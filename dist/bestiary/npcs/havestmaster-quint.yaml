BeforeCombat: >-
  Prior to confronting the PCs, Harvestmaster Quint casts lesser restoration to
  remove his altitude fatigue, bear's endurance, aid, and divine favor (all of
  which are included in his stats.)
DuringCombat: >-
  The Harvestmaster directs his ghoul thralls to attack PCs while he casts
  ranged attack spells. If approached in melee, he uses his destructive smite
  and channel smite abilities to deal the most damage to his attacker. If he
  finds himself getting hit often, he sacrifices a round of attacking to cast
  shield of faith. The Harvestmaster alternates channeling to heal his undead
  minions and harm the PCs if his other methods of attack prove ineffective.
Morale: The last of his cult in Taldor, Harvestmaster Quint fights to the death.
