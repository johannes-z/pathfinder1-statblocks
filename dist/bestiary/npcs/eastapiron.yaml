  Eastapiron delights in tripping foes and skewering them with attacks of
  opportunity. If the tomb giants with him are both defeated, or if his fossil
  golem armor is reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, he uses a swift action to
  order the golem to remove itself and fight independently.
Morale: Eastapiron fights to the death.
Gear: >-
