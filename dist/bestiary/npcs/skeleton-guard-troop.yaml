    description: >-
      A skeleton guard troop can fire a volley of arrows as a standard action.
      This attack takes the form of up to two lines with a range of 100 feet.
      These lines can start from the corner of any square in the troop's space.
      Each creature in any of these lines takes 3d6 points of piercing damage
      (Reflex DC 18 half). The save DC is Dexterity-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The skeleton guard troop shoots volleys at creatures approaching the
  barricades. As soon as a creature reaches the barricade, or when otherwise
  commanded by Warden Ossua, the skeleton guard troop rushes from behind cover
  to swarm over its foes.
Morale: The skeleton guard troop fights until it is destroyed.
