    description: >-
      Whenever a character strikes a caryatid column with a weapon (magical or
      nonmagical), the weapon takes 3d6 points of damage. Apply the weapon's
      hardness normally. Weapons that take any amount of damage in excess of
      their hardness gain the broken quality.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The caryatid columns act as mundane statues until any PC attempts to scale the
  citadel, at which time they lurch to life and attack the nearest intruder.
DuringCombat: >-
  The caryatid columns attempt to prevent the PCs from accessing the citadel's
  stairs.
Morale: The constructs mindlessly fight until destroyed.
