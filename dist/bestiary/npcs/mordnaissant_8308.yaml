SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Lifesense (Su)
    description: >-
      A mordnaissant notices and locates living creatures within 60 ft., just as
      if it possessed the blindsight ability.
  - name: Death Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      As a final cruel jest to the individual that puts a mordnaissant out of
      its misery, the slayer must make a DC 20 Will save or suffer from a
      terrible curse that reduces all subsequent experience points awarded by
      50%. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Lash of Fury (Su)
    description: >-
      The mordnaissant can lash out with its negative energy powers and directly
      attack the vitality of living creatures, in the form of a twisting stream
      of black energy. The mordnaissant must make a ranged touch attack against
      its target as an attack action. If the ray hits, the victim must make a DC
      22 Fortitude save for half damage or duration, depending on the specific
      effect chosen by the mordnaissant. The save DC is Charisma-based. The lash
      of fury has a range of 30 ft. with no range increment. The mordnaissant
      can pick from three possible lashes; it must make its choice prior to
      rolling the attack. The three options are: whip the flesh (as inflict
      moderate wounds, 2d8+9 damage), whip the mind (1d4 points of Intelligence
      damage), or whip the soul (stun 1d4+1 rounds). A critical hit doubles the
      damage rolled or the duration, in the case of whip the soul.
  - name: Pain Wail (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, the mordnaissant can produce a terrible wailing sound
      that reflects the pain it experiences every moment of its existence. All
      living creatures within 20 ft. must make a DC 20 Will save or be dazed for
      one round. For every 20 points of damage the mordnaissant takes, the save
      DC increases by +1.
  - name: Shield of Agony (Su)
    description: >-
      A mordnaissant harnesses the pain of its existence to shield it. It adds
      its Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to its AC and CMD.
