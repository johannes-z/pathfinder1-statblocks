SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Continuous Barrage (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a beatific one hits with the last attack of its flurry of blows, it may
      make an additional attack at a -2 penalty. If this attack hits, the
      beatific one may continue to make additional attacks, with a cumulative
      &#8211;2 penalty for each subsequent attack (&#8211;4 for the second
      attack, &#8211;6 for the third, and so on). If any attack misses, the
      barrage ends.
  - name: Flurry of Blows (Ex)
    description: >-
      A beatific one can make a flurry of blows as per the monk ability. It may
      use this ability whenever it has at least two of its six hands free or is
      equipped with a special monk weapon. Monk Qualities A beatific one
      emulates many of the strengths of the monk character class. On top of its
      racial abilities, a beatific one receives the AC bonus, bonus feats, speed
      bonus, unarmed damage, and weapon proficiencies of a monk whose level is
      equal to its Hit Dice, along with the flurry of blows, improved evasion,
      and still mind abilities. All these benefits are included in the
      statistics above.

  aware of interlopers (not included in her statistics).
DuringCombat: >-
  Sulukta holds her opponents in disdain. She trips and disarms foes, then
  batters them with unarmed strikes. She enjoys disarming foes and using their
  own weapons against them.
Morale: Sworn to protect the shrine, Sulukta fights to the death.
