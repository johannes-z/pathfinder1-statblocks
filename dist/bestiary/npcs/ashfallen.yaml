SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dexterity Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      The otherworldly teeth and tongues of a denizen of Leng deal 1d6 points of
      Dexterity drain with a bite. Constructs, elementals, and other creatures
      that do not possess flesh are immune to this effect. A successful DC 19
      Fortitude save reduces the Dex drain to 1 point. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Planar Fast Healing (Su)
    description: >-
      A denizen of Leng maintains a connection to Leng at all times, and when
      away from Leng, it has fast healing 5. It loses this ability on Leng or i
      n areas where planar connections do not function. If killed, a denizen's
      body dissolves into nothingness. Ashfallen maintains his connection as
      long as he wears the warden ring.
  - name: Unusual Anatomy (Ex)
    description: >-
      A denizen's internal anatomy varies from individual to individual, and has
      a 50% chance to treat any critical hit or sneak attack against it as a
      normal hit.
