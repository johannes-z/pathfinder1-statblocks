SpecialAbilities:
  - name: s Favored (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Master of Heresy is one of the favored minions of the archdevil
      Geryon, and he has been granted potent boons as a reward. These boons
      include the advanced creature template, a +5 increase to natural armor
      over that granted by the advanced creature template, and ability scores
      generated with a 20-point buy. In addition, the Master of Heresy has
      resources equal to that of a 13th-level PC. Together, these benefits
      increase his final CR to 15.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  The Master of Heresy casts false life, mage armor, and shield on himself
  before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Master of Heresy casts greater invisibility at the start of combat. If at
  a later point he realizes foes can see invisible creatures, he casts
  displacement on himself as soon as possible. The Master prefers to let his
  allies fight in combat, but keeps his +3 defending spear in hand, allocating
  its entire +3 enhancement bonus to his Armor Class. Remaining at range, the
  Master uses magic for battlefield control, casting wall of force or black
  tentacles to prevent enemies from fleeing or from providing support to each
  other. He generally waits a few rounds to start hitting foes with his
  offensive spells, so that he has a chance to observe the enemy in combat and
  thus make educated decisions about what sorts of attacks might work the best
  against specific targets. Once foes engage him in melee, he casts silence on
  himself to disrupt enemy spellcasting and communications, then continues using
  his offensive spells against foes. The Master views making attacks with his
  spear as a waste of his potential as a psychic.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, the Master of Heresy's contingency
  activates and sends him via dimension door to area D8, where he recruits the
  aid of Lictor Clandegar before returning with these reinforcements to take up
  the fight again in area D9 (he drinks his potions of cure serious wounds along
  the way). Beyond this, the Master of Heresy fights to the death.
Gear: potions of cure serious wounds (4)
OtherGear: >-
  +3 defending spear, belt of mighty constitution +6, cloak of resistance +3,
  headband of vast intelligence +4, ring of protection +1, greater talisman of
  freedomOA, greater talisman of life's breathOA, key to the door in area D1
