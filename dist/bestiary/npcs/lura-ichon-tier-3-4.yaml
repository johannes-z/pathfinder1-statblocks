BeforeCombat: >-
  If Ichon knows the PCs are coming, her spotters in the street outside have
  message cast on them and warn her when the PCs approach. At this point, she
  casts magic fang (twice, once on each hand for both slam attacks), mage armor,
  and resist energy (electricity) on Bellu (these spells are already figured
  into her stat block), and palms her potion of invisibility, drinking it as
  soon as the PCs start to cause trouble.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once the fight begins, Ichon activates her whip feather token, ordering it to
  attack obvious arcane casters, and then consumes her potion of invisibility,
  leaving the bulk of the combat to Bellu. She spends combat casting guidance on
  Bellu and staying close to receive the shield ally bonuses. When her potion
  wears off or opponents otherwise locate her, she targets their weapons with
  grease and groups of PCs with glitterdust, and only fights in melee if there
  is no other option.
Morale: >-
  Born and bred on the mean streets of Bloodcove, Lura Ichon would sooner die
  than publicly show weakness.
Gear: >-
  feather token (whip), potion of cure light wounds, potion of invisibility,
  wand of reduce person (9 charges)
