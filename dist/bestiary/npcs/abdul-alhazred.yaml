SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Contingency (Sp)
    description: >-
      If Alhazred is reduced to 100 or fewer hit points, a heal spell (CL 20th)
      activates on him (Alhazred used a scroll of heal and Use Magic Device to
      set up this contingency ages ago).
  - name: Dreambound (Ex)
    description: >-
      Abdul Alhazred cannot exit the Dreamlands; any effect that would shift him
      to another plane automatically fails.
  - name: Inherent Bonuses (Ex)
    description: >-
      Alhazred has used wish spells to increase his ability scores. He has a +5
      inherent bonus to Charisma, Dexterity, Intelligence, Strength, and Wisdom,
      as well as a +4 inherent bonus to Constitution. Kitab Al-Azif (Su)
      Alhazred carries a copy of the Kitab Al-Azif, the original version of the
      tome that would become known as the Necronomicon. Written in Arabic, this
      book contains a wealth of lore and information beyond the scope of this
      adventure. The Kitab Al-Azif functions as Alhazred's spellbook and
      contains all spells. As long as he carries the book in his hand, it grants
      him a +5 profane bonus to his Armor Class, increases his maximum hit point
      total by 80, and negates the need for material or focus components for
      spells he casts. If Alhazred sets this book down or otherwise loses it,
      the book vanishes, but he can cause it to reappear in his hand as a move
      action. This ability increases his CR by 1.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Ex)
    description: >-
      This incarnation of Abdul Alhazred is as much a physical manifestation of
      the Dreamlands as an individual. If he's slain, he doesn't remain dead for
      long- he is restored to life, as if via true resurrection, 24 hours after
      he is slain, manifesting in some different region of the Dreamlands with
      only his copy of the Kitab Al-Azif and wearing simple robes.
Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: evocation, transmutation
BeforeCombat: >-
  Before combat, Abdul Alhazred casts foresight, greater false life, mage armor,
  mind blank, moment of prescience, nondetection, overland flight, shield, and
  stoneskin.
DuringCombat: >-
  Alhazred has little interest in combat, although he is a dangerous foe if
  meddled with. He prefers to use mind control spells to turn enemies into
  allies, or to conjure allies via gate to fight for him.
Morale: >-
  Having died once already, Alhazred does not fear the mysteries of death, nor
  does he retreat from battle. If he's slain, he seeks out those who murdered
  him to regain his gear and to exact revenge, provided those who slew him
  remain in the Dreamlands.
Gear: >-
  boots of teleportation, pearl of power (4th level), potions of cure serious
  wounds (3), wand of confusion (CL 20th, 18 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +5 defending wounding dagger, amulet of natural armor +5, belt of physical
  might +6 (Dex, Con), cloak of resistance +5, headband of vast intelligence +6,

  the Kitab Al-Azif
