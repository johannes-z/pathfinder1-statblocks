SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Explode (Ex)
    description: >-
      If Hellion's chassis is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes, dealing 8d4
      points of plasma damage (half fire, half electricity) in a 20-foot-radius
      burst (Reflex DC 14 half). The save DC Is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Plasma Beam (Ex)
    description: >-
      Hellion's chassis has a plasma beam integrated into its "tail." An
      advanced version of the typical arachnid robot's plasma torch, this plasma
      beam is an integrated weapon. The robot treats this attack as if it were a
      manufactured weapon, not a natural attack-it can make iterative attacks
      with the plasma beam, and the integrated weapon can be targeted by effects
      that target manufactured weapons (such as magic weapon spells or sunder
      attempts). It cannot be harvested for use outside of the robot's body, and
      does not provoke attacks of opportunity when fired in melee combat. The
      plasma beam deals 2d6 points of damage on a hit (half of which is fire
      damage and half of which is electricity damage), has a range increment of
      50 feet, and is semi-automatic (see page 20 of the Technology Guide).
DuringCombat: >-
  While inhabiting this robot, Hellion prefers to attack with its plasma torch,
  even in melee (because this is an integrated weapon, attacks with it do not
  provoke attacks of opportunity). When the robot makes a full-attack action, it
  can fire its plasma torch and attack with its claws, but if it does so, it
  treats its claw attacks as secondary attacks.
Morale: >-
  Hellion fights until destroyed while inhabiting the robot, unless the central
  processor in area S3 has been destroyed or shut down, in which case it
  attempts to flee Scrapwall if reduced to fewer than 30 hit points. If cornered
  in such conditions, the AI attempts to bargain for its life, offering anything
  it can in trade for mercy, but at the first opportunity, it attempts to escape
  from or slay its captors, either given the opportunity to do so without
  putting itself at obvious risk or after it manages to repair its damage.
