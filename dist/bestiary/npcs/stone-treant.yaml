SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acidic Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      Anyone striking the stone treant with a piercing or slashing attack and
      inflicting damage releases a gout of acidic blood, which causes 5d4 points
      of acid damage to the person who struck it. A DC 20 Reflex save reduces
      this damage by half. The blood becomes inert one round after leaving the
      elemental's body.
  - name: Radial Symmetry (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because of its shape, the stone treant can bring no more than four of its
      slam attacks to bear on any one target. However, it also perceives the
      area around it equally well, and thus it cannot be flanked.
