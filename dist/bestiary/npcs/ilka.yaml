BeforeCombat: >-
  Before a potential combat, Ilka casts longstrider on herself. When she
  believes confrontation is imminent, she shifts to her natural form before
  drinking her potion of bear's endurance and using her wand of magic fang on
  Umber.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ilka spontaneously casts summon nature's ally as often as possible to tip the
  odds in her favor. She casts unshakable chill on Vegazi to weaken her for
  capture, and she casts soften earth and stone to slow the PCs as she tries to
  knock the ranger unconscious. If she successfully subdues Vegazi, Ilka throws
  the half-orc onto Umber and orders the boar to flee back to camp. Ilka uses
  her spells and scrolls as needed to keep the PCs busy or to cover her escape.
Morale: >-
  Ilka's primary goal is to capture Vegazi or a PC, and she flees if that
  doesn't seem like a possibility and her minions are defeated.

  potion of bear's endurance, scrolls of call animal (3), scroll of flame blade,
