SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Topple (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any living creature damaged by a warden jack swarm when its spikes are
      retracted must make a successful DC 12 Reflex save or fall prone. The save
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Tower Access (Sp)
    description: >-
      This specific warden jack swarm can cast open/close as a move action on
      any door within area P. Circumstances that prevent open/close from
      functioning normally also prevent this ability from working. This ability
      is as much a feature of the building as it is the swarm; therefore, it
      does not function on containers or in any other building besides the
      tower.
  - name: Wounding Spikes (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any living creature hit by a warden jack swarm when its spikes are
      extended also takes 1 point of bleed damage.
DuringCombat: >-
  The swarm doesn't use complex tactics, but it does use the terrain to its
  advantage when possible.
Morale: The swarm fights until destroyed.
