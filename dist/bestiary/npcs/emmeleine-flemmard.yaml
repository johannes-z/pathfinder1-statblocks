Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Primarily concerned with her own safety, Flemmard tries to stay out of melee,
  using her longbow as long as she is able, but switches to her longsword when
  necessary, making use of Combat Expertise. The sergeants accompanying Flemmard
  actively cry out for their leader's guidance and help, but the haughty,
  shallow knight ignores their pleas in favor of mid-combat flourishes using
  Dazzling Display and cocky dirty trick and disarm maneuvers that do little
  more than illustrate her lack of wisdom.
Morale: >-
  Flemmard tries her best to lead her troops in battle, but if two or more
  sergeants or war hounds are defeated in battle, the knight inheritor drinks
  her potion of invisibility, grabs her handy haversack from her tent (see
  Treasure below), mounts one of the horses tethered nearby, and flees in
  cowardice, leaving her fellows to fend for themselves.
