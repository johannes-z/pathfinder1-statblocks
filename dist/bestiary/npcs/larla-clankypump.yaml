BeforeCombat: Clankypump casts invisibility if she has time.
DuringCombat: >-
  Clankypump tries to avoid combat. She inspires the dust mephit minions with
  courage, then uses glitterdust, hold person, and hideous laughter to keep the
  PCs disorganized and distracted. She prefers to hold back on physical attacks
  until she's got the bulk of the party blinded or otherwise incapacitated, in
  which case she focuses those attacks on any PCs who still remain able to fight
  back.
Morale: >-
  If she is reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, Clankypump surrenders, begging
  for mercy and promising that she can help the PCs. She knows the PCs need the
  doomsday key to open the door to area A10, and that the key is held by the
  medusa in area A22. She agrees to help the PCs recover the key if they promise
  to let her go once they secure the key, but in fact, she attempts to flee as
  soon as she has a chance to heal herself back to full hit points.
