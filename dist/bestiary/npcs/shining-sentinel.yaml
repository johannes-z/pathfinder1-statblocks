SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shining sentinel is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that
      allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature. A transmute rock to mud spell deals 1d6
      points of damage per caster level to a shining sentinel, with no saving
      throw. Transmute mud to rock, on the other hand, heals any lost hit
      points. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the shining
      sentinel's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to
      magic for 1 full round.
  - name: Light Fortification (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a sneak attack or critical hit is scored against a gold-clad
      creature, there is a 25% chance that the extra damage is negated and
      damage is rolled normally.
  - name: Shatter Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a character strikes a caryatid column with a weapon (magical or
      nonmagical), the weapon takes 3d6 points of damage. Apply the weapon's
      hardness normally. Weapons that take any amount of damage in excess of
      their hardness gain the broken quality.
  - name: Statue (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shining sentinel can stand perfectly still, emulating a statue. An
      observer must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to notice the shining
      sentinel is alive.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The shining sentinels activate their shield spells as soon they detect the PCs
  (already included in their statistics).
DuringCombat: The shining sentinels move to engage any creatures trying to cross the bridge.
Morale: >-
  The shining sentinels fight until destroyed, crumbling into gold-plated rubble
  when reduced to 0 hit points.
