BeforeCombat: >-
  Luculla casts undetectable alignment every morning and drinks a potion of
  bear's endurance before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  If she has allies, Luculla hangs back and uses her ranged spells against foes.
  If she's on her own (or if it looks like she's about to be on her own), the
  changeling attempts to cast summon monster IV to conjure up a fiendish giant
  wasp to protect her. She casts divine favor next, then fights in melee (using
  copycat for extra defense as often as she can). Once reduced to 30 or fewer
  hit points, she casts invisibility and flees to heal her wounds, then returns
  to rejoin the fight. She falls back on using channeled negative energy
  whenever she's surrounded and alone.
Morale: >-
  Luculla attempts to flee combat if reduced to 15 or fewer hit points, using
  invisibility to aid her flight if she hasn't done so already. She abandons the
  Lucky Bones  to begin plotting long-term vengeance against the PCs. If she's
  cornered, she fights to the death, as she would expect no more mercy from her
  enemies than she would grant them.
Gear: >-
  potions of bear's endurance (2), potion of cure light wounds, potion of cure
  moderate wounds, scroll of glyph of warding
