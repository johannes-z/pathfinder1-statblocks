SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burning Flail (Su)
    description: >-
      When Rask wields a flail, the weapon deals +1d6 points of fire damage and
      can be used as a weapon with 15-foot reach. Rask does not threaten the
      area into which he can make an attack, but he can use the weapon against
      foes anywhere within his reach (including adjacent foes). This ability
      replaces the dullahan's normal chilling blade ability.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Rask activates his death's calling ability against the strongest-looking
  warrior, using the victim's name if possible, then makes Spirited Charges and
  Ride-By Attacks while Shenaleure tramples any opponents on the ground. Rask
  uses his burning flail to trip or disarm foes while Shenaleure breathes smoke
  on them.
Morale: Believing himself invincible, Rask fights until destroyed.
Gear: >-
  +2 full plate, +1 flail, amulet of natural armor +1, moribund key (see
  sidebar), ring of protection +1
