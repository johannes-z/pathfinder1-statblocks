SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Madness (Ex)
    description: >-
      Derros use their Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of their Wisdom
      modifier, and are immune to insanity and confusion effects. Only a miracle
      or wish can remove a derro's madness. If this occurs, the derro gains 6
      points of Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma.
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      Derros are not at risk of poisoning themselves when handling poison. They
      use Medium spider venom to poison their crossbow bolts, and generally
      carry 10 prepoisoned bolts at all times.
  - name: Poison (Ex)

  - name: Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex)
    description: >-
      A derro takes 1 point of Con damage after every hour it is exposed to
      sunlight.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  The derro commander prefers to fight from range, and uses her hide in plain
  sight ability. If she becomes overmatched on the platform, she uses her
  darkness at will ability. Once concealed within the darkness, she flees to the
  safety of the room's edge farthest from the bulk of the PCs. Next she uses
  ghost sound to trick the PCs into believing she is still within the sphere of
  darkness. Once more she hides and uses sound burst or her crossbow to attack
  her foes. Otherwise, she isolates her foes and uses sneak attack.
Morale: The derro commander fights to the death.
Gear: leather armor, short sword, repeating light crossbow with 10 poisoned bolts
