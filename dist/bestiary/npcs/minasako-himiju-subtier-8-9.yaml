SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      When a penanggalen slays a female humanoid via blood drain who had at
      least 10 Hit Dice in life, that slain humanoid rises as a manananggal at
      the next sunset. This manananggal is under the command of the penanggalen
      who created it, and remains enslaved until that penanggalen's destruction.
      A penanggalen may have enslaved spawn totalling no more than twice its own
      Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become
      free-willed undead.
  - name: Hexes (Su)
    description: >-
      A penanggalen witch can use one of her hexes at will on any creature
      within 30 feet. Using a hex is a standard action (unless otherwise noted)
      that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. See the Advanced Player's
      Guide for specific hex descriptions.
  - name: Melee (Su)
    description: >-
      A penanggalen's bite and slam attacks count as magical for the purposes of
      overcoming damage reduction.
  - name: Penanggalen Weaknesses (Su)
    description: >-
      In addition to light sensitivity, a penanggalen is staggered while outside
      of her human body and exposed to direct sunlight.
  - name: Separate (Su)
    description: >-
      During the day, a penanggalen has the same appearance as she did in life,
      and does not detect as undead (though she is still an undead creature). At
      night, she can detach her head and entrails as a full-round action. Her
      physical but now hollow body exists as dead flesh, and can be destroyed if
      it suffers damage equal to the penanggalen's normal hit point total.
      Before a penanggalen can return to her body, she must soak her entrails in
      vinegar for 1 hour- she can then reattach to her body, at which point any
      damage done to the body immediately heals (although damage the penanggalen
      herself suffered remains). A penanggalen whose body is destroyed can never
      again walk the day in living form, but is otherwise unharmed (save for no
      longer having a safe way to travel in direct sunlight). When a penanggalen
      wears her body, she cannot use her natural attacks, her fly speed, or any
      of her special penanggalen attacks.
  - name: Wither (Su)
    description: >-
      A penanggalen's entrails drip with a foul bile that blisters and weakens
      living flesh. Any creature that is damaged by a penanggalen's slam attack
      must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or take 1d4 Dexterity and 1d4
      Charisma damage.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If aware the PCs are coming sometime that day, Minasako casts mage armor
  (reflected in her stat block) and spite (with vampiric touch). If she knows
  the PCs are close, she applies the dust of emulation to use her scroll to
  ensure she can use it without a chance of failure. Finally she may instruct
  her familiar, Kiyaga, to float above the door near the ceiling so that he
  might go unnoticed and surprise the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  Minasako targets witches and females as a priority, but not to the exclusion
  of common sense. She uses spells and abilities that lower saving throws and
  ACs (such as bestow curse and evil eye) to bring her blood drain and wither
  abilities to bear. Her retribution hex and unwilling ally spell serve to
  provide healing while hurting enemies.
Morale: >-
  Minasako fights until destroyed to protect her lower half, but if it is
  destroyed she considers flight (out to the balcony) once reduced to 27 hit
  points of fewer.
Gear: scroll of protection from good, dust of emulation*
OtherGear: >-
  amber spindle ioun stone (Pathfinder Player Companion: Seekers of Secrets 48),
  hat of disguise, 12 pp, 5 gp
