DuringCombat: >-
  The dominated soldiers wield their longswords in both hands and fight
  defensively, gaining a +2 dodge bonus to AC and taking a -4 penalty on attack
  rolls. Otherwise, their tactics are straightforward: they always attack the
  nearest or easiest target.
Morale: >-
  When reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, a dominated soldier starts fighting
  more recklessly and no longer fights defensively.
