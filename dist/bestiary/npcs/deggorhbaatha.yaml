BeforeCombat: >-
  If aware of the PCs' approach, Deggorhbaatha casts mage armor, shield, and
  defensive shock.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Deggorhbaatha casts grease on the stairs, hoping
  to slow or halt the PCs' ascent. He uses his damaging spells in combat, but if
  too many PCs draw too close, he activates his thunderstaff bloodline power and
  fights with his trident and natural attacks.
Morale: >-
  Deggorhbaatha has no desire to die before he gets a chance to attack
  Thrushmoor. If reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, he casts invisibility and
  flees to the fort's basement or joins Itsqaal-Thoal in area D16, whichever
  seems the most prudent at the time.
