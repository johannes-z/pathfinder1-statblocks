BeforeCombat: >-
  Rovald begins every day by casting mage armor and false life (both are
  reflected in his stat block). If he is aware of the PCs, he casts shield and,
  if time permits, bless. If he has the opportunity without tipping his hand, he
  casts suggestion or charm person on a PC to gain an ally among his possible
  foes.
DuringCombat: >-
  Rovald casts haste in the first round of combat, then stays out of melee at
  all costs. He prefers hideous laughter as his primary combat spell, but uses
  burning hands, scorching ray, and touch of idiocy when prompted by the
  situation.
Morale: >-
  Rovald is extremely sure of himself, and despite his frailty and weakness,
  believes the PCs to be only a minor threat. He fights to the death, refusing
  to believe the PCs could best one of his social and arcane standing.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds, scroll of disguise self, wand of false life
  (20 charges)

  resistance +1, elixir of truth, ring of protection +1, 40 gp
