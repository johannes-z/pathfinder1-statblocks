SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Corporeal Instability (Su)
    description: >-
      Claw-contact; save Fort DC 17; effect amorphous body and 1 Wisdom drain
      per round (see below); cure corporeal instability can only be cured with
      magic (such as greater restoration, heal, remove curse, restoration, or
      heal). Corporeal instability is a curse effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. A blow from a chaos beast against a living creature
      can cause a terrible transformation. The creature must succeed on a
      Fortitude save or become a spongy, amorphous mass. Unless the victim
      manages to control the effect (see below), its shape melts, flows,
      writhes, and boils. An affected creature is unable to hold or use any
      item. Clothing, armor, rings, and helmets become useless. Large items worn
      or carried&#8211;armor, backpacks, even shirts&#8211;hamper more than
      help, reducing the victim's Dexterity score by 4. Soft or misshapen feet
      and legs reduce speed to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less.
      Searing pain courses along the nerves, so intense that the victim cannot
      act coherently. The victim cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it
      attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (&#8211;4 penalty
      on attack rolls and a 50% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll). A
      victim can temporarily regain its own shape by taking a standard action to
      attempt a DC 15 Will save (this check DC does not vary for a chaos beast
      with different Hit Dice or ability scores). A success reestablishes the
      creature's normal form for 1 minute. Spells that change the victim's shape
      (such as alter self, beast shape, elemental body, and polymorph), do not
      remove the curse, but hold the creature in a stable form (which might not
      be its own form, depending on the spell) and prevent additional Wisdom
      drain for the duration of the spell; shapechange or stoneskin has a
      similar effect. The victim takes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental shock
      every round that it ends its turn in an amorphous shape; the creature
      permanently becomes a chaos beast if this Wisdom drain equals or exceeds
      its actual Wisdom score.
  - name: Immunity to Transformation (Ex)
    description: >-
      No mortal magic can permanently affect or fix a chaos beast's form.
      Effects such as polymorphing or petrification force the creature into a
      new shape, but at the start of its next turn, it immediately returns to
      its mutable form as a free action.
DuringCombat: >-
  The chaos beast attacks one creature until it succumbs to corporeal
  instability, then changes to another target and repeats this process. It
  leaves the area once all its opponents are amorphous.
Morale: The chaos beast tries to flee if brought below 30 hp.
