SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Meld (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action while in area A9 or A10, a foo lion can meld with the
      murals. This behaves as meld with stone except the lion is clearly visible
      and can move up to 30 feet along the walls as a move action.
DuringCombat: >-
  The foo lions use their stony defense liberally and pounce on different
  targets, willingly triggering a glyph of warding if it would catch at least
  one enemy.
Morale: >-
  Myrllial fights to the death. Luccaro fights to the death unless Myrllial is
  defeated, in which case she melds with the paintings once reduced to 25 hit
  points or fewer.
