  - name: Diseased Pustules (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that damages a festrog with a slashing or piercing natural
      weapon, light weapon, or one-handed weapon is sprayed with foul, diseased
      pus from the creature's boils. The target must make a DC 15 Fortitude save
      or be sickened for 1d6 rounds from this effect. Anyone who becomes
      sickened from this effect is also exposed to filth fever (DC 15 Fortitude
      save negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Feed (Su)
    description: >-
      When a festrog inflicts bite damage on a living creature, the festrog
      feeds on the creature's flesh and gains 5 temporary hit points.
