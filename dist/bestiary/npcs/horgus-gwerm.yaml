DuringCombat: >-
  Horgus prefers to avoid combat. If possible, he finds a good place to hide to
  wait out a fight. Despite his cowardice, Horgus enjoys shouting advice to his
  companions from the safety of a defensible location. If forced into combat,
  Horgus demands a rapier&#8211;the weapon with which he's trained the most
  (although more as a way to show off than to actually fight). Without a rapier,
  he's forced to use his fists or whatever weapon he can scavenge.
Morale: Horgus flees or surrenders if reduced to fewer than 12 hit points.
