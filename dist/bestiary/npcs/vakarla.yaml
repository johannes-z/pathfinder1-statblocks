BeforeCombat: >-
  Vakarla casts false life, mage armor, and overland flight every day. When the
  PCs' ship is about to crash into the reef, she casts mirror image and shield
  from her wand.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vakarla casts fog cloud over the PCs' ship, then casts haste on herself and
  her cutthroats just before her crew board the PCs' ship. She uses her flight
  to keep out of melee combat and starts by casting fear on a large group of
  foes, then casts her attack spells against those resisting her crew, using her
  invisibility field to stay invisible. She saves phantasmal killer for use
  against the ship's captain. Vakarla's monkey familiar, Mister Swabb, clings to
  her shoulder flinging droppings and screeching at anyone who attacks her.
Morale: >-
  Vakarla expects a quick and easy victory, so if her cutthroats are slain, or
  if she is reduced to fewer than 25 hit points, she flees combat, flying back
  to her island base (see Development below).

  potion of cure moderate wounds, scroll of invisibility, scroll of knock,
  scroll of wall of force, scroll of water breathing, wand of shield (20
