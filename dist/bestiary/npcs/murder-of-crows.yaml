      eyes. The blindness lasts for 1d4 days or until healed with remove
      blindness. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  These crows are particularly aggressive, and anyone that enters the building
  or the nearby yard will find himself beset upon by four swarms of angry birds.
  Once roused, the murder of crows pursues the PCs until they seek shelter in
  another building. The spriggans have learned to avoid this building.
Morale: The crows fight to the death.
