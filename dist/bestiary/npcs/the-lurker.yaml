  - name: Corpse Spew (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Lurker can vomit a shower of rotting meat and bones in a 20-foot cone.
      Each creature caught in this cone must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save
      or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. A creature caught in this cone must also
      attempt a save against the Lurker's ghoul fever (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary
      146), as if the otyugh had bitten it.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      The Lurker's bite attack exposes creatures to ghoul fever, as if the
      target had been bitten by a ghoul.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Lurker is fairly thoughtless and spoiled. It attacks any intruders, and
  uses its corpse spew ability only if reduced below 20 hit points.
