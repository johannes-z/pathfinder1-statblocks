SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Electrified (Su)
    description: >-
      An ancient war wisp generates a continuous electrical charge. Creatures
      attacking it using natural attacks, unarmed strikes, or melee weapons made
      primarily of metal take 3d6 points of electricity damage. A successful DC
      21 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Lightning Form (Ex)
    description: >-
      Twice per day, a war wisp can transform into lightning as a standard
      action and instantly travel in a straight line to a distance of up to 50
      feet, rematerializing in the new location as a free action. This movement
      does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures in this line take 10d6
      points of electrical damage and are staggered for 1 round (a successful DC
      21 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the staggered condition). The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
