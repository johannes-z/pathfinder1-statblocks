Source: PFS S4-09
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Olaf is aware of the PCs' approach, he casts shield of faith and drinks his
  potion of fly (the former is already included in his stats). If he has more
  time, he also applies his oil of keen edge to his axe.
DuringCombat: >-
  Olaf begins combat by activating his time flicker ability and moving toward
  the PCs. He enters a rage before his first melee attack or as soon as possible
  upon taking damage, applying both Power Attack and his spirit guide's guidance
  spell on his first axe swing. Once raging, Olaf fights recklessly to ensure
  the Pathfinders don't foil his plan, since that would usher in the end of the
  world. Against ranged combatants he uses his moment of clarity rage power and
  casts sound burst, and he uses the remainder of his spell slots to heal
  himself while maintaining his rage.
Morale: >-
  Olaf is insane with delusions of his own importance and the necessity of
  protecting Michellia. He fights to the death to prevent her rescue.
