BeforeCombat: >-
  While in his stone prison, Thurl has cast the following spells on himself:
  barkskin, bear's endurance, eagle's splendor, greater heroism, and stoneskin
  before breaking free. He also cast greater magic fang and evolution  surge,
  adding a +1 to all of Inaz's natural attacks and making him Large.
DuringCombat: >-
  Thurl casts haste on the first round of combat, including all of his allies in
  the effect. He then stays within Inhaz's reach, gaining the benefit of his
  shield ally ability. He first casts summon monster V to summon a fiendish
  wooly rhinocerous, then uses grease, ray of sickening and glitterdust to
  weaken foes. He uses life conduit or resist energy to help Inhaz. If Inhaz is
  killed, Thurl uses his summon monster VI ability to call up a fiendish
  chimera.
Morale: >-
