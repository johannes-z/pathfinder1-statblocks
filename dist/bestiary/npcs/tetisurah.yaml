BeforeCombat: >-
  If she has time to prepare for combat, Tetisurah casts bull's strength and
  magic fang.
DuringCombat: >-
  Under normal circumstances, Tetisurah prefers to use Diplomacy or Intimidation
  to avoid combat. If fighting is unavoidable, however, she targets opponents
  with offensive spells such as burning hands or heat metal before attacking
  with her claws. Despite her ferocity, Tetisurah prefers to leave foes alive.
  She always seeks to achieve surrender, charging an opponent his deepest secret
  as the price for freedom.
Morale: >-
  Tetisurah has no wish to die, and if reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, she
  yields, though always with an eye toward eventual escape or revenge.
