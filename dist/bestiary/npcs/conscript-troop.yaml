DuringCombat: >-
  The conscripts charge forward and attempt to exploit any obvious entrances
  such as broken windows to enter the house. If the PCs have boarded up or
  barricaded the windows, a few conscripts instead charge toward the main door
  and use portable rams to break it down. The others attempt to gain entrance by
  climbing up to the second story windows, firing at the PCs, or attacking
  barricades with their axes.
Morale: >-
  The conscripts fear Shimazi's wrath more than the PCs, and fight to the death.
  If subdued or disabled with nonlethal tactics, the conscripts surrender.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds, alchemist's fire (2)
