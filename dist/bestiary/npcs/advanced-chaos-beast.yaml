    description: >-
      Claw-contact (curse); save Fort DC 23; effect amorphous body and 1 Wisdom
      drain per round (see below); cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution based. A creature cursed with an amorphous body becomes a
      spongy, shapeless mass. Unless the victim manages to control the effect
      (see below), its shape constantly melts, flows, writhes, and boils. An
      affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing, armor,
      helmets, and rings become useless. Large items worn or carried - armor,
      backpacks, even shirts - hamper more than help, reducing the victim's
      Dexterity by 4. Speed is reduced to 10 feet or one-quarter normal,
      whichever is less. The victim gains the amorphous quality, but cannot cast
      spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish
      friend from foe (-4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50% miss chance,
      regardless of the attack roll). A victim can temporarily regain its own
      shape by taking a standard action to attempt a DC 15 Will save. A success
      reestablishes the creature's normal form for 1 minute. Spells that change
      the victim's shape (such as alter self, beast shape, elemental body, and
      polymorph) do not remove the curse, but hold the creature in a stable form
      (which might not be its own form, depending on the spell) and prevent
      additional Wisdom drain for the duration of the spell; shapechange and
      stoneskin have a similar effect. The victim takes 1 point of Wisdom drain
      from mental shock every round that it ends its turn in an amorphous shape
      - upon being drained to 1 Wisdom, further Wisdom drain ceases and the
      amorphous body effect is permanent until removed via magic (no further
      number of saving throws can cure the condition at this time). Due to the
      magic permeating the Bloodways, a victim reduced to a Wisdom score of 1
      from this ability has a 10% chance of actually transforming into a chaos
      beast. Victims that do so have a 10% chance of retaining their original
      Hit Dice and ability scores if they are better than those of a standard
      chaos beast (see the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary 2 for stats for
      a standard chaos beast).

    description: >-
      Transmutation effects, such as polymorphing or petrification, force a
      chaos beast into a new shape, but at the start of its next turn, it
      immediately returns to its normal form as a free action.
