  - name: Gifts of the Teachers (Ex)
    description: >-
      Old-Mage Jatembe sought the knowledge and assistance of many great
      powers-from angels to demons to gods&#8211;so he could help his people.
      Among the gifts they bestowed on him were permanent versions of augmented
      mythic barkskin, mind blank, and shapechange, plus the knowledge and power
      that allowed him to develop his enhanced divine knowledge ability. These
      increase his CR by 1. Jatembe's
  - name: Divine Knowledge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Jatembe has a much stronger version of the divine knowledge archmage path
      ability (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 19). He has the following spells
      on his list of spells known: barkskin, call lightning, entangle, forest
      friendUC, lesser restoration, plant growth, speak with animals, and speak
      with plants.
  - name: Perfect Preparation (Ex)
    description: >-
      Jatembe no longer needs a spellbook to prepare spells. He knows and can
      prepare any wizard spell from the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook that
      doesn't have the evil descriptor, any spell from pages 28 and 29 of
      Pathfinder Player Companion: Faiths & Philosophies (casting these as
      though they were wizard spells of the highest level listed in their
      descriptions), and possibly others as well, including unique ones he's
      researched. Permanent Spells Through the use of permanency, Jatembe is
      constantly under the effects of the following spells: arcane sight,
      darkvision, see invisibility, and telepathic bond (once with each of his
      Ten Magic Warriors). He is under the effect of a contingency that causes
      dimension door to come into effect if he's brought below 80 hit points.
