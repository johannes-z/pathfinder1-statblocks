BeforeCombat: >-
  Koss's statistics above include the effects of Nedowyn's heroes' feast. In
  addition, he casts mage armor, shield, and overland flight before getting into
  a fight.
DuringCombat: >-
  Koss avoids melee combat, and tries to stay mobile in a fight so he can hit
  foes with his spells, preferring to use flight to remain out of melee reach
  but still in range to be affected  by allied spell effects. He casts mirror
  image on the first round of combat, then focuses on battlefield control for
  the following few rounds, using wall of force, spiked pit, and create pit to
  complicate things for the enemy. He's quick to use dispel magic on
  particularly dangerous effects as they come up, and relies on
  blindness/deafness when faced with foes who utilize sneak attacks or ranged
  attacks. If an ally is in deadly peril, Koss swoops in to teleport that ally
  and himself to safety with dimension door, but he won't travel too far if that
  means abandoning other Fearless Crows. He prefers to save area effect damage
  spells and his staff of fire to use against grouped foes once his allies have
  softened them up.
Morale: >-
  Koss fights to the death unless he's the last one standing, in which case he
  flees Barleybridge.
