  lies in wait, beginning combat with a sneak attack.
DuringCombat: >-

  unable to safely throw her fiery concoctions. She uses smoke and stink bombs
  to disorient foes and hide amid the chaos.
Morale: >-
  Sehema has worked hard to build her pesh empire and fights to the death to
  defend it, but if the PCs can convince her that they aren't trying to steal
  from her by changing her attitude from hostile to at least indifferent, she's
  willing to let them live, and may even sell pesh or information to them.
