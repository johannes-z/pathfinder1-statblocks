BeforeCombat: >-
  Nebta-Khufre casts alarm spells in areas Q8 and Q13 every day, and casts false
  life and mage armor as soon as the alarm in area Q8 is triggered. Once the
  second alarm in area Q13 is triggered, he also casts bear's endurance, fly,
  shield, and stoneskin, and casts communal resist energy (fire) on himself and
  the mummies.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once combat begins, Nebta-Khufre uses the Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh to
  cast animate dead on the corpses piled on the dais, creating six zombies, then
  takes to the air and casts haste on himself and his undead minions and
  obsidian flow on the floor around opponents. He then rains down offensive
  spells and rays, sending ball lightning against armored warriors and targeting
  spellcasters with disruptive spells (modified with his lesser disruptive
  metamagic rod).
Morale: >-
  Obsessed with his newfound power over life and death, Nebta-Khufre is
  unwilling to give up the Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh and fights to the
  death.

  of stinking cloud, wand of enervation (14 charges)
