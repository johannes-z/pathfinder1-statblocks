DuringCombat: >-
  Inoklar stays back, hoping to lure PCs into the trap on the floor in front of
  her throne. Once the PCs approach within 30 feet, she uses Dazzling Display to
  demoralize them and take advantage of her Scent of Fear feat. She concentrates
  her attacks on any shaken foes or a PC caught in the trap.
Morale: Intoxicated by the smell of humanoid fear, Inoklar fights to the death.
