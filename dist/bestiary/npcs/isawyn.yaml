SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Devastating Aria (Su)
    description: >-
      By spending 1 round of bardic performance as a standard action, Isawyn can
      direct a burst of sound at a target within 30 feet. This deals 1d4+10
      points of sonic damage to an object, or half this amount to a living
      creature. Bardic Performance&#8211;Scathing
  - name: Tirade (Su)
    description: >-
      To affect a creature with a scathing tirade, Isawyn must be within 30 feet
      of the target, who must be able to see and hear her. The targeted creature
      becomes frightened (Will DC 19 reduces the effect to the shaken condition)
      for as long as Isawyn continues the performance plus 1d4 rounds. This is a
      mind-affecting fear effect.
  - name: Costume Proficiency (Ex)
    description: >-
      Isawyn is proficient with medium armor and can cast bard spells while
      wearing medium armor without incurring arcane spell failure chance.
  - name: Famous (Ex)
    description: >-
      Isawyn gains a +3 bonus on Bluff and Intimidate checks made in and around
      certain parts of central Cheliax&#8211;this ability is of little use to
      her at this time.
  - name: Prima Donna (Ex)
    description: >-
      Isawyn can expend an extra round of bardic performance to gain a +2 bonus
      on Perform checks or save DCs to her countersong, fascinate, and scathing
      tirade bardic performances.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Isawyn casts unseen servant at the start of every day. She drinks a potion of
  bear's endurance just before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Isawyn activates her bardic performance to inspire courage, then casts
  invisibility and uses haste and healing magic to aid Gorebeard and any
  summoned monsters. She uses her unseen servant to open and close doors, pick
  up fallen weapons, and otherwise do small tasks during combat to keep
  opponents on their toes and force them to waste time with move actions to
  counter these minor inconveniences. She targets the most heavily armored foe
  with dominate person and orders that person to strip out of his armor, drop
  his weapons, and then stand patiently in the corner of the room. If the battle
  turns bad, she risks ordering the dominated person to attack her enemies with
  his bare hands. If a foe looks like he's only a few points away from being
  knocked unconscious, Isawyn uses devastating aria to try to knock him out with
  the damage it causes.
Morale: >-
  Isawyn doesn't want to die here; she casts dimension door to escape into the
  surrounding slums if reduced to fewer than 15 hit points. Isawyn holds
  grudges, however, and having heard of the PCs' infamous grudge against
  Harrigan, she seeks him out and joins him in defending his island if she can
  escape.
Gear: potions of bear's endurance (2)
