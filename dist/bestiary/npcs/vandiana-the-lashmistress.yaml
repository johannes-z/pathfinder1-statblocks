BeforeCombat: >-
  Prior to beginning the awakening ritual, Vandiana casts false life and mage
  armor on herself. If she senses her alarm trigger in area A1, she casts
  darkvision. Once she hears anyone open the door to area A4, she drinks her
  potion of cat's grace. All of these are already factored into her stats.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vandiana tries to stay out of melee, relying on her allies to keep her enemies
  at bay. She uses her spells to hamper and harm her enemies and help her allies
  using her best judgment and does not hesitate to cast darkness to confuse
  intruders (especially if she hears the alarm and casts darkvision).
Morale: Vandiana zealously fights to the death.
Gear: potion of cat's grace
OtherGear: >-
  +2 light steel shield, +1 whip, amulet of natural armor +1, ring of protection
  +2 (arcane bond), spell component pouch
