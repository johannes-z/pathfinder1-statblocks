BeforeCombat: >-
  When the goblins captured this giant scorpion, he was injured severely and has
  not since fully recovered. His stinger was cut off (thus removing his sting
  attack and poison), he took a lot of Strength damage from goblin poisons (of
  which 4 points have yet to heal), and he still has 17 points of damage that
  haven't healed from the day he was brought here.
DuringCombat: The scorpion is mindless and injured&#8211;he attacks the first PC he sees.
Morale: The scorpion fights to the death.
