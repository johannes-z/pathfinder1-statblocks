SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)

      Str; cure 2 saves.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: Sskhavo casts blur and mirror image before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Sskhavo uses precise strike as often as possible (the bonus is already
  included in his stat block). He attempts to disarm foes who engage him in
  melee combat, focusing all of his attacks on disarmed opponents while parrying
  and riposting attacks from other foes. He uses his enhanced mobility to avoid
  being cornered or flanked.
Morale: >-
  If he is reduced to fewer than 100 hit points, Sskhavo teleports to area N10
  and summons his officers to rally the fortress's defenders. If the fortress is
  already on alert, he instead teleports to area N26 to join Khavith in a
  last-ditch defense of the citadel. Otherwise, Sskhavo fights to the death,
  aware that failure or surrender will only result in an even more painful death
  at the hands of Vyr-Azul.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds
OtherGear: >-
  +2 leather armor, +1 composite longbow (+3 Str) with 20 arrows, +1 keen short
  sword, amulet of natural armor +2, belt of giant strength +2, key to area N34,
  80 gp
