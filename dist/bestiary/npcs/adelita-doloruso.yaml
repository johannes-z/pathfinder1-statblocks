BeforeCombat: Adelita casts mage armor every day.
DuringCombat: >-
  Adelita hangs back at first, letting her crew move forward while she supports
  them with spells. She casts quickened shield on the first round, along with
  invisibility so she can prepare a few other spells (mirror image and heroism)
  before she joins in with her attack spells. She casts repulsion if too many
  enemies are reaching her.
Morale: >-
  Adelita fights until reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, at which point she
  attempts to teleport back to Harrigan's fortress to warn him of the fleet's
  failure. If she escapes in this manner, feel free to either have her join
  forces with Harrigan (if your PCs could use a bigger challenge) or join the
  other prisoners in the prison (area D5) after some unfortunate mutilations to
  her hands and tongue.

  of mighty constitution +4, cloak of resistance +2, mutineer's bane earring
