SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear of Fire (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shriezyx within 30 feet of a fire the size of a torch or larger becomes
      shaken as long as it remains within that range. If damaged by fire, a
      shriezyx must succeed at a Will save (DC equals the amount of fire damage
      dealt) or be frightened for 1 round.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 27; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6
      Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Slowing Toxin (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature struck by this enormous shriezyx's web must succeed at a DC
      27 Fortitude save or be slowed (as per the spell) for 1 minute. Each
      round, a victim may attempt a new DC 27 Fortitude save to end the effect
      early. This toxin fades quickly from spun webs&#8211;it can only affect
      targets on the round the web is spun. Existing webs, while they remain
      sticky, do not have this slowing effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The shriezyx uses its web to entrap foes who aren't wearing armor&#8211;it's
  smart enough to assume these characters aren't as strong as armor-wearing
  foes. It prefers to focus its attacks on armor-clad foes so its poison can
  debilitate their strength.
Morale: The shriezyx fights to the death.
