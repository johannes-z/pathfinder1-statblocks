  Unless the PCs intervene, the ooze kills all of the cattle in the main hold
  before slithering upstairs onto the main deck, whereupon it kills 2d4 sailors
  before slithering off the side of the ship into the ocean to swim away. If the
  PCs confront it, the ooze focuses its attacks on them.
Morale: The hungry flesh fights to the death.
