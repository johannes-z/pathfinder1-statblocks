  - name: Nine Lives (Su)
    description: >-
      The warden familiar has nine lives. Each time it is slain it is reborn in
      1d2 rounds, stronger than it w as in its previous incarnation. If slain a
      ninth time, it remains dead. Each time it is slain and reborn, the warden
      familiar increases in power as shown on the table below. When its Strength
      score equals or surpasses its Dexterity score, it loses the Weapon Finesse
      feats and gains the Weapon Focus (bite) feats. The damage dice for its
      claws and bite also increase to the next larger die as it grows in size
      (from 1d2 to 1d3; from 1d3 to 1d4, etc.). This ability cannot be dispelled
      or negated except by the following: disintegrate, flesh to stone, miracle,
      temporal stasis, or wish. A dismissal spell sends the warden familiar back
      to its plane of origin. When awarding XP for defeating a warden familiar,
      only award XP for the highest CR at which the PCs defeated it. If the PCs
      defeat a warden familiar and return to defeat it again later, award XP
      equal to the difference between the previous CR and the current one. For
      example, if the PCs defeat a guardian familiar 4 times, they receive XP
      for a CR 2 encounter. If they later return and defeat it when it is CR 4,
      they get XP equal to the difference between a CR 2 and CR 4 encounter.
