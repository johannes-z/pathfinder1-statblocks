BeforeCombat: >-
  Ironfang shadows prefer to fight from superior positions or to stage ambushes.
  They poison an arrow before entering combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Shadows grant their favored enemy bonuses to allies before launching volleys
  of arrows. They prefer using their ranger tricks to keep foes at range or to
  fire in melee without provoking attacks of opportunity, and they switch to
  their scimitars only when desperate.
Morale: Ironfang shadows are fanatics and fight to the death.
