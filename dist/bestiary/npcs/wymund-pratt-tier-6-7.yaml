BeforeCombat: Pratt summoned 1d3 fiendish wolverines and used a scroll of eagle's splendor.
DuringCombat: >-
  Pratt sends his wolverines after the PCs and hits the toughest-looking PC with
  confusion. He then casts glitterdust at any fighter-types not hit by
  confusion, casts hideous laughter at clerics and casters, and hits anyone who
  gets too close with fear. If the PCs get close, he casts invisibility and
  repositions himself. Should he run out of spell options, he resorts to his
  shortbow.
Morale: Pratt fights to the death.

  potion of cure moderate wounds, scrolls of dimension door (2), scroll of
  invisibility, scroll of silence
