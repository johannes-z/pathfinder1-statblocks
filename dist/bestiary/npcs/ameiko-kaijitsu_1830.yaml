BeforeCombat: Ameiko casts unseen servant every morning.
DuringCombat: >-
  When able to strike first in a combat, Ameiko uses bravado's blade to
  intimidate foes instead of dealing sneak attack damage. Ameiko begins combat
  by activating her bardic performance. She always uses Arcane Strike in battle
  (these bonuses are included in her stats above).
Morale: >-
  Ameiko is loyal to her friends, and never abandons an ally in combat. Alone,
  her bravery isn't as great. When she is faced with a dangerous foe and has no
  allies in peril, she prefers to flee if reduced below 15 hit points.

  potion of remove disease, wand of cure moderate wounds (25 charges), wand of
  identify (40 charges)
