BeforeCombat: >-
  Areshkhesbed places alarms on the doors in areas K18 and K38, and a symbol of
  persuasion on the door to this chamber from area K38.
DuringCombat: >-
  Areshkhesbed attacks intruders with her spell-like abilities, making use of
  blasphemy, contagion, poison, and unholy blight. If all else fails, the evil
  sphinx is more than happy to pounce upon her foes, smiting good and tearing
  them limb from limb with her claws and fanged bite.
Morale: >-
  Bound for eternity to the Sightless Sphinx, Areshkhesbed has no choice but to
  fight to the death to defend the temple. However, if reduced to fewer than 35
  hit points, the sphinx uses dimension door to retreat to another room, where
  she waits for her fast healing ability to heal her before returning to attack
  intruders.
