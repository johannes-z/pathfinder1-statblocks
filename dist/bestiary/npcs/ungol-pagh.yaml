BeforeCombat: >-
  Ungol-Pagh casts mage armor on himself, and keeps a mental alarm spell active
  at the base of the stairs from area D8 active at all times; he uses his lesser
  extend metamagic rod to enhance both of these spells.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ungol-Pagh spends the first few rounds of combat casting defensive
  spells&#8211;mirror image, shield, and displacement, in that order (the
  effects of these spells are not factored into the above statistics). If warned
  by a skum from area D8 or by his alarm, he casts these spells and then heads
  east to confront the PCs there. Once his spells are in place, he prefers to
  attack with magic, starting with slow to keep from being overwhelmed. Casting
  dispel magic to end a character's method of breathing water is a favorite
  tactic of the skum enchanter.
Morale: >-
  Ungol-Pagh fights to the death, knowing that failure to maintain this advanced
  scouting post for his master would result in a far worse punishment should he
  flee to report bad news to the aboleth necromancer.
Gear: wand of lightning bolt (12 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  amulet of natural armor +1, headband of vast intelligence +2, lesser extend
  metamagic rod, carving tools, pump valve ring (from area D10), spellbook (a
  series of engraved clam shells that contains all prepared spells plus an
  additional four 1st- , 2nd-, and 3rd-level spells of your choice)
