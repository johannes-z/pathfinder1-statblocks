SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Paranoid (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ederleigh suffers from paranoia (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 251),
      giving him a -4 penalty on Will saves and Charisma-based skill checks
      (included in his stat block). He cannot receive benefit from or attempt
      the aid another action and cannot willingly accept aid (including healing)
      from another creature unless he makes a successful DC 17 Will save.
  - name: Schizophrenic (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ederleigh also suffers from schizophrenia (GameMastery Guide 251), giving
      him an additional &#8211;4 penalty on all Wisdom and Charisma-based skill
      checks (included in his stat block). He cannot take 10 or take 20 on skill
      checks, and each time he finds himself in a stressful situation (such as
      combat), he must make a successful DC 16 Will save or become confused for
      1d6 rounds.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Because of his paranoia, Ederleigh sees enemies everywhere. He drinks his
  potion of cat's grace at the first sign of trouble and casts levitate to get
  out of harm's way.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ederleigh relies on his spells and hand of the apprentice to fight from range,
  using his cunning trigger rogue talent to trigger traps in the room as swift
  actions (see Traps, below). His paranoia makes him unwilling to use his
  familiar, Dolo, to deliver touch spells. If cornered, Ederleigh wields his
  short sword to the best of his ability.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 40 hit points, Ederleigh leaps out the window, using
  feather fall to safely reach the ground. He then drinks his potion of
  invisibility and uses his scroll of expeditious retreat to run to the armory
  (area B26) which he locks himself in and uses as a safe room. Ederleigh
  surrenders only if subdued or brought to 12 hit points or fewer.
Gear: >-
  potion of cat's grace, potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of invisibility,
  potion of remove disease, scroll of expeditious retreat
OtherGear: >-
  +2 leather armor, +1 short sword, masterwork light crossbow with 10 bolts,
  amulet of natural armor +1, ring of protection +1, masterwork artisan's tools
  (Craft [traps]), everburning torch, spellbook (contains all prepared spells,
