  When attacked by the Black Kiss Boys, Jasper must make a DC 16 Will save each
  round to avoid becoming confused for 1d6 rounds due to his madness. If he acts
  normally, he fights using total defense. If the PCs step in to help defend
  him, Jasper hoots, hollers, and jeers the thugs as he moves about to support
  the PCs by healing them. If Jasper joins the PCs in their journey south, he
  continues this role, preferring to heal the PCs and keep them alive, since his
  visions have shown him that without the PCs, the doom he predicts for Magnimar
  will not come&#8211;the PCs must live if the apocalypse he hopes for so
  fervently is to occur at all.
Morale: Jasper never flees from a fight.
Gear: >-
