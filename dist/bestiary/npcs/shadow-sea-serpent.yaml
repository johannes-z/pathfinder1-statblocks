SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Capsize (Ex)
    description: >-
      A sea serpent can attempt to capsize a boat or ship of its size or smaller
      by ramming it as a charge attack and making a combat maneuver check. The
      DC of this check is 25 or the result of the boat captain's Profession
      (sailor) check, whichever is higher.
  - name: Elusive (Su)
    description: >-
      Sea serpents have long been the stuff of maritime legends, but despite
      countless attempts to hunt them, they are rarely encountered unless they
      wish it. As a full-round action while in water, a sea serpent can move up
      to its run speed (300 ft.) without leaving any trace of its passing
      (identical in effect to a pass without trace). An elusive sea serpent
      gains a +40 circumstance bonus to its Stealth check. In addition, except
      when in combat, a sea serpent is considered to be under the effects of a
      nondetection spell. Both of these spell effects are at caster level 20th
      and cannot be dispelled.
  - name: Shadow Blend (Ex)
    description: >-
      In any illumination other than bright light, a shadow elemental blends
      into the shadows, giving it concealment (20% miss chance). A shadow
      elemental can suspend or resume this ability as a free action.
