SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Double Weapon Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      While making a full attack, an atamahuta controls its arms with both heads
      and does not take a penalty on attack or damage rolls for attacking with a
      double weapon.
  - name: Spellstrike (Su)
    description: >-
      An atamahuta can imbue its weapon with magical properties using its
      spell-like abilities. Whenever an atamahuta casts a spell with a range of
      "touch" from its spell-like abilities, it can deliver the spell through
      any weapon it is holding as part of a free melee attack at its highest
      base attack bonus as part of casting its spell. If successful, this melee
      attack deals its normal damage as well as inflicts the effects of the
      spell. This attack uses the weapon's normal critical threat range, but the
      spell effect deals only double damage on a successful critical hit, while
      the weapon damage uses the weapon's normal critical multiplier. An
      atamahuta cannot make a full attack during the same round that it uses a
      spell-like ability unless another effect would allow it to do so.
  - name: Ward Off Distractions (Ex)
    description: >-
      An atamahuta uses one of its heads to defend against attacks while the
      other is using a spell-like ability, giving it a +4 bonus to AC against
      attacks of opportunity while casting.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  The atamahuta drink their potions of fly and cast stoneskin before entering
  combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The oni cast haste on the first round of combat. Each round, one of them jumps
  down into the courtyard (the equivalent of a charge), while the one still
  above casts fireball, black tentacles, or wall of fire to hinder defenders.
  Once both oni are in the courtyard, they attack the closest foes, channeling
  their spell-like abilities through their weapons with their spellstrike
  ability and attempting to sunder the weapons of powerful opponents.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 75 hit points or fewer, an atamahuta casts rage on himself and
  his partner and they continue attacking. Thereafter, they fight savagely to
  the death.
Gear: potions of fly (2)
OtherGear: kusari gusoku*, javelins (5), monk's spade*
