BeforeCombat: >-
  If forewarned of the PCs' approach, the guards drink their potions of
  invisibility to begin combat with a sneak attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  The guards attempt to flank enemies if possible; if this proves impractical,
  they feint to gain sneak attacks against their enemies.
Morale: >-
  The guards fight to the death if either Lyone or Orlicino are active in the
  battle; if both leaders fall, flee, or surrender, any remaining guards flee
  downstairs seeking the cultists' aid. In this event, the guards perish when
  they activate the trap on level D, plummeting to their deaths in the well's
  central shaft.
