DuringCombat: >-
  General Stom has a dozen rocks stacked along the edge of the balcony, and as
  combat begins, she supports the giants below by hurling these into the fray.
  She makes the PCs come to her before engaging in melee&#8211;if the PCs use
  ranged weapons or attacks, though, she rushes down the stairs to attack them
  once at least four of the giants below have been killed.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 80 hit points, General Stom makes a fighting retreat
  toward the exit, hoping to flee the region entirely once she gets out of the
  building. If no escape is possible, she surrenders if brought below 20 hit
  points, and offers to aid the PCs in killing Jubbek. She knows the layout of
  Jubbek's Halls quite well, and can at the very least provide the PCs with a
  map and lists of guards. She doesn't know about area B11.
OtherGear: >-
  +2 adamantine breastplate, +2 thundering earth breaker, bag (see Treasure,
  below)
