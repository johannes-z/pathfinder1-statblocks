    description: >-
      Gunshy's phobia of guns forces him to attempt a DC 14 Will save when
      confronted with firearms to avoid being shaken for 1d6 rounds. Against
      laser rifles, he takes a -4 penalty on this save.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Gunshy rages and charges at the closest foe, thrashing away with his magical
  greatclub. He isn't the most creative combatant, but he does enjoy making
  Power Attacks. Against a character who wields a firearm, he always attempts to
  sunder the character's weapon before attacking with intent to kill.
Morale: >-
  Gunshy fights to the death unless he takes damage from a firearm while at
  fewer than 14 hit points. If he survives being shot at this point, he
  automatically attempts to flee, fighting to the death only if cornered.
Gear: +1 hide armor, +1 greatclub
