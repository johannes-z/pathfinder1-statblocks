  - name: Versatile Tools (Ex)
    description: >-
      Aoinse lacks the net attack normal clockwork servants have. Instead, she
      has a number of useful tools built into her hands. These tools are treated
      as masterwork artisan's tools (Craft [clockwork]) and masterwork thieves'
      tools, and can't be disarmed or removed without damaging the construct.
