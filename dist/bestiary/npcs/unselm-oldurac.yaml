  - name: s Legacy (Ex)
    description: >-
      Unselm's addiction left him with a number of permanent afflictions, which
      he leaves untreated as a kind of penance. He takes penalties to his
      physical characteristics (-2 Str, &#8211;4 Dex, &#8211;2 Con) and speed
      (&#8211;10 feet; without a cane his speed is reduced by a further 10
      feet), and is prone to seizures. However, his unorthodox feral mutagen has
      left his skin with a lasting leathery texture, providing a +1 natural
      armor bonus.
  - name: Seizures (Ex)
    description: >-
      The toll Unselm's addiction took on his mind and body has left him
      especially vulnerable to seizures. If Unselm engages in any strenuous or
      exciting activity such as combat (even if he is just an observer), he must
      succeed at a DC 10 Fortitude save at the beginning of the event to
      forestall a seizure episode. If Unselm fails, he collapses and convulses
      painfully for 2d4 rounds (treat as prone and stunned). Following the
      seizure, he is staggered and sickened for 2d6 rounds.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Unselm remains on the fringes of the action, lobbing bombs when offensive
  action is required, and employing his healing arts otherwise. He does not
  imbibe his mutagen even in the direst circumstances unless commanded to do so
  by Sheila Heidmarch herself.
Morale: >-
  The penitent Unselm refuses to forsake comrades, fighting and providing aid
  until killed.
Gear: >-

  of cure serious wounds (2), wand of detect magic (42 charges)
