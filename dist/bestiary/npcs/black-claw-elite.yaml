DuringCombat: >-
  Elite warriors are better equipped and trained than their ordinary
  counterparts. Even when outnumbered, they hold their ground, shooting at foes
  with poisoned arrows and falling back to cover if attacked. They use stealth
  to sneak behind or outflank foes, and only engage in melee if they have no
  other choice.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, they order any remaining kobolds to
  hold the line while they retreat to safety to drink healing potions. They
  fight to the death only if cornered, or if they know their boss Zalsus (see
  page 12) is watching.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds (2), Medium spider venom (3 doses)
