SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Consume Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a mythic succubus can consume a soul stored in a
      gemstone she carries. Doing so affects her as if by a heal spell (CL 15th)
      and grants her a +4 profane bonus to her Charisma for 1 minute.
  - name: Penetrating Enchantments (Su)
    description: >-
      A mythic succubus's enchantment spell-like abilities and spells can affect
      creatures normally immune to mind-affecting effects of any sort, but such
      creatures gain a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist these effects.
  - name: Soul Trapping (Su)
    description: >-
      If a mythic succubus kills a creature, she can attempt to trap its soul in
      a gemstone she carries as an immediate action, affecting the soul as if by
      the spell soul bind. A successful DC 27 Will save negates this effect. If
      the creature being targeted was slain by the mythic succubus's energy
      drain attack, it receives no saving throw to resist this effect. The save
      DC is Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  One Pleaser uses mind fog at the start of combat, while the others immediately
  use mass suggestion to try to convince the enemies to assume subservient or
  humiliating positions and to remain in those positions for the duration.
  Pleasers are fond of turning such victims to stone via flesh to stone. In
  combat, they use mind control to prevent enemies from coordinating defense so
  they can focus on fewer targets at once in melee, much preferring to flank
  foes or feint to get in more sneak attacks.
Morale: >-
  A Pleaser attempts to flee combat if reduced below 40 hit points, offering her
  profane gift or her specific information as a bribe or payment for freedom if
  captured.
Gear: >-
  black sapphires (one worth 20,000 gp, one worth 15,000 gp, and two worth
  10,000 gp each)
