  - name: Electricity Discharge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a giant electric catfish can generate a pulse of
      electricity that deals 2d6 points of electricity damage to everything a 10
      ft. radius. Living creatures within the area not only take damage but also
      are stunned for one round. A successful DC 20 Reflex save reduces the
      electricity damage by half and negates the stunning effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
