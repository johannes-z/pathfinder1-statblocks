BeforeCombat: Zinlun casts extended still false life.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat he casts time stop, and takes advantage of this
  moment to cast reverse gravity, glitterdust, eagle's splendor and to move into
  a more advantageous combat position. After his time stop ends, he attacks the
  party with an area-effect offensive spell on odd-numbered rounds and a devour
  soul attempt on even-numbered rounds. If reduced to fewer than 100 hit points,
  he casts time stop again and then casts spells and repositions as appropriate
  to regain an advantage.
Morale: Zinlun fights until destroyed.
Gear: emerald wedge ioun stone (see page 77), spellbooks
