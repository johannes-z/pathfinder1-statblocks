SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Failed by Humanity (Ex)
    description: >-
      Aeptolinu holds a grudge against humans for their constant failures since
      Azlant's destruction, granting him a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls
      against human opponents. Humans take a -2 penalty on saving throws against
      his special abilities. This ability replaces the broken soul's scar tissue
      special ability.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Aeptolinu's disguise melts away as a free action, exposing his foes to his
  baleful, bloody gaze. He then uses his agonized wail and psychic magic to
  scatter enemies before flensing and bludgeoning them into submission. He
  favors human opponents, berating them for their millennia of failures.
Morale: Death would be a mercy to Aeptolinu, and he fights until destroyed.
