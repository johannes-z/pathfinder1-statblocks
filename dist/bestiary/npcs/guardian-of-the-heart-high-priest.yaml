  - name: ESP (Su)
    description: >-
      Similar in effect, but more powerful, to the spells detect thoughts and
      seek thoughts, the ESP ability allows the guardian to find and understand
      surface thoughts of a target, as well as gaining a limited precognition.
      The guardian can use any of the abilities of detect thoughts or seek
      thoughts, and additionally gains a bonus on initiative equal to the
      guardian's HD. A target gets a Will save against this intrusion equal to
      10 + 1/2 the guardian's level + the guardian's Charisma modifier.
  - name: Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round, a guardian high priest may use one of the following
      effects as a gaze attack, with a range of 30 ft.: confusion, discord (as a
      song of discord), dominate person, fear, or pain (as a symbol of pain).
      Each power may be used once per round, but no more than once per hour
      each. The save to resist the gaze is equal to 10 + 1/2 the guardian's
      level + the guardian's Charisma modifier.
  - name: Increased Spellcasting (Ex)
    description: >-
      When within the environs of the Lead mine, all guardians of the heart cast
      spells as a cleric 2 levels higher. This affects prepared spell only, no
      other class abilities are affected.
