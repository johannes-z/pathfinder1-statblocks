DuringCombat: >-
  Although Myriana is undead, she was made so by despair, not hate. She would
  rather recruit the PCs than harm them. She prefers to use her stunning glance
  to defeat foes without causing lasting harm, but if pressed uses her magic and
  corrupting gaze to get her point across.
Morale: >-
  As long as her lover remains atop Hook Mountain as an undead monster, Myriana
  cannot be slain forever. She fights until destroyed, then rejuvenates with the
  next sunset and sends Yap to gather the PCs to her side once again&#8211;if
  she's ignored, she may turn her wrath against Turtleback Ferry.
