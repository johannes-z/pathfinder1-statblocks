SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Castothrane is shrouded in an aura of fear. Creatures with fewer than 5
      Hit Dice and in a 30-foot radius must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be
      affected as per fear (CL 11th).
  - name: Find Target (Sp)
    description: >-
      Castothrane can track and find the holder of his circlet unerringly, as
      though guided by discern location (CL 11th). Using this ability, he can
      also find the last person to hold his circlet. His caster level is equal
      to the total of his Hit Dice.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Castothrane uses Power Attack when he fights. As he does, he attempts to
  maneuver the battle out onto one of the nearby parapets, so he can attempt to
  bull rush enemies off the edge (anyone who topples from either parapet takes
  6d6 points of damage from the fall to the rocky shoreline below). Although
  Castothrane would like nothing better than to pursue fleeing enemies, his
  orders are to remain on this floor of the gatehouse no matter what.
Morale: Castothrane fights until destroyed, or until he receives his circlet.
Gear: >-
  +1 full plate, +1 heavy steel shield, +1 battleaxe, mwk composite longbow (+4
  Str) with 20 arrows, cloak of resistance +1, ring of immolation (see page 435)
