SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Size Alteration (Su)
    description: >-
      At will as a standard action, a spriggan can change his size between Small
      and Large. Weapons, armor, and other objects on the spriggan's person grow
      proportionally when he changes size (objects revert to normal size 1 round
      after a spriggan releases them). When a spriggan becomes Large, his speed
      increases to 30 feet, he gains +12 Strength, -2 Dexterity, and +6
      Constitution, and he takes a &#8211;2 size penalty to his AC. While Large,
      a spriggan cannot use his sneak attack or his racial spell-like abilities.
  - name: Spriggan Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A spriggan gains a +1 racial bonus on concentration checks and to save DCs
      for all of its racial spell-like abilities.
  - name: Spriggan Skills (Ex)
    description: >-
      Climb, Disable Device, Perception, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth are class
      skills for spriggans.
DuringCombat: >-
  The spriggan grows to Large size as soon as possible and lumbers into combat,
  concentrating on the most dangerous opponents (see below for Large
  statistics). The spriggan does not much like the atomies, and so avoids
  harming PCs that seem to be concentrating their attacks against the diminutive
  duelists.
Morale: The grim spriggan expects and offers no quarter. He fights until slain.
