DuringCombat: >-
  Ikiko does not take risks in combat, instead biding her time to make the best
  use of her precise strike (using superior feint as necessary) and opportune
  parry and riposte deeds. She always keeps at least 1 panache point in reserve
  to take advantage of her kip-up, swashbuckler's grace, and superior feint
  deeds.
Morale: >-
  Ikiko is a warrior of opportunity; if things look to be going against her, or
  if she's reduced to fewer than 25 hit points, she attempts to flee or
  negotiate terms with her opponents.
