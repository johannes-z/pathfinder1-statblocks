Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Dimata readies her crossbow and looks for a defensible position, preferring
  high ground and deadfalls or other terrain that serves as a barricade. If
  necessary, she uses her Kaava musk to attract predators to the site of an
  ambush.
DuringCombat: >-
  Dimata prefers to stay at range and force enemies to approach her, preferably
  over treacherous ground. Once her enemies close in, she switches to her
  scimitar and first tries to eliminate anyone she sees casting spells.
Morale: >-
  Dimata is brave but not foolhardy. She tries to flee if greatly outnumbered or
  obviously outmatched. She uses her knowledge of the jungle to mislead pursuers
  and hide herself. If there seems to be no other option, she may try to
  surrender but is more likely to fight to the death than allow herself to be
  executed by bloodthirsty enemies.

  Kaava musk (Sargavan "goop," see Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting 130)
