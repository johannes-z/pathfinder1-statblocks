SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Daemonic Pact (Su)
    description: >-
      Urdefhans are infused with daemonic energy; as an immediate action, an
      urdefhan can attempt to allow this energy to consume its soul (50% chance
      of success per attempt). If it succeeds, the urdefhan dies and releases a
      5-foot-radius burst of negative energy that deals 2d6 points of damage (DC
      15 Reflex half ). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Negative Energy Affinity (Ex)
    description: >-
      An urdefhan is alive, but it reacts to positive and negative energy as if
      it were undead- positive energy harms it, while negative energy heals it.
  - name: Strength Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      An urdefhan's bite drains vitality, turning the skin and muscle around the
      wound transparent and causing 2 points of Strength damage unless the
      target succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. The flesh remains transparent
      until the Strength damage is healed, but this transparency does not have
      any other effects. The save DC is Constitution-based.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Before springing an ambush, the urdefhans drink their potions of shield of
  faith.
DuringCombat: >-
  The urdefhans target opponents with ranged sneak attacks from behind their
  arrowslits. They rely on Wind Stance and Lightning Stance to avoid ranged
  attacks as they move among the stone slabs. Once joined in melee, however,
  they work together, circling around with Spring Attack and Mobility to flank
  foes and make sneak attacks. Rather than kill intruders, the urdefhans try to
  take captives and drag them to the holding pens at area A5.
Morale: >-
  The urdefhans fight to the death, triggering their daemonic pact to escape
  capture or control in an explosion of negative energy that may also heal their
  nearby allies.
Gear: +1 arrows (10), potion of inflict serious wounds, potion of shield of faith
OtherGear: +2 chain shirt, +1 composite longbow (+6 Str) with 10 arrows, +1 rhoka
