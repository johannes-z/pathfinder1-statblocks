DuringCombat: >-
  If the Xun bodyguards are aware that combat is imminent, they prepare to throw
  tanglefoot bags as their initial action during the fight. After throwing their
  tanglefoot bags (or as their first action if caught by surprise), the Xun
  bodyguards use their light crossbows to fire a single volley at the PCs before
  they engage in melee. In melee, they work to position themselves between the
  PCs and Shadow Orchid and fight in pairs to flank their opponents. Whenever
  possible, they use their Spring Attack feat and readied actions to flank
  opponents while moving about the room.
Morale: >-
  The Xun bodyguards are fanatics and fight to the death. They neither give nor
  accept quarter.
