DuringCombat: >-
  These two bruisers fight in a coordinated way. One spends a turn to draw a
  potion of invisibility and drink it, while the other immediately engages the
  PCs with her ranseur. Once invisible, the invisible bruiser attempts to move
  into a flanking position with the first bruiser, targeting the most
  dangerous-looking PC. The invisible bruiser then attacks from invisibility to
  take advantage of a sneak attack just before the other bruiser can take 
  advantage of the flanking. Both use the reach of their weapons to their
  advantage and move about the room to keep their attackers on their toes.
Morale: >-
  If a bruiser is defeated, the remaining one retreats to area H6 to join forces
  with the creatures there. If that room is empty, the bruiser flees for area H1
  to escape into town.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of invisibility, potion of shield of
  faith +2
