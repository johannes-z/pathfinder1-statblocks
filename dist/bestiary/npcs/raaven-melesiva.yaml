DuringCombat: >-
  Melesiva makes use of his feats and slayer talents to make sneak attacks as
  often as possible. If these attacks are successful, he uses his studied target
  ability as an immediate action. He fights primarily to get the sacrifice away
  from the PCs, while also defending Syrellia from their attacks.
Morale: >-
  Duke Melesiva knows his actions constitute treason. Rather than suffer an
  agonizingly slow death through excruciation as punishment, he fights until
  slain in battle.
