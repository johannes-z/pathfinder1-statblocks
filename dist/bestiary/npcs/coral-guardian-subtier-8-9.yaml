  - name: Corporeal Instability (Su)
    description: >-
      Claw-contact (curse); save Fort DC 17; effect amorphous body and 1 Wisdom
      drain per round (see below); cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Con-based. A creature cursed with an amorphous body becomes a spongy,
      shapeless mass. Unless the victim manages to control the effect (see
      below), its shape constantly melts, flows, writhes, and boils. An affected
      creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing, armor, helmets, and
      rings become useless. Large items worn or carried&#8211;armor, backpacks,
      even shirts&#8211;hamper more than help, reducing the victim's Dexterity
      score by 4. Speed is reduced to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever
      is less. The victim gains the amorphous quality, but cannot cast spells or
      use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from
      foe (&#8211;4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50% miss chance, regardless of
      the attack roll). A victim can temporarily regain its own shape by taking
      a standard action to attempt a DC 15 Will save (this DC does not vary for
      a chaos beast with different Hit Dice or ability scores). A success
      reestablishes the creature's normal form for 1 minute. Spells that change
      the victim's shape (such as alter self, beast shape, elemental body, and
      polymorph) do not remove the curse, but hold the creature in a stable form
      (which might not be its own form, depending on the spell), and prevent
      additional Wisdom drain for the duration of the spell; shapechange and
      stoneskin have a similar effect. The victim takes 1 point of Wisdom drain
      from mental shock every round that it ends its turn in an amorphous
      shape&#8211;upon being drained to 1 Wisdom, further Wisdom drain ceases
      and the amorphous body effect is permanent until removed via magic (no
      further number of saving throws can cure the condition at this time).

    description: >-
      Transmutation effects, such as polymorphing or petrification, force a
      chaos beast into a new shape, but at the start of its next turn, it
      immediately returns to its normal form as a free action.
