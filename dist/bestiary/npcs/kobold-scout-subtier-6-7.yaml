  The scouts attempt to pin down as many opponents as they can with their tangle
  bolts (+1 seeking bolts that entangle the target on a hit, in addition to the
  bolt damage, as if it had been hit by a tanglefoot bag), then use Deadly Aim
  to deal maximum damage to entangled targets. One scout mans the trap trigger
  at all times.
