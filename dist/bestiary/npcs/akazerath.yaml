BeforeCombat: >-
  Akazerath casts mirror image, see invisibility, shield, and stoneskin on
  himself before battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  Akazerath casts displacement and haste on himself and Volstus at the beginning
  of combat, and fire shield (warm shield) on himself. The dragon uses his
  breath weapon at range while the Storm Tyrant uses his spell-like abilities.
  Once they enter melee combat, Akazerath makes Flyby Attacks with his bite
  while Volstus make Ride-By Attacks.
Morale: >-
  Dominated by Volstus, Akazerath is bound to unquestioningly obey his master in
  combat, fighting to the death if so ordered. If freed from the influence of
  the Orb of Red Dragonkind, however, the demoralized dragon is likely to flee
  any opponent that has even the slightest chance of defeating him.
