BeforeCombat: >-
  Fihralaz crouches and hides in the deep bog, waiting in ambush and concealing
  his position using 3 points of his misdirection class ability and his
  camouflage rogue talent.
DuringCombat: >-
  Fihralaz wades into combat, attempting to tear apart lightly armored targets
  before turning on heavily armed combatants. Upon grabbing a target with a
  natural attack, he tosses aside his harpoon to better sustain the grapple. He
  uses his spell-like abilities to hinder and damage large groups of enemies,
  and he throws his harpoon at foes out of reach in the hope of skewering them
  and dragging them into a grapple. If overwhelmed by enemies, Fihralaz doesn't
  hesitate to duck underwater, drink his potion of haste, and swim or teleport
  to a more advantageous position.
Morale: >-
  Fihralaz prefers failure to death and attempts to flee when reduced to 30 or
  fewer hp.
Gear: potion of haste
OtherGear: +1 keen harpoonUE, longarm bracersUE, 27 pieces of amber worth 80 gp each.
