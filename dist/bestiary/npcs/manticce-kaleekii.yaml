Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Manticce casts quickened false life and mirror image on the first round of
  combat, then a quickened lightning bolt and mass charm monster on the second.
  She favors dominate monster and dominate person after that, hoping to make
  allies out of enemies. If she dominates the whole party, she sends them back
  to Kintargo to continue their lives but periodically steps in to maintain her
  domination; how this plays out over the long term is left to you, but Manticce
  is no friend of Thrune, so it may be that being dominated by the witch has no
  real effect on the campaign.
Morale: >-
  If reduced below 80 hit points, Manticce teleports to safety elsewhere in her
  home. The PCs soon thereafter find themselves relentlessly attacked by various
  dominated minions and allies, along with repeated demand spells, until they
  can track down Manticce and either defeat her or apologize; how they might
  accomplish this may well lead to a series of adventures of your own design.
