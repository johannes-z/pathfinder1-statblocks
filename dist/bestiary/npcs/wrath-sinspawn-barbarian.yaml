DuringCombat: >-
  Once they're aware of the PCs' presence, the wrathspawn lash out. Having been
  interrupted during their sadistic cruelty, the creatures let out howls of rage
  before charging toward the PCs. The wrathspawn use their ranseurs to attack
  with reach and set up flanking positions. If this becomes difficult, two of
  the wrathspawn drop their weapons and instead fight with claws and bites in
  closer quarters.
Morale: >-
  Unable to fight anything worthwhile in millennia, the wrathspawn fight
  viciously to the death.
