BeforeCombat: >-
  Aglorn begins each day by casting false life, mage armor, and overland flight.
  If the PCs set off his alarm spell on the stairs to C1, he casts extended wind
  wall and shield before the Pathfinders reach the cavern.
DuringCombat: >-
  Aglorn begins combat by summoning monsters to waylay the PC along the rope
  bridges and plateaus, doing so as far as his range will allow. He summons
  creatures in the following order: 1d3 fiendish giant wasps (summon monster V)
  and 1d3 fiendish wolverines (summon monster IV), each using  the Augment
  Summoning feat and 1 charge of Aglorn's extend metamagic rod. Once he can see
  the PCs, he uses the next round to catch as many of them as possible in a
  fireball, and casts dispel magic on the first PC he sees flying or otherwise
  using magic to gain mobility across the treacherous terrain. If the
  opportunity presents itself, Aglorn splits the party with a wall of fire and
  then uses fear to drive fleeing opponents toward the flames. If he is cornered
  in melee, he uses his dimensional steps spell-like ability to escape and
  continue the combat at range.
Morale: >-
  Aglorn knows the entire Aspis Consortium effort in the Hao Jin Tapestry hinges
  on him maintaining control of the Diamond Gate, and he fights to the death to
  defend it.
