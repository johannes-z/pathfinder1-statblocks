SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sunlight Petrification (Ex)
    description: >-
      A rock trill that is exposed to natural sunlight is staggered and must
      make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round to resist permanently turning to
      stone. A stone to flesh spell (or similar effect) restores a petrified
      rock troll, but if it remains exposed to sunlight, it must immediately
      start making new Fortitude saves to avoid petrification. Spells like
      sunray or sunburst that create powerful natural sunlight cannot petrify a
      rock troll, but the troll is staggered for 1d4 rounds after being exposed
      to such an effect.
