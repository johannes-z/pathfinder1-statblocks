BeforeCombat: >-
  Ouidda cast glibness before she began her speech before the People's Council,
  and the effects have not yet worn off. She drinks her potion of invisibility
  when she hears someone approach the door.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ouidda attempts to turn the PCs against one another and win allies through her
  mastery of compulsions. She tries to avoid melee at all costs, preferring to
  use charmed foes as blockers between herself and her attackers, and employing
  magic such as hold person or deep slumber to drop physical threats out of
  combat.
Morale: >-
  Ouidda is not stupid and knows when she's beaten. She can exact revenge on the
  PCs if she can simply get away, which she attempts to do if reduced to fewer
  than half her total hit points.
Gear: >-
  potions of cure moderate wounds (2), potion of invisibility, potion of
  undetectable alignment
