    description: >-
      Eldarius is immune to the Aevan-Vhor curse. He always remembers what he is
      and what has befallen him.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      Carcosa has affected how a ghost's rejuvenation normally works. If
      destroyed, Eldarius reforms in his manor in 2d4 hours instead of 2d4 days.
      Eldarius can be laid to rest permanently if his family is restored to life
      and taken away from Carcosa.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Eldarius begins by using telekinesis to fling a PC away with a bull rush
  combat maneuver. While that ability recharges, he uses corrupting gaze or
  draining touch on any PCs who are fighting him.
Morale: >-
  Defeat means little to Eldarius, who rejuvenates quickly, although even one
  scene of violence in front of his family causes him to reconsider future
  negotiation.
