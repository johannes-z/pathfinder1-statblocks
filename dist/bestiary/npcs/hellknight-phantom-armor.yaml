  These undead suits of armor were created in a desecrated area and have
  additional hit points as a result. In addition, the above statistics assume
  these creatures are encountered in the area of an active desecrate effect; if
  encountered outside of such an area, reduce their channel resistance to +2 and
  reduce all of their saving throws, attack rolls, and damage rolls by 2 as
  well. These Hellknight phantom armors focus their attacks on obvious
  worshipers of good deities if possible.
Morale: The phantom armors fight until destroyed.
