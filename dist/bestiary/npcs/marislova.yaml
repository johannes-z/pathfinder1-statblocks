SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Nymph Inspired (Su)
    description: >-
      Marislova carries a lock of hair as a token of the debased nymph
      Kyrisjana's affection. This lock grants Marislova a +4 insight bonus on
      Will saving throws, Craft checks, and Perform checks. Kyrisjana retains a
      link to the token and Marislova as if she had cast a status spell on her.
      This effect ends if Kyrisjana is slain.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  If Marislova turns violent, she uses her arcane pool to enhance her handaxe to
  a +1 keen handaxe as a swift action, then uses her spell combat ability to
  cast shield (already included in her stat bock) and attacks with her axe. She
  continues using spell combat to cast scorching ray and magic missile, then
  uses spellstrike to deliver touch spells with her attacks. After 1d4 rounds,
  Marislova calms a bit and becomes more rational, casting defensive spells like
  blur, vanish, or web to open an escape route.
Morale: >-
  Marislova is interested in her own freedom above all else. If reduced to 25
  hit points or fewer, she casts vanish and tries to flee. If she's unable to
  escape the room or is cornered or captured, Marislova begs for execution
  rather than a return to her imprisonment.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds, potion of spider climb
OtherGear: >-
  +1 chain shirt, dagger, mwk composite longbow (+2 Str) with 20 arrows, mwk
  handaxe, mwk scimitar, amulet of natural armor +1, cloak of resistance +2,
  spell component pouch, lock of Kyrisjana's hair
