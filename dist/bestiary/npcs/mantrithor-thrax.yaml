BeforeCombat: >-
  Thrax casts stoneskin, mage armor, and shield on himself before he enters the
  ring-even before the battle starts, he's preparing, if unconsciously, for a
  worst-case scenario that sees him losing the battle and then attacking the PCs
  directly.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once Thrax summons his first batch of lemures (using summon monster IV to
  summon 1d4+1 of the devils), he casts haste on the devils on the same round
  they appear. Every round thereafter, he casts additional summon monster spells
  to call more and more lemures into the battle until he runs out with his last
  summon monster II spell. If things go bad for Thrax and he attacks the PCs, he
  casts stinking cloud into the cage with the rest of the party, and follows up
  with a dimension step to attack the party or (if the PCs used a champion
  rather than a summoned creature) the winning gladiator.
Morale: >-
  Once Thrax snaps and attacks the PCs, he fights to the death-he won't accept
  offers to surrender and must be magically or physically restrained if the PCs
  want to avoid killing him.
OtherGear: >-
  +1 mithral quarterstaff with twin rubies for eyes (worth 4,100 gp in all),
  amulet of natural armor +1, pearl of power (1st), gold Hellcaller's Cup trophy
  (worth 1,000 gp), diamond dust worth 500 gp
