BeforeCombat: >-
  The sisters cast mage armor on themselves each day, and cast status on the
  guards assigned to the monorail station.
DuringCombat: >-
  When combat begins, the witches cast mass suggestion to try to convince the
  PCs to lay down their arms and submit to capture. If this fails, they rain
  down misfortune, evil eye, and agony hexes while their maraxes engage PCs
  directly. If any PCs survive long enough, the witches target them with
  dominate person and enervation. They prefer to use spells like harm in melee
  combat instead of their spears. In the end, the witches hope to capture living
  targets&#8211;those they do are eventually brought to Prosser in area B4.
Morale: >-
  The sisters vastly overestimate their abilities, and won't consider retreating
  unless only one is left. A lone surviving sister flees immediately to
  Prosser's laboratory to protect him in later battles, fighting to the death to
  protect him.
