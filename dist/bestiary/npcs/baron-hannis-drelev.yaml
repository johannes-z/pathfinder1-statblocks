    description: >-
      Drelev has the gear of a PC rather than an NPC to account for his greater
      resources as the leader of a small kingdom. This equipment increases his
      CR by 1.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Drelev always uses his sword's defending property to enhance his AC against
  more proficient warriors. He likes to disarm opponents in the course of a duel
  or battle to force surrender. While fighting alongside his bodyguards, he also
  takes advantage of their flanking and his Mobility and Spring Attack feats to
  make quick work of foes by sneak attacking them.
Morale: >-
  If reduced below 20 hit points or disarmed during a duel, Drelev flees, trying
  to escape using the caverns below Drelev Keep. If he has no escape route, he
  drops his weapons and begs for mercy in a cowardly display.
Gear: potions of cure serious wounds (3)

  physical might +4 (Constitution and Strength), cloak of resistance +2, ring of
  protection +2, rod of splendor, key ring (contains keys to all locks in the
