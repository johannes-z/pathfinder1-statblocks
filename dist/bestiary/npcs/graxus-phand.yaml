BeforeCombat: >-
  Graxus Phand casts extended magic vestment on his armor and shield, and
  greater magic weapon on his +1 speed longsword. Before combat, he casts air
  walk, bear's endurance, bull's strength, and shield of faith. He casts
  extended status on his allies the Fist of Iomedae (area A36), Inquisitor
  Kazakador (area A23), Muzanesha (area A47), and Parnoneryx (area A53), every
  day-if he notices that any of these allies is taking damage or suffering from
  other    ailments, he quickly moves to the ally's last known location in order
  to provide aid.
DuringCombat: >-
  Phand prefers to fight alongside allies rather than face enemies alone, a
  tactic born from common sense, not cowardice. He saves most of his spells for
  recovery after a fight or to deal with ranged foes, closing to melee with
  enemies as soon as possible. Before entering melee, he uses a point of fervor
  to cast divine favor on himself as a swift action and then dispel evil on
  himself. When Phand enters melee, he uses his sacred weapon ability to enhance
  his longsword to grant it the frost and shock weapon special abilities as a
  swift action and uses his holy strike blessing to deal an additional 1d6
  points of damage to evil foes. He abandons the frost and shock special
  abilities whenever he begins a turn at fewer than 50 hit points to expend a
  use of fervor to cast his most powerful cure spell available on himself as a
  swift action. Faced with foes who favor energy damage, Phand instead uses
  sacred armor to grant his armor energy resistance against that energy as a
  swift action. He is fond of using Greater Sunder against enemies' weapons as
  well.
Morale: >-
  Phand views his command of Citadel Dinyar with pride, and knows that to fail
  in its defense is to fail the Glorious Reclamation. As a result, he fights to
  the death to defend the citadel.
Gear: lesser extend metamagic rod, wand of cure serious wounds (9 charges)

  +1 full plate, +1 fire resistance heavy steel shield, +1 speed longsword,
  amulet of natural armor +1, cloak of resistance +2, keys to guardroom and
  stockades (areas A6-A8), key to armory (area A15), old and battered wooden
  holy symbol of Iomedae, 91 gp
