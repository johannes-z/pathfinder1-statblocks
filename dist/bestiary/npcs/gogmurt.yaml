BeforeCombat: >-
  Gogmurt uses speak with animals and casts flame blade, then uses his wand of
  produce flame before investigating the PCs' arrival. If he thinks there's
  time, he also casts animal messenger to send a thrush out to the island to
  deliver a bloodstained goblin tooth to Warchief Ripnugget&#8211;a prearranged
  code to warn that the adventurers have finally arrived to murder them all.
  Gogmurt calls Tangletooth to his side and directs her in combat using speak
  with animals.
DuringCombat: >-
  Gogmurt casts entangle on the first round of combat, taking care to place the
  spell so that it blocks access to area C9 but doesn't block his own possible
  escape routes. If the PCs have animal minions, he casts charm animal on one of
  them. On following rounds, he fights with his flame blade in one hand,
  throwing fire from produce flame in the other when he needs to make ranged
  attacks. As soon as he's brought below 20 hit points, he retreats by fleeing
  into the brambles, heals himself as best he can, and then returns to ambush
  the PCs from behind by swapping out a remaining 1st-level spell for summon
  nature's ally I.
Morale: >-
  If he is ever brought below 10 hit points and has no healing left, Gogmurt
  attempts to flee north to warn Warchief Ripnugget about the PCs. If surrounded
  or captured, Gogmurt's resolve breaks and he sobs for mercy.
Gear: >-
  potions of cure light wounds (2), wand of produce flame (34 charges), wand of
  tree shape (4 charges)
