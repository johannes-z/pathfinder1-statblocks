BeforeCombat: The brawlers are scattered about the room, drinking and itching for a fight.
DuringCombat: >-
  If the brawlers have time at the beginning of combat or just before, they
  drink their potions of bull's strength (not figured into their stats). The
  brawlers then charge the nearest PC and start throwing punches while wielding
  their cestuses. Should a PC be out of immediate reach, a brawler grabs a chair
  and hurls it at them.
Morale: >-
  The brawlers are drunk, came here to fight, and don't fear pain; they fight
  until beaten unconscious or killed.
Gear: potion of bull's strength
OtherGear: masterwork studded leather, masterwork cestus
