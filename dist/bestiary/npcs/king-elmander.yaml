SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Special Arrows (Ex)
    description: >-
      A pixie can sprinkle his arrows with pixie dust before shooting them as a
      free action as long as it is then fired by that same pixie. King Elmander
      can generate 20 uses of dust per day. Once applied to an arrow, it
      persists on that missile for one round. A pixie can choose from the
      following three effects; save DCs are Charisma-based. Charm: Succeed on DC
      18 Will save or be affected as though by charm monster for 10 minutes.
      Memory Loss: Succeed on a DC 18 Will save or be affected by a modify
      memory spell (this effect can only eliminate the previous 5 minutes of
      memory). Sleep: Succeed on a DC 18 Will save or fall asleep for 5 minutes.
