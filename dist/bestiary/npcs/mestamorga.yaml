  Mestamorga remains disguised as Illayna as long as possible, hoping to avoid
  combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  If attacked or if her ruse is uncovered, Mestamorga fights viciously with her
  physical attacks, relying on her spell-like abilities if outnumbered in melee
  or faced with a foe she cannot hit. When the night hag resorts to using magic,
  she begins with unholy blight, followed by invisibility and deep slumber.
Morale: If reduced below 40 hp, Mestamorga attempts to become ethereal and escape.
