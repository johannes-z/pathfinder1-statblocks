SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Abyssal Connection (Su)
    description: >-
      Thanks to a foul rite in which Metruni dedicated her eternal soul to
      Haagenti, the oracle received a special gift from her patron demon lord,
      who granted Metruni a favored servant in exchange for her piety-a
      retriever called Orixium. Metruni and Orixium are irreversibly linked, and
      possess a special bond identical to that of a wizard's empathic link with
      his familiar.
  - name: Eldritch Bolt (Su)
    description: >-
      Metruni can damage foes with a bolt of raw magical energy. She may make a
      ranged touch attack against any foe within 60 feet. On a hit, she deals
      1d8+6 points of force damage. She may use this revelation a number of
      times equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.
  - name: Primal Manipulation (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever Metruni casts a spell that deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire
      damage, she may change it to deal one of the other listed damage types.
      She may use this ability once per day, plus one additional time for every
      5 levels she possesses.
  - name: Primal Mastery (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a spell Metruni casts triggers a primal magic event, or whenever
      she uses a rod of wonder, she may roll d% twice when generating the
      result. She may pick which of the two results actually occurs. She gains a
      +2 bonus on all saving throws made to resist primal magic events or
      magical effects caused by a rod of wonder.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Metruni senses any harm befalling her retriever or should she hear combat
  in area B18, she imbibes her potion of cat's grace and uses a charge of her
  wand of stoneskin on herself before setting out to investigate.
DuringCombat: >-
  Metruni alternately casts offensive spells to damage her foes and protective
  spells to bolster her defenses. Harm and inflict spells aid her greatly in the
  former regard, while spells such as bull's strength and greater magic weapon
  can be a boon if she is pressed into melee. She prefers to let her retriever
  minion do most of the fighting, however, and casts summon monster V to bolster
  her forces if need be, all while staying back and launching eldritch bolts or
  bullets from her axe musket at her foes. Meld into stone allows the tiefling a
  quick escape if she sees defeat is inevitable, allowing her to recover before
  seeking revenge upon the PCs later.
Morale: >-
  Metruni casts cure serious wounds on herself if she is brought to fewer than
  15 hit points, and surrenders if she runs out of healing spells, her retriever
  companion is slain, and she has no viable escape route. Her brief alliance
  with Sultur is certainly an unworthy cause to die for.
Gear: >-
  potion of cat's grace, potions of cure serious wounds (2), scroll of
  dismissal, wand of stoneskin (9 charges)
