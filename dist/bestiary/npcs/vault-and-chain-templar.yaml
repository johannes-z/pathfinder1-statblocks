BeforeCombat: >-
  If a templar expects a fight, she casts prayer to bolster herself and any
  nearby allies (not included in this stat block).
DuringCombat: >-
  The templar activates her justice and protection judgments to improve her
  attack bonus and AC by 3; her vambraces extend this bonus to her CMD and
  concentration checks. She uses Divine Interference to protect soldiers in her
  charge and spells like silence and hold person to shut down enemy
  spellcasters. Finally, she activates her bane ability and opens fire with her
  crossbow.
Morale: A templar fights to the death.
