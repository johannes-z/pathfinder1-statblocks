  Four ordinary vexgits have previously sneaked into nearby buildings, and when
  the fight breaks out, they start dismantling things. These three vexgit human
  hunters guard the approach to those buildings and fire at anyone who offers
  resistance, targeting humans first. The normal vexgits flee as soon as their
  protectors are defeated and do not put up a fight against the PCs, but if
  statistics are necessary, see page 29.
Morale: >-
  The vexgit human hunters run away from the square if they are reduced below 5
  hit points.
