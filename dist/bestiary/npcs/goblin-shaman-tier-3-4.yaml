DuringCombat: >-
  The goblin shaman stays in the back and tries to hit the PCs with sleep and
  then relies on her light crossbow. Should the PCs get close to her, she casts
  burning hands on the next round trying to get as many PCs possible
  (unconcerned about hitting other goblins) and then tries to hit a PC each
  round after with touch of fatigue. As soon as combat begins, she orders her
  weasel to attack the closest PC.
Morale: The goblin shaman fights to the death.
Gear: potions of cure light wounds (3)

  dagger, masterwork light crossbow with 10 bolts, wooden holy symbol of
