DuringCombat: >-
  The marines work together to keep attackers from reaching Admiral Thrune. The

  close combat. Any marine within 10 feet of Admiral Thrune falls under the
  effects of her ward the faithful spell, gaining a +3 deflection bonus to AC
  and a +3 resistance bonus on all saving throws.
