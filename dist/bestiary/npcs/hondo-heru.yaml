BeforeCombat: >-
  Hondo casts mage armor at the start of each day (included in his statistics).
  When his alarm spell goes off or he hears the PCs set off one of the
  basement's traps, he casts invisibility, fly, shield, mirror image, see
  invisibility, and arcane sight in that order.
DuringCombat: >-
  Hondo starts by casting improved invisibility and follows up with black
  tentacles, cloudkill, or transmute rock to mud. He uses cloudkill and stinking
  cloud with impunity in the enclosed area as his necklace of adaptation makes
  him immune to both of them. He reserves his dispel magic for effects that
  negate his invisibility. Against troubling opponents, he casts quickened true
  strike (or true strike) and attacks in melee with his sickles, hoping for a
  sneak attack.
Morale: >-
  Unwilling to give up his headquarters without a struggle, Hondo fights until
  reduced to 10 hit points or fewer before attempting to teleport away from
  Sothis entirely.
Gear: >-
  masterwork sickles (2), cloak of resistance +1, belt of incredible dexterity
  +2, headband of vast intelligence +2, necklace of adaptation, ring of
  protection +1, spell component pouches (2), spellbook (contains all prepared
  spells plus all 0-level and 1st-level spells in the Core Rulebook)
