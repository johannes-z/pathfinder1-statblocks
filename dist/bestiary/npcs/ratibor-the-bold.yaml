DuringCombat: >-
  Ratibor uses little in the way of strategy. He simply rages and attacks the
  nearest target within range, though he does take advantage of his rage
  powers&#8211; particularly guarded stance and unexpected strike. He holds his
  ground and tries to prevent his enemies from getting past him.
Morale: >-
  If guarding the Dancing Hut, Ratibor has no choice but to fight to the death.
  If his opponents flee, he follows them wherever they go, but he is forbidden
