  - name: Frightful Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures within 30 ft. that meet the eyes of a yeti must succeed on a DC
      14 Will save or stand paralyzed in fear (treat as a hold person spell) for
      3 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. An affected creature does not
      receive a saving throw each round to break the effects. This is a

      A yeti that makes a successful grapple check against a Medium or smaller

      round.
