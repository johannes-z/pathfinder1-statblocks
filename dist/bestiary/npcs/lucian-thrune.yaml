  Lucian prefers to fight astride his wyvern, and uses Ride-By Attack while
  using Vital Strike with his greatsword. He's conservative with Power Attack,
  and tends to use that feat only when he can somewhat offset the penalty on his
  attack rolls with a charge, flanking, or the like. He uses his tactician
  ability to grant Distracting Charge to allies, particularly to his wyvern when
  Lucian uses Ride-By Attack. He prefers to challenge obvious worshipers of
  faiths opposed to Asmodeus, but if given no other option challenges non-human
  foes, particularly halflings&#8211;Lucian bristles at the mere thought of
  halflings not being enslaved. When mounted, Lucian must guide his mount with
  his knees since he uses a two-handed weapon, but unless there are extenuating
  circumstances, he can't fail this DC 5 Ride check or the DC 10 Ride check to
  fight with a combat-trained mount.
Morale: >-
  Lucian's fear of failure outweighs his sense of self-preservation, but he
  won't hesitate to break off combat to retreat and recover if outclassed. If
  reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, he retreats to area C21 to use the
  healing magic kept there, abandoning his soldiers and even his wyvern if he
  feels that doing so will help him reach that room. He then commands the devil
  that guards area C21 to accompany him back to battle. At this point, he fights
  to the death. If cornered with no option to flee, he prefers to leap from a
  cliff's edge, hoping to fall to his death rather than allow the PCs to take
  him alive.
