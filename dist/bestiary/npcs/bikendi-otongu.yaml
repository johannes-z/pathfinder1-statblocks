    description: >-
      If slain, Bikendi's ghost reforms 2d4 days later. The only way to
      permanently destroy him is to return the missing immortal dreamstone to
      him so he can complete his ritual, or to destroy the stone, which frees
      his soul and permanently destroys his ghost.
Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: evocation, transmutation
BeforeCombat: Bikendi casts mage armor every day and shield when intruders enter the cellar.
DuringCombat: >-
  Bikendi casts dust of twilight to darken the surroundings and fatigue foes. He
  uses his malevolence ability to possess an identifiable cleric and ensure that
  character can't channel positive energy against him, while casting his spells
  using that enemy's body. If this tactic fails, or if he's forced to abandon a
  living body, Bikendi debilitates the same opponent with a blinding ray, deep
  slumber, or phantasmal killer. Against other opponents, he relies on his
  invisibility field to hide while casting illusions, enervation, feeblemind,
  shadow conjuration, shadow evocation, or his ray spells to weaken them.
  Thereafter, Bikendi attacks with his corrupting touch, in combination with
  touch spells such as bestow curse, touch of idiocy, or vampiric touch.
Morale: >-
  Obsessed with completing his ritual, Bikendi rejuvenates if slain. He then
  uses more nightmares to threaten the PCs, hoping to convince or bribe them
  into retrieving the immortal dreamstone, if for no reason other than to end
  his nightly visitations.
Gear: >-

  Bluff)
