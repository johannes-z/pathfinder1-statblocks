  - name: Create Elemental (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, as part of throwing a rock, an enforcer can transform a
      hurled rock into a Medium earth elemental. If the giant hits a target with
      its rock, the stone transforms into an elemental, suddenly sprouting arms
      and automatically attempting to grapple the target on the giant's turn. If
      the rock misses, it lands 1d6x5 feet away in a random direction and
      transforms into an elemental; the elemental is not prone and immediately
      charges into battle.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  The enforcers really enjoy using their ability to create earth elementals, and
  they use it before entering melee if possible.
