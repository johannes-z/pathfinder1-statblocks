SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Destructive Attacks (Ex)
    description: >-
      An abrikandilu's natural attacks can threaten and confirm critical hits
      against objects. In addition, the abrikandilu gains a +5 racial bonus on
      Strength checks made to break or destroy objects.
  - name: Hatred of Mirrors (Ex)
    description: >-
      An abrikandilu loathes the sight of its own reflection. Using a mirror
      grants a +5 bonus on Intimidate checks against an abrikandilu. An
      abrikandilu adjacent to a mirror or attacked by a mirror-carrying creature
      (at the GM's discretion, some shields could be considered mirrors) must
      attempt a DC 15 Will save at the start of its turn. If it fails, the
      abrikandilu must focus all of its actions that round on attempts to
      destroy the mirror.
  - name: Mutilation (Su)
    description: >-
      An abrikandilu's bite causes hideous, ugly wounds that not only mar beauty
      but supernaturally diminish a creature's sense of self-worth. A creature
      bitten by an abrikandilu must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or take a
      -1 penalty on all Charisma-based checks. This penalty can stack as high as
      a &#8211;5 penalty with multiple bites and failed saves, and lasts even
      after the wounds are healed. The penalty reduces by 1 point every 24
      hours. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The abrikandilu opens combat by hurling knives and bits of broken furniture at
  the PCs. When it engages in melee, it focuses its attacks on the most
  attractive PC.
Morale: The abrikandilu flees if reduced to fewer than 6 hit points.
