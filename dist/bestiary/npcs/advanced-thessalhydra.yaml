DuringCombat: >-
  The thessalhydra spits acid with its breath weapon, then strikes with its many
  serpentine bites at opponents within reach, using its Snatch feat to grab
  victims. It flings those caught in the fangs of its many mouths into the
  rubble of the collapsed warrens or onto the battlements of area B6. The
  thessalhydra uses its Combat Reflexes and Stand Still feats to prevent anyone
  from moving toward the gates.
Morale: The thessalhydra fights to the death.
