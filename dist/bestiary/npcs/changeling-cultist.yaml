DuringCombat: >-
  A changeling casts shield of faith on the first round of combat&#8211;if she
  hears the PCs coming early, she does so before combat. The changelings do
  their best to capture the PCs alive, using nets and wands of hold person for
  crowd control, or using command to get the PCs to drop what they're holding to
  limit their combat options. They generally avoid their hell's corruption
  subdomain power in combat, preferring instead to use this ability on the
  street to prepare a potential mark for easier mugging in a one-on-one fight.
Morale: >-
  Once one changeling is slain, the remaining changelings drink their potions of
  invisibility and flee to area C8 to join their mistress and report on the PCs
  strengths and weaknesses. Wounded changelings may pause along the way to cast
  cure light wounds on themselves if they feel they have the time.
Gear: potion of invisibility, wand of hold person (10 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  leather armor, mwk net, wooden unholy symbol, key to the door in area C1, 119
