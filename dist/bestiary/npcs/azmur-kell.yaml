BeforeCombat: >-
  Azmur casts air walk, call lightning, and barkskin if he hears combat and
  knows the PCs are near.
DuringCombat: >-
  Azmur wants to capture the PCs alive, and does his best not to kill them. If
  forced into melee combat, he uses his wand to create a flame blade.
Morale: >-
  If brought below 20 hp, he surrenders&#8211;the PCs are obviously stronger
  than he anticipated. If the PCs accept his surrender, continue with
  Development below. If they don't, he uses wild shape to assume the form of a
  bird and flies away to recover&#8211;at this point, he watches and lurks in
  the background, and can come to the PCs' aid in the future, at which point he
  again tries to bargain for their help in defeating the dragon.
