BeforeCombat: >-
  Lyone casts mage armor and false life daily, and both are reflected in his
  statistics. Before engaging in combat, he casts keen edge, cat's grace, mirror
  image, and shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Lyone initially hangs back and attempts to hamper opponents with mass reduce
  person and animate rope while his underlings fight. After using up his ranged
  spells he wades into melee with his falcata, always using Power Attack and
  Arcane Strike. Facing adjacent opponents, he uses Cleave rather than iterative
  attacks. Whenever he loses 20 or more hit points, he casts vampiric touch to
  heal himself (he can do so up to three times; twice from his prepared spells
  and once by channeling the spell through his arcane bond). When reduced to
  half his hit points, he casts blink and continues fighting.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 hit points or less, Lyone casts dimension door to teleport to
  the surface and flees, leaving his group behind. If that fails, he casts
  vanish to turn invisible for 9 rounds, and attempts to flee, but is extremely
  willing to surrender given the opportunity.
