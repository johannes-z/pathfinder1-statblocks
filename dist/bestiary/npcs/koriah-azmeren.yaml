BeforeCombat: >-
  Koriah casts barkskin, longstrider, and bear's endurance, drinks a potion of
  bull's strength, and uses her wand of cat's grace before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Koriah casts lead blades on the first round of combat and uses her hunter's
  bond to grant appropriate favored enemy bonuses to her companions. If she has
  to move to engage foes in battle, she's fond of making a single attack with
  her aklys against the target to try to trip it before moving up to attack it.
  She saves cure moderate wounds to use on an ally knocked down to negative hit
  points in battle, or for herself if she's fighting alone and falls to fewer
  than 25 hit points before she tries to flee combat.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 25 hit points, Koriah withdraws from combat. She uses
  her aklys to try to trip foes and deter them from chasing her, but as long as
  any allies remain in battle, she won't completely abandon a fight.
Gear: >-

  moderate wounds (7 charges)
OtherGear: >-
