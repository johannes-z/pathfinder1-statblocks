SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Judgment (Su)
    description: >-
      You can pronounce judgment upon your foes as a swift action, receiving a
      bonus or special ability based on the type of judgment made. The bonuses
      granted by the judgment continue to improve on following rounds, reaching
      a maximum bonus that lasts until the judgment ends. You can use this
      ability once per day. Once activated, this ability lasts until the combat
      ends, at which point all of the bonuses end. You must participate in the
      combat to gain these bonuses. If you are frightened, panicked, paralyzed,
      stunned, unconscious, or otherwise prevented from participating in the
      combat, the ability does not end, but all of the bonuses reset to those
      granted on the first round until you can participate in the combat again.
      When you use this ability, you must select one type of judgment to make.
      As a swift action, you can change this judgment to another type, but doing
      so resets the bonus granted to those granted on the first round. The
      judgments are as follows. Destruction: You are filled with divine wrath,
      gaining a +1 sacred bonus on all weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases
      by +1 each round after the first, to a maximum of +3. Healing: You gain
      fast healing 1. This causes you to heal 1 point of damage each round as
      long as you are alive and the judgment lasts. This increases to fast
      healing 2 on the second round and to fast healing 3 on the third round.
      Justice: The judgment spurs you to seek justice, granting a +1 sacred
      bonus on all attack rolls. This bonus increases by +1 each round after the
      first, to a maximum of +3. Piercing: The judgment grants a +1 sacred bonus
      on concentration checks and caster level checks made to overcome a
      target's spell resistance. This bonus increases by +1 each round after the
      first to a maximum of +3. Protection: You are surrounded by a protective
      aura, granting a +1 sacred bonus to Armor Class. This bonus increases by
      +1 each round after the first, to a maximum of +3. Purity: You are
      protected from the vile taint of your foes, gaining a +1 sacred bonus on
      all saving throws. This bonus increases by +1 each round after the first,
      to a maximum of +3. Resiliency: The judgment makes you resistant to harm,
      granting DR 1/magic. This bonus increases to 2/magic on the second round,
      and 3/magic on the third and following rounds. Resistance: You gain 2
      points of energy resistance against one energy type (acid, cold,
      electricity, fire, or sonic) chosen when the judgment is declared. The
      protection increases to 4 on the second round, and to 6 on the third
      round.
