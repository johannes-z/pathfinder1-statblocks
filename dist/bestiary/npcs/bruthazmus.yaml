DuringCombat: >-
  Bruthazmus reacts to intrusions on his personal time with roars and curses.
  There's a 50% chance he's not wearing his armor if encountered in area D2; in
  any event, he flies into combat with his heavy flail with a murderous glee. He
  attacks elves in preference to any other target.
Morale: >-
  If brought below 15 hit points, Bruthazmus attempts to flee to area D15, where
  he barricades the door and then races downstairs to area E4 to join Nualia,
  hoping to get some healing and then remaining at her side as a bodyguard until
  the PCs are no longer a threat.
