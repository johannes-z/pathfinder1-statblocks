DuringCombat: >-
  Galdron is a force of rage, and he lashes out at the PC he sees as most
  responsible for the conflict with the Aspis Consortium that pushed him over
  the edge. He isolates that PC from allies with a wall of fire. Galdron then
  fights using ranged attacks such as fire breath, fireball, searing light,
  sound burst, or telekinesis, then closes on his primary target to engage in
  melee with his corrupting touch.
Morale: >-
  Galdron's judgment is clouded by his anger, and he fights until destroyed,
  healing himself with inflict critical wounds to prolong the battle. See
  Development below for his actions when reduced to 0 hit points.
