      (55 feet in her hide armor).
  - name: Sacred Site (Ex)
    description: >-
      Vigliv is bound to Grandmother's Cauldron (area A) and was charged by the
      ancient goddess who invested her with power with protecting the grotto
      from harm and preventing intrusion. Should Vigliv ever leave the grotto,
      she loses the divine guardian template unless she atones and reenters the
      site within 1 week. Otherwise, she loses the template permanently and
      takes 6d6 points of Constitution drain as the years catch up to her.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Before revealing herself to visitors to the grotto, Vigliv casts moment of
  prescience.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vigliv attempts to avoid combat, but if forced into it, she tries to
  incapacitate and overcome her foes with spells such as bestow curse, maze,
  repulsion, and time stop  Only if she takes more than 100 points of damage
  does she revert to quickened phantasmal killer, power word kill, weird, and
  her snip thread ability.
Morale: >-
  Vigliv always to tries avoid combat by using dimension door or tree stride to
  jump to one of her rowan's many saplings, using the time she gains to plot her
  retaliation and prepare with spells such as forbiddance and guards and wards.
  Destroying the rowan tree does not harm Vigliv, but she is likely to exact
  retribution on those responsible. If forced into combat and unable to escape,
  Vigliv fights to the bitter end, trying to snip the threads of as many of her
  opponents as possible.
