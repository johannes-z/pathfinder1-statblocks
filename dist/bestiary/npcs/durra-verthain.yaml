  her first attack (she has a 15% spell failure chance to cast these spells
  because of her armor).
Morale: >-
  When reduced to half or fewer hit points, Durra starts to attack the eggs in
  spiteful defiance. The eggs have an AC 5 and 5 hp. She continues attacking the

  PCs again. She then fights until she is dead or otherwise unable to continue.
