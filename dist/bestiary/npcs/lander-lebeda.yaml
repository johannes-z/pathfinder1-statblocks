DuringCombat: >-
  Lander is a showy combatant who delights in performing combat maneuvers, even
  if the situation does not call for it. Unless he has been made friendly, he
  charges into combat without regard for his own safety or for supporting the
  tactics of his allies. If his attitude toward the PCs is friendly or helpful,
  he follows the PCs' suggestions and supports them using flanking and aid
  another actions.
Morale: >-
  Lander may be foolhardy, but he isn't stupid. If reduced to 5 or fewer hit
  points, he attempts to flee, using the PCs as shields as he does so. He drinks
  his potion of cure light wounds if given the chance.
