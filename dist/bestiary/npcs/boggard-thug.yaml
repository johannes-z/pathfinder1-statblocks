    description: >-
      The boggards suffer from paranoia as a result of the vault's midnight
      spores. A paranoid boggard takes a -4 penalty on Will saves and
      Charisma-based skill checks, cannot receive benefit from or attempt the
      aid another action, and cannot willingly accept aid (including healing)
      from another creature unless it makes a DC 22 Will save.
BeforeCombat: The boggards drink their potions of heroism before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The boggards take turns using their terrifying croaks to scare opponents. They
  gang up on single, weak-looking foes if possible, looking for flanking
  opportunities.
Morale: >-
  Afraid of Teka, the boggards fight to the death as long as the priest is
  alive. If Teka is slain, they try to flee the vault. If they cannot escape
  through area H3, they retreat to join the girallons in area H6. If cornered
  there, the boggards fight to the death.
