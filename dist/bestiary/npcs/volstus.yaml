BeforeCombat: >-
  Volstus drinks his potion of protection from good and always calls Akazerath
  to his side before a battle, knowing that teaming up with the dragon makes him
  almost invincible.
DuringCombat: >-
  When battle begins, the Storm Tyrant uses his orb of storms to conjure a storm
  of vengeance, then uses call lighting, chain lightning, wall of fire, and his
  breath weapon while Akazerath uses his own breath weapon. When these magical
  attacks are exhausted, Volstus makes swooping ride-by attacks with his falcata
  while Akazerath makes flyby attacks.
Morale: >-
  All of the Storm Tyrant's plans of conquest hinge on the outcome of his battle
  with the PCs. As a result, he gives no quarter and asks for none, fighting to
  the death. If  Volstus is killed or incapacitated, the dead man's switch in
  his cloud diadem detonates the alchemic bomb in area F3, if it has not yet
  been disabled.
Gear: >-
  potion of barkskin, potions of cure serious wounds (2), potion of protection
  from good
