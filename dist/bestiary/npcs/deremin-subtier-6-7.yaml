BeforeCombat: >-
  As part of a prayer earlier in the day, Deremin has already cast magic
  vestment on his shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Deremin joins the other pirates, at first casting bless and shield of faith
  before striking his enemies with spells and storm burst. Once melee combat is
  inevitable, he casts divine power and always maintains an illusory double with
  copycat. He flanks when possible and uses the trip combat maneuver regularly.
Morale: >-
  If Deremin suspects that he is fighting a losing battle&#8211; whether as a
  result of losing multiple scallywags in one round, being attacked in melee by
  multiple assailants, or simply an uncomfortable hunch&#8211;he casts water
  walk and makes a run for the river. If the PCs cannot threaten him from there,
  he pauses to strike with another spell or two before casting invisibility to
  run away.
Gear: >-
  +1 breastplate, heavy steel shield, mwk rapier, heavy crossbow with 10 bolts,
  cloak of resistance +1, gauntlets of the skilled maneuver (trip)UE, pyxes of
