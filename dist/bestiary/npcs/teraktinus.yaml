  Teraktinus wastes no time in carrying out his own mission. He and his two
  bodyguards make their way through Sandpoint toward the Old Light&#8211;if no
  one stands in their way, they reach the ruins on Round 20. Teraktinus spends 5
  rounds digging through the ruins for a good-sized stone for Mokmurian, then
  sounds the call for retreat with his war horn. If anyone gets in his way, he
  proves quite creative at finding things to throw at his
  enemies&#8211;chimneys, pieces of buildings, and wagons work as well as thrown
  rocks in a pinch. In any event, foes brave enough to stand in his way annoy
  him to such a degree that he abandons his mission long enough to try to kill
  them. If faced with particularly powerful foes, he uses his war horn to summon
  aid (Longtooth if the dragon's still available; or the closest group of giants
  otherwise).
Morale: Teraktinus fights to the death if challenged.
Gear: >-
  +2 hide armor, +1 dwarf bane heavy pick, +1 light pick, ring of protection +1,
