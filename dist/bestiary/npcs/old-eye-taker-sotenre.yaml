  - name: Command Skeletons (Su)

      A dread skeleton can automatically command all normal skeletons within 30
      feet as a free action. Normal skeletons never attack a dread skeleton
      unless compelled.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Old Eye-Taker prefers to let his skeletal bailiffs keep order in the
  courtroom, commanding them to grapple and pin victims so he can extract their
  eyes. This can be done only to a helpless, pinned, or willing character, and
  takes 1 full round to accomplish. Sotenre automatically hits and scores a
  critical hit with his claw. In melee combat, Sotenre lashes out with his
  claws.
Morale: Old Eye-Taker fights until destroyed.
