DuringCombat: >-
  Miyaro uses her mobility to move about the battlefield, looking for the most
  advantageous position from which to make sneak attacks and never staying in
  one spot for long.
Morale: >-
  As a servant of a higher cause, Miyaro is unwilling to throw her life away
  needlessly, and if a battle turns against her, she almost always prefers to
  withdraw and fight another day. She has been tasked with bringing the PCs to
  the kami of the Forest of Spirits, however, and she will fight to the death if
  necessary to ensure her charges safely reach their destination.
