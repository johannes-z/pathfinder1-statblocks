    description: >-
      A rust monster's antennae are a primary touch attack that causes any metal
      object they touch to swiftly rust and corrode. The object touched takes
      half its maximum hp in damage and gains the broken condition-a second hit
      destroys the item. A rust monster never provokes attacks of opportunity by
      attempting to strike a weapon with its antennae. Against creatures made of
      metal, a rust monster's antennae deal 5d6+9 points of damage. An attended
      object, any magic object, or a metal creature can attempt a DC 19 Reflex
      save to negate this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: The alpha rust monsters' actions are determined by the Feed Me! sidebar above.
Morale: >-
  An alpha rust monster does not flee unless it has fed at least twice. Even
  then, it flees only when reduced to 15 or fewer hp.
