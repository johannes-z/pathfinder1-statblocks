SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Correction (Su)
    description: >-
      An aevarut can expend one use of mythic power as a move action to make
      amends to perceived "errors" in continuity by targeting a creature within
      100 feet and changing the course of future events, thereby absorbing the
      potential energy of actions that never happened. The target creature must
      succeed at a DC 26 Will save or become staggered until the end of its next
      turn. In return, the aevarut gains an additional standard or move action
      in the next round of combat. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Erasure (Su)
    description: >-
      When an aevarut successfully deals damage with a slam attack, its target
      must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or be temporarily erased from time for
      1d4 rounds. A creature that fails this save ceases to exist, disappears
      instantly, and cannot be targeted by any spells or effects that attempt to
      reference the creature or interact with it. Such effects fail as if the
      target creature did not exist. After the duration of erasure expires, the
      target reappears exactly where it was as if no time had passed for it (and
      any remaining effects on the creature resume). If that space is occupied,
      it appears in the nearest unoccupied space. A creature that successfully
      saves against an aevarut's erasure ability cannot be affected by the same
      aevarut's erasure for 24 hours. Only a miracle or wish spell can
      prematurely end the effect of erasure. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Horacalcum Vulnerability (Ex)
    description: >-
      An aevarut's damage reduction and regeneration are bypassed by damage from
      horacalcum weapons. Critical threats made by a horacalcum weapon against
      an aevarut are automatically confirmed.
  - name: Out of Time (Su)
    description: >-
      An aevarut is a caretaker of time and can take actions when it would
      normally be affected by time stop. While in an area of a time stop spell,
      an aevarut is free to attack or otherwise interact with any other
      creatures that can act during the duration of the spell.
  - name: Predictive Defense (Su)
    description: >-
      An aevarut adds its Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to its Armor
      Class.
  - name: Ravages of Time (Su)
    description: >-
      An aevarut's aura is disruptive to creatures that experience time in a
      linear direction. A living creature that begins its turn within 30 feet of
      an aevarut must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or become exhausted
      until it leaves the aevarut's aura. A creature that successfully saves
      against ravages of time is immune to the effects of this ability for 24
      hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Slipstream (Su)
    description: >-
      An aevarut can spent one use of mythic power as a swift action to slip
      into the timestream and emerge anywhere within 50 feet. This ability
      overwhelms most teleportation countermeasures such as dimensional anchor.
      When an aevarut activates slipstream, it can attempt a caster level check
      (DC = 11 + the effect's caster level) against each such countermeasure; if
      successful, it ignores that countermeasure for the duration of the effect.
      The aevarut has a 75% chance to ignore any countermeasure that does not
      have a caster level.
  - name: Temporal Anomaly (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a full-round action, an aevarut can expend one use of its
      mythic power to create a temporal anomaly that duplicates any creature it
      can see that whose total number of Hit Dice is no greater than half the
      aevarut's Hit Dice plus half its mythic tier. This is identical to the
      effect of a simulacrum spell, except the duplicate is made entirely of
      sand and shares a telepathic connection to the aevarut across any
      distance. A creature created by this ability lasts for 24 hours or until
      the inevitable dismisses it as a free action, and then collapses into a
      pile of glowing sand. An aevarut may not have more than one temporal
      anomaly active at a time.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Vector uses vision on each of the PCs to learn information about them. Then
  Vector spends 1 point of mythic power to use its temporal anomaly ability to
  create a simulacrum of Sorrina Westyr that contacts the PCs and attempts to
  dissuade them from their mission. Following that conversation, Vector casts
  freedom of movement on itself, haste on itself and its allies, and then gate
  to reach Kandirion's Forge.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vector casts quickened slow on the first round of combat and then uses its
  correction ability on the most heavily armored opponent. It uses slipstream to
  close the distance with spellcasters, and pummels its greatest threats.
