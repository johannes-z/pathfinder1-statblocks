DuringCombat: >-
  As much as possible, Woaltog uses the room to his advantage, stepping in and
  out of the shadows, as well as slipping through the fake portals to the east
  and the west and into the adjoining cloakroom. As he moves about, he uses his
  spell-like abilities to keep foes confused and to summon allies out of
  shadow-stuff.

  Finally free of temporal stasis, Woaltog fights to the death to avoid being
  recaptured.
