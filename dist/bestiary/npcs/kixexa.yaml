  Kixexa casts greater invisibility on herself right away and fills the room
  with quickened fireballs and scorching rays in quick succession. When she has
  expended her fireballs, Kixexa launches quickened scorching rays at those who
  seem most injured by the fire while targeting others with her area effect
  spell-like abilities. Kixexa prefers to fight with her magic, but she attacks
  with her slam attack in melee if she has no other choice.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, Kixexa casts gaseous form and attempts
  to flee, joining Picasi in area H9.
