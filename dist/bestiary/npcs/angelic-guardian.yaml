SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Deflective Wings (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an angelic guardian can spread its wings and protect
      a single adjacent creature from the next ranged attack. The next time the
      protected creature would normally be hit by a ranged attack, the attack is
      instead deflected and the protected creature takes no damage. An angelic
      guardian can only deflect one ranged attack per turn in this way. This
      effect lasts until the angelic guardian's next turn or until the protected
      creature leaves its square, whichever comes first.
  - name: Metallic Feathers (Ex)
    description: >-
      An angelic guardian's wings are honed to razor-sharp edges, and attacks
      with them deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.
DuringCombat: >-
  The angelic guardians use their breath weapons as often as possible in between
  their melee attacks, focusing their attention on whoever currently displays or
  whoever last held Sheila Heidmarch's wayfinder. If attacked by another target,
  however, the guardians defend themselves.
Morale: >-
  Programmed to destroy the Pathfinders of Heidmarch Manor, the angelic
  guardians fight until destroyed.
