    description: >-
      Stirges are harbingers of disease. Any creature subjected to a stirge's
      blood drain attack has a 10% chance of being exposed to filth fever,
      blinding sickness, or a similar disease (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core
      Rulebook, "Diseases"). Once this check is made, the victim can no longer
      be infected by this particular stirge, though attacks by different stirges
      are resolved normally and may result in multiple illnesses.
