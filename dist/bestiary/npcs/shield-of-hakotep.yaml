DuringCombat: >-
  Two of the golems stand adjacent Hakotep, using their guard ability to defend
  him, while the other two advance upon foes, activating their haste ability as
  soon as possible. If hard pressed, Hakotep commands the golems to cast their
  stored boneshatter spells.
Morale: >-
  If one of the golems guarding Hakotep falls, he orders another to replace it,
  if possible. The Shields of Hakotep fight until destroyed.
