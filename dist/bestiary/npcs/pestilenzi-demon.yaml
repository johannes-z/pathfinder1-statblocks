SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Pestilenzi Rot (Su)
    description: >-
      Disease-bite; save Fort DC 14; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6
      Con damage and 1d6 Cha damage; cure -. A creature suffering from
      pestilenzi rot cannot recover naturally over time. Anyone casting a
      conjuration (healing) spell on the afflicted creature must succeed on a DC
      10 caster level check, or the spell is wasted and the healing has no
      effect. Anyone who dies from pestilenzi rot turns to dust and cannot be
      raised without a resurrection or greater magic. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
