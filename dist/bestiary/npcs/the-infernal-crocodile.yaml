DuringCombat: >-
  The Infernal Crocodile casts unholy aura on itself on the first round of
  combat, then lunges from the pool to attack the closest opponent. It seeks the
  most dangerous-looking good foe, particularly one wearing a holy symbol of a
  good deity, and makes a full attack with its smite good ability. It continues
  making full attacks if possible, combined with quickened poison spells. If
  surrounded, the Infernal Crocodile takes flight and casts blasphemy or horrid
  wilting on its foes before returning to melee combat. It saves its destruction
  spell-like ability for use against a single particularly dangerous opponent.
Morale: >-
  When reduced to 125 hit points or fewer, the Infernal Crocodile casts summon
  monster IX to summon 1d3 barbed devils to aid it in battle. Thereafter, the
  Infernal Crocodile fights to the death.
