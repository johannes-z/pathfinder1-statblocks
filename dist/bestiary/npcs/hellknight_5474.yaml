SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Detect Chaos (Sp)
    description: >-
      This ability functions like a paladin's detect evil ability, save that it
      detects chaos.
  - name: Disciplines (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Hellknight has access to two disciplines. Fearsomeness: Twice per day,
      the Hellknight can use the Intimidate skill to cause a creature within 10
      feet to become frightened instead of shaken. Pentamic Faith: The
      Hellknight gains all granted powers of the Law domain (but not domain
      spells), treating his Hellknight level as his cleric level.
  - name: Force of Will (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Hellknight gains a +2 bonus on Will saves against spells with the
      charm descriptor and a +4 bonus against spells with the fear descriptor.
  - name: Hellknight Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Hellknight wears a special type of masterwork full plate called
      Hellknight plate armor. While wearing this armor, he reduces the armor
      check penalty by 2, increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by 2,
      and moves at full speed.
  - name: Smite Chaos (Su)
    description: >-
      This functions as the paladin's smite evil ability, but against
      chaotic-aligned creatures. This ability is twice as effective against
      outsiders with the chaotic subtype, chaotic-aligned aberrations, and fey.
