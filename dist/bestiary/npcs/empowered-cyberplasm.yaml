  - name: Deconstruct (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cyberplasm can mix traces of its own nanites with dead organic material,
      giving the material a semblance of life. As a full-round action, a
      cyberplasm can use this ability to transform a dead Large or smaller
      creature into a quivering blob, transforming it into a hungry flesh
      (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 152). The hungry flesh remains active for 1
      hour before collapsing into a slurry of inert organic material. A
      cyberplasm can use this ability on a hungry flesh it has created in this
      way at any point during the hour to reset the duration.
  - name: Infest (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a cyberplasm can attempt to inhabit a Large or
      smaller corporeal creature. The cyberplasm must move into the target's
      space (dealing swarm damage in the process), and the target must succeed
      at a DC 18 Fortitude save to avoid being infested. An infested creature
      retains its physical ability scores, hit points, natural and special
      attacks, and natural abilities, while the cyberplasm uses its own mental
      ability scores, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and
      mental abilities. The host is considered unconscious while infested, and
      can't take actions or control any of its own abilities as long as the
      cyberplasm inhabits it. While infesting a host, a cyberplasm can't access
      its host's thoughts, skills, or mental abilities, and it loses its swarm
      traits (including immunity to weapon damage) and use of its extraordinary
      abilities. Any damaging attacks or effects affecting the host deals half
      of the damage to the host and half of the damage to the cyberplasm. Any
      electricity damage dealt to the host deals full damage to the host and the
      cyberplasm (and the cyberplasm is still subject to its vulnerability to
      electricity). A cyberplasm deals 1 point of Constitution damage every hour
      it is inside a host. If the cyberplasm reduces its host's Constitution
      score to 0 in this way, the host's body dissolves into gray dust and is
      destroyed (similar to a disintegrate effect). A cyberplasm can end its
      infestation as a move action, appearing in any space adjacent to the
      infested creature. If the host is slain, the cyberplasm is immediately
      ejected and is dazed for 1 round. A remove disease spell has a 50% chance
      to force a cyberplasm from a host, but the creature receives a saving
      throw against this effect. Anytime a creature infested with a cyberplasm
      is subjected to electricity damage, it can attempt another DC 18 Fortitude
      save to eject the cyberplasm. The save DC for this ability is
      Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
  - name: Reconstruct (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cyberplasm can temporarily reshape and repair constructs. As a
      full-round action, a cyberplasm can reactivate a destroyed or inert
      construct by leaving traces of its own nanites within the construct.
      Constructs revived in this way are restored with their full normal hit
      points, but after 1 hour the traces of nanites within the construct become
      inert and the construct is destroyed once again. A cyberplasm can use this
      ability on a construct it has revived at any point during the hour to
      reset the duration.
