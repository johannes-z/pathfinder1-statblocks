    description: >-
      Sting-injury; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2
      Dexterity damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based, and
      includes a +2 racial bonus. Fulvid can sting only once; once it makes a
      successful sting attack, it loses 5 hp per round as if it were
      experiencing a bleed effect. If this bleed is stopped, it does not regain
      its stinger.
DuringCombat: Fulvid attacks whomever Tenzekil commands it to, using bite attacks.
Morale: >-
  If brought to 15 hp or fewer, Fulvid switches to sting attacks. Once it
  successfully stings, it continues with bite attacks until it is dead or
  Tenzekil directs it to stop fighting.
