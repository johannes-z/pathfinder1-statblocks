DuringCombat: >-
  Lyraesia assumes that the PCs have potent defenses against cold and instead
  focuses on using her melee attacks against them (or ranged icicle attacks if
  the PCs avoid melee). She attempts disarm combat maneuvers against PCs once
  per round and focuses her stunning fists on healers, whose arts disgust the
  pain-addicted kyton.
Morale: >-
  The high mistress has lived for thousands of years, and while the concept of
  death and its mysteries intrigue her, that curiosity does not compel her to
  seek its answers. If reduced to fewer than 100 hit points, she realizes the
  PCs are formidable foes and she calls for a truce, using compliments and
  appeals to their prowess in an attempt to secure a momentary respite from
  battle before using dimension door to relocate to a place of safety that
  still  allows communication. If the PCs continue to press the attack, she uses
  dimension door again, this time to retreat up into the upper floors of the
  palace to recover and report the situation to Inkariax. It takes her 2d4 days
  to convince the White Death that the PCs are worth dealing with, and if the
  PCs are still in Frozen Tears at this point, they are confronted by the kyton
  demagogue himself-see page 86 for his statistics and page 13 of the adventure
  for advice on how to handle this perilous situation. If the PCs agree to speak
  with Lyraesia, she thanks them for their wisdom and asks them what their
  purpose is in Frozen Tears. If she learns they seek only to use White Death's
  Diadem as a staging ground for a ritual to enter Belimarius's realm, she is
  intrigued. She won't agree to give the PCs her pendant, but she does volunteer
  to aid them in attacking Lady Wollnoxe to secure the troll's pendant instead.
  In return for the PCs honoring their truce with her, she allows them entrance
  into White Death's Diadem to travel to Xin- Edasseril. She warns them that the
  terms of the truce are over once they do so, and if they ever return to Frozen
  Tears, they will be met with a deadly reception from Inkariax himself. She
  allows the PCs to keep the pendant of the first tears they take from Lady
  Wollnoxe, in any event.
