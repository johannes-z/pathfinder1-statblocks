  If forewarned of the PCs' approach, the guards drink their potions of
  invisibility to begin combat with sneak attacks.

  The guards attempt to flank enemies if possible; if this proves impractical,
  they feint to gain sneak attacks against their enemies.
Morale: >-
  The guards fight to the death as long as Orlicino and Lyone are alive and
  fighting; if both of their leaders fall, flee, or surrender, the remaining
  guards attempt to flee downstairs to seek the protection of the cult. In this
  event, they fall victim to the trap in area D and perish.
