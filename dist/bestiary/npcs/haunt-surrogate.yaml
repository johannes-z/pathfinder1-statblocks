SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      In addition to taking acid damage, any creature harmed by a caustic
      stalker's breath weapon must succeed at an additional DC 20 Fortitude
      saving throw or be affected by caustic creep poison. Caustic
      Creep-inhaled; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4
      Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Chemical Burn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature struck by the caustic stalker, or that strikes it with a
      natural weapon or unarmed attack, is affected as if by the burn special
      attack, but takes acid damage instead of fire damage. The chemical burn
      persists for multiple rounds, just as a normal burn, but can be ended
      early if the affected creature is doused in at least 1 gallon of liquid
      (requiring a full-round action from the victim or another creature) or
      fully submerges itself in water.
  - name: Energy Bolt (Su)
    description: >-
      A haunt surrogate can fire a bolt of energy as a standard action. This
      ranged touch attack has a maximum range of 100 feet and no range
      increment, and it deals 5d6 points of damage. When activating this
      ability, the surrogate chooses whether to deal acid or electricity damage.
  - name: Haunted Form (Su)
    description: >-
      Despite being alive, a haunt surrogate is healed by negative energy and
      harmed by positive energy as if it were an undead creature. It also gains
      a +4 profane bonus to its AC.
  - name: Misty Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A caustic stalker's body is composed of a semisolid chemical mist similar
      to thick foam. The caustic stalker does not have a Strength score and
      cannot manipulate or wear solid objects. This form grants it the amorphous
      defensive ability, and enables it to move through areas as small as 1 inch
      in diameter with no reduction to its speed. A caustic stalker cannot enter
      water or other fluids, and is treated as a creature two size categories
      smaller than its actual size (Tiny for most caustic stalkers) for the
      purposes of how wind affects it.
  - name: Vulnerable to Wind (Ex)
    description: >-
      A caustic stalker takes damage every round that it's exposed to stronger
      than moderate winds: 1d6 points of damage for strong winds, 2d6 points of
      damage for severe winds, and an additional 1d6 points of damage for each
      wind force category beyond severe (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 439). Gust
      of wind is considered severe wind for this ability. A caustic stalker
      cannot use its breath weapon while being affected by stronger than
      moderate winds and for 1 minute afterward.
DuringCombat: >-
  A surrogate uses its breath weapon on the first round of combat, affecting as
  many different creatures as possible. It attacks with slam thereafter, using
  its breath weapon as it becomes available. One aspect flies above the combat,
  arcing electricity at spellcasters and archers. If an aspect is reduced to 30
  hp or less, it flies up and switches to arcing electricity.
Morale: Isirah's aspects fight until destroyed.
