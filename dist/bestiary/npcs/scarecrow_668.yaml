SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fascinating Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Target is fascinated, 30 feet, Will DC 14 negates. Fascination lasts as
      long as the scarecrow is "alive" or remains within 300 feet of the
      fascinated creature. Note that the approach or animation of the scarecrow
      does not count as an obvious threat to the victim of this particular
      fascination effect (although the scarecrow's attack does count as an
      obvious threat and ends the fascination). This is a mind-affecting effect.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      The touch of a scarecrow infuses its target with overwhelming waves of
      fear. If the victim fails a DC 14 Will save, he is cowering and can take
      no actions other than attempting a new DC 14 Will save at the end of the
      following round (and each round thereafter) to throw off the effects of
      this fear. A successful save leaves the victim shaken for 1 round. This is
      a mind-affecting fear effect. The Save DC is Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The scarecrow attacks anyone approaching the hut, focusing its attacks on
  victims of its fascinating gaze.
Morale: The scarecrow fights until destroyed.
