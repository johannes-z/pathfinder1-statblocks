BeforeCombat: Gryne casts false life and mage armor before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Gryne lets her kyton companions engage the PCs in melee while she hangs back
  to utilize her spells on foes at range. She's particularly fond of using
  feeblemind on arcane spellcasters, charm person and suggestion to trick people
  into accepting offers of surgery, and hold person on those who resist such
  offers.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, Gryne casts dimension door to retreat to
  area H6 to have the robot there inject a dose of grade III hemochemTG into her
  body while she drinks her healing potions, after which she moves through the
  secret passage to area H7 to report to her master Krimox (and perhaps beg for
  more healing) and to fight at his side if the PCs challenge him&#8211;in this
  case, she fights to the death.
