SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear of Fire (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shriezyx within 30 feet of a fire the size of a torch or larger becomes
      shaken as long as it remains within that range. If damaged by fire, a
      shriezyx must make a successful Will save (DC equals the amount of fire
      damage dealt) or become frightened for 1 round.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2
      Str; cure 1 save.
  - name: Slowing Toxin (Su)
    description: >-
      A shriezyx's web is coated with a toxin that deadens the nerves on
      contact. Any creature struck by a shriezyx's web must succeed at a DC 14
      Fortitude save or become slowed (as per the spell) for 1 minute. Each
      round, a victim may attempt a new DC 14 Fortitude save to end the effect
      early. This toxin fades quickly from spun webs-it can only affect targets
      on the round the web is spun. Existing webs, while they remain sticky and
      tangled, do not have this slowing effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The shriezyx work together, using their webs at first to slow down enemies and
  then ganging up to flank foes still able to reach them. Any creature that uses
  fire against them earns both monsters' wrath, and assuming they can avoid
  becoming frightened, they focus all their attacks on these foes to the
  exclusion of others.
