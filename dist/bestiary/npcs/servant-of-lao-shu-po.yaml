SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bane (Su)
    description: >-
      The inquisitor can imbue one weapon she holds with the bane weapon special
      ability as a swift action. She must select one creature type when she uses
      this ability (and a subtype if the creature type selected is humanoid or
      outsider). Once selected, the type can be changed as a swift action. This
      ability only functions while the inquisitor wields the weapon. If dropped
      or taken, the weapon resumes granting this ability if it is returned to
      the inquisitor before the duration expires. The 9 rounds per day this
      ability may be used need not be consecutive.
  - name: Judgment (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, the inquisitor can pronounce judgment upon her foes
      as a swift action. Starting when the judgment is made, the inquisitor
      receives a bonus or special ability based on the type of judgment she
      made. When pronouncing judgment, the inquisitor can choose two judgments
      simultaneously, expending only a single use of the power. The inquisitor
      must participate in the combat to gain these bonuses. If the inquisitor is
      either frightened, panicked, paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise
      prevented from participating in the combat, the ability does not end, but
      the bonuses do not resume until she can participate in the combat again.
      Justice: This judgment spurs the inquisitor to seek justice, granting a +2
      sacred bonus on all attack rolls. Protection: This judgment surrounds the
      inquisitor with a protective aura, granting a +2 sacred bonus to her Armor
      Class.
  - name: Solo Tactics (Ex)
    description: >-
      All of the inquisitor's allies are treated as if they possessed the same
      teamwork feats as the inquisitor for the purpose of determining whether
      the inquisitor receives a bonus from her teamwork feats. Her allies do not
      receive any bonuses from these feats unless they actually possess the
      feats themselves. The allies' positioning and actions must still meet the
      prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for the inquisitor to receive
      the listed bonus.
  - name: Swarming (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ratfolk are used to living and fighting communally, and are adept at
      swarming foes for their own gain and their foes' detriment. Up to two
      ratfolk can share the same square at the same time. If two ratfolk in the
      same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that
      foe as if they were in two opposite squares.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If she has time to prepare for combat, the inquisitor drinks her potion of
  barkskin, casts heroism, and reads a scroll of false life (Use Magic Device DC
  22). Then she casts deeper darkness on a pebble and puts it in her pocket to
  mask the effect.
DuringCombat: >-
  At the start of combat, the servant of Lao Shu Po activates her justice and
  protection judgments as a swift action, and then pulls the pebble out of her
  pocket and drops it, relying on her eyes of darkness domain power to see
  through the dark. She withdraws as her special vision expires, attacking her
  foes as they leave the area of magical darkness. The servant of Lao Shu Po
  prefers to attack lightly-armored targets and makes heavy use of her bane
  special attack.
Morale: >-
  Dedicated to her goddess and the Undying Empress, the servant of Lao Shu Po
  fights to the death.
Gear: potion of barkskin, potion of cure moderate wounds, scrolls of false life (2)
