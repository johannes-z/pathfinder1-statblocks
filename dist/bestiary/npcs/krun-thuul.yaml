BeforeCombat: >-
  When Krun is about to enter battle, he uses Intimidate to shake up his foes
  and orders his followers into a battle line. Typically, he brings an orc
  cleric onto the battlefield as his cohort to cast spells that improve his
  fighting ability, such as bless.
DuringCombat: >-
  Krun uses reach to his advantage. He shifts about the battlefield, relying on
  his minions to block opponents while he steps into areas that will allow his
  reach to strike enemies with impunity. If an enemy closes past his reach, he
  batters the opponent with armor spikes but steps away as soon as an opening is
  available. He uses Improved Trip with his guisarme to knock down advancing
  opponents and then makes attacks of opportunity when they stand up within his
  reach.
Morale: >-
  If confronted by a clearly superior opponent, or one that he can't easily
  harm, he runs away. He also flees if an opponent reduces him to 20 hit points
  or fewer or a single attack deals him 20 or more points of damage. Thanks to
  his armor training and his Run feat, Krun can usually outrun his opponents. He
  sacrifices his own troops to achieve a significant victory or save his own
  life.
