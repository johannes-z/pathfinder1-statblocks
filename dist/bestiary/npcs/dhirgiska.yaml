SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bloodspray (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a creature sunders one of a miasma hydra's heads, strikes it with
      a melee attack that does bleed damage, or confirms a successful critical
      hit against the miasma hydra with a melee piercing or slashing weapon, the
      creature must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or be affected by the
      miasma hydra's poison as though it had been bitten.
  - name: Breath Weapon (Ex)
    description: >-
      A miasma hydra's breath weapon is identical in effect to cloudkill, except
      that it has a duration of instantaneous, covers a 15-foot-cone area, and
      is usable every 1d4 rounds by each of the miasma hydra's heads. A creature
      in the area of multiple breaths in the same round must make multiple
      saves, but can only be affected by the cloudkill effect once per round.
  - name: Fast Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A miasma hydra's fast healing ability is equal to its current number of
      heads (minimum fast healing 12). This fast healing applies only to damage
      dealt to the miasma hydra's body.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
