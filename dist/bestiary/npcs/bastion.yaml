SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Construct Bane (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bastion deals an additional 2d6 points of damage to constructs and undead
      created by feats or spells.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      Bastion is immune to and absorbs any spell or spell-like ability that
      allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against it, as detailed below. &#8226; Magical electricity
      damage slows Bastion for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. If hasted,
      magical electricity attacks instead negate the haste effect. &#8226;
      Mage's disjunction staggers Bastion and negates its impeded magic ability
      for 1d4 rounds.
  - name: Impeded Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      A spellcaster within 60 feet of Bastion must succeed at a concentration
      check (DC 25 + the level of the spell being cast) to successfully cast a
      spell-if this check fails, Bastion absorbs the spell.
  - name: Spell Absorption (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever Bastion absorbs a spell, it heals 5 points of damage per spell
      level. Healing in excess of its normal hit point maximum grants it
      temporary hit points. Absorbing a spell gives the golem the benefits of
      haste for 1 round per spell level.
  - name: Spell Sunder (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature struck by Bastion's slam attack is targeted by dispel magic (CL
      18th). Bastion absorbs any spells so sundered.
DuringCombat: >-
  Bastion doesn't address the PCs at all&#8211;it's tightly focused on its job
  to defend the security sector's control center. It doesn't pursue foes from
  this room.
Morale: Bastion fights until destroyed.
