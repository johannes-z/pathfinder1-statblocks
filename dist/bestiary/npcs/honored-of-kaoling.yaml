BeforeCombat: >-
  The honored of Kaoling depends on his mount to track down foes. If a fight
  seems likely, he casts bull's strength and magic weapon.
DuringCombat: >-
  The honored of Kaoling moves to be adjacent to the most powerful foe as soon
  as possible, preferring to fight in melee without his mount. If this isn't a
  realistic option, he remains mounted and uses his longbow. If badly injured,
  the honored of Kaoling seeks to fall back long enough for his regeneration to
  heal him.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds
