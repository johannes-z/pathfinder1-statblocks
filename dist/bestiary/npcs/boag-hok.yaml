SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Force Fangs (Su)
    description: >-
      When Boag-Hok attacks with its bite, its fangs are made of magical force.
      On a hit, it inflicts 5d6 points of force damage, modified by 1-1/2 times
      its Charisma modifier.
  - name: Vaporous Body (Ex)
    description: >-
      Boag-Hok can pass through small holes, even cracks, without reducing its
      speed. It cannot enter water or other liquid. It has no Strength score,
      and it cannot manipulate objects other than to bite them.
DuringCombat: >-
  Boag-Hok begins combat by casting unholy blight, then flows out through the
  gaps in the bars t o cast poison on its foes and attack with its bite. It
  casts darkness if it's surrounded and reduced to fewer than 30 hit points,
  using the cover to escape back to a distance, after which it relies upon
  making bite attacks with Flyby Attack to prevent full attacks against itself.
Morale: Boag-Hok fights to the death.
