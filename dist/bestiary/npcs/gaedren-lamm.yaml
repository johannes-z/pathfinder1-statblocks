  - name: Limping Gait (Ex)
    description: >-
      Age has not treated Gaedren well. Although his mind remains sharper than
      ever, his body is failing. The most significant manifestation of Gaedren's
      long life of crime is his limp; an old wound to his left leg reduces his
      base speed to 15 feet. This, combined with the way his old age reduces his
      physical ability scores, reduces his overall CR to 2.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Although he is much higher level than the PCs, Gaedren's age has all but
  crippled him. He's aware of his flaws and limitations, but his bitter and
  cruel personality gets the better of his judgment. His first act in combat is
  to fire a crossbow bolt at Gobblegut-assuming he hits, the sudden pain drives
  the cantankerous alligator into a frenzy. Gaedren then turns his crossbow on
  the PCs, remaining away from the edge of the pool and hoping that Gobblegut
  takes care of the PCs. He switches to his dagger only if confronted in melee.
Morale: >-
  Although unwilling to give up his latest home, Gaedren knows when he's in
  trouble. If reduced to fewer than 6 hit points, he tries to escape to one of
  the skiffs tied to the hidden walkway in area A12 to row away. Of course, if
  Gobblegut is riled up, navigating the walkway around the alligator's den might
  just be the last thing Gaedren does. It's unlikely that Gaedren can escape the
  PCs, but if he does, they may well have secured a significant recurring enemy-
  see What If Gaedren Escapes? on page 27 for more details.
