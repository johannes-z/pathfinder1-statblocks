IsTemplate: 0
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Helekhterie activates her coat of many stars revelation and then casts
  protection from good. Her statistics have not been adjusted for these effects.
DuringCombat: >-
  Helekhterie initiates combat by using her interstellar void revelation on an
  apparent enemy spellcaster. She then focuses on incapacitating heavily armored
  opponents with color spray or turning them against their own allies with
  murderous command.
Morale: >-
  Once Helekhterie is reduced to 40 hp, she withdraws from combat and quaffs her
  potion of fly at the next opportunity. Helekhterie then retreats to the air
  and counts on her vampiric mist allies to finish off her foes. If reduced to
  20 hp or fewer (or if her vampiric mist allies are defeated before or while
  she is flying), Helekhterie flies out of the opening in the ceiling and
  attempts to escape.
Gear: >-
  potion of fly, spellguard bracersUE, wand of air breathing (3 charges), wand
  of expeditious retreat (26 charges)
