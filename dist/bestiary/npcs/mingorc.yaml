DuringCombat: >-
  Mingorc stands in the center of the room, where he has fallen into a torpor.
  The undead giant remains motionless for 2 rounds after any PCs come into view,
  after which point he rouses and attacks. If the PCs attack before this, they
  gain an automatic surprise round before Mingorc reacts normally.
Morale: >-
  Mingorc pursues foes throughout the donjon, but will not exit the structure.
  Otherwise, he fights until destroyed.
