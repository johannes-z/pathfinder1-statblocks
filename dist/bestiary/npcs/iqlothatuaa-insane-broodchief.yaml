    description: >-
      Iq'lothatuaa suffers from schizophrenia, and can no longer tell the
      difference between what is real and what is not. He takes a -4 penalty on
      all Wisdom- and Charisma-based skill checks, and cannot take 10 or 20.
      Each time he finds himself in a stressful situation (such as combat), he
      must make a DC 16 Will save or become confused for 1d6 rounds (Pathfinder
      RPG GameMastery Guide 251).
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Iq'lothatuaa activates his guarded stance rage power, and if necessary, uses
  his defending greataxe to further protect himself. In battle, Iq'lothatuaa
  uses his knockback rage power to make bull rushes. While raging, Iq'lothatuaa
  will pursue fleeing enemies even into area F25.
Morale: Iq'lothatuaa fights until slain.
