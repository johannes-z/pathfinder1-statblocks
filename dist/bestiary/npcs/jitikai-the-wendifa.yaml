SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Connaissance (Su)
    description: >-
      You can spend a full-round action to attune yourself to the spirit world,
      gaining the benefit of a moment of prescience spell with the insight bonus
      equal to half your oracle level (minimum 1). You can use this ability a
      number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), but
      you can have only one connaissance effect active at a time.
  - name: Ensnare the Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      Your magic turns others into zombie-like servants. Add charm person and
      dominate person to your spell list. Creatures affected by either spell
      become listless and pale, appearing dead to observers (Heal or Perception
      DC 20 to determine the creature is not undead). Affected creatures are
      slow to take any action unless you specifically direct them to take a
      particular action. They are not mindless or helpless, however, and defend
      themselves if attacked. Summon Nature's
  - name: Spirits (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day, as a standard action, you can cast a summon monster spell of
      a level up to the highest level you can cast. You can summon only
      elementals in this manner, but are treated as having the Augment Summoning
      feat when you do so.
