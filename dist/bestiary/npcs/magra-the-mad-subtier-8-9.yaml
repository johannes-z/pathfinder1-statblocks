BeforeCombat: >-
  Magra has already cast shield other on Kogan. If the PCs failed to surprise
  the wily orc, he also casts sanctuary on himself before he attempts his
  extortion (not reflected in his stat block).
DuringCombat: >-
  If one of the PCs fights Kogan, during the fight Magra skulks into one of the
  side tunnels and casts healing spells to heal the damage he sustains through
  shield other. If the PCs fight all of the orcs, Magra uses his highest level
  summon monster spell to create a barrier between himself and the PCs. He then
  casts a silence spell on Kogan to hamper spellcasting PCs before ducking back
  into a side tunnel to heal his wounds from shield other. If need be, he also
  casts healing spells on Kogan while attempting to stay out of the PCs' sight.
  As a last resort, Magra uses his offensive spells.
Morale: >-
  Magra fights until reduced below 0 hit points, at which point he attempts to
  flee to the east, heal the worst of his wounds, and escape into the labyrinth
  of tunnels.
