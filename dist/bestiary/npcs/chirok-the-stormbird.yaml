SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Lighted Way (Su)
    description: >-
      At will, an ercinee can shed drops of luminous fluid from its wings. This
      liquid falls behind it as it flies, with one droplet falling every 25
      feet. These droplets illuminate the area within 5 feet of where they land
      with dim light. This fluid lasts for 1 hour, after which it evaporates to
      nothing.
  - name: Radiance (Su)
    description: >-
      At night, an ercinee sheds light as the daylight spell. It can activate or
      suppress this ability as a free action.
  - name: Unstable Screech (Su)
    description: >-
      An ercinee can, as a standard action, emit a shrill and bewildering
      screech. Any creature within 30 feet of the ercinee must make a DC 15 Will
      save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. Creatures who succeed at this save
      cannot be affected again by the same ercinee's screech for 24 hours.
      Creatures that are already confused take a -2 penalty on their save to
      resist additional unstable screeches. This is a mind-affecting effect. The
      save DC is Wisdom-based.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Upon seeing intruders in her nest, the ercinee becomes enraged and uses her
  unstable screech before swooping in for the kill, trying to knock the
  assailants away from her clutch with flyby attacks and rays of searing light.
Morale: >-
  Chirok fights to the death to defend her nest. If the PCs simply pilfer a
  feather and flee, however, she stays to defend her nest and doesn't pursue the
  intruders.
