BeforeCombat: >-
  When the PCs open the well from area 2, the gargoyles are alerted, and
  Razorcraw applies 3 doses of purple worm poison to the blades of his double
  axe and horns.
DuringCombat: >-
  Razorcraw allows his gargoyles to lead the attack as they are better fliers
  than he is. He waits for one PC to separate himself from the others and swoops
  to attack that one while away from help. If such an opportunity does not
  present itself, Razorcraw instead attempts to flank a fighter with one of his
  gargoyles and poison him as many times as possible with his attacks.
Morale: >-
  Razorcraw surrenders if reduced below 15 hit points and escape doesn't seem
  possible.
Gear: 6 doses of purple worm poison
