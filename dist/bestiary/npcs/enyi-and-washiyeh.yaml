BeforeCombat: >-
  Fatima's bodyguards open battle by throwing back their hoods, brandishing
  their falchions, and using Dazzling Display to intimidate their enemies.
DuringCombat: >-
  Enyi always fights the strongest-looking foe that has not been made shaken.
  Washiyeh is a cruel bully and prefers to target foes who seem weak. Both
  half-dragons usually wait until they can line up two or more enemies before
  using their lightning breath.
Morale: >-
  As long as Fatima is not in danger, Enyi and Washiyeh take wing to escape if
  the situation goes badly. If she is present, one of the two will snatch her up
  and flee while the other stays behind to draw attacks before fleeing as well.
