  The two undead serpentfolk stand on the bridge and hurl javelins at any
  targets they notice in the room below. Once the skeletons have thrown all of
  their javelins (or if enemies try to leave the room or take cover in the
  alcoves to the north), they step off the bridge and fall 40 feet to the
  ground, taking 4d6 points of damage but rising to continue the fight with foes
  below using their claws and bites.
Morale: The serpentfolk skeletons fight until destroyed.
