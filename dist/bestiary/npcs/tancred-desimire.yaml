SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Damned (Ex)
    description: >-
      When Tancred is killed, his soul is instantly claimed by the Abyss. In
      time, his soul is transformed into a demon appropriate to the greatest
      sins he gloried in while he lived. Any character attempting to resurrect
      Tancred must succeed at a DC 13 caster level check or the spell fails.
      That character cannot attempt to resurrect Tancred again until the
      following day, though other characters can attempt to do so if they
      please.
  - name: Demonic Mark (Ex)
    description: >-
      Tancred bears Shax's symbol as a tattoo-like brand. Once per day, Tancred
      can call upon the profane power of his mark to power a spell, giving it
      the chaotic and evil descriptors. The spell is not expended as it is cast,
      allowing Tancred to cast it again later.
  - name: Energumen (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Tancred Desimire can open his soul to a demonic spirit as a
      free action. The spirit possesses him for 3 rounds, granting a +2 profane
      bonus to his Constitution. When this possession effect ends, Tancred
      becomes confused for a number of rounds equal to his demoniac level. At
      the start of each round of confusion, Tancred can attempt a DC 25 Will
      save to end the effect immediately. Energumen is negated by protection
      from evil or protection from chaos. Tancred (or the PCs) can prevent or
      end the confusion side effect by having one of these spells cast upon him
      when (or before) this ability ends, but being affected by such a spell
      before this ability has run its course also causes the benefits to end
      prematurely. Killer's
  - name: Finesse (Sp)
    description: >-
      Tancred's demonic boon from Shax allows him to cast invisibility twice per
      day as a spell-like ability.
Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: transmutation, enchantment
BeforeCombat: >-
  This morning, Tancred cast extended mage armor and performed his obedience to
  Shax. Before the PCs ascend the stairs to area C3, he drinks a potion of
  bear's endurance, a potion of cat's grace, and a potion of bull's strength,
  followed by casting fire shield. If he has the time he also uses a scroll of
  greater magic weapon on his cane.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Tancred casts haste, including any of his allies
  in range. He then casts black tentacles on the ground floor, followed by
  summon monster V to summon 1d3 fiendish dire wolves. If threatened, he uses
  his scroll of displacement and then he uses his energumen special ability to
  boost his Constitution score.
Morale: If reduced below 10 hit points, Tancred flees using teleport.
