    description: >-
      Glorfan's prolonged exposure to waters of Lamashtu left him with a number
      of deformities. He gains two claw attacks and one bite attack, fast
      healing 1, and unnaturally tough skin, and is exceptionally large for a
      goblin. As a result, his CR is 1 higher than normal.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Glorfan knows the PCs are coming, he hides with his assistant behind the
  boxes on the east wall, ready to ambush the PCs.
DuringCombat: Glorfan attacks the nearest PC and does so throughout the combat.
Morale: >-
  His size, strength, and unnatural healing has given Glorfan too much
  confidence. He is not afraid of anything and fights to the death.
