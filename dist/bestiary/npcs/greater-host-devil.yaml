SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Infernal Wound (Ex)
    description: >-
      The damage a magaav deals with its claws or rend causes a persistent
      wound. An injured creature loses 1 additional hit point each round. The
      wound does not heal naturally and resists healing spells. The continuing
      hit point loss can be stopped by a DC 16 Heal check or any spell that
      cures hit point damage; casting a curative spell on the injured creature
      requires a successful DC 15 caster level check, otherwise the spell has no
      effect. The check DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Master Grappler (Ex)
    description: >-
      A magaav can wield a weapon and still make grapple checks. If it's not
      wielding a weapon, a magaav gains a +4 bonus on grapple checks.
  - name: Noxious Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a magaav can exhale a breath that reeks of pure
      corruption upon a creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 16
      Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution
      based. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same
      magaav's noxious breath for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison
      spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with
      immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison
      receive their normal bonuses on their saving throws. Once a magaav uses
      its breath weapon, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The magaav has already used its summon devil ability for the day, summoning
  gaavs to explore the surrounding territory.
DuringCombat: >-
  The magaav is a tactical fighter and attempts to attack the weakest PC
  (wearing light or no armor, has obvious wounds, etc.) each round.
Morale: >-
  The magaav fights until brought below 5 hit points and then attempts to fly
  away. If successful, the magaav returns to area F4 where the PCs encounter it
  later.
