SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Prayer Attack (Su)
    description: >-
      To initiate a prayer attack, a Red Mantis assassin holds her sawtooth
      sabre (or sabres) out, point down, and weaves the blade in the air. She
      must be within 30 feet of and visible to her victim. Beginning a prayer
      attack is a standard action, and causes her victim to be fascinated by her
      unless he succeeds at a DC 16 Will save. She can maintain the fascination
      effect by concentrating. The victim can attempt a new save to escape
      fascination each time a threat (other than the assassin) appears. At any
      point after 3 rounds, the assassin can make a coup de grace attack against
      the target, provided the target is still fascinated. Activating or
      concentrating on maintaining a prayer attack does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity.
  - name: Red Shroud (Su)
    description: >-
      A Red Mantis assassin can create a veil of red mist two times per day as a
      move action. The red shroud persists for 3 rounds. It grants a +1 dodge
      bonus to Armor Class and fast healing 2. This mist cannot be dissipated by
      wind. If she is slain while this ability is active, she can choose whether
      to remain corporeal or to disintegrate into a cloud of red mist that
      leaves behind only her gear in order to deprive her enemies of access to
      her remains.
BeforeCombat: >-
  As soon as the assassins realize someone's entering the house, they each drink
  a potion of resist fire and a potion of bull's strength, cast magic weapon on
  their blades, and spend charges from their masks to activate all of the masks'
  abilities (using the effects of deathwatch at day or darkvision at night).
  They then remain hidden until they are spotted or until at least one PC climbs
  the stairs up to area A7.
DuringCombat: >-
  The assassins are outnumbered, but they've got a deadly advantage: just as in
  their previous attempt to slay Vencarlo, they crept into the ambush site early
  and prepared the place with distilled alchemist's fire. On the first round of
  combat, each assassin throws a vial of alchemist's fire at the fireplace on
  her level, causing flames to burst out and quickly light the room on fire. The
  3 squares the fireplace takes up are now burning-each round, the fire spreads
  quickly to 1d4 adjacent squares. A character in a square that is on fire takes
  1d6 points of fire damage and must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or catch on
  fire. The Red Mantis assassins need not fear the fire as long as their potions
  last, and they use the fire to their advantage as they are able. Once the
  battle begins, the assassins each activate their red shroud ability and make
  an effort to reach each other so they can team up and flank foes. If the
  assassins begin combat with only one PC in sight, an assassin attempts to use
  his prayer attack on that PC before starting his fire.
Morale: The assassins fight to the death.
