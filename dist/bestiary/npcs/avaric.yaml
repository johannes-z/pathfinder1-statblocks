BeforeCombat: >-
  At the start of the day, Avaric implants the mesmeric mirror trick in himself
  and the vision of blood trick in his two bodyguards in area B14. If given
  forewarning, Avaric casts false life, see invisibility, and dons his mask of
  the mesmeristOA if not already wearing it. The adjustment for false life has
  not been included in this stat block.
DuringCombat: >-
  He uses greater command and hold person to eliminate dangerous melee threats
  before closing in to deal with spellcasters with his rapier and his sapped
  magic bold stare. If outmatched, he uses enervation to make the fight costly
  for his enemies.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 50 hp, Avaric casts invisibility and becomes gaseous in order to
  get to the dungeon and area B24 specifically. Once inside, he attempts to
  recover his vigor with fast healing.
Gear: >-
  +3 glamered breastplate, +3 keen rapier, amulet of natural armor +2, belt of
  incredible dexterity +4, cloak of resistance +4, headband of alluring charisma
