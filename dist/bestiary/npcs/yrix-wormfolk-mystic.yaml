SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Goblin Breath (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a goblin snake can release a disgusting belch. Any
      creature within 5 feet of the goblin snake must succeed on a DC 13
      Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by
      the same goblin snake's goblin breath for 24 hours. A delay poison or
      neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature.
      Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant
      to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.
  - name: Snake Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability functions similarly to a druid's wild empathy ability, but
      allows a goblin snake to verbally communicate with and be understood by
      snakes and similar serpentine reptiles. The base check equals the goblin
      snake's racial Hit Dice plus her Charisma modifier, and includes a +4
      racial bonus.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  If attacked, Yrix uses her Lunge feat to attack an opponent normally out of
  her reach, followed by her goblin breath to sicken as many opponents as
  possible. After a successful bite attack, she tries to Bluff opponents into
  thinking her bite is poisonous, offering an "antidote" if they agree to cease
  hostilities.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 7 hit points or fewer, Yrix shrieks and tries to flee through
  the door to area 18 and thence down the stairs.
