BeforeCombat: Muminah casts bless on the party and bull's strength on Bega.
DuringCombat: >-
  Muminah stays in the back and uses channel positive energy to heal her crew.
  She uses her Selective Channeling feat to keep the two most hurt PCs out of
  the blast of positive energy. Should a PC get close to her, she uses her next
  action to cast cause fear on that PC and if that fails, casts sanctuary. When
  not healing, she hits Bega's target with searing light.
Morale: Muminah is a brave adventurer and Pathfinder&#8211;she fights to the death.
