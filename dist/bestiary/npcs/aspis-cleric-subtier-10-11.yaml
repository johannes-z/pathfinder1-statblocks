BeforeCombat: >-
  The cleric has used his touch of glory ability on himself to increase his
  chances of success when intimidating foes, and has also cast bull's strength
  and entropic shield on himself, magic weapon on his weapon, and magic vestment
  on his armor. In addition, he casts his spell immunity spells to grant
  immunity to magic missile and fireball.
DuringCombat: >-
  The cleric enters a battle rage, wades into combat, and fights furiously,
  using spells like bane and blindness to hinder foes, as well as spiritual
  weapon to combat those he himself is not attacking with his melee weapon. If
  necessary he uses his positive energy to heal himself or allies. He uses
  breath of life to restore life to recently slain allies, and righteous might
  if possible and he feels the odds are not in his favor otherwise.
Morale: >-
  Unwilling to admit defeat so quickly, the cleric only retreats if his allies
  fall and he is the only one left.
