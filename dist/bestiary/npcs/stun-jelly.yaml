SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stunjelly secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material
      quickly, but does not affect metal or stone. Any melee hit deals acid
      damage, and the opponent's clothing and armor (non-metal only) take the
      same amount of damage unless they succeed on DC 18 Reflex save. A wooden
      weapon that strikes a stunjelly takes 1d6 acid damage unless it succeeds
      on a DC 18 Reflex save. If a stunjelly remains in contact with a wooden
      object for 1 full round, it inflicts 18 points of damage (no save) to the
      object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    description: >-
      Since a stunjelly looks like normal stone when at rest, it takes a DC 20
      Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in
      Survival or Knowledge (dungeoneering) can use one of those skills instead
      of Perception to notice the stunjelly. Dwarves can use stonecunning to
      notice a stunjelly.
  - name: Corrosion (Ex)
    description: >-
      An opponent that is being engulfed by a stunjelly suffers a -4 penalty on
      Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing and armor.
