    description: >-
      The bone reaper reflection takes no damage from fire attacks; instead,
      fire heals the reaper one hit point for every 3 points of damage
      inflicted, and breaks any slow effects. At least 5 points of electrical
      damage in a single attack slows the reaper for 1 round. It is affected by
      rust attacks normally. It is immune to all other spells and effects that
      would not affect a golem. Finally, any damage that is done to the statue
      anchoring the bone reaper is also inflicted upon the bone reaper
      reflection (and vice versa).

    description: >-
      The bone reaper can only be directly attacked by viewing its reflection
      and striking blindly at where it would be from that view. This incurs a -4
      circumstance penalty to attack rolls and CMB checks and a -2 circumstance
      penalty to AC against its attacks. Note that this is not invisibility, and
      see invisibility or even true seeing does not allow one to look directly
      at the bone reaper reflection's effective location.
