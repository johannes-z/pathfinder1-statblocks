Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Enga is brave and fearless, despite (or perhaps due to) her small stature. She
  rages on the first round of combat and focuses her anger on healers first and
  foremost.
Morale: >-
  Enga flees to the southwest if reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, hoping to
  lose her tormenters in the mazelike region. If she's got a few rounds, she
  rigs a quick but deadly trap by removing her necklace of fireballs (but
  keeping one bead) and leaving it on the ground. She then moves about 60 feet
  away and waits; once she sees someone reach the necklace, she throws her bead
  and detonates the entire necklace at once. She then doubles back to area B7a
  via a different route and seeks out one of the lamias in area B13 for aid.
