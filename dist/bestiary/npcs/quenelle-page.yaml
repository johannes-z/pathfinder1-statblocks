  Quenelle is an excellent tactician, and despite her heavy armor does her best
  to stay mobile in fights, attempting to flank foes with her underlings or
  trying to force enemies to move to keep up with her to deny them full attacks.
  In lieu of making full attacks herself, Quenelle uses Vital Strike and Power
  Attack. She's not afraid to use Improved Sunder on weapons, particularly if
  their wielders seems particularly good at dealing damage with them.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, Quenelle makes a fighting retreat up
  the stairs to area M1, calling any surviving Gray Maidens to her side to cover
  her retreat. Her goal is to reach Commander Oriana or, preferably, "Sorshen,"
  to gain additional support in defeating the PCs. Otherwise, she fights to the
  death.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds
OtherGear: masterwork full plate, masterwork heavy steel shield, +1 longsword, 215 gp
