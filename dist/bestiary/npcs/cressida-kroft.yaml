DuringCombat: >-
  Cressida prefers to fight in melee if possible, saving her arrows for foes who
  avoid hand-to-hand combat. In a fight, Cressida uses Power Attack (taking a -3
  penalty on attack rolls but gaining a +6 bonus on damage rolls); if she misses
  a foe entirely for 2 rounds of combat, though, she switches back to regular
  attacks.
Morale: >-
  Cressida prefers to save her potion of cure moderate wounds to aid allies, but
  if she's reduced to fewer than 20 hit points and escape isn't an option, she
  drinks the potion and fights defensively until the odds change in her favor or
  she sees an opportunity to escape. She won't abandon friends or her
  subordinates to certain death; if presented with overwhelming odds, she works
  with allies to make a fighting retreat to safety, but brings up the rear
  herself, and is willing to give up her life to buy her allies a chance to
  flee.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds
