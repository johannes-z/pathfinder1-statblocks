DuringCombat: >-
  Although Vale pays little attention to how much damage he takes during a
  fight, he certainly doesn't fight recklessly. He approaches battle with a
  wide-eyed excitement, viewing each fight as a puzzle to be solved with mind
  and steel. He has a knack for seeking out subtle tactical advantages (higher
  ground, flanking, cover, and the like) that serve him well. Vale prefers to
  fight with a battleaxe and handaxe, and once an enemy is engaged, he makes
  Power Attacks unless he can't quite hit foes with his secondary attacks. He
  views his greatest flaw as his lack of talent in finesse fighting, and when he
  grows too overconfident, he often makes trip, disarm, and flanking attacks
  that provoke a dangerous number of attacks of opportunity.
Morale: >-
  If Vale is left on his own, the concept of retreat would never occur to him.
  He becomes so enthralled with the battle that he loses track of his own
  well-being.
