  - name: Lure (Su)
    description: >-
      At any point that the leucrotta's targets are unaware of it (for example,
      if the leucrotta is hiding or concealed in darkness), the leucrotta can
      call out to the targets, who must be in line of sight and within 60 feet.
      When the leucrotta calls out, the targets must make a DC 16 Will save or
      fall under the effects of a suggestion to approach the sound of the
      leucrotta's voice. This effect functions identically to a mass suggestion
      spell with a caster level equal to the leucrotta's Hit Dice. A creature
      that saves cannot be affected again by the same leucrotta's lure for 24
      hours. The lure is a language-dependant effect, and if the leucrotta uses
      the victim's name during the lure, the victim suffers a -4 penalty on his
      saving throw. This is a sonic mindaffecting charm effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Powerful Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A leucrotta's bite attack always applies 1.5 times its Strength modifier
      to damage and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19&#8211;20. Against
      objects, a leucrotta's bite treats the object as having a hardness of 5
      less than the object's actual hardness rating.
  - name: Voice Mimicry (Ex)
    description: >-
      A leucrotta can perfectly imitate the voice of any creature it has heard
      talking. It makes a Bluff check when using voice mimicry&#8211;listeners
      may oppose this Bluff with Sense Motive checks to see through the mimicry,
      although if the listener isn't familiar with the voice of the person being
      mimicked, he suffers a &#8211;8 penalty on his Sense Motive check to
      oppose the leucrotta's Bluff. Leucrottas find it difficult to mimic the
      voices of creatures more than one size category smaller or larger than
      themselves and take a &#8211;8 penalty on their Bluff checks to mimic the
      voices of such smaller or larger creatures.
BeforeCombat: >-
  If the monster is able to remain undetected, it stalks the PCs for several
  minutes after they enter the hex until it can learn their names. Ideally, it
  waits until the PCs split up, but otherwise it attempts to lure the PCs into
  an ambush by calling from a nearby crag in a frightened woman's voice, calling
  on as many of the PCs by name as it can to come aid it.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once it has sprung its trap, the leucrotta charges the nearest opponent with
  its bite attack, kicking any other combatant who tries to intervene.
Morale: >-
  While cruel and evil, the leucrotta is not stupid. If it is reduced to 25 hit
  points or fewer, it jumps up higher into the rocks (requiring a DC 20 Climb
  check to follow) and flees to its lair to recover. It later follows the PCs to
  try again to lure them to their deaths, one at a time.
