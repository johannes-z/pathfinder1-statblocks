  - name: Frightener (Su)
    description: >-
      Renfal's unique personality manifests even in death. He gains the use of
      the following spell-like abilities three times per day: dancing lights,
      ghost sound, minor image, soften earth and stone, and whispering wind. He
      can manifest these effects in areas related to his emotions throughout
      Ironcloud Keep and Ashpeak's caldera (including areas E5, F26, F32, F41,
      and F51), even if he doesn't have line of effect. This ability originally
      appeared on page 25 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Classic Horrors
      Revisited.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      Renfal can't be permanently laid to rest or destroyed until Ironcloud Keep
      is out of the hands of the Storm Tyrant. If Volstus is killed and control
      of the cloud castle is returned to Renfal, the cloud giant is finally free
      to pass on to the afterlife.
  - name: Vehemence (Su)
    description: >-
      Renfal's connection to Ironcloud Keep is so powerful that he possesses a
      measure of mastery over objects in the cloud castle. Once per round,
      Renfal can possess a Large or smaller object, giving it life as an
      animated object with a CR no higher than 15. If the target object is being
      held by a creature, the object can attempt a DC 27 Will save using its
      bearer's saving throw bonus to resist possession. If the animated object
      is destroyed, Renfal reappears in its space and cannot possess another
      object for 1d4 rounds. This ability originally appeared on page 26 of
      Classic Horrors Revisited.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Renfal avoids combat as much as possible. If forced to fight, he relies almost
  exclusively on the massive damage his corrupting touch can inflict on the
  living, coupled with any spells that might be of use.
Morale: >-
  Tied to Ironcloud Keep as long as it remains under the control of the Storm
  Tyrant, Renfal rejuvenates in 2d4 days if destroyed.
