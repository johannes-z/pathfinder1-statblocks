BeforeCombat: >-
  Kharazhar does nothing to prepare for combat, but her naga friends cast shield
  of faith to protect their champion.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kharazhar charges at anyone threatening her newfound friends. She grapples
  foes, hoping to use her bonebreaker bracers to incapacitate especially
  powerful-looking warriors early in the fight. Her grabbing appendages allow
  her to use Power Attack on unarmed strikes and bites against held foes. Once
  she takes any damage, her frenzy ability increases her Strength and
  Constitution, providing a +1 bonus on her attack rolls, combat maneuvers,
  damage, and Fortitude saves, and increasing her hit points by 10.
Morale: >-
  When reduced to 70 hit points, and again when reduced to 35 hit points,
  Kharazhar can attempt a DC 20 Will save to escape the charmed thralldom of her
  captors. If she succeeds, she ignores Synvaar's commands and  disregards his
  safety, but continues to protect Sylyeese. Whether she succeeds or fails, she
  fights to the death as long as the PCs threaten Sylyeese. If Sylyeese is
  slain, Kharazhar flees into the Darklands, but may return to harry the PCs
  later.
Gear: bonebreaker bracersUE
