BeforeCombat: >-
  If Krojun knows he is about to face great opposition, he applies his Shoanti
  war paint and drinks a potion of shield of faith +2.
DuringCombat: >-
  Krojun charges fearlessly into battle, preferring to fight toe-to-toe against
  foes to make full use of his Thunder and Fang fighting style. Krojun is fond
  of screaming his own name whenever he lands a critical hit against a foe.
Morale: >-
  Headstrong, Krojun has courage to spare. He is not a fool, however, and
  withdraws if vastly outnumbered or overmatched, or upon being reduced to 20
  hit points or fewer. Only when raging does he fight to the death.
