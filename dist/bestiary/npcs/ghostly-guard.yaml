  When these ghosts spot intruders, they use their frightful moan more as an
  alarm than an attack, then proceed to use telekinesis to attempt to disarm the
  intruders or hurl them against the walls of the House. After a few rounds, the
  ghosts swoop down to engage the PCs in melee&#8211;note that with their solid
  equipment, these ghosts cannot easily pass through walls.
Morale: The ghostly guards fight until destroyed.
