DuringCombat: >-
  Janks stands in the square marked X and attacks the PCs at range with his
  crossbow, preferring to target anyone wearing light or no armor first. He
  hopes to draw the PCs into the swinging axe trap by making himself a target.
  Once the trap has been activated, Janks backs toward the staircase in the west
  wall, firing and moving each turn. Janks prefers not to enter melee, but will
  as a last resort.
