BeforeCombat: >-
  Before mounting up, the riders apply one oil of flame arrow to a single quiver
  of 50 arrows and divvy up the enchanted ammunition.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Stirge Hounds circle or chase prey on their stirge steeds, firing arrows
  and unleashing their color spray spell-like effects against any opponents who
  prove especially dangerous. After a few rounds, they attempt to fast dismount
  and direct their mounts to attach to enemies and drain their blood.
  Ironically, the dismounted sprites are much faster and more maneuverable.
Morale: A rider flees if reduced to fewer than 5 hit points.
