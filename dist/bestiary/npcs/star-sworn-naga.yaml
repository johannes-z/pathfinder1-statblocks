BeforeCombat: >-

  scrying at the beginning of each day. If they expect imminent conflict, each
  casts cat's grace, see invisibility, and fly.
DuringCombat: >-
  The nagas coordinate their attacks, using their magic and mobility to strike
  quickly and let poison and illusions take their toll.
Morale: >-
  The nagas fight to the death until only one remains, at which point the
  survivor pleads for mercy so that at least one guardian might continue to
  defend the observatory.
