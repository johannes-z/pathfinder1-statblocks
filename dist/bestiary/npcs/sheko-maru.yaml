BeforeCombat: >-
  Sheko-Maru is patient and observant, and quietly waits for opportunities to
  present themselves before making any moves. He likes to sow tension within
  groups, stealing one member's belongings and hiding them in another target's
  pack, or stealing food in the night and leaving crumbs on a potential victim's
  bedroll, and turns to his poisons, magic, and violence only once a party's
  members grow more suspicious of one another than of any outside threat. He
  studies two targets carefully and poisons his blades before leaping into the
  fray.
DuringCombat: >-
  Sheko-Maru attacks from under cover of his red shroud ability, and rarely
  attacks more than two enemies at once without backup. His combat style is
  straightforward, relying on his poisoned blades to fell enemies before he
  melts back into concealment.
Morale: >-
  If dropped to fewer than 15 hit points, Sheko-Maru reactivates his red shroud
  ability so enemies don't have access to his corpse, but otherwise fights to
  the death.
