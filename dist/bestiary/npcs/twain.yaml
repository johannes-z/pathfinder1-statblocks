Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If aware of combat in the floors below, Twain drinks her mutagen and hides
  among the hanging skins, waiting for the best moment to attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  Twain drinks her thorn body extract on the first round of combat, preferably
  while hiding. She takes advantage of the hanging skins for concealment while 
  she moves to sneak attack her enemies. If this tactic doesn't work as well as
  she hoped, she drinks her greater invisibility or displacement extract. If the
  PCs keep out of her range, she drinks her long arm extract, and if attackers
  overwhelm her, she drinks her haste extract to gain an extra attack and better
  defenses.
Morale: >-
  Twain is paranoid that authorities will discover the infirmary sits above an
  entrance to the derro settlement of Corgunbier, and she fights to the death to
  preserve that secret.
