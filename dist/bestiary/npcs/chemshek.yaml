BeforeCombat: >-
  If Chemshek knows that combat is imminent, he drinks his potion of
  invisibility, exits through a window on the bookshop's second floor, climbs
  down to the ground floor, and then tries to enter the bookshop through the
  front door to sneak up on the PCs from behind. It takes Chemshek 3 rounds to
  complete this movement.
DuringCombat: >-
  Chemshek makes use of his Spring Attack feat to move into combat, make a
  single attack, and then retreat out of harm's way. He continues this tactic
  for as long as possible.
Morale: >-
  Chemshek is reckless and fearless in combat, especially  if Shadow Orchid is
  in danger. If reduced to less than 20 hit points, he retreats and drinks his
  potion of cure light wounds before returning to combat. Chemshek fights to the
  death to protect Shadow Orchid.
