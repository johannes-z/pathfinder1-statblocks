SQ: prince of rabbits, quickness, woodland stride
Source: The Harrowing
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Prince of Rabbits (Ex)
    description: >-
      Brambleson always counts as having a running start when making Acrobatics
      checks to jump.
  - name: Quickness (Su)
    description: Brambleson gains one bonus move action every round.
  - name: Suggestible (Ex)
    description: >-
      The rabbit prince's simplistic mind sidetracks easily. Whenever he rolls a
      Will save to resist a charm effect, Brambleson must roll two dice and use
      the worse of the two results.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Brambleson makes full use of his Combat Expertise, Spring Attack, and Mobility
  feats in combat, moving constantly and pecking away at opponents more as a
  nuisance than a genuine threat. With his incredible leaping ability, he takes
  the fight into tree branches or other territory awkward for larger folk as
  soon as possible.
Morale: >-
  Brambleson's honor won't let him admit defeat, though he readily calls any
  fight a draw when he's down to one-third his total hit points, and then offers
  them his token. If a dishonorable opponent won't accept such a condition, he
  flees into the Briar.
Gear: >-
  sword of oaths (broken +2 short sword), elixir of truth, tin crown holding
  four feather tokens (anchor, bird, tree [2])
