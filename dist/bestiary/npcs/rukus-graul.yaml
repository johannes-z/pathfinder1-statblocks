    description: >-
      Rukus is particularly mean-looking and gains a +4 racial bonus on
      Intimidate checks, but has a deformed right hand that imparts a -2 penalty
      on attack rolls with two-handed weapons (this hand cannot wield weapons on
      its own).
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Rukus sics his dogs on the PCs and watches the fight from the edge of the
  clearing for 1 round before he joins the fray. He prefers to fight against
  smaller or unarmored foes, flanking them with his dogs.
Morale: >-
  Rukus flees back to the Graul homestead if dropped below 30 hit points or if
  more than three of his dogs are slain, crying and blubbering loudly the entire
  way.
