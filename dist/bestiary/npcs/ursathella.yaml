SpecialAbilities: []
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ursathella casts misdirection twice per day to help hide her aura, and alarm
  twice per day on the western portion of area A8 so that anyone entering the
  room from those doors triggers a mental alarm in her head. She casts fly on
  herself before entering battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ursathella casts haste on herself in the first round of battle, then uses
  unholy blight, lightning bolt, and scorching ray to make attacks at range
  while she flies out of reach. If her enemies use ranged attacks but can't fly
  themselves, she's fond of dropping a cloudkill on them and then preparing
  actions to attack them as they emerge from the vapors&#8211;but she might fly
  down into the mists to attack PCs if they don't emerge after too long,
  exposing herself to the spell's effects. She casts lead blades as soon as she
  needs to enter melee combat, but often moves around to attack new foes each
  round rather than taking advantage of a full attack action. She uses healing
  on herself when she's reduced to fewer than 50 hit points if she can, but
  doesn't bother to cast defensively when she does.
Morale: >-
  Ursathella has a difficult time envisioning a loss in battle, and fights to
  the death as a result.

  +3 chain shirt, +3 unholy scythe, cloak of resistance +2, facial piercings
  worth 750 gp in all, key to cage
