DuringCombat: >-
  If forced into combat, Tavoul attacks a flat-footed enemy with his spiked
  chain on the first round and then flees using fast stealth. He repeatedly uses
  hit and run tactics, avoiding drawn-out melee combat if at all possible. When
  fighting alongside allies, Tavoul prefers to flank foes with heavily armored
  allies.
Morale: >-
  Tavoul flees combat if reduced to 25 hit points or fewer, or surrenders if no
  escape is apparent. Only when cornered against foes he knows will offer no
  quarter does he consider fighting to the death.

  +3 chain shirt, +1 icy burst spiked chain, amulet of natural armor +1, boots
  of elvenkind, ring of protection +1, masterwork thieves' tools
