SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      Igramalash can channel energy into his claws when he hits, dealing 1d6
      points of energy damage (cold, electricity, or fire, chosen when he
      attacks) in addition to his normal claw damage.
  - name: Divine Source (Su)
    description: >-
      Although none worship him today, Igramalash was once seen as a god by the
      inverted giants. He granted access to the domains of Chaos and Evil, and
      his symbol was a spiral with a circular maw at the center. His areas of
      concern were hunger, obedience, and pain, and his favored weapon was the
      bite. If Igramalash escapes fully, he may eventually seek to reestablish
      his dead cult among new worshipers.
  - name: Runes (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever Igramalash is affected by a spell or spell-like ability, the
      runes on his arms flash with light-at this point, any creature within 10
      feet must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Smoke Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Igramalash exhales toxic smoke. Any creature within 10 feet of Igramalash
      must succeed at a DC 32 Fortitude save or be poisoned by this smoke.
      Creatures that breathe in this smoke take a &#8211;4 penalty on this
      saving throw. In areas of severe or greater wind, this ability is
      suppressed for as long as the wind persists plus an additional round. This
      is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Smoke Breath:
      Breath&#8211;contact; save Fort DC 32; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds;
      effect 1d4 Constitution drain plus staggered for 1 round from pain; cure 3
      consecutive saves.
DuringCombat: >-
  Igramalash is only slightly below average human intelligence, yet his long
  imprisonment has left him somewhat insane and bewildered. His initial tactic
  is to advance in melee and physically attack the closest foes. He uses his
  mythic power to surge whenever he misses an attack in an attempt to correct
  that failing. Only if no foes are available for melee does he resort to his
  spell-like abilities.
Morale: Igramalash fights to the death.
