SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burst of Vengeance (Su)
    description: >-
      Despite its slow, lumbering nature, a Leng mummy is capable of lurching
      forward to attack with a short but surprising explosion of speed. Twice
      per day as a swift action, a Leng mummy may act as if affected by a haste
      spell for 1 round.
  - name: Dexterity Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      The otherworldly teeth and tongues of a Leng mummy deal 1d6 points of
      Dexterity drain with a bite. Constructs, elementals, and other creatures
      that do not possess flesh are immune to this effect. A successful DC 20
      Fortitude save reduces the Dexterity drain to 1 point. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Dust Stroke (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature killed by a Leng mummy's natural attack disintegrates into a
      cloud of dust and ash, completely destroying the victim's body (as per
      disintegrate). Site-Bound (Su) A Leng mummy is bound to the site in which
      it was created and loses its planar fast healing ability and its plane
      shift spell-like ability. This also hampers its sneak attack damage,
      reducing it to 3d6.
  - name: Unusual Anatomy (Ex)
    description: >-
      Each Leng mummy's internal anatomy is different, and it has a 50% chance
      to treat any critical hit or sneak attack against it as a normal hit.
  - name: Vulnerability (Su)
    description: >-
      The mummification process leaves a Leng mummy vulnerable to fire. As a
      fail-safe in case of rebellion, a mummified creature is subtly marked
      during the ritual process with a hieroglyph someplace inconspicuous on its
      body or wrappings that identifies the particular energy type to which it
      is vulnerable. A successful DC 20 Perception check is needed to find the
      mark , but a successful DC 25 Linguistics check is still required to
      decipher the hieroglyph's meaning.
BeforeCombat: >-
  When the mummies detect anyone approaching-such as a creature manipulating the
  trap door above the center of the room, one of the mummies uses minor image to
  create an image of Hrethnar Olvaradsson, a powerfully built, golden-haired
  Ulfen man wearing midnight blue robes, seated on the enormous stone throne.
DuringCombat: >-
  One round after the first PC reaches the floor of  this room, the mummies
  attack. During the first two rounds of combat they use their burst of
  vengeance ability to gain an extra bite attack. Thereafter, the mummies use
  Spring Attack to dart in and out of melee, striking at a different PC each
  round with a bite attack.
Morale: >-
  The mummies fight until destroyed. They pursue fleeing PCs, but they do not
  leave areas B3, B4a, and B4b.
