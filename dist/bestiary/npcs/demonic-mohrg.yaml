    description: >-
      A demonic mohrg's fiendish spirit can attempt to leap into another host
      when it is destroyed. At this point, the demonic mohrg can attempt to
      possess any one creature within 30 feet to which it has line of sight as
      an immediate action. The targeted creature can resist being possessed if
      it makes a DC 23 Will save. If it fails, the demonic mohrg possesses that
      target as if via magic jar, but with no duration for the effect and
      without the need for a receptacle. Typically, the demonic spirit lies low
      if it successfully possesses a new host, waiting until the right moment to
      seize control of the host and start a new chain of horrific murders. In
      this way, a demonic spirit can jump from host to host, for each time its
      host is executed, it rises anew as a demonic mohrg. The possessing spirit
      can be driven from a living host with a successful dispel chaos or dispel
      evil spell, instantly destroying the spirit and ending the cycle, but such
      tactics have no effect on the creature after it has animated an executed
      body as a demonic mohrg. The save DC is Charisma-based.
