BeforeCombat: >-
  If Lorenzo is aware of the PCs and isn't occupied with another task, he drinks
  his daily mutagen, increasing his Constitution. He always coats his short
  sword in two doses of large scorpion venom at the start of the day (using his
  concentrate poison discovery), and has thus far avoided using it in the
  party's previous encounters.
DuringCombat: >-
  Lorenzo tries to stay behind the heavily armored brothers, preferring to throw
  bombs from range.
Morale: >-
  Lorenzo fights to the death, completely dedicated to the task at hand, even if
  it costs him his life. That is, after all, what he signed on for.
