SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Possession (Su)
    description: >-
      Nicoroux's fell influence grants Stom incredible powers, but leaves him
      susceptible to several magical effects. Protection from evil and
      protection from law affect Stom as if he were an evil creature, and he may
      not touch any creature benefiting from either spell. Additionally,
      Nicoroux's control is instantly ended with a successful dispel evil or
      dispel law spell delivered as a touch attack.
  - name: Weapon Familiarity (Ex)
    description: >-
      By virtue of his years using the tool, Stom may wield his mining pick in
      combat as a heavy pick without taking an improvised weapon penalty.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Stom has already cast bear's endurance, bull's strength, instant armor, and
  magic vestment for his earlier fight with the other survivors, and has also
  taken a small amount of damage, reducing him to 101 hit points. If the PCs are
  especially loud or noisy returning from the basement, he prepares by casting
  righteous might on himself. (All of these spells are included in his stats).
DuringCombat: >-
  Stom uses his war sight revelation to roll initiative twice and take the
  better result, then casts wall of fire to surround the PCs in a circle of
  flames. Afterward, he casts sanctuary on himself to finish his combat
  preparations, casting divine power, and if time permits, magic weapon. He then
  unleashes unholy blight and flame strike on clustered groups of PCs, swinging
  with his pick whenever an opponent gets within melee range. If reduced below
  half his normal hit points, he uses a swift action each round to cast a cure
  spell using his combat healer revelation.
Morale: >-
  If reduced below 20 hit points, Stom collapses as Nicoroux's hold over him
  slips. He returns to his former neutral alignment and begs for leniency. Only
  the vaguest memories of the past half-hour remain.
Gear: miner's pick
