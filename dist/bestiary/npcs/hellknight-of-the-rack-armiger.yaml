DuringCombat: >-
  An Order of the Rack armiger prefers to take living prisoners, but won't stay
  his hand to make nonlethal attacks until the last minute&#8211;they aren't
  afraid to drop violent foes to the ground and then bandage them later if
  necessary. In battle, they work to support each other as much as to capture
  "criminals," preferring to flank with fellow armigers.
Morale: >-
  Once an armiger is reduced to 10 or fewer hit points, all of the armigers
  retreat, leaving the situation for any surviving dottari to handle. If an
  armiger is dropped to negative hit points, his allies protect him&#8211; one
  administers a potion of cure moderate wounds, after which they all retreat to
  Castle Kintargo.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds
