  Ormandar casts greater magic fang on himself and his shark companion Galieus

DuringCombat: >-

  casts dispel magic on air-breathers that are using magic to breathe
  underwater, forcing those opponents to hold their breath or dash to the

  wildshapes into a Large great white shark and rushes into melee.
Morale: >-
  Once he tastes blood, Ormandar loses control and fights to the death in a gory
  frenzy.
