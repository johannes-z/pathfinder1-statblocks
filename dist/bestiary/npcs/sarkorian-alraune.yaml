SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Calming Fragrance (Su)
    description: >-
      A supernaturally sweet perfume that calms the nerves and blunts aggression
      constantly surrounds an alraune to a radius of 60 feet. Any creature in
      this area of effect must succeed at a DC 21 Will save at the start of its
      turn or fall under the effects of calm emotions for 1 round. Creatures
      that could be attracted to the alraune's current apparent gender take a -2
      penalty on this Will save, while all other creatures gain a +2 bonus on
      the save. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Feed (Ex)
    description: >-
      An alraune's roots can feed on a helpless or willing target. At the end of
      an hour of feeding, the victim takes 1d6 points of both Constitution and
      Intelligence drain, and the alraune heals 3d6 points of damage.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The Sakorian alraune is directing two of the last remaining Pathfinders to dig
  their own grave.
DuringCombat: >-
  If forced into combat, the Sakorian alraune uses wall of thorns to separate
  the party and then uses a mix of mix of spells and melee to subdue the PCs,
  preferring to leave them alive if possible.
Morale: >-
  The Sakorian alraune has struggled its entire life to find an environment as
  suitable as the Mwangi Expanse. It's unwilling to suffer any longer and fights
  to the death to defend its new home.
