SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Command the Frozen (Su)
    description: >-
      Karivek's death at the hands of a supernaturally cold malevolence (the
      wendigo) has given him ghost power over non-outsider creatures who possess
      the cold subtype. The ghost can use dominate monster at will on any
      non-outsider with the cold subtype as a spell-like ability, but can only
      maintain control in this manner over one creature at a time.
  - name: Eater of Flesh (Su)
    description: >-
      As a victim of the wendigo's insidious disease prior to his death, Karivek
      retains a portion of that sickness within his very being. On a successful
      critical hit with his vicious bite attack, the ghost tears away a chunk of
      flesh and consumes it (the flesh becoming ghostly and vanishing as he does
      so)-this deals 1d6 points of Constitution and Charisma drain to the victim
      (DC 22 Fortitude save negates).
  - name: Frozen Dead (Su)
    description: >-
      Karivek gains the cold subtype, thanks to his death in this frozen
      landscape. As long as he's in an area where the temperature is below
      freezing (as it is on this ledge), he gains fast healing 10.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      Until his bones are returned to the Vekkers' cabin, Karivek's ghost
      rejuvenates 2d4 days after it is destroyed.
  - name: Vicious Bite (Su)
    description: >-
      Karivek threatens a critical hit with his bite on a natural roll of
      18&#8211;20. His fangs become solid and razor sharp as they cut through
      flesh but ignore armor, allowing him to attack with his bite as a touch
      attack. Karivek adds 1-1/2 times his Charisma modifier as damage to his
      vicious bite attack. Wounds caused by his vicious bite are deep and gory,
      causing 1d8 points of bleed damage.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Karivek uses his frightful moan on the first round of combat, then uses
  telekinesis to hurl non-flying foes off of his ledge. He focuses his melee
  attacks on larger foes&#8211;victims with the most meat on their bones. If he
  sees that the frost worm is nearly dead and surrounded by enemies, he'll
  attempt to kill the worm with his corrupting touch in order to trigger its
  death throes, knowing that only the supernatural piercing damage can hurt him
  (and even then, at best, he'll only take half damage from that, due to his
  incorporeal nature.
Morale: >-
  Once Karivek engages in battle, he fights until destroyed, knowing he will
  just rejuvenate in a few days.
Gear: +4 improved cold resistance padded armor
