BeforeCombat: >-
  Galenmir drinks his potion of heroism and uses oil of darkness on his pick
  (unless the PCs don't seem to be relying on light, in which case he does not
  use this tactic).
DuringCombat: >-
  Galenmir has stacked several rocks next to the pit entrance to his lair and
  uses these against intruders. If confronted in close quarters, he uses
  Improved Bull Rush to keep his enemies from surrounding him and to set himself
  up for tactical advantages. He always uses Power Attack (these bonuses are
  included in his stats above).
Morale: >-
  Although Galenmir is no coward, he realizes when he's been beaten. If reduced
  to 30 hit points or fewer, he drinks his potion of gaseous form and seeps into
  the cracks and crevices of the caves, working his way up and out of the pit to
  gather a group of eight stone giants to then lead back into the pit to seek
  out the PCs. While he's aware that Mokmurian will likely be furious at this
  breach of edict, Galenmir assumes his lord will be even more furious if the
  PCs are allowed to explore the caves uncontested.
