BeforeCombat: >-
  When preparing for violence, the wyrmlings leverage their strengths. Sirocco
  positions herself up high while Scorpion seeks a hiding spot (usually under
  the sand). In the meantime, Inferno attempts to draw attention to himself with
  trumpeting challenge-roars and gouts of fire.
DuringCombat: >-
  In combat, the wyrmlings focus on one foe at a time. Inferno opens with his
  breath weapon and attacks, hoping to give his clutchmates easy access to flank
  their foes.
Morale: >-
  When given the opportunity, the wyrmlings flee. Sirocco covers the retreat of
  her brothers from the air, using her breath weapon to allow her to keep her
  distance from threats.
