SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bay (Su)
    description: >-
      When a shadow mastiff howls or barks, all creatures within a 300-foot
      spread except evil outsiders must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or become
      panicked for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. A
      creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same mastiff's
      bay for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
  - name: Shadow Blend (Su)
    description: >-
      In any condition of illumination other than full daylight, a shadow
      mastiff disappears into the shadows, giving it concealment (50% miss
      chance). Artificial illumination, even a light or continual flame spell,
      does not negate this ability; a daylight spell, however, does. A shadow
      mastiff can suspend or resume this ability as a free action.
