BeforeCombat: >-
  Lrrhech casts freedom of movement, shield of faith, barkskin, and spell
  resistance before combat begins.
DuringCombat: >-
  The mi-go priest casts summon monster V at the start of combat to conjure up a
  large mud elemental, augmenting the creature with its it came from beyond
  domain ability, granting it the advanced creature template (this ability makes
  the mud elemental look like a cross between an eel and an octopus made of the
  soggy fungus, but does not imbue the elemental with the fungus's toxic
  qualities). Lrrhech focuses on its ranged spells thereafter, favoring
  irradiate and confusion from its staff along with wall of thorns.
Morale: >-
  Lrrhech attempts to flee if reduced to fewer than 30 hit points. If it
  escapes, it likely returns with reinforcements (several more mi-go) at some
  point in the future to track down the PCs, eager to harvest the brains of foes
  so capable. How this impacts future adventures is left to you to determine.
