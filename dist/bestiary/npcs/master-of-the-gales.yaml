  day, imbuing all of its natural attacks with a +1 enhancement bonus. He casts
  endure elements and water breathing on himself every day, and casts air walk,
  barkskin, extended bear's endurance, extended bull's strength, extended cat's
  grace, freedom of movement, stoneskin, and true seeing before combat. He also
  casts animal growth on his giant squid cohort before battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Master of Gales uses wild shape to assume the form of a giant squid,
  killer whale, Huge air elemental, or Huge water elemental for combat. He often
  combines call lightning storm and whirlwind to good effect and reserves his
  baleful polymorph spell to transform a difficult opponent into a sea slug. In
  the water, he casts summon monster VII or VIII to summon elder elementals,
  fiendish giant squids, or fiendish dire sharks to assist him in combat.

  If reduced to fewer than 40 hit points, the Master of the Gales uses word of
  recall stored in his spellstaff to retreat to his sanctuary in Drenchport.
