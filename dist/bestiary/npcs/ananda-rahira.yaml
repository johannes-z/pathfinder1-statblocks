SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sacrificial Staff (Su)
    description: >-
      When wielding any magic staff containing one or more charges, the magus
      can break the staff for a retributive strike. Such an act must be
      purposeful and declared by the magus, and can be performed as a standard
      action. When making a retributive strike, all charges currently in the
      staff are released in a 30-foot spread. All creatures within 10 feet of
      the broken staff take a number of points of damage equal to 10 times the
      number of charges in the staff, those between 11 and 20 feet away take a
      number of points of damage equal to 7 times the number of charges in the
      staff, and those between 21 and 30 feet away take a number of points of
      damage equal to 5 times the number of charges in the staff. All affected
      targets can attempt a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage (DC = 1/2
      the magus's level + her Intelligence modifier). If the broken staff
      contains a spell that deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, the
      damage dealt by the retributive strike is also of this energy type (if
      more than one energy type is present in the staff, the magus can choose
      which the retributive strike deals). A staff containing no spells that
      deal energy damage instead deals an amount of force damage equal to half
      the normal amount of damage. Prior to breaking the staff, the magus can
      spend 1 or more points from her arcane pool as a swift action to recharge
      the staff up to its maximum number of charges. The magus must be at least
      12th level before selecting this arcana.
