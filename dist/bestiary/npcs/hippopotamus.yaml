      A hippopotamus excretes a reddish-tinged oil that protects its skin from
      both the sun and bacteria. It suffers no harm from being in hot

      saves to resist nonmagical diseases.
  - name: Capsize (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hippopotamus can attempt to capsize a boat or ship of its size or
      smaller by ramming it as a charge attack and making a combat maneuver
      check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the boat captain's
      Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher.
  - name: Hold Breath (Ex)

      A hippopotamus can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to four
