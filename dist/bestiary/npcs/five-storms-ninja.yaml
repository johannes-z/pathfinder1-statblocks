SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fast Stealth (Ex)
    description: The ninja can move at full speed using the Stealth skill without penalty.
  - name: Ki Pool (Su)
    description: >-
      A ninja has a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to
      accomplish amazing feats. As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki
      pool, a ninja treats any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if she had
      a running start. By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a ninja can make
      one additional attack at her highest attack bonus, but she can do so only
      when making a full attack. In addition, she can spend 1 point to increase
      her speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a ninja can spend 1 point from
      her ki pool to give herself a +4 insight bonus on Stealth skill checks for
      1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action.
  - name: Light Steps (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a ninja can move up to twice her speed, ignoring
      difficult terrain. While moving in this way, any surface will support her,
      no matter how much she weighs. This allows her to move across water, lava,
      or even the thinnest tree branches. She must end her move on a surface
      that can support her normally. She cannot move across air in this way, nor
      can she walk up walls or other vertical surfaces. When moving in this way,
      she does not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being
      touched, such as lava or caltrops, nor does she need to make Acrobatics
      checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces. Finally, when using
      light steps, the ninja ignores any mechanical traps that use a
      location-based trigger.
  - name: No Trace (Ex)
    description: >-
      A ninja learns to cover her tracks, remain hidden, and conceal her
      presence. The DC to track a ninja using the Survival skill increases by
      +2. In addition, her training gives her a +2 insight bonus on Disguise
      skill checks and on opposed Stealth checks whenever she is stationary and
      does not take any action for at least 1 round.
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      A ninja is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison
      herself when applying poison to a weapon.
  - name: Smoke Bomb (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a ninja can throw a smoke bomb that creates a cloud
      of smoke with a 15-foot radius. This acts like the smoke from a
      smokestick. The ninja can center this smoke on herself, or throw the bomb
      as a ranged touch attack with a range of 20 feet. Each use of this ability
      uses up 1 ki point.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The ninja poison their katanas and shuriken with shadow essence before combat,
  and drink their potions of displacement.
DuringCombat: The ninja pair up against opponents, flanking to make sneak attacks.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, the ninja drink their potions of cure
  serious wounds. If reduced to 8 hit points or fewer after this point, the
  ninja commit seppuku (ritual suicide by performing a self-inflicted coup de
  grace with their katanas) rather than submit to capture.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure serious wounds, potion of displacement, shadow essence (6
  doses)
OtherGear: masterwork chain shirt, masterwork katana*, shuriken (12)
