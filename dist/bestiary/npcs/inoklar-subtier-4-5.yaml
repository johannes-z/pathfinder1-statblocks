DuringCombat: >-
  Inoklar stays back, hoping to lure PCs into the trap on the floor in front of
  her throne. Once the PCs approach within 30 feet, she uses Dazzling Display to
  demoralize them (increasing the duration of the shaken condition with her
  frightening ability) and take advantage of her Scent of Fear feat. She orders
  her goblin sharpers to flank with her for sneak attacks utilizing her brutal
  beating ability, concentrating her attacks on any shaken foes or a PC caught
  in the trap.
Morale: Intoxicated by the smell of humanoid fear, Inoklar fights to the death.
