    description: >-
      At the start of a hound's turn, creatures within 30 feet are beset with
      excruciating hunger pangs, take 3d6 points of nonlethal damage, and become
      fatigued. A successful DC 22 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates
      the fatigue. Damage and fatigue caused by this ability cannot be healed or
      removed until the affected creature eats a meal. Creatures that do not
      need to eat (such as constructs, undead, and non-native outsiders, like a
      hound of Old Kintargo) are immune to this effect. The saving throw is
      Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The hounds use Improved Vital Strike when attacking. The increase to their
  bite attack is included in the stats above (when a hound doesn't use this
  feat, its bite deals 3d6+12 points of damage plus 2d6 points of fire damage).
  If encountered in narrow confines, such as in the halls below the Lucky Bones,
  the hounds use their dimension door spell-like ability to move into position
  whenever possible rather than squeezing through halls.
Morale: The hounds of Old Kintargo fight to the death.
