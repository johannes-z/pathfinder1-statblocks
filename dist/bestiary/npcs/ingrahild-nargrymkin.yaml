  - name: Schizophrenic (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ingrahild suffers from schizophrenia (GameMastery Guide 251). She takes a
      -4 penalty on all Wisdom and Charisma-based skill checks, cannot take 10
      or take 20, and must succeed at a DC 16 Will save when in a stressful
      situation (such as combat) or become confused for 1d6 rounds.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Ingrahild must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or
  become confused for 1d6 rounds. If able to act normally, she charges the
  closest opponent and attacks, focusing her strikes on that opponent as much as
  possible. If other combatants attempt to intervene, she casts entangle to slow
  their approach.
Morale: >-
  Convinced that the orcs have taken her brother, Ingrahild fights to the death,
  though she falls unconscious and automatically stabilizes if reduced to fewer
  than 0 hit points due to her Diehard feat.
