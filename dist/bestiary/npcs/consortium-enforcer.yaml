DuringCombat: >-
  The enforcers draw their weapons if the PCs do the same, and fight using
  flanking tactics to overwhelm anyone standing between them and Zeeva. If they
  act before the PCs, the enforcers use sleep arrows to remove PCs from the
  fight. Once engaged in melee, they do not attempt further ranged attacks.
Morale: >-
  These hired mercenaries have no stake beyond fulfilling their contract. The
  enforcers drop their weapons and surrender if reduced to 15 or fewer hit
  points. If Devane is knocked unconscious or killed, any remaining enforcers
  flee the market.
