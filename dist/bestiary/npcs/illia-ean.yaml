DuringCombat: >-
  Illia relies on surprise to eliminate weak foes quickly, knowing she has few
  chances to sneak attack her enemies. In the first round of combat, she draws
  her sword as a swift action and uses Whirlwind Attack to gain as many attacks
  against flat-footed targets within reach, then moves into a position in which
  she cannot be flanked. She employs Whirlwind Attack and her rogue talents as
  often as possible when unable to gain sneak attacks.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 25 hit points, Illia gives up, admitting her
  desperation to escape this hellish plane led her to act rashly, and begging
  the PCs for mercy.
Gear: >-
  potions of cure serious wounds (2), rod of cancellation, scroll of dispel
  magic, wand of knock (7 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +3 leather armor, +2 keen short sword, belt of incredible dexterity +2,
  masterwork thieves' tools, 335 gp
