BeforeCombat: Pratt summoned 1d3 fiendish wolves and used a scroll of eagle's splendor.
DuringCombat: >-
  Pratt sends his wolves after the PCs and uses his one remaining 3rd level
  spell slot to hit the toughest-looking PC with fear. He then casts glitterdust
  at any fighter-types not hit by fear, casts hideous laughter at clerics and
  casters, and hits anyone who gets too close with sleep. If the PCs get close,
  he casts invisibility and repositions himself. Should he run out of spell
  options, he resorts to his shortbow.
