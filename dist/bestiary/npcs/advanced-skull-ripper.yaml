    description: >-
      A skull ripper is an expert at collecting its favorite trophies: skulls.
      Once it has pinned a foe, it can attempt to behead the victim with its
      claws. This attempt is made as part of the grapple check to maintain an
      existing pin, and if successful, deals 4d6+18 points of damage to the
      victim. If this damage is enough to bring the foe to fewer than 0 hit
      points, the victim must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save to resist having
      his head torn from his body; failure results in instant death for most
      creatures. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Dread Visage (Su)
    description: >-
      A skull ripper's fearsome appearance is such that all creatures within 30
      feet that can see the skull ripper must succeed at a DC 22 Will save at
      the start of their turn or be frightened for 1 round. If the victim
      recognizes any of the heads affixed to the skull ripper's body as having
      once belonged to friends or allies, that victim takes a -4 penalty on the
      save. A character that succeeds at the save is immune to the dread visage
      of that particular skull ripper for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting
      fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Su)
    description: >-
      Sting-injury; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4
      Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The two skull rippers lurk in the shadows near the north and west doors,
  attacking as soon as anyone comes within reach. Each focuses on the same foe
  if possible, moving to flank if there's room. They pursue foes until heavily
  wounded (see Morale), even up into Jubbek's Halls above.
Morale: >-
  A skull ripper retreats to area C1 if reduced to fewer than 50 hit points.
  Confronted there, a skull ripper fights until destroyed.
