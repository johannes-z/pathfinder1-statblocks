BeforeCombat: >-
  Sjohvor casts alarm on the entrances to his cave every day. If he sees or is
  alerted to an imminent attack, he casts resist energy (fire) on himself, as
  well as mage armor, mirror image, and shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Sjohvor prefers to be airborne when he battles others. He uses fog cloud, wall
  of ice, and wall of force to split his foes before swooping in to snatch one
  of the enemies. On the ground, he engages in melee, using his breath weapon
  when available.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than half his full normal hit points, Sjohvor calls on
  either his harpy or centaur allies (whichever are closest). He then flees to
  his lair in the distraction. If particularly strong foes face him, he calls
  for Thragandor to join his defense. If confronted in his lair, he fights to
  the death to protect his hoard.
