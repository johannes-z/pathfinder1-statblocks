BeforeCombat: >-
  A hobgoblin sergeant always lets his troops close with the enemy before he
  engages combatants. He prefers to stay out of reach while using his scorpion
  whip to make trip attacks, but dual-wields his longsword and whip if forced
  into melee.
Morale: >-
  A hobgoblin sergeant has far too much pride to run or surrender. As long as at
  least one other hobgoblin is within sight, a hobgoblin sergeant fights to the
  death. If the sergeant is the last hobgoblin standing, he tries to flee if
  brought below 5 hit points.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds
