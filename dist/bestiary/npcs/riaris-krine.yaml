DuringCombat: >-
  Riaris uses her boarding pike's reach to attack foes being hounded by Patch
  Patchsalt, using Power Attack to gain a +6 bonus on damage rolls (at a cost of
  a &#8211;3 penalty to hit) to further her blows. She keeps an eye on
  spellcasters, and attempts to maximize her Disruptive feet by catching as many
  enemy spellcasters in her weapon's reach as possible.
Morale: Riaris fights to the death.
Gear: potions of cure serious wounds (2)

  +2 breastplate, +1 boarding pike, masterwork daggers (5), grappling hook,
