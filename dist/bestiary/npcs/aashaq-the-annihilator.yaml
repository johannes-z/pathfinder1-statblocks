BeforeCombat: >-
  Aashaq requires little in the way of preparation, but she will cast resist
  energy (cold) if she expects to be threatened by evocation magic. She uses her
  cleric spells to control enemies or to prepare herself for those exceptionally
  rare fights in which she expects difficulties.
DuringCombat: >-
  Aashaq lives to destroy. She will not engage in diplomacy unless she finds she
  cannot end her enemies swiftly. Even then she will only use discussion to
  learn about her foes before launching another attack. She savors the visceral,
  tactile joy of tearing her foes apart, using quickened spells to confound
  enemies along with her claws and teeth. She knows few can challenge her, so
  she is not afraid to spend all of her power on those who do.
Morale: >-
  Aashaq will fight to the death, but is not completely reckless. If reduced to
  75% of her hit points, she uses wall of force to separate her foes and deal
  with them one at a time. If reduced to 50% of her hit points she casts
  antimagic field, relying on her natural bulk and armor to deal with enemies
  who are otherwise benefitting from multiple spells and enchantments.
