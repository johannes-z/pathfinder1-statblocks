  - name: Dirty Fighting (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sir Ilivan knows how to hold his own on the jousting field as well as a
      barroom brawl. He gains a +2 bonus on all combat maneuver checks, and
      whenever he confirms a critical, may elect to deal normal damage and roll
      on the following table rather than dealing extra damage.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Unless the PCs draw weapons or move to intercede during his rant, Sir Ilivan
  feeds the potion of haste to his mount.
DuringCombat: >-
  Sir Ilivan has spent much of the past day traveling with the PCs and likely
  knows their strategies. Despite his distressed state, he's still a capable
  fighter and tactician. If the PCs earned at least 1 Empathy Point, Sir Ilivan
  refrains from using Power Attack or his challenge class feature until he has
  taken at least 10 points of damage. His preferred tactic is to charge a PC
  with his lance and then switch to his longsword as necessary. He rides away to
  gain distance and charge again if he's at risk of being overwhelmed in melee.
Morale: Sir Ilivan believes he has nothing to lose, and he fights to the death.
