DuringCombat: >-
  The hunter prefers to charge into melee to make use of his rhino hide charge
  bonus. If he has an advantage in the battle, he uses nonlethal attacks to
  capture prey alive, because live captives are more fun for him and his family.
  He sets his wolf companion on any spellcasters who are bothering him. If he
  thinks he might be slain, he mercilessly carves through his foes, focusing on
  killing any humans first.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds

  resistance +1, ring of protection +1, 60 gp
