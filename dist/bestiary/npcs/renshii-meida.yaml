BeforeCombat: >-
  Meida activates her spirit shield revelation and casts status to monitor her
  allies every day. Prior to battle, she casts shield of faith and shield from
  her wand (using Use Magic Device). She further prepares for battle by casting
  true seeing and resist energy (fire) on herself, and sacred bond on the Jade
  Regent.
DuringCombat: >-
  Meida casts air walk on the first round of combat. She summons a spiritual
  ally to attack anyone targeting her while she casts battlefield control spells
  such as blade barrier or reverse gravity. She monitors her allies closely with
  status, casting mass cure spells or dispel magic as needed. If the Jade Regent
  is attacked, she casts summon monster VII to add 1d3 shadow demons to the
  fight. Meida targets enemy healers with her otherworldly kimono's maze effect
  to keep them from aiding their companions. If necessary, she opposes
  spellcasters with her Improved Counterspell feat and either greater dispel
  magic or quickened dispel magic.
Morale: >-
  If severely hindered by magic or reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, Meida
  casts sanctuary and retreats to restore herself with cleanse, greater dispel
  magic, or a cure spell. If the Jade Regent is slain, Meida reacts by invoking
  her ancestral weapon and spirit of the warrior abilities to avenge him,
  launching herself into the melee with wild, furious abandon and fighting to
  the death.
Gear: wand of hold person (17 charges), wand of shield (33 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 fighting fan*, masterwork darts (6), otherworldly kimono (see page 60),
  ring of counterspells (harm), rod of splendor, gold bracelet (focus for sacred
  bond, worth 100 gp)
