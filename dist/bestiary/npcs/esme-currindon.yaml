DuringCombat: >-
  Esme is a poor combatant. If there is no one to protect her, she attempts to
  charm a likely protector and then flees combat, using unseen servant to close
  doors and move obstacles into the path of pursuers.
Morale: >-
  Esme quickly flees or gracefully surrenders if she believes she would be
  killed. She isn't frightened by battle; she just understands that she has no
  aptitude for it.
