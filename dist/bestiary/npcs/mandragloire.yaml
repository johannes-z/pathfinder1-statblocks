DuringCombat: >-
  The mandragloires know all too well they are small and fragile compared to
  many denizens of the Pestilent Palace, and rely on cunning and patience to win
  the day. The soften up prey with hit-and-run tactics, combing their flight and
  quickened poison spell-like ability, then follow in hiding, giggling eerily.
  Only once their opponents are weakened or panicked do they finally attack,
  unleashing their shriek and blasphemy to further scatter enemies.
Morale: >-
  The mandragloires flee back into hiding if reduced below 20 hit points, and
  avoid such dangerous enemies in the future.
