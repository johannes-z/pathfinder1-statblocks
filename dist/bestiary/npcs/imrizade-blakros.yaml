  - name: Fungoid Umbilicals (Ex)
    description: >-
      Five 20-foot-long fungoid umbilicals connect Imrizade to the Gate of
      Beyond (and to the mind of Kubburum Ishme-dagan), attached to her hips,
      shoulders, and the base of her skull, cumulatively providing her with fast
      healing 3. The umbilicals may be individually attacked using the sunder
      combat maneuver. Each umbilical has hardness 2 and 5 hit points. Each
      severed umbilical inflicts 1d3 points of damage to Imrizade, and her fast
      healing is reduced by 1 for every two severed umbilicals. Severing all
      five umbilicals disconnects Imrizade from the Gate but she remains
      possessed by Kubburum.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: aberrant
BeforeCombat: >-
  Imrizade uses her scroll of mage armor as soon as she hears screeching from
  area 6. When the alarm in area 8 goes off, she uses her scroll of shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Imrizade directs her zombie to engage opponents, while she casts color spray
  from her wand to catch as many approaching enemies as possible. She then
  stands behind her zombie and uses her long limbs to deliver touch attacks,
  particularly shocking grasp against foes wearing metal armor. She targets
  spellcasters with magic missile to try to disrupt their spells. If she runs
  out of spells or is forced into melee combat, she uses her last 1st-level
  spell to cast enlarge person and attempts to make sneak attacks with her
  enlarged rapier.
Morale: >-
  Possessed by the ghostly brain of Kubburum Ishmedagan, Imrizade fights to the
  death. If Kubburum's cylinder is destroyed, however, Imrizade is freed from
  possession and surrenders.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure light wounds, scroll of mage armor, scroll of shield, wand of
  color spray, tanglefoot bag
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork rapier, hand crossbow with 10 bolts, cloak of resistance +1,
  backpack, thieves' tools, signet ring (50 gp), pouch with 20 gp, papyrus
  Aucturn Enigma scroll (see Mission Notes)
