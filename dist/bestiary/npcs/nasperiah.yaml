SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      As long as the soul anchor exists, Nasperiah returns to her unlife as a
      witchfire 24 hours after her destruction. If the soul anchor is destroyed
      or Barzillai Thrune's heart is removed from the soul anchor, she is
      immediately destroyed and allowed to move on to the Great Beyond.
  - name: Symbol of Mahathallah (Ex)
    description: >-
      A functional unholy symbol of Mahathallah adorns Nasperiah's torso, a
      physical manifestation of her faith in the Dowager of Illusions. This
      symbol functions as a divine focus for all of Nasperiah's divine spells
      and grants her a +4 profane bonus to her Armor Class.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Nasperiah casts screen daily to make the Soulbound Fane appear empty and
  deserted.
DuringCombat: >-
  For the first few rounds of combat, Nasperiah attempts to stay out of melee
  range and casts blade barrier and flame strike, along with a quickened
  spiritual weapon. She uses quickened dispel magic against the PC who seems to
  be the most augmented by magical effects (favoring those who use magical
  flight). She switches to using witchfire bolts after a few rounds of combat,
  still staying at range and channeling negative energy only when surrounded. In
  melee, she favors powerful touch spells like slay living, but saves harm to
  heal herself with once reduced to 150 or fewer hit points. If reduced to fewer
  than 50 hit points, she uses Quicken Spell to cast inflict spells to heal
  herself while she attempts to flee via mislead or sanctuary, returning to
  combat once she is healed up again.
Morale: Nasperiah fights until destroyed.
