SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Haste (Su)
    description: >-
      A cave troll is affected by a permanent haste spell (CL 8th). This grants
      the cave troll a +1 bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and
      Reflex saves (both already figured into the stat block above). Any
      condition that makes the cave troll lose its Dexterity bonus to AC also
      makes it lose its dodge bonus. This is an inherent bonus and cannot be
      dispelled or negated. When making a full attack action, a cave troll can
      make one extra attack with any weapon it is holding or one extra claw
      attack (if using natural weapons). The extra attack is at the cave troll's
      full attack bonus.
  - name: Spider Climb (Su)
    description: >-
      A cave troll can climb sheer surfaces as though by a spider climb spell
      (caster level 4th). This ability is always active, but can be negated or
      dispelled. The cave troll can restart it again on its next turn as a free
      action.
