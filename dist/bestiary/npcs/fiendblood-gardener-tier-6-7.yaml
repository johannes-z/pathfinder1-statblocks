    description: Any PC injured by a gardener's unarmed strike risks palepox infection.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If the gardeners hear the PCs approaching, they move to the center of the
  field and load their slings. Should the PCs approach stealthily, the gardeners
  are tending the flowers in randomly determined locations around the field. The
  gardeners are all infected with palepox.
DuringCombat: >-
  The gardeners attempt to lure the PCs into the flamebloom field, hoping to
  infect them. If forced into melee, they use their garden tools (sickles) to
  fend off the attackers. They throw tanglefoot bags at any PCs attempting to
  flee the field, should the PCs uncover the flowers' contagious nature.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, tanglefoot bag (2)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 hide shirt, club, masterwork sickle, masterwork sling with 10 bullets,
  masterwork gardening tools, shovel, silken rope
