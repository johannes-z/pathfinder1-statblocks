SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Courage (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day when a kuru makes a saving throw against a fear effect, he
      can roll the saving throw twice and take the better result. He must decide
      to use this ability before the saving throw is attempted.
  - name: Cannibalistic Vitality (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a kuru hits a living creature with its bite attack, he gains 1
      temporary hit point by ingesting the target's blood. This ability has no
      effect against creatures that do not have blood.
BeforeCombat: Mbaaj casts entropic shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Mbaaj relies on his followers to engage the PCs in melee so he can hang back
  and use his ranged spells and special abilities on foes. He focuses his
  attacks on suspected spellcasters first before drawing his club and charging
  the PCs. If he sees a PC drop to below 0 hit points, he gleefully casts death
  knell.
Morale: >-
  If Mbaaj is reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, he retreats and drinks his
  potions of cure light wounds. Once out of healing potions, he fights to the
  death to honor the Blood Queen.
Gear: potions of cure light wounds (3)
