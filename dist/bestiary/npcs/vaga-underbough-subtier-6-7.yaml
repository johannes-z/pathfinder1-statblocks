BeforeCombat: >-
  Vaga attempts to position herself in the most advantageous location while her
  disguise is still in effect. She ensures that her dagger is coated in a dose
  of shadow essence whenever possible so that her first attack with the weapon
  will be deadly. At the soon as she is aware of the PCs' presence, Vaga casts
  false life, and she casts shield immediately before entering area D5, knowing
  combat within is imminent (as long as she can do so without being seen or
  heard by a PC).
DuringCombat: >-
  Vaga prefers deception and capitalizing on her targets' moments of weakness
  rather than open combat, but when forced to fight, she does so with the fury
  expected of a killer of her renown. If adjacent to a flat-footed foe at the
  start of combat, she initiates with a sneak attack; otherwise, she activates
  her boots of levitation immediately, hovering above her enemies to avoid melee
  attacks. Although she has a 10% arcane spell failure chance as a result of
  wearing leather armor, she nevertheless knows that her strength is in her
  spellcasting rather than physical damage. Thus, she lets her yeth hound
  minions fight in her stead while she casts offensive spells from range. After
  one of the hounds is defeated, Vaga casts summon monster IV to bring 1d3
  dretches to her aid (or 1d3 fiendish dire bats if more than half of the PCs
  are flying).
Morale: >-
  Vaga is overwhelmed by her urge to kill, and even when her carefully crafted
  plans fall apart, she can't bring herself to surrender or relent until all her
  enemies are dead. As such, she fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  potion of gaseous form, wand of misdirection (CL 12th, 6 charges), shadow
  essence (2 doses)
OtherGear: glamered +2 leather armor, dagger, boots of levitation
