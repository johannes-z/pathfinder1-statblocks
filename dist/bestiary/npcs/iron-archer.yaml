    description: >-
      When the iron archer attacks with its bow, it fires arrow-shaped bolts of
      energy. These arrows deal 3d6 points of damage on a hit. On the first
      round of combat, these arrows deal fire damage. On the second round, they
      deal electricity damage. On the third they deal cold damage. On the fourth
      round, they switch back to fire and the cycle repeats. If the iron archer
      ceases to use its arrows (to make a melee attack, for example), the cycle
      restarts with fire arrows the next time it fires.
DuringCombat: >-
  The iron archer focuses its attacks on opponents who get past it into the
  corridor to the exclusion of all others, until the target is dead or flees. If
  no opponent gets past it, the iron archer focuses on flying foes.
Morale: The iron archer fights until destroyed.
