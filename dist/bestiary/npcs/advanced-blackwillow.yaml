SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Tendril Whip (Ex)
    description: >-
      A blackwillow can attack any creatures to a range of 100 ft. away with
      multiple grasping tendrils. This acts as a black tentacles spell as cast
      by a wizard with a caster level equal to the blackwillow's hit dice,
      except that it is an extraordinary ability. The tendrils have a CMB of +21
      and do 1d6+4 points of damage to a grappled opponent.
