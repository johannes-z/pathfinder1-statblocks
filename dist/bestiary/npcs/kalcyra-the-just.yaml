BeforeCombat: >-
  Kalcyra casts divine favor and protection from evil on herself before battle,
  and then bless (which affects the foo dogs as well).
DuringCombat: >-
  Kalcyra begins combat by casting blistering invective while the foo dogs
  attack. She prefers to stay out of melee combat, using her spells to
  debilitate her foes from a distance. If pressed into melee combat, Kalcyra
  casts flames of the faithful and activates her bane ability, then on the next
  round pronounces a judgment-usually destruction, justice, or resistance.
Morale: Believing she has a divine mandate, Kalcyra fights to the death.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds, potion of spider climb
