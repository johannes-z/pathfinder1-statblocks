    description: >-
      Your face is covered with unpleasant pimples and outright boils that have
      a tendency to pop at inopportune moments. Although this makes you
      particularly ugly, you are also used to discomfort. Whenever you're
      subjected to an effect that causes the sickened condition, you may make
      two saving throws to avoid the effect (if a saving throw is allowed),
      taking the better of the two results as your actual saving throw. Special
      Challenge Talent Chuffy has a special talent that provides an unexpected
      boon while attempting to win Licktoad badges. His nasty, pus-filled sores
      make him extra sticky, granting him a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks
      during the Animal Fiendship challenge.
Gender: Male
Gear: >-
  padded armor, dart (1), sharpened rock (functions as an improvised dagger),
  bottle of pimple squeezings (functions as oil), cicada shell (counts as empty
  calories), extra juicy earthworm (for later)
