    description: >-
      Nirmathi skirmishers spend their training studying the techniques of their
      hated enemy, the Molthuni Imperial Army, and specifically learning how to
      defeat its troops in their Nirmathi homeland. This training and hatred
      grant the Nirmathi skirmishers troop a +2 bonus on Perception checks,
      troop melee damage, and damage rolls when facing Molthuni troop units.
      Their training also grants the Nirmathi skirmishers troop a +3 bonus on
      all Knowledge (local) and Knowledge (nature) checks. The bonuses on
      Knowledge checks are calculated into the troop's stat block.
  - name: Skirmishers (Ex)
    description: >-
      Nirmathi skirmishers are effective and versatile hit-and-run troops. This
      lowers the troop's AC by 2 and its troop melee damage by one die, but
      increases its movement by 10 feet (these effects have already been
      calculated into the troop's stat block). Additionally, as a standard
      action, the troop can make a ranged attack similar to a volley. This
      attack can take the form of up to two lines starting from the corner of
      any square in the troop's space. This attack's range is 50 feet. All
      creatures in these lines take 3d6+5 points of piercing damage (Reflex DC
      19 half). The save DC is Dexterity-based.
