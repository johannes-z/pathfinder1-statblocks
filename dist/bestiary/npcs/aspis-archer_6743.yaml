DuringCombat: >-
  The archer focuses his attacks on PCs that can't be reached by Aglorn's
  summoned creatures, such as flying or climbing PCs, leaving those within range
  of the summoned horde to the monsters' devices. He saves his seeking arrows
  for use against targets that have concealment (such as those that move into
  areas of darkness or dim light).
Morale: >-
  As long as Aglorn lives, the archer fights to the death. If his commander has
  been defeated, however, the archer surrenders if reduced to 10 or fewer hit
  points.
