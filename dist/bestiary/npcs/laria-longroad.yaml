DuringCombat: >-
  Laria uses martial flexibility to gain Dodge, and does so as a move action on
  the first round of combat. She prefers flanking foes to combine sneak attack
  with her brawler's flurry. She drinks a potion of cure light wounds if reduced
  to fewer than half her hit points.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 5 hit points, Laria drinks her potion of gaseous form
  to try to escape unless she would be leaving allies behind; she won't abandon
  friends, and fights to the death to protect them.
Gear: oil of silence, potion of cure light wounds (2), potion of gaseous form
