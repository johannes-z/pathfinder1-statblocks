DuringCombat: >-
  The aboleths use dominate monster for the first few rounds of combat to try to
  turn the PCs against each other, and illusions of undead rune giants rising
  from the island's muck to trick them into wasting resources. Once the PCs are
  distracted, the aboleths rise to use their wands, resorting to melee as a last
  resort.
Morale: The aboleths fight to the death.
Gear: wand of magic missile (CL 9th, 15 charges)
