    description: >-
      A creature bit by Poor Eledia must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw or
      become fatigued for 1 hour. A fatigued creature that's bitten is instead
      exhausted for 1 hour. An exhausted creature that's bitten extends the
      duration of the effect to 1d6 hours. Each successful bite grants Poor
      Eledia 1d4 temporary hit points. The fatigued and exhausted conditions can
      only be eliminated by destroying Poor Eledia, or by using dispel magic,
      remove curse, or similar effects. The save DC is Charisma-based.
