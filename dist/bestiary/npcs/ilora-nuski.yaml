Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ilora casts alarm every evening to protect her campsite and endure elements
  every morning to make her life more bearable. She casts barkskin as soon as
  she fears combat is imminent.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ilora takes advantage of woodland stride and uses the thorns to her advantage,
  gaining soft cover against foes farther than 5 feet away from her. She fights
  with both swords, using Vital Strike when she has to move up to attack a foe.
  She relies on her spells to protect her from foes who use ranged attacks
  against her.
Morale: >-
  If faced with a foe she's obviously outnumbered or outmatched by, Ilora flees;
  throwing her life away on a pointless battle won't get Pitax out from under
  Irovetti's rule, after all.
Gear: wand of cure moderate wounds (30 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +2 studded leather, 2 +1 short swords (2), amulet of natural armor +1, boots
  of striding and springing, ring of protection +2, 5 gp
