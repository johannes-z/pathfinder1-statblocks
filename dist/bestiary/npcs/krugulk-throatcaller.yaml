BeforeCombat: >-
  Krugulk casts protection from good on himself in the last few seconds before
  starting combat if he can.
DuringCombat: >-
  The boggard chief starts by casting doom, then spiritual weapon. He prefers to
  hang back and cast spells like bull's strength and guidance on his giant
  dragonfly, and singles out particularly effective PCs for his bane spell. He
  doesn't hesitate to cast death knell on a fallen ally if the opportunity
  presents itself.
Morale: >-
  Krugulk knows his position in the tribe is dependant on shows of strength, and
  fights to the death as long as other boggards are still alive to witness it.
  If all the other boggards are struck down, he immediately flees for the
  tribe's camp, preparing tales of how he "heroically defeated the monsters that
  ambushed his group" to explain the suspicious loss of his hunting party.
Gear: >-
  leather armor, masterwork morningstar, belt of incredible Dexterity +2, amber
  necklace worth 300 gp
