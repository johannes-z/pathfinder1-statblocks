  Lady Wollnoxe uses her cacophonous roar ability on her first turn. The clamor
  causes either the apostle kytons from area B13 or the dybbuk from area B16
  (assuming either group still lives) to join the fight. (If both are alive,
  only one group comes to investigate, determined randomly.) Otherwise, Wollnoxe
  makes full attacks against her foes.
Morale: Lady Wollnoxe fights to the death.
