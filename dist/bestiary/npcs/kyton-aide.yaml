SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Chain Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      The chains that adorn a kyton grant it a +4 armor bonus, but are not
      treated as armor for the purpose of arcane spell failure, armor check
      penalties, maximum Dexterity, weight, or proficiency.
  - name: Dancing Chains (Su)
    description: >-
      A kyton can control up to four chains within 20 feet as a standard action,
      making the chains dance or move as it wishes. In addition, a kyton can
      increase these chains' length by up to 15 feet and cause them to sprout
      razor-edged barbs. These chains attack as effectively as the kyton itself.
      If a chain is in another creature's possession, the creature can attempt a
      DC 15 Will save to break the kyton's power over that chain. If the save is
      successful, the kyton cannot attempt to control that particular chain
      again for 24 hours or until the chain leaves the creature's possession. A
      kyton can climb chains it controls at its normal speed without making
      Climb checks. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Unnerving Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Range 30 ft., Will DC 15 negates. A kyton can make its face resemble one
      of an opponent's departed loved ones or bitter enemies. Those who fail
      their saves become shaken for 1d3 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear
      effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
