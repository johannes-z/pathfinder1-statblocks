  - name: Runelord Champion (Ex)
    description: >-
      Viorian bears the rune of greed upon her left shoulder, a physical
      manifestation of her role as Karzoug's champion. She has pledged herself
      to his service, body and soul, and as long as Karzoug lives (even while
      that life is confined to the far side of the runewell), she gains complete
      immunity to mind-affecting effects. In addition, she possesses SR 32
      against spells from the school of transmutation. Unfortunately, being the
      champion of greed also brings with it an associated weakness against
      domineering runeforged weapons-she qualifies as a transmuter for that
      weapon's bane effects, and critical hits made against her with such
      weapons automatically confirm.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Viorian drinks her potion of haste. After this,
  her tactics are simple&#8211;she selects the strongest-looking foe and focuses
  her wrath upon him, moving to other foes only when her current target is
  defeated. She uses Power Attack and Vital Strike when she isn't making a full
  attack, but abandons this tactic when making a full attack with Chellan and a
  shield bash.
Morale: Viorian fights to the death.
Gear: potion of haste, potions of cure serious wounds (5)
