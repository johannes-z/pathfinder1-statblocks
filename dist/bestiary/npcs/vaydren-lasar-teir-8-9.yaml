SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Corrupting Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      By passing part of its incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard
      action, the ghost inflicts 9d6 damage. This damage is not negative
      energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from
      supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this
      damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A
      Fortitude save halves the damage inflicted.
  - name: Malevolence (Su)
    description: >-
      The ghost's jealousy of the living is particularly potent. Once per round,
      the ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This
      ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th), except that
      it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be
      adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful
      Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same
      ghost's malevolence for 24 hours.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat:
      the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful
      spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently
      destroy a ghost is to determine the reason for its existence and set right
      whatever prevents it from resting in peace.
  - name: Telekinesis (Su)
    description: >-
      The ghost can use telekinesis as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds
      (CL 12th).
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: Vaydren attacks whomever Dargo tells him to.
Morale: >-
  Vaydren fights until destroyed. If a worshiper of Erastil manages to open the
  chest and touch The Sniper, Vaydren vanishes, his curse lifted.
