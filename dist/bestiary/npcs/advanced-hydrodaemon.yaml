  - name: Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hydrodaemon can launch itself into the air and glide along for 1 minute,
      gaining a fly speed of 40 feet with average maneuverability. While
      gliding, the hydrodaemon gains the pounce ability.
  - name: Sleep Spittle (Su)
    description: >-
      A hydrodaemon can spit at a single target within 20 feet, making a ranged
      touch attack as a standard action. A target hit by this spittle must
      succeed on a DC 22 Will save or fall asleep for 6 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The hydrodaemons cling to the sides of the chasm and use their sleep spittle
  to attack intruders by surprise. Any opponents who succumb to the spittle are
  pushed over the edge, soon followed by a hydrodaemon gliding down into the
  chasm to feed on the fallen foe. The rest leap forward to attack with bite,
  claw, and rake attacks.
Morale: >-
  The hydrodaemons jump into the chasm to seek refuge in the subterranean lake
  if reduced to 50 hit points or fewer.
