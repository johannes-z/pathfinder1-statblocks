SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Swarming (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ratfolk are used to living and fighting communally, and are adept at
      swarming foes for their own gain and their foes' detriment. Up to two
      ratfolk can share the same square at the same time. If two ratfolk in the
      same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that
      foe as if they were in two opposite squares.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Krella first observes the PCs in the wildshape form of a dire rat. If they
  discover her and seem prepared to take violent action, she transforms back
  into her ratfolk form.
DuringCombat: >-
  Krella casts sleet storm and flaming sphere to hamper the PCs' movements, and
  boosts Darkeyes's abilities with barkskin, bull's strength, and greater magic
  fang, hoping her animal companion can do most of the melee fighting for her.
  If she can get more than one target in the area of effect, she casts flame
  strike or ice storm, preferring to rain attacks upon her foes from range
  rather than risk personal harm in close combat.
Morale: >-
  Krella flees if reduced to 30 or fewer hit points, using freedom of movement,
  longstrider, or meld into stone to augment her escape.
Gear: scrolls of cure moderate wounds (2)
OtherGear: >-
  leather armor, masterwork cold iron dagger, daggers (3), cloak of resistance
  +1, headband of inspired wisdom +2, spell component pouch, jade pendant worth
  150 gp, key to pagoda doors
