SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alpha Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      An incarnation of death almost always gains initiative in any fight, and
      is never flat-footed. When rolling initiative, an incarnation of death
      rolls twice and takes the better result.
  - name: Certain Blow (Ex)
    description: >-
      The blows of an incarnation of death always strike the very soul of their
      assigned foe. In addition to the benefits of its smite ability, the
      attacks of an incarnation of death are considered to be touch attacks
      against its assigned foe.
  - name: Death Sense (Su)
    description: >-
      An incarnation of death can automatically sense the exact level of health
      of any living being it sees, effectively knowing its total hit dice, hit
      point maximums, and current hit point level. The incarnation can also
      discern any unusual status conditions, including wounded, disabled,
      staggered, unconscious, dying, nauseated, panicked, stunned, poisoned,
      diseased, and the like.
  - name: Magic Immunity (Ex)
    description: >-
      A lesser incarnation of death is immune to all spells and spell-like
      abilities of 3rd level or less. The incarnation may voluntarily lower this
      immunity as a standard action, and may raise it again as a free action. In
      addition, incarnations of death are immune to all death effects.
  - name: Permanent Slaying (Ex)
    description: >-
      Those killed by a lesser incarnation of death may only be brought back via
      a true resurrection, miracle or wish spell; those slain by a greater
      incarnation of death can only be brought back by the direct intervention
      of a deity.
  - name: Replication (Su)
    description: >-
      When an incarnation of death has an assigned foe, and another creature
      interferes, a second incarnation of death of the same type immediately
      appears to do battle with the interfering party, with the offending party
      as its assigned foe. Only one incarnation of death appears at a time to
      engage an interfering party, even if that party continues to interfere.
      However, if several people interfere, each ends up facing its own
      incarnation of death. Should one of these other incarnations be slain,
      that person again becomes subject to this ability should they turn their
      attention to assisting another face an incarnation of death. Assistance
      can take the form of attacking an incarnation, healing the assigned foe's
      wounds, or even positioning oneself so as to give the assigned foe a
      flanking bonus on the incarnation. If the incarnation has no foes
      assigned-for example, if it was summoned to simply wreak havoc and slay
      all who cross its path-it cannot use its replication ability.
