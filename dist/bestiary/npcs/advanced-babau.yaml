SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Protective Slime (Su)
    description: >-
      A layer of acidic slime coats a babau's skin. Any creature that strikes a
      babau with a natural attack or unarmed strike takes 1d8 points of acid
      damage from this slime if it fails a DC 18 Reflex save. A creature that
      strikes a babau with a melee weapon must make a DC 18 Reflex save or the
      weapon takes 1d8 points of acid damage; if this damage penetrates the
      weapon's hardness, the weapon gains the broken condition. Ammunition that
      strikes a babau is automatically destroyed after it inflicts its damage.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Whether the babaus hear the PCs arrive or a quasit informs them of the
  intruders, the babaus use their greater teleport ability to get to one of the
  hidden nooks in the southwest part of this cavern. From there they watch the
  PCs (even invisible ones, as babaus have constant see invisibility)  and
  decide on the best way to approach and neutralize the PCs, typically by
  teleporting behind a stalagmite near a PC, then charging at or ambushing their
  target.
DuringCombat: >-
  Babaus like to flank opponents so they can use sneak attack. Though they
  prefer to attack the most powerful creature present so they can neutralize the
  greatest threat, they recognize that their acid slime is harmful to creatures
  using natural attacks or unarmed strikes, and may gang up on animal companions
  or monks if the opportunity presents itself. They may use darkness to snuff
  the dim lights of the skull-torches, as their darkvision allows them to fight
  without penalty in darkness. They have been promised souls and slaves in
  exchange for their work, and growl about this in Abyssal once they reveal
  themselves to the PCs.
Morale: >-
  If brought to 10 hit points or less, a babau attempts to retreat, using
  greater teleport if safe to do so, transporting to the pyramid cavern to the
  southwest and warning its masters there. Neither demon uses its summon
  ability.
