SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      A white pudding secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material
      and metal quickly, but does not affect stone. Each time a creature suffers
      damage from a white pudding's acid, its clothing and armor take the same
      amount of damage from the acid. A DC 21 Reflex save prevents damage to
      clothing and armor. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a white pudding
      takes 2d6 acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 21
      Reflex save. If a white pudding remains in contact with a wooden or metal
      object for 1 full round, it inflicts 21 points of acid damage (no save) to
      the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Corrosion (Ex)
    description: >-
      An opponent that is being constricted by a white pudding suffers a -4
      penalty on Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing
      and armor.
  - name: Icy Cold (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures grappled by a white pudding take 1d6 points of cold damage per
      round and must make a successful DC 21 Fortitude save to avoid becoming
      fatigued by the cold, as if suffering from the effects of hypothermia. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Split (Ex)
    description: >-
      Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a white pudding. Instead,
      the creature splits into two identical puddings, each with half of the
      original's current hit points (round down). A pudding with 10 hit points
      or less cannot be further split and dies if reduced to 0 hit points.
  - name: Suction (Ex)
    description: >-
      The white pudding can create powerful suction against any surface as it
      climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. A white
      pudding can establish or release suction as a swift action, and as long as
      it is using suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a
      white pudding gains a +10 circumstance bonus to its CMD to resist bull
      rush, awesome blows, and other attacks and effects that attempt to
      physically move it from its location.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The frosty lurker blends perfectly with its surroundings and patiently waits
  for victims to approach within its reach.
DuringCombat: >-
  The pudding uses its slam to attack and engulf single victims. After it seizes
  a meal, it retreats to its pit to eat it, though it remains aggressive and
  fights back if the PCs continue to attack it.
Morale: Mindless, the ooze fights until slain.
