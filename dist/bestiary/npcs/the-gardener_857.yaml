SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action at will, the gardener can cause his appearance to
      burst into a riot of mold and decay, turning his ghostly body into a
      hideous garden of fungus and ruin. All living creatures within a 30- foot
      radius that view this shift must make a DC 22 Will save or be panicked for
      1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that saves
      against this ability is immune to its effects for 24 hours.
Gender: Male
Bloodline: aberrant
BeforeCombat: >-
  In the rounds before it appears, the gardener casts cat's grace, owl's wisdom,
  and mage armor on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  The gardener uses his corrupting gaze throughout any combat. On the first
  round, he attacks with his horrific appearance and a quickened haste spell. On
  the second round, he casts black tentacles and a quickened magic missile. On
  the third round, he uses telekinesis to attempt to bull rush a heavily armored
  foe into the surrounding pool, then moves to the most wounded target and casts
  a quickened vampiric touch. Once he's used all three charges of his rod of
  lesser quicken metamagic, he begins attacking with his corrupting touch, using
  telekinesis and his spells against foes who maintain ranged superiority.
Morale: >-
  The gardener fights to the death; once he appears, he pursues his victims
  anywhere they flee on Whiterose Hill, but not beyond the stone wall that
  surrounds the place.
