SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aerial Charge (Ex)
    description: >-
      When airborne, a derhii can dive at twice its normal flying speed. This is
      the equivalent of a charge, gaining a +2 bonus on the attack roll and a -2
      penalty to AC.
  - name: Booming Voice (Ex)
    description: >-
      A derhii can use its booming voice as a signal. The sound can be heard up
      to 12 miles away as a thrumming in the air that conveys 20 words of
      information in 5 minutes.
  - name: Knockdown (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a derhii confirms a critical hit with a two-handed weapon, it can
      knock its opponent prone, in addition to the damage dealt by the critical
      hit. If the derhii's confirmation roll exceeds its opponent's CMD, the
      opponent is knocked prone as if from the trip combat maneuver. This does
      not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the derhii is tripped during its
      own trip attack, it can drop its weapon to avoid being tripped.
DuringCombat: >-
  The derhii throw javelins and then make aerial charges with their falchions,
  focusing their attacks on humans if possible.
Morale: Loyal soldiers of the Gorilla King, the derhii fight to the death.
