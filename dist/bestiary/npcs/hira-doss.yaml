SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Viridian Escape (Sp)
    description: >-
      Hira has been subjected to an ancient ritual called the viridian
      transcendence, granting her the ability to use word of recall as a swift
      action once and once only. When she activates this ability, she vanishes
      in a puff of bright blue-green smoke and reappears in a Peacock Spirit
      safe house in Magnimar.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Hira casts create food and water every morning to feed herself and her
  companions. She also casts status on Viralane and Damil every morning at 8:00
  a.m.; this spell gives her additional advance warning of the PCs' approach if
  they attack Damil between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. If the PCs get
  in a fight with Damil, she casts invisibility, air walk, and protection from
  good on herself, then climbs into the air so she can attack foes  below with
  her +1 lucerne hammer but avoid melee attacks against herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once she's up in the air, Hira uses her ranged and reach attacks on the PCs.
  If either she or Viralane is reduced to half their hit points, Hira casts
  sanctuary or invisibility on herself and moves in to provide healing before
  returning to battle.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 10 or fewer hit points, Hira uses her viridian escape ability to
  vanish and flee back to Magnimar. She can become a recurring villain in this
  event, perhaps joining up with a group of Peacock Spirit cultists in an
  upcoming adventure.
