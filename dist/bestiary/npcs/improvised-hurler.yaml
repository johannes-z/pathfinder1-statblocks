BeforeCombat: The monk drinks potions of barkskin and cat's grace.
DuringCombat: >-
  This monk prefers to use improvised weapons like ladders, tankards, and
  chisels. If he happens upon a particularly effective and sturdy improvised
  weapon, he applies oil of greater magic weapon before rejoining the fray. In
  familiar terrain, he tries to stun or trip a foe as a standard action and then
  uses his abundant step ability to seek cover where he can hide. The dwarf then
  pelts his adversaries with anything on hand.

  oil of greater magic weapon (3), oil of mending (5), potion of barkskin,
  potion of cat's grace, potions of cure serious wounds (2)
