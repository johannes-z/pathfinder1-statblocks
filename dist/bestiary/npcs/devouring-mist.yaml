SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      Creatures in the devouring mist's space at the end of its movement each
      round take 1d4 points of Constitution damage as it siphons blood out of
      the victim's body. For every point so drained, the devouring mist heals 5
      hit points of damage. Creatures without blood take no damage from the
      devouring mist.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature slain by a devouring mist rises as a vampire spawn in 1d4
      days, unless the remains are blessed. If the victim had more than 5 hit
      dice, there is a 1% chance per hit die that it arises as a full-fledged
      vampire instead, or a 5% chance per hit die if the victim was of the
      humanoid type.
