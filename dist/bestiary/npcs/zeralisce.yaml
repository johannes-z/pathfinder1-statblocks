BeforeCombat: >-
  Zeralisce maintains extended mage armor at all times. She also casts extended
  shield before venturing into a dangerous area. The bonuses to her AC are
  included above, but remember that when the PCs first encounter her, these
  effects have long since expired and she hasn't been able to re-cast the
  spells.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zeralisce makes her spells available to the PCs if they travel with her;
  several of them she's perfected to aid in her role as a guide for off-plane
  patrons. She offers darkvision to PCs who can't see in the dark, daylight to
  do what she can to offset the plane's gloom, secure shelter if a safe place to
  rest is required, recovering as needed. In combat, she uses her shadow
  evocation and shadow conjuration spells to create effects tailored
  specifically for the situation, but she is always ready to extract allies in
  danger by rushing in and then casting dimension door to help them escape.
Morale: >-
  If the PCs rescue Zeralisce, she will fight to the death to aid and protect
  them. But on her own, she flees if reduced below 20 hit points.
