Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Oppian likely has forewarning of the PCs' arrival from Mindaliel, giving him
  time to cast air walk, bear's endurance, bull's strength, freedom of movement,
  and shield of faith before facing them.
DuringCombat: >-
  Oppian uses his scroll of spiritual ally on the first round of combat. He
  knows he is a stronger melee combatant than spellcaster, so he activates his
  holy lance ability and closes to melee range as soon as possible, but he casts
  spells as needed. Against heavily armored enemies or foes capable of dealing
  large amounts of damage, he casts Inheritor's smite and attempts to bull rush
  them off the edge of the rotunda.
Morale: His dream of a free Kantaria torn asunder, Oppian fights to the death.
