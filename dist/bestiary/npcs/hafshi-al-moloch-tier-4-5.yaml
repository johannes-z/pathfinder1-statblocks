BeforeCombat: >-
  If Hafshi knows the PCs are coming, she prepares for their arrival by casting
  shield of faith. She summons a lemure using summon monster II, followed by 1d3
  additional lemures with summon monster III. The f irst lemure lasts for 5
  rounds after the PCs arrive and the other lemures stay for 6 rounds. Finally,
  Hafshi casts divine power prior to the PCs' arrival&#8211;it lasts for 7
  rounds. Both divine power and shield of faith are already f igured into her
  stat block.
DuringCombat: >-
  Hafshi uses her summoned minions to keep the PCs away from her and trips
  heavily-armed PCs as often as she can. Because she gets a single attack with
  her mace and two trip attacks with her whip each round that she can take a
  full attack, she will always move to insure she can do both whenever possible.
  If any heavily-armed PCs get too close to her, she uses cause fear on that PC
  and uses deeper darkness and wall of fire to cut off casters from herself or
  her minions. Hafshi saves her cure spell, potions, and wand for herself.
Morale: Hafshi fights to the death.
