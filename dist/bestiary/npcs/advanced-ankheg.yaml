SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Spit Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 6 hours, an ankheg can spit a 30-foot line of acid. Creatures
      struck by this acid take 4d4 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 16 half).
      Once an ankheg uses this attack, it must wait 6 hours before using it
      again. Additionally, during this time period, its bite attack does not
      inflict any additional acid damage. As a result, an ankheg does not use
      this ability unless it is desperate or frustrated, most often spitting
      acid when reduced to fewer than half its full normal hit points or when it
      cannot not successfully grab an opponent. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The ankheg climbs onto the stage and attacks the nearest target with its bite
  and grab attack. It attempts to drag its prey beneath the stage, but drops
  that foe and switches targets if attacked.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to half its hit points, the ankheg spits acid and then attempts to
  retreat underground.
