BeforeCombat: >-
  If aware of the PCs' approach, Graestos grabs a slave as a human shield and
  casts barkskin on himself and drinks his potion of bear's endurance. He
  positions himself in the entryway to the inner sanctum so that he cannot be
  cut off from retreating there for aid.
DuringCombat: >-
  Graestos sends Isehkta into melee, remaining within reach of his slaves to act
  as unwilling shields. The druid employs spells such as call lightning and
  spike growth to control the battlefield, and uses his whip to trip foes
  engaged in combat with his panther, all the while making his way to the inner
  sanctum and his allies there.
Morale: >-
  If he cannot make his escape earlier to gather aid from area A6, Graestos
  surrenders when reduced to 12 or fewer hit points.
