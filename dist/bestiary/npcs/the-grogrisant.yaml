SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blazing Mane (Su)
    description: >-
      When in an area of normal or brighter light, the grogrisant's golden mane
      blazes like the sun. Creatures more than 60 feet away treat the beast as
      having total concealment due to the dazzling brilliance, and any creature
      within 60 feet that looks at the grogrisant must succeed at a DC 20
      Fortitude save or be permanently blinded. Creatures can avert their eyes
      as if this were a gaze attack.
  - name: Powerful Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      The grogrisant's bite attack applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on
      damage rolls and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.
  - name: Shimmering Coat (Su)
    description: The grogrisant adds its natural armor bonus to its touch AC.
