DuringCombat: >-
  The crocotta uses its lure and sound mimicry ability to mimic Count Matsanda's
  voice, crying out for help from the darkness. It calls to Baron Rudyahm by
  name, imposing a &#8211;4 penalty on his saving throw. If the crocotta is
  unable to coax the baron out of his tree, it  uses its climb speed to close
  into melee. It prefers to attack the baron when possible.
Morale: The crocotta fights to the death.
