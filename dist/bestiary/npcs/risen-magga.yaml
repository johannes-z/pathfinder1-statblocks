SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath of Madness (Su)
    description: >-
      Risen Magga does not use her breath of madness ability in this battle, as
      it does not function underwater.
  - name: Transdimensional Tentacles (Su)
    description: >-
      Risen Black Magga's tentacles allow her to see into and infiltrate the
      Ethereal Plane and the Shadow Plane while she is on the Material Plane.
      This allows her not only to be aware of these planes and the creatures
      there, but also to shift her tentacles through these planes to attack
      their inhabitants. She can even phase her tentacles in and out of
      existence, effectively reaching through walls and other solid barriers to
      attack foes on the other side, provided that area is not warded by
      dimensional lock or a similar effect. She can grapple foes with her
      tentacles normally, but she cannot pull grappled foes or objects through
      planes as her tentacles shift between them.
  - name: Warp Dimensions (Su)
    description: >-
      Risen Magga's presence distorts the dimensions of reality. A creature that
      attempts to utilize a teleportation effect while within 300 feet of Risen
      Magga must succeed at a DC 21 caster level check or the effect fails. If
      the effect fails, the creature that attempted to create that effect must
      succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d6 rounds. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  Risen Magga attacks first by attempting to cast dominate person on any PC who
  seems like a divine spellcaster; she avoids casting greater command if foes
  take shelter in the area of silence that covers the platform. She primarily
  focuses on physical attacks against foes and can even use her transdimensional
  tentacles to attack foes through the ceiling of areas A4-A12 in Zinlun's tomb
  (as long as the entrance is open and the dimensional anchor effect over the
  place is inactive), since there's only 10 to 15 feet of stone between the
  ceilings of these rooms and the lake bed above.
Morale: >-
  Risen Black Maga fights until destroyed but does not pursue foes beyond a
  1,000-foot radius of area A1.
