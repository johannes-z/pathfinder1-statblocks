SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Long Limbs (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a result of its faceless stalker ancestry, the Wrong One's arms are
      lengthier than that of normal myceloids, giving it reach of 10 feet.
  - name: Remorseful Aspect (Sp)
    description: >-
      The Wrong One can adjust its skin to crudely resemble the appearance of
      another creature it can see, the sight of which fills the target with
      profound disgust and remorse. This spell-like ability functions as
      terrible remorseUM. Creatures currently infected with purple pox take a -2
      penalty on saving throws against this ability.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Wrong One uses its remorseful aspect spell-like ability against intruders,
  preferring victims already suffering from purple pox. When an opponent gets
  within its reach, the Wrong One attacks with its claws.
Morale: >-
  The Wrong One fights to the death unless Mam or Pap commands it to stop
  fighting.
