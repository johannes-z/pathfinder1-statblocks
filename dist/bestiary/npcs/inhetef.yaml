BeforeCombat: >-
  Inhetef casts freedom of movement and shield of faith on himself before
  combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Inhetef activates his destruction and justice judgments in the first round,
  and attempts to dominate one of his attackers to create another ally. In
  subsequent rounds, Inhetef casts divine power and flames of the faithful on
  his battleaxe, and enters melee combat after activating his greater bane
  ability. If surrounded, Inhetef casts unwilling shield on one of his enemies,
  and if given the opportunity, he uses telekinesis to push opponents into the
  lava pool. If a baykok's infused arrow paralyzes a PC, Inhetef must succeed at
  a DC 23 Will save to resist the overwhelming urge to rush to the helpless PC
  and drain her blood&#8211;he hasn't fed properly in ages. With his shoes of
  the firewalker and spider climb ability, Inhetef can move through most places
  in the Fire Crypt with little trouble.
Morale: >-
  Inhetef fights until reduced to 0 hit points, at which point he assumes bat
  swarm form and flees toward his sarcophagus in area D5. If the wall hasn't
  been broken down, he changes into a centipede swarm and crawls through tiny
  cracks in the wall nearby. Once in his sarcophagus, Inhetef is helpless for 1
  hour until he regains 1 hit point.
Gear: >-
  +2 horn lamellarUE, +2 vicious battleaxe, cloak of resistance +2, shoes of the
  firewalkerUE, gold unholy symbol of Sekhmet (worth 50 gp)
