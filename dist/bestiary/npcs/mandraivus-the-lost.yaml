  A paladin in life, Mandraivus focuses on characters who remind him of his
  former existence. Paladins, heavily armored fighters, and clerics of militant
  or good deities are his favored targets, but anyone who wields a bastard sword
  trumps all others. As he lunges at such a target, he shrieks, "You shall not
  have Serithtial! It is mine and no other's!"
Morale: Mandraivus fights until he is destroyed.
