SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Influenced by Abyssal Runestones (Ex)
    description: >-
      A PC who carries an Abyssal runestone can attempt a DC 20 Sense Motive
      check as a free action at the start of each round. On a success, the PC
      senses that Runelord Thybidos harbors memories of awarding such items to
      his own favored servants. Forcefully presenting an Abyssal runestone is a
      standard action that forces Runelord Thybidos to attempt a DC 20 Will
      save; on a failure, the runelord ceases attacking. In this event, he drops
      to his knees, weeping, and begs the PCs t o bring him Xiren's remains once
      more. Runelord Thybidos remains in this state for 24 hours or until he is
      attacked again.
  - name: Quartered Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      When he is destroyed, Runelord Thybidos unleashes a final curse on all
      creatures within a 30-foot radus. Affected creatures suffer increasingly
      mind-numbing and soul-crushing pain in the hips, shoulders, and neck. Each
      creature in the area must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or take 1d6 points
      of Constitution damage and 1d6 points of Charisma damage. The cursed
      creature doesn't benefit from effects that remove ability damage. Once
      cursed, the target must succeed at a Will save every 24 hours (at the same
      DC) or take the ability damage again. If either ability score is reduced
      to 0, the cursed creature's arms, legs, and head tear away from the torso
      in a spectacular display, killing the creature on the spot. A creature
      slain in this manner rise s as a ghost after 24 hours have passed and
      gains the quartered curse ability as a bonus special ability. A character
      who took part in either the apprentice's or soldier's ordeal gains a +4
      bonus on saving throws against this curse (or a +8 bonus if they took part
      in both ordeals). The save DC is Charisma-based. Runelord's
  - name: Wrath (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures within a 30 -foot radius that can see Runelord Thybidos must
      succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be terrified into subservience. A creature
      that fails its saving throw gains the cowering condition for 1d4 rounds. A
      creature that successfully saves is not subject to this ability for 24
      hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Wrathful Fire (Su)
    description: >-
      Runelord Thybidos can shoot a beam of fire from his burning heart as a
      ranged touch attack with a range of 60 feet (no range increment). On a hit
      , this fire deals 3d6 points of fire damage. This does not provoke an
      attack of opportunity. He can use this a ttack and make both claw attacks
      in 1 round using a full attack action. On a hit , this fire deals 3d6
      points of fire damage.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Runelord Thybidos attacks the nearest PC on the first round of combat,
  switching targets to any PC who seems particularly effective at harming him as
  needed. The first time he attacks a PC who carries an Abyssal runestone, he
  hisses and staggers back, that round of attacks wasted as he says,
  "Aaaahhhh... you carry proof of the ordeal... I shall suffer you to live as my
  gift to you!" Thereafter, he does not attack a PC who carries an Abyssal
  runestone unless the PC continues to attack him, in which case he f ocuses his
  fury on that character while shouting, "Traitor! Betrayer!"
