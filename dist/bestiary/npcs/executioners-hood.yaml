SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Engulf (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although it is a Tiny monster, an executioner's hood can drop onto the
      head of a Medium or smaller creature as a standard action. If the hood's
      attack succeeds, it can immediately make a grapple check to grab its
      target and constrict. The hood's crawling tendrils wrap themselves tightly
      around its victim, seeking entry into the creature's ears, nose, and
      throat, making it difficult to remove. Any attacks against the hood deal
      half damage to the hood and half to its grappled target inside.
  - name: Strangle (Ex)
    description: >-
      A grappling executioner's hood entirely covers its opponent's head with an
      airtight grip. A creature that is grappled by the hood cannot speak or
      cast spells with verbal components and must hold its breath (see
      Suffocation, Core Rulebook 445) unless it doesn't use its head to speak or
      breathe.
  - name: Vulnerability to Alcohol (Ex)
    description: >-
      Strong alcohol harms an executioner's hood. Every quart poured on it
      causes 1 point of damage. Four quarts of alcohol incapacitates it and
      forces it to release a grappled target.
DuringCombat: >-
  The executioner's hoods drop down onto creatures below them and attempt to
  constrict and strangle their victims. If they miss, they make their laborious
  way back to the ceiling to try again.
Morale: >-
  The hoods fight to the death unless confronted with enough alcohol to damage
  them, at which point they try to flee back up to the ceiling or down the well.
