SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Beguiling Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature sexually attracted to women runs the risk of being beguiled
      by Neriad if it looks upon her beauty from a distance of 30 feet or less.
      If the creature fails a DC 28 Will save, it is immediately fascinated.
      Neriad may use her suggestion spell-like ability at will against creatures
      that are fascinated by her beguiling aura. This is a mind-affecting
      compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
