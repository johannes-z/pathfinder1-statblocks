SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Judgments (Su)
    description: >-
      Heshlak can pronounce judgment on her foes as a swift action. Starting
      when the judgment is made, she receives a bonus or special ability based
      on the type of judgment made. Once activated, this ability lasts until the
      combat ends, at which point all of the bonuses immediately end. She must
      participate in the combat to gain these bonuses. If she is frightened,
      panicked, paralyzed, stunned, unsconscious, or otherwise prevented from
      participating in combat, the ability does not end, but the bonuses do not
      resume until she can participate in the combat again. When Heshlak uses
      this ability, she must select one type of judgment to make. As a swift
      action, she can change this judgment to another type. The two judgment
      types Heshlak uses in this combat are as follows: Protection: Heshlak is
      surrounded by a protective aura, granting a +2 profane bonus to Armor
      Class. Destruction: Heshlak is filled with divine wrath, gaining a +3
      profane bonus on all weapon damage rolls.
  - name: Precise Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever Heshlak and an ally who also has this feat are flanking the same
      creature, Heshlak deals an additional 1d6 points of precision damage with
      each successful melee attack. This bonus stacks with other sources of
      precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If warned of the PCs' approach, Heshlak casts bless on herself and the
  cultists, drinks her potion of cat's grace, and casts flames of the faithful
  on her whip, granting it the flaming burst weapon special property for 6
  rounds (caster level +1 round as a transmutation spell).
DuringCombat: >-
  Once the PCs are in range, Heshlak casts spiritual weapon on a spellcaster,
  pronounces a judgment of destruction against the party, and moves forward to
  threaten any PC entering the room with her whip. She tries to stay out of the
  PCs' reach, letting cultists engage them while using her whip's reach to
  dominate the floor, expending a swift action to activate her bane ability,
  selecting the most common humanoid subtype among the Pathfinders. She
  positions herself to have multiple PCs within 10 feet, if possible, and uses
  her action each round to either strike a target of the subtype of her bane
  ability or to make trip attacks. She gleefully takes attacks of opportunity
  against anyone within range who provokes them. If attacked, she trips her
  assailant and steps away, laying into them with the whip if trapped.
  Confronted by multiple assailants at once, she switches her judgment to
  protection and lashes about her as best she can.
Morale: >-
  Heshlak refuses to surrender. If brought below 15 hit points, and a PC is
  between her and the opening to the  central well, she attempts a bull rush to
  knock her enemy and herself into the shaft for a 60-foot drop.
Gear: potion of cat's grace, potion of cure serious wounds
