BeforeCombat: Roscasco drinks a potion of bear's endurance and a potion of invisibility.
DuringCombat: >-
  Roscasco observes the PCs for as long as possible while invisible, to see
  whether they trigger a trapped iron maiden (see Traps below) and to move to a
  more advantageous position. If any of the PCs are obvious spellcasters, he
  uses martial flexibility to gain the Disruptive and Spellbreaker feats;
  otherwise, he uses it to gain Greater Weapon Focus (unarmed strike) and Step
  Up. Once the fight begins, he attempts to bull rush foes into the entrapping
  iron maidens.
Morale: >-
  Roscasco falsely believes he is important to the Seal-Breaker cause, and this
  delusion compels him to fight to the death.
Gear: >-
  potions of bear's endurance (2), potions of cure serious wounds (2), potion of
  invisibility
OtherGear: >-
  +2 light fortification studded leather, +1 buckler, +1 punching dagger, amulet
  of mighty fists +1, cloak of resistance +1, gauntlet of the skilled maneuver
  (bull rush)UE, crude humanoid figurine made of rat fur
