SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fade (Su)
    description: >-
      Cadimus irregularly fades in and out of existence- attacks against him
      take a 50% miss chance as a result, as if he were under the effects of
      displacement.
  - name: Hellfire Burst (Su)
    description: >-
      Cadimus may release a wave of brimstonereeking hellfire in a
      30-foot-radius burst five times per day dealing 14d6 points of damage,
      half of which is fire and half of which is raw unholy power (Reflex DC 24
      half ).
  - name: Teleporting Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, as part of his corrupting touch attack, Cadimus may
      teleport a creature in a random direction (roll 1d8, with 1 indicating
      north and the other numbers indicating compass directions going clockwise)
      and to a random distance (1d10 x 100 feet). A teleported creature arrives
      in the closest open space to the determined destination. Creatures may not
      be teleported in this way beyond the necropolis walls. A successful DC 22
      Will save negates this effect.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Cadimus begins combat by unleashing a hellfire burst, then follows with
  corrupting touch attacks. As long as his body hasn't been looted of his whip,
  Cadimus can make his corrupting touch attacks via this whip to a reach of 15
  feet&#8211;this attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity as a normal
  whip does. He pursues foes throughout the necropolis, but cannot do so beyond
  its walls.
Morale: Cadimus fights until destroyed.
Gear: >-
  whip, ghost touch bracers of armor +2, cloak of resistance +2, ring of force
  shield
