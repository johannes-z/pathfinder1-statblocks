SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animate Flames (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an ukobach can animate an existing Small or larger
      fire. Doing so requires the ukobach to succeed at a DC 15 Wisdom check as
      it impresses its will upon the fire. This DC increases by +5 for every
      size category of the flame above Small. If it's successful, the flame
      animates and follows the ukobach's mental commands, functioning as a fire
      elemental of the same size. The flame remains animate for a number of
      rounds equal to the ukobach's Wisdom modifier- usually 3-after which it
      returns to being simple flame, setting the square it ceases moving in
      alight or being extinguished, as its surroundings warrant.
  - name: Ember (Ex)
    description: >-
      An ukobach can hurl a red-hot ember as an improvised thrown weapon that
      deals 1d6 points of fire damage. A thrown ember has a range increment of
      10 feet.
  - name: Fire Leap (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, an ukobach occupying the same space as a fire, a pool
      of lava, a vent of searing steam, or a similar blaze (such as the fire
      plumes in the smithy ruins) can teleport from that burning feature and
      emerge from another within 100 feet. This ability functions similarly to
      dimension door, but only between fires. Upon entering a flame, an ukobach
      is instantly aware of all flames within range through which it might exit.
      If an ukobach enters a flame and there are no others to exit through
      within 100 feet, the devil's movement immediately ends and it is stunned
      for 1 round. Fire-Breathing (Su) An ukobach can spend a standard action to
      guzzle a pint of oil, alcohol, or a similarly flammable fluid and hold the
      combustible liquid within its body. At any point within 10 minutes of
      doing so, the ukobach can ignite and expel the liquid as either a 10-foot
      cone or a 20- foot line of fire, dealing 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex
      DC 14 half). Once it has breathed fire, an ukobach cannot make use of this
      ability again until it drinks another pint of flammable liquid. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Scorch (Su)
    description: >-
      An ukobach's touch is searing hot, and its natural weapons and any metal
      weapons it grasps deal an additional 1d4 points of fire damage.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  From hiding, Brextur attempts to animate one of the fire plumes as a Small
  fire elemental, which then attacks the PCs. If the devil remains undetected,
  he continues this tactic. If he's spotted, Brextur stays to defend his home,
  but uses his flame leap ability to move around the battlefield through the
  fire plumes.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, Brextur offers unconditional
  surrender, pleading for his life and cursing "the Inheritor and her lackeys
  for ever coming to Kantaria."
