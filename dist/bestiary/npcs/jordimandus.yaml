SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Demonically Obese (Ex)
    description: >-
      While Jordimandus's fat grants a +4 natural armor bonus, it reduces his
      base speed to 10 feet.
  - name: Heart of Slime (Su)
    description: >-
      Jordimandus's heart grants a +6 profane bonus to Constitution and renders
      him immune to critical hits and sneak attacks. The heart also effectively
      makes him immortal by ceasing his aging and nourishing him. Oozes do not
      attack Jordimandus as a result of his unholy heart. If all four of the
      variant ochre jellies in the surrounding pipes are slain, Jordimandus's
      access to the life-giving humors ceases and his heart begins to decay. He
      immediately loses all the benefits granted him by the heart, and
      furthermore takes 1d6 points of Constitution drain each day until he
      perishes.
Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: evocation, illusion
BeforeCombat: >-
  Jordimandus casts mage armor and unseen servant daily. Once he realizes his
  maze is invaded, he casts stoneskin, see invisibility, false life, fly, and
  quickened shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jordimandus starts combat by summoning monsters, using quickened acid arrows
  while he does. He resorts to offensive spells only once there's a nice group
  of summoned monsters to protect him from melee. He stays in his throne until
  menaced in melee, at which point he uses flight, dimensional steps, and
  dimension door to stay away from the PCs. Jordimandus carries his rod of
  absorption at all times&#8211;he does not carry a weapon at all, relying
  entirely on magic in combat.
Morale: >-
  Jordimandus is something of a coward&#8211;if he's brought down to fewer than
  30 hit points, he drops to his knees and begs for his life. While he can't
  leave this room without dying, he's learned quite a lot about Runeforge and
  its inhabitants&#8211; information that the PCs can use to their advantage
  (see Treasure, below).
