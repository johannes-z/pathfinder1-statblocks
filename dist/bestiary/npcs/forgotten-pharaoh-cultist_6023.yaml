BeforeCombat: The cultists cast shield before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The cultists work together as a team to take advantage of their Outflank
  teamwork feat. They make Power Attacks with their falchions, preferring melee
  combat to spellcasting, though if the opportunity presents itself, or if they
  are having trouble hitting opponents, they cast true strike (which does not
  incur a spell failure chance). If need be, the cultists cast magic weapon on
  their falchions from their scrolls.
Morale: >-
  The cultists fight to the death, which triggers their Troth of the Forgotten
  Pharaoh feat, destroying their bodies. If knocked unconscious or capture seems
  inevitable, a cultist activates his Troth of the Forgotten Pharaoh feat as an
  immediate action to avoid capture and questioning.
Gear: potion of heroism, scrolls of magic missile (2), scrolls of magic weapon (2)
OtherGear: >-
  studded leather, +1 heavy crossbow with 20 bolts, mwk falchion, cloak of
  resistance +1, gilt wooden funerary mask (worth 25 gp), 23 gp
