BeforeCombat: >-
  If Barl hears the sounds of combat nearby, he stations his stone giant
  bodyguard near the entrance. Once that guard notices the PCs approaching, he
  calls out to Barl, who casts fly and spectral hand if he has the chance.
DuringCombat: >-
  Barl activates his Sihedron medallion's false life on the first round of
  combat. He would rather let his bodyguard fight his fights while he remains
  seated on his throne, casting spells from there. If the PCs manage to reach
  him in melee, he sighs heavily, lifts his earth breaker, and responds in kind.
  If one of the PCs is killed, Barl gets a gleam in his eye and casts animate
  dead on the body the first chance he gets, more to see the anguish of the new
  zombie's onetime allies than out of any real sense of tactics.
Morale: >-
  Barl is no stranger to death, but does not want to die himself. If reduced to
  fewer than 15 hit points, the giant drops his weapon and begs for his life.
  He's willing to reveal much of what Mokmurian has planned for the region if
  the PCs are willing to grant him mercy (see Concluding the Adventure, below).
Gear: wand of enervation (12 charges)

  [arcana]), Sihedron medallion, 650 gp in black onyx gems, spellbook (contains
  all prepared spells, plus all other necromancy spells of 1st&#8211;4th level)
