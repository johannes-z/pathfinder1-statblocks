BeforeCombat: >-
  When the cultist knows the PCs are closing on her, she drinks her potion of
  protection from good and her potion of bear's endurance, and uses one charge
  from her wand of greater invisibility, preparing to ambush them when they come
  within striking distance, preferably with her death attack. She has already
  placed one dose of shadow essence on her short sword.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Lissalan assassin combines greater invisibility and Spring Attack to gain
  sneak attacks on her foes, healing and applying poison to her sword as needed
  under the cover of invisibility. When her allies arrive, she flanks her foes
  to gain sneak attacks once she runs out of magical means of doing so.
Morale: >-
  Having never met a foe she couldn't best and driven by her zeal for Lissala,
  the Lissalan assassin fights until she is likely too close to death to escape.
  If reduced to 10 hit points or less, she attempts to flee.
Gear: >-
  potion of bear's endurance, potion of protection from good, scroll of cure
  moderate wounds, scroll of fly, wand of greater invisibility (2 charges),
  shadow essence (2 doses)
