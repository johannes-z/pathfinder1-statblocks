BeforeCombat: >-
  Nedowyn casts heroes' feast for the Fearless Crows in the morning, and its
  effects are included in his statistics above. In addition, he casts greater
  magic weapon on his rapier and magic vestment on his armor early every
  morning.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nedowyn begins a combat by casting shield of faith, then joins Tanti in melee
  to support her. He relies primarily on channeled energy to keep the group
  healed, often using his Quick Channel feat to activate the ability as a move
  action and then get a bit more healing in with a spell. He relies on magic for
  ranged attacks, and abandons melee to aid allies with recovery spells like
  remove paralysis or breath of life as needed, but knows his role as a
  frontline combat companion to Tanti is as important to the group's success, so
  that the other Crows can hold back and provide support.
Morale: Nedowyn fights to the death.
Gear: scroll of air walk, scroll of heal
