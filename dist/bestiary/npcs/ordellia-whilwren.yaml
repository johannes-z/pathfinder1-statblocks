    description: >-
      In death, Ordellia manifested a power she considers a gift from Desna. As
      part of casting a spell of 4th level or lower with a range of touch,
      Ordellia can send forth a fluttering streak of incorporeal moths that can
      deliver the effect to targets within 60 feet. For offensive effects, this
      ability manifests as a ghostly starknife rather than moths.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ordellia never anticipates combat, so she prepares spells she thinks would be
  most helpful for whatever situations come up in a busy city like Magnimar. She
  spends most of her prepared spells and cleric spell-like abilities to aid the
  citizens of her namesake district.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ordellia uses her frightful moan to scatter combatants. She prefers to use her
  spells in a fight, but resorts to her corrupting touch ability when faced with
  exceptionally dangerous or evil opponents.
Morale: >-
  After years of being bound to her beloved city district, Ordellia is convinced
  she's not going anywhere anytime soon. As such, she fights until destroyed.
Gear: >-
  bracers of armor +2, headband of alluring charisma +2, silver holy symbol of
  Desna
