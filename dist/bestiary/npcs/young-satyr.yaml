BeforeCombat: >-
  This young satyr is lost, having become separated from his patrol when they
  fled the diseased dryads. His initial attitude toward the PCs is unfriendly,
  as he suspects them of involvement in the spreading plague. He only attacks if
  the PCs attack him or reduce him to hostile.
DuringCombat: >-
  Without his weapons, the satyr attempts to keep as much distance between
  himself and the PCs as possible. He uses fear, suggestion, and sleep to
  eliminate PCs from the fight, targeting the most threatening PCs first. He
  already cast summon nature's ally III to escape from the infected dryads'
  glade, but the monster he summoned was killed.
Morale: If reduced to fewer than 10 hp, the satyr attempts to flee into the woods.
