BeforeCombat: >-
  Before setting out for Corpselight, Kuryn cast spell immunity, selecting
  vampiric touch and ray of enfeeblement. As Kuryn and his acolytes approach the
  town and set their sights on the PCs, he casts eagle's splendor, prayer, and
  divine power, in that order.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kuryn initiates combat by casting consecrate and follows up by channeling
  energy to harm undead. The following round, he casts searing light at the PC
  he judges to be the greatest threat (note that this does not affect the PCs as
  if they were undead). From then on, he alternates channeling energy to harm
  the PCs and to heal his acolytes, using flame strike, searing light, and sound
  burst if directly attacked.
Morale: >-
  If convinced the PCs are not truly the undead they appear to be, Kuryn calls
  off the attack. Otherwise, he fights to the death, fully willing to make the
  ultimate sacrifice for the Lady of Graves.
