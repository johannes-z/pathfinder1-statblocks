  - name: Abyssal Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      A howler's bite and quills are considered to be chaotically aligned and
      evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
  - name: Howl (Su)
    description: >-
      A howler's constant howling is a grating, exhausting baying that can drive
      listeners insane. All beings other than outsiders within 120 feet of a
      howling howler must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or become cursed by the
      creature's howl. Once a creature becomes cursed in this way, he suffers no
      additional penalty for being exposed to additional howlers' howls until
      the current curse is lifted. This is a sonic mindaffecting effect. The
      save DC is Charisma-based. Howler Howl: Curse; save Fort DC 12 negates;
      frequency 1/hour; effect 1 Wis damage; cure 1 save.
  - name: Pain (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a creature takes damage from a howler's quill attack or quill
      defense, he must make a DC 14 Reflex save or bits of the quills break off
      in his flesh, causing the target to become sickened until the quill
      fragments are removed. Removing quill fragments requires a DC 20 Heal
      check made as a full-round action-on a failed check, the quills are still
      removed but the process causes 1d4+1 points of damage. The save DC is
      Dexterity-based.
  - name: Quill Defense (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature that strikes a howler with a non-reach melee weapon, an
      unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d4+1 points of piercing damage
      from the howler's quills.
DuringCombat: >-
  As soon as they notice the PCs, the howlers use their howl attack on the first
  round of combat to alert the rest of the Asmodean Knot, then rush in to bite
  and thrash about with their quills.
Morale: The howlers fight to the death.
