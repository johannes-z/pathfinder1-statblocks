SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ki Pool (Su)
    description: >-
      By spending 1 point from his ki pool, Momota can make one additional
      attack at his highest attack bonus, but he can only do so when making a
      full attack. In addition, he can spend 1 point to increase his speed by 20
      feet for 1 round. Finally, Momota can spend 1 point from his ki pool to
      give himself a +4 insight bonus on Steath checks for 1 round. Each of
      these powers is activated as a swift action. As long as he has at least 1
      point in his ki pool, Momota treats any Acrobatics check made to jump as
      if he had a running start.
  - name: No Trace (Ex)
    description: >-
      Momota has learned to cover his tracks, remain hidden, and conceal his
      presence. The DC to track him using the Survival skill increases by +1. In
      addition, his training gives him a +1 insight bonus on Disguise checks and
      opposed Stealth checks whenever he is stationary and does not take any
      actions for at least 1 round.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Momota climbs one of the temple's walls and prepares two shuriken with his
  doses of drow poison as well as his siangham with one of the other two poisons
  in his possession (GM's choice) and resheathes the blade. If he has time, he
  also drinks his potion of shield of faith. Once positioned, he uses Stealth to
  hide himself from immediate notice.
DuringCombat: >-
  Momota begins by spending a ki point to make a second shuriken attack, hoping
  to get off two sneak attacks and deliver his doses of drow poison against two
  targets before the PCs know what hit them. On the following round, he uses his
  vanishing trick (invisible for 5 rounds as the invisibility spell, costs 1
  point from his ki pool) and drops to the ground, where he fights with his
  siangham.
Morale: >-
  Momota is loyal to the Aspis Consortium only so long as his superiors in the
  Golden League have a means of hearing of this disloyalty. He surrenders if
  Leska is killed, but otherwise fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  potion of shield of faith, potion of blur, drow poison (2 doses), giant wasp
  poison (1 dose), large scorpion venom (1 dose), smokestick
OtherGear: >-
  +1 studded leather, masterwork siangham, masterwork shuriken (5), cloak of
  resistance +1, 2 gp
