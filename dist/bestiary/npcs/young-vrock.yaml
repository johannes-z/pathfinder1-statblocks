SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dance of Ruin (Su)
    description: >-
      A vrock can dance and chant as a full-round action-at the end of 3 rounds,
      a crackling wave of energy explodes from the vrock, dealing 5d6 points of
      electricity damage to all creatures within 100 feet. A DC 17 Reflex save
      halves this damage. For each additional vrock that joins in the dance, the
      damage increases by 5d6 and the DC to avoid the effect increases by +1, to
      a maximum of 20d6 when four or more vrocks are dancing (the DC continues
      to increase with additional vrocks, but the damage does not). The dance
      immediately ends and must be started anew if any of the participating
      vrocks is slain, stunned, or otherwise prevented from dancing. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
  - name: Spores (Ex)
    description: >-
      A vrock can release a cloud of spores from its body once every 3 rounds as
      a free action. Adjacent creatures take 1d8 points of damage from the
      spores, plus 1d4 points of damage per round for 10 rounds as the spores
      grow into thick green vines. Although ugly, the vines are harmless and
      wither away in 1d4 days if not shaved off before then. The spores can be
      destroyed by casting bless on the affected creatures or by sprinkling them
      with holy water. This attack can also be halted by effects that remove or
      provide immunity to disease.
  - name: Stunning Screech (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per hour, a vrock can emit a shrill screech. All creatures except
      demons within a 30-foot-radius spread must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude
      save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
BeforeCombat: The vrock casts mirror image if it expects battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  The vrock tries to use its spores ability at every opportunity as long as
  there is a creature adjacent to it. It uses its stunning screech the first
  time it has at least two enemies in range. Note that the vrock can fly under
  its own power at a faster speed than the ambient fly ability, so it can zoom
  around if it wants to, though it has a tendency to spin relative to the true
  gravity when it does this (so it would look upside-down to the PCs, though
  this doesn't hinder it in any way).
Morale: >-
  The demon is bound by an abyssal agreement to serve Jevana, and fights to the
  death.
