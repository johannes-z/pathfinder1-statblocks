SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Brain Consumption (Ex)
    description: >-
      When Xyoddin makes a successful grapple check to deal damage with his bite
      against a pinned or helpless living foe, the victim takes 2d4 points of
      Intelligence drain as Xyoddin consumes portions of his brain. A successful
      DC 23 Fortitude save halves this Intelligence drain. A creature reduced to
      0 Intelligence by this attack is slain. Creatures immune to critical hits
      and those with multiple heads are not killed by this attack. The save DC
      is Strength-based.
  - name: Cannibalistic Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      So long as Xyoddin has fed on human flesh within the last 24 hours, he
      gains fast healing 10.
  - name: Command Zombies (Su)
    description: >-
      Xyoddin can automatically command all normal zombies within 30 feet as a
      free action. Normal zombies never attack him unless they are compelled.
  - name: Favored Prey (Ex)
    description: >-
      Xyoddin gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls against humanoids and a +2 bonus
      on Bluff, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks when using these
      skills against humanoids. Against humans, these bonuses increase to +4.
  - name: Hungry Special Attacks (Ex)
    description: >-
      Humans take a -2 penalty on saving throws against Xyoddin's special
      attacks.
  - name: Ravenous Body (Su)
    description: >-
      Normally, Xyoddin must eat human flesh at least once every 3 days or he
      begins to starve, but the sustaining presence radiated by Runeforge
      prevents this.
  - name: Sprint (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Xyoddin can move at a speed of 300 feet when he makes a
      charge.
  - name: Telepathic Bond (Sp)
    description: Xyoddin has a permanent telepathic bond with Azaven.
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Any animal within 30 feet of Xyoddin must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or
      become panicked, remaining so for as long as it remains within this
      proximity. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Xyoddin tears free a portion of the torso's liver and eats it before combat
  begins if he has a chance, gaining the benefits of fast healing 10 for the
  fight to come.
DuringCombat: >-
  If faced with enemies that include humans in their ranks, Xyoddin's terrible
  hunger pulls him to them, causing him to ignore all non-human targets. He's
  able to hold back his ravenous urgings enough to resist taking the time to
  feast on a slain human if other enemies remain to defeat, but only barely.
Morale: Xyoddin fights until destroyed.
Gear: >-
  +3 chain shirt, +1 human bane dagger,  masterwork dagger, amulet of natural
  armor +2, cloak of resistance +1, 146 gp
