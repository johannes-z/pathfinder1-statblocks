SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Constructed (Ex)
    description: >-
      For the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as a
      ranger's favored enemy and bane weapons), androids count as both humanoids
      and constructs. Androids gain a +4 racial bonus on all saving throws
      against mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, and stun effects, are
      not subject to fatigue or exhaustion, and are immune to disease and sleep
      effects. Androids can never gain morale bonuses, and are immune to fear
      effects and all emotion-based effects.
  - name: Emotionless (Ex)
    description: >-
      Androids have problems processing emotions properly, and thus take a -4
      penalty on Sense Motive checks.
  - name: Nanite Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      An android's body is infused with nanites. Once per day as an immediate
      action, an android can cause his nanites to surge, gaining a bonus on any
      one d20 roll; this ability must be activated before the roll is made. When
      an android uses this power, his circuitry-tattoos glow with red light
      equivalent to that of a torch in illumination for 1 round.
DuringCombat: >-
  The androids attempt to capture the PCs alive, switching to nonlethal attacks
  against foes that seem about ready to fall in combat. They use Deadly Aim and
  Power Attack near the start of a fight, though, and attack to deal lethal
  damage in an attempt to soften up the PCs to a point where they can attempt to
  deliver knockout blows.
Morale: >-
  The penitent androids fight to the death unless they see Harab surrender, in
  which case they do as well.
Gear: potions of cure moderate wounds (2)
OtherGear: +2 breastplate, +1 warhammer, mwk composite longbow, 138 gp
