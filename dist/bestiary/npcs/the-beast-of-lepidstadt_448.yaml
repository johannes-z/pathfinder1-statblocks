SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Berserk (Ex)
    description: >-
      When the Beast enters combat, there is a cumulative 5% chance each round
      that it goes berserk. This increases to 10% per round when using its rage
      ability. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest
      living creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature
      is within reach, then moving on to spread more destruction. It takes 1
      minute of inactivity by the golem to reset its berserk chance to 0%.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A flesh golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. &#8226; A magical attack
      that deals cold or fire damage slows a flesh golem (as the slow spell) for
      2d6 rounds (no save). &#8226; A magical attack that deals electricity
      damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for
      every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of
      healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it
      gains any excess as temporary hit points. A flesh golem gets no saving
      throw against attacks that deal electricity damage.
  - name: Knockback (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Beast can make one free bull rush attempt against one target hit in
      melee this round. The Beast does not need to move back with the target if
      successful. This power is used as an immediate action after the attack
      roll is made.
  - name: Open Mind (Ex)
    description: >-
      Unlike other constructs, the Beast is susceptible to mind-affecting
      effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).
  - name: Rage (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Beast does not gain a bonus to its Constitution while in a rage, nor
      does it gain any extra hit points. Likewise, it is not fatigued after
      rage.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The Beast tries to avoid combat if at all possible, unless hunting a
  particular foe.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Beast begins by attempting to demoralize its target before attacking with
  its ogre hook. If faced with multiple opponents or ones who seem able to
  bypass its damage reduction, the Beast rages. While raging or berserk, the
  Beast has little grasp of tactics, pummeling a single enemy with its fists
  until it stops moving.
Morale: >-
  With no way to heal itself except its renewed vigor rage power, the Beast
  flees from battle if reduced to less than half its hit points. If berserk, the
  Beast fights until destroyed.
Gear: >-
  battered masterwork breastplate, double crossbow (see Pathfinder Chronicles
  Campaign Setting), ogre hook, boots of the mire (see Pathfinder Adventure Path
  volume #3), cloak of elvenkind, flesh golem manual, shock amulet of mighty
  fists, ragged and torn explorer's outfit, headless doll, tattered book of
  Taldan poetry, aquamarine worth 100 gp.
