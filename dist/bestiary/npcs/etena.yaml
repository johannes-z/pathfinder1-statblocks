    description: Etena's CR is reduced by 1 to account for her venerable age.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If she knows combat is imminent, Etena casts bull's strength and lead blades
  in preparation for battle. The bonuses from these spells are not included in
  her stat block.
DuringCombat: >-
  At the Sacred Forge (area Z5), Etena casts forbid action and hold person to
  prevent opponents from approaching Minderhal's Forge. If the shard slags (see
  Relighting the Forge on page 56) have awoken, Etena falls back and positions
  herself behind them, casting doom, heat metal, ray of sickening, and spiritual
  weapon to weaken and hinder opponents. If forced into melee combat, Etena
  casts divine favor and tries to stay mobile to take advantage of her dance of
  the blades oracle revelation, while wildly swinging her flaming hammer.
Morale: >-
  Etena is more than willing to martyr herself in Minderhal's name, and fights
  to the death.
Gear: >-
  +2 light fortification chainmail, +1 adamantine flaming warhammer, stone
  unholy symbol of Minderhal
