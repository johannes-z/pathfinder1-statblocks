SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Missing Leg (Ex)
    description: >-
      Cirieo's left leg has been severed at the thigh. Cirieo has a speed of 5
      feet. If he uses a wooden crutch or his sling staff to assist his movement
      (either of which requires one hand), his speed increases to 15 feet.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Cirieo prefers to fight from a position of strong advantage, either ambushing
  his foes or leading them into a prepared trap. If surprised, he relies on his
  trusty sling staff long enough to slow his enemies and then falls back to
  allies or higher ground.
Morale: >-
  Cirieo flees combat if it's going poorly-if he lives through a fight, he can
  return to solve the problem later. If doing so means abandoning allies, he
  returns as soon as possible to free any captives and tend to the wounded.
Gear: >-

  resistance +1, backpack, bedroll, coffee potUE, crutch, healer's kit, mess
