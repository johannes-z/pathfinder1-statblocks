    description: >-
      You have a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches you magic
      and helps to guide you along your path. Your familiar (Daji, a fox) also
      aids you by granting you a bonus on saving throws (see below) and helping
      with some types of magic. You must commune with your familiar each day to
      prepare your spells (just as a wizard studies a spellbook to prepare his
      spells). Your familiar stores all of the spells that you know, and you
      cannot prepare a spell that is not stored by your familiar. If a familiar
      is lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 day later through a special ritual
      that costs 500 gp per witch level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete.
      Fox familiar: You gain a +2 bonus on Reflex saves.
