BeforeCombat: Zenobia casts shield of faith before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zenobia relies on spellcasting if in her human guise, as she carries no
  weapons, saving her channel energy ability for moments when she's surrounded
  or thinks she can drop wounded foes. If encountered in her more hideous form
  after dark, she still focuses on spellcasting (her entrails allow her to make
  somatic gestures) and uses her slam attack  when an attack of opportunity
  presents itself. Note that if Kordaitra is present, the cavalier can use her
  instant order ability to grant Zenobia an additional standard action on the
  first round of combat to cast an additional offensive spell-combining flame
  strike and unholy blight is a favorite tactic. Zenobia casts divine power on
  Kordaitra as soon as possible after this tactic.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 40 or fewer hit points, Zenobia attempts to flee combat. If she
  reaches a safe place where she can cast sending, she does so to alert Vavana
  Dhatri of the attack on Deathhead Vault. She is loath to abandon her body, but
  will if forced to do so. In this case, she can be encountered again in Castle
  Korvosa, fighting alongside Vavana in the defense of the False Ileosa.
Gear: >-
  dusty rose prism ioun stone, headband of mental prowess +2 (Wis, Cha), golden
  unholy symbol of Urgathoa
