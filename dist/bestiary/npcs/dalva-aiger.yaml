SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Tumor Infestation: Injury; save Fort DC 17; onset 1 minute; frequency
      1/day; effect 1d2 Con and 1d2 Cha; cure 2 consecutive saves. Anyone who
      dies from tumor infestation turns into a hungry flesh 1d4 hours later.
  - name: Mutated Infestation (Ex)
    description: >-
      Dalva's tumor infestation has caused her body to begin producing its own
      mutagen, allowing her to "consume" her mutagen as a swift action without
      actually drinking it or provoking an attack of opportunity. It takes 4
      hours for her body to create a new reserve of mutagen, and Dalva's present
      reserve is a Strength mutagen.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Dalva hides under the operating table to  escape the ghastly specters she
  thinks are flitting about the room. If she hears combat in area C1, she
  consumes her extracts of barkskin, spider climb, and jump in that order.  
  Dalva activates her mutagen at the beginning of combat and viciously attacks
  anyone in sight. She uses her exceptional mobility to leap from combat to rain
  bombs upon the PCs. Despite her altered mental state, she maintains knowledge
  of her equipment and class abilities along with considerable cunning.
Morale: Dalva fights until killed or subdued.
