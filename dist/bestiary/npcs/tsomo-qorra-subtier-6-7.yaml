SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Frenzy (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a malenti that takes damage in combat can fly into a frenzy
      in the following round. It gains +2 Constitution and +2 Strength, but
      takes a -2 penalty to its AC. The frenzy lasts as long as the battle or 1
      minute, whichever is shorter.
  - name: Speak with Sharks (Su)
    description: >-
      A malenti can communicate telepathically with sharks to a distance of 150
      feet. This communication is limited to simple concepts, such as "come
      here," "defend me," or "attack this target." Splash Weapon Mastery When
      throwing a splash weapon, Tsomo acts as if he has the Far Shot feat. When
      Tsomo hits with a splash weapon, select one additional square adjacent to
      the splash area; creatures in this area also take splash damage. When
      Tsomo misses with a splash weapon, he may adjust the miss direction on the
      grid by +1 or -1. This feat appears in Pathfinder Player Companion:
      Adventurer's Armory.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Tsomo arrived at the docks before the PCs, he drinks his potion of
  barkskin. The bonus from this spell is not included in his statistics.
DuringCombat: >-
  On his first turn, Tsomo throws the grenade he is holding at the PCs. Whenever
  possible, he uses his grenades to split PCs apart and force them into the
  water, where he attacks with his ranseur. He uses Power Attack to activate
  shield of blades and uses Vital Strike and attacks of opportunity when able.
Morale: >-
  The PCs have cornered Tsomo, and he refuses to allow the PCs to capture him
  alive. If reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, he drinks his potion of cure
  moderate wounds.
