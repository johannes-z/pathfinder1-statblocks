SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aging Effects (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although Kerdak Bonefist is of old age, he has imbibed 2 doses of sun
      orchid elixir (The Inner Sea World Guide 301). As a result, he suffers
      none of the penalties while retaining the bonuses of his advanced age.
  - name: Exceptional Resources (Ex)
    description: >-
      As Hurricane King of the Shackles, Kerdak Bonefist has the wealth of a PC
      rather than an NPC, and his ability scores use a 20-point build. These
      advantages increase his CR by 1.
  - name: Pirate Tricks (Ex)
    description: >-
      With a DC 20 Profession (sailor) check once per day, Bonefist can double
      his ship's base movement for 1 round. He gains a +1 competence bonus on
      attack rolls with a cutlass, rapier, or short sword. He can drink for free
      and gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks in
      any of his 10 "favored taverns." If he deals damage with his sneak attack,
      Bonefist can make an Intimidate check as an immediate action to demoralize
      the damaged opponent. As a full-round action once per day, Bonefist can
      shout orders to his crew; any allies within 30 feet who can hear him gain
      a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls or on a particular skill check for 10
      rounds. Bonefist treats all storms as if they were one category less
      severe for the purposes of sailing and navigation. He can make an
      Acrobatics check to move his normal speed across uneven ground, and does
      not take a penalty on any Acrobatics checks due to slightly slippery,
      slightly unsteady, or moderately unsteady conditions.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  When opponents board the Filthy Lucre, Bonefist drinks potions of barkskin and
  shield of faith. In addition, his stat block includes the bonuses from the
  lord's banner of victory flying from the mainmast. Before stepping on deck, he
  uses the Hurricane Crown to cast winds of vengeance.
DuringCombat: >-
  Bonefist dusts himself with dust of disappearance and activates his boots of
  speed, using his sniper goggles to make sneak attacks at range with his
  pistol. Whenever possible, he makes full attacks, using his Rapid Shot and
  Deadly Aim feats. He uses his invisibility and flight to stay out of reach of
  melee combatants, and his Snap Shot feats to make attacks of opportunity with
  his pistol. If possible, Bonefist tries to remain within 40 feet of enemies to
  take advantage of his pistol's touch attack. In melee combat, Bonefist uses
  his vampiric touch ability and rapier, but retreats again to range as soon as
  possible.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, Bonefist flees belowdecks to heal
  himself and ambush pursuers. Arrogant and stubborn to the last, Bonefist
  refuses to abandon his ship and fights to the death to keep his crown.
Gear: >-

  potions of barkskin +5 (2), potions of cure serious wounds (2), potion of
