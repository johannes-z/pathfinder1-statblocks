SpecialAbilities: []
BeforeCombat: Mangvhune uses his wand of greater invisibility to become invisible.
DuringCombat: >-
  Mangvhune's signature move is to use a death attack to paralyze a foe by
  damaging the victim's spinal cord at the base of the neck. When attacking a
  victim who's alone, he gives the victim several rounds to comprehend her doom
  before performing a second death attack to kill the victim in the same manner.
  Mangvhune much prefers delivering death attacks with his claws. When facing a
  group of foes, though, he switches tactics, preferring a cat-and-mouse game of
  death attacks made every 3 rounds while under the effects of greater
  invisibility. When he becomes visible, he gleefully spends several rounds
  attacking foes, flanking with allies if possible and making sneak attacks, or
  using darkness and his darkvision otherwise. If reduced to 100 or fewer hit
  points, he teleports to a remote area, uses his wand of cure critical wounds,
  then returns to finish the job. His wand of magic missiles is his sole ranged
  attack.
Morale: Mangvhune fights to the death.
