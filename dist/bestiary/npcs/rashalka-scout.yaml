  The scouts work in pairs to surround opponents and block their escape. The
  centaurs try to subdue opponents and capture them, but they do not hesitate to
  kill if there seems to be no other option.
Morale: >-
  Once two or more of the centaurs have fallen, one of the scouts breaks from
  combat and attempts to flee back to the centaur camp to warn Korak Kaag of the
  intruders.
