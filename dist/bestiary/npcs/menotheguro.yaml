BeforeCombat: Menotheguro casts false life on itself before entering combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The aboleth would prefer to capture PCs alive, since it can then kill them at
  its leisure and use the interaction of their souls with the Drowned Eye's
  necromantic energies to further fuel its work. If it manages to dominate a
  foe, it prefers to command the foe to simply lay down arms rather than risk
  her escaping control by forcing her to attack her allies.
Morale: >-
  Menotheguro isn't interested in risking its life for its project. If reduced
  to fewer than 50 hit points, it casts invisibility and attempts to flee. The
  monster swims as quickly as it can out to sea to seek depths where it is more
  comfortable, and if the PCs allow it to escape, it does not return to
  antagonize Acisazi.
Gear: >-
  pale blue rhomboid ioun stone, ring of protection +1 (worn on the tip of a
  tentacle), spellbook (strips of preserved seaweed inscribed with runes
  containing all prepared spells)
