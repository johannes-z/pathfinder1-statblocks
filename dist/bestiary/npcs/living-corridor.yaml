SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Closed Passage (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living corridor attacks the first creature that enters it, closing in
      around it instinctively like a sphincter. As long as the living corridor
      maintains the grapple on its opponent, other creatures cannot enter the
      corridor or pass through its opponent's space.
  - name: Vulnerability to Pain (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although a living corridor has enormous recuperative powers, it still
      feels pain, and does not willingly injure itself. Thus, the easiest way to
      move past it is to brace injurious objects along its length to prevent it
      from using its crush and constrict attacks.
