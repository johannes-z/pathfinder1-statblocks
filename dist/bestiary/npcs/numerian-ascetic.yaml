SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Constructed (Ex)
    description: >-
      For the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as a
      ranger's favored enemy and bane weapons), androids count as both humanoids
      and constructs. Androids gain a +4 racial bonus on all saving throws
      against mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, and stun effects, are
      not subject to fatigue or exhaustion, and are immune to disease and sleep
      effects. Androids can never gain morale bonuses, and are immune to fear
      effects and all emotion-based effects.
  - name: Emotionless (Ex)
    description: >-
      Androids have problems processing emotions properly, and thus take a -4
      penalty on Sense Motive checks.
  - name: Nanite Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      An android's body is infused with nanites. Once per day as an immediate
      action, an android can cause her nanites to surge, granting a bonus equal
      to 3 + the android's character level on any one d20 roll; this ability
      must be activated before the roll is made. When an android uses this
      power, her circuitry-tattoos glow with light equivalent in illumination to
      that of a torch for 1 round.
