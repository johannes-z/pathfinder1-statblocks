  - name: Sudden Charge (Ex)
    description: >-
      When making a charge attack, an axe beak makes a single bite attack. If
      successful, it may also attempt to trip its opponent as a free action
      without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the axe
      beak is not tripped in return.
