SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Corrupted Flames (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a creature begins its turn within Pyralisia's shroud of flame, it
      must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or gain 1d4 temporary negative levels as
      the spell enervation. Whether or not this save is successful, an affected
      creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Pyralisia uses flyby attack and favors her spell-like abilities in combat. She
  uses her fiery attacks to damage foes while simultaneously healing the iron
  golems in area C1.
Morale: >-
  Pyralisia fights to the death. If she self-resurrects in the Abyss, she must
  attempt at a DC 25 Will save. If she succeeds, she returns as a neutral good
  phoenix; if she fails, she returns in her neutral evil form. An atonement
  spell cast on her remains before her self-resurrection allows her to
  automatically succeed at this saving throw. If restored to a good alignment,
  she pledges her aid to the PCs and promises to help them in whatever way she
  can.
