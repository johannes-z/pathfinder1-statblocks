BeforeCombat: Dinvaya casts magic vestment on her chainmail.
DuringCombat: >-
  Dinvaya casts giant vermin on the first round of combat; in the Clockwork
  Chapel, there are always plenty of normal spiders crawling around to be
  targeted by this spell. She follows this with magic at range. If reduced to
  fewer than 18 hit points, she casts sanctuary on herself and attempts to flee
  combat. If she's fighting with allies, she prefers to play the role of healer
  rather than combatant.
Morale: >-
  If she's reduced to 6 or fewer hit points and believes her enemies are capable
  of mercy, Dinvaya surrenders. Otherwise, in such a situation where she can't
  escape, she doesn't waste time healing herself and instead desperately fights
  to the death.
