SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Misfortune (Su)
    description: >-
      Every creature within 10 feet of a fortune-spurned creature gains the
      diminished criticals and unlucky strike special qualities of the
      fortune-spurned template as long as it remains within range. Furthermore,
      each such creature takes a - 4 penalty on all checks and saving throws.
  - name: Calamitous Mishap (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action once per encounter, a fortune-spurned creature can cause
      some calamity to befall itself and another creature within 5 feet of it.
      The mishap selected must be a possible result of normal circumstances, but
      it can be the worst possible result. For instance, lightning could strike
      both the fortune-spurned creature and its foe on a cloudy day, or it could
      strike a tree, causing a heavy limb to fall on both targets, but lightning
      could not strike out of a clear sky. Alternatively, ropes holding up some
      scaffolding might break, the lock on a portcullis might slip, or the floor
      of a ruined keep might give way. In some cases, the fortune-spurned
      creature might be unable to cause any calamity given its surroundings. A
      calamity cannot affect more than the fortune-spurned creature and a single
      adjacent creature of its choice. Nearly any natural misfortune may be
      chosen, but it must be one that is as dangerous to the fortune-spurned
      creature as it is to the other creature. Both targets must be affected
      equally-that is, both must make the same saving throw and suffer the same
      result. Thus, if the fortune-spurned creature is immune or resistance to
      electricity it could not choose to have lightning strike both it and its
      foe unless the foe is equally resistance to electricity.
  - name: Cursed (Ex)
    description: >-
      A fortune-spurned creature takes a - 2 luck penalty on all opposed checks
      and saves, and a -1 luck penalty on all attack rolls. These penalties are
      figured into the creature's stats.
  - name: Diminished Criticals (Ex)
    description: >-
      A fortune-spurned creature must roll twice to confirm a critical hit.
      Fortune-Spurned
  - name: Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per month, Baillaset can curse up to 25 humanoids, permanently giving
      them his fortune-spurned template. Baillaset has already used this ability
      this month cursing the Zyphus cultists.
  - name: Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)
    description: >-
      A raise dead or similar spell cast on a wight destroys it (Will negates).
      Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.
  - name: Twist of Fate (Su)
    description: >-
      The first time in any given day that a fortune-spurned creature rolls a
      natural 20 on a saving throw, it fails the save. This twist of fate
      happens only once per day.
  - name: Unlucky Strike (Su)
    description: >-
      When a fortune-spurned creature attacks with a weapon and rolls a natural
      1, it drops the weapon unless it can make a successful Reflex save (DC
      14). If it attacks with a natural weapon and rolls a natural 1, it
      provokes an attack of opportunity from its target, even if that creature
      would not otherwise be entitled to make one.
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Baillaset is unaware of the PCs' approach, he's hanging corpses over the
  bloody trench by the west wall. If he's aware that the PCs are coming, he
  waits in the 10-foot square just west of the entrance to this room, ready to
  ambush the first PC through the door.
DuringCombat: >-
  Baillaset gets in close and stays there, preferring to take out one target at
  a time, fully aware of the effect of his aura of misfortune.
Morale: >-
  Baillaset fights until destroyed-when destroyed, he evaporates in a bloody red
  mist.
