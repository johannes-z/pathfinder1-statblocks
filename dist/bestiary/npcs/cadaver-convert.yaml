    description: >-
      When a Cadaver convert is slain, its body disintegrates in a burst of
      negative energy, leaving its gear in a heap on the ground. The negative
      energy deals 1d8 points of damage in a 10-foot-radius burst (Will DC 10
      half). Undead creatures in the burst radius are instead healed of a like
      amount of damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
