SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Shark for an Arm (Su)
    description: >-
      The shark accidentally summoned into Beez's body grants him several
      abilities, including a bite attack each round, the ability to breathe
      underwater, and scent. Once blood is drawn in combat, there is a 50%
      chance each round that Beez can't control his shark arm, and it attacks
      him that round instead of his opponent.
DuringCombat: >-
  Beez bellows for the PCs to get out and hurls a barrel at them. If they stay,
  he attacks the next round. He only activates his rage if the PCs previously
  punished him.
Morale: >-
  Beez only wanted to be alone to brood, and stops his attack and begs for mercy
  if reduced below 20 hit points.
