BeforeCombat: >-
  The smugglers stay hidden in their barrels as they assess who the PCs are and
  what they're doing in the room.
DuringCombat: >-
  If the PCs are unaware of the smugglers, the rogues attack from their barrels
  with surprise (by rising from a crouch as a free action and hurling daggers or
  tanglefoot bags). If both parties are aware of one another, roll initiative
  normally. They do everything they can to keep the PCs from going through the
  west doors, flanking and sneak attacking when possible.
Morale: >-
  The smugglers are terrified of the Pure Legion discovering them and fight to
  the death to avoid capture.
