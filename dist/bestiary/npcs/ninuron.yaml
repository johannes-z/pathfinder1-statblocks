  - name: Exiled (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ninuron has been exiled from the Dimension of Time. He cannot enter that
      dimension again, nor can he enter areas particularly infused with the
      dimension's energies (such as the Therassic Library below Jorgenfist). As
      long as his exile continues, he remains immortal and does not
      age-something others might consider a boon, but to a dragon, who grows
      more powerful only with age, it has been agony. In this adventure, nothing
      can remove this effect from the time dragon, but depending on the PCs'
      actions in the last adventure of Return of the Runelords, they might be
      able to release Ninuron from his strange fate.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: Ninuron casts mage armor on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ninuron starts combat by casting glitterdust on the party to disrupt tactics
  and then takes to the air and uses his breath weapon on the second round. He
  then lands and attacks in melee. Once reduced to 125 hp or fewer, he casts
  invisibility to retreat, takes to the sky, and begins using his ranged spells
  mixed with breath weapon attacks. If at any point it appears that Ninuron is
  about to destroy the party entirely, the dragon relents and offers the PCs a
  chance to submit to his demands. In this case, he doesn't ask for the PCs' aid
  in exploring the Therassic  Library-he expects it from those he has bested in
  combat. Even at his angriest, the dragon doesn't want to slaughter the PCs, as
  he hopes they can help him. He avoids using his breath weapon against foes
  that are likely to immediately perish, nor does he attack foes who look like
  they might be on their last legs. Judge the fight as appropriate, and be ready
  for Ninuron to offer mercy instead of killing a PC if the time comes.
Morale: >-
  Ninuron fights until he is reduced to fewer than 75 hit points, at which point
  he calls for a truce, offering each PC a choice of treasure from his hoard
  (see page 6) if they let him live and assist him.
