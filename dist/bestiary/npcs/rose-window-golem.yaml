SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dazzling Brightness (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stained glass golem in an area of bright light dazzles any creature
      within 30 feet that sees it (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Once a creature
      makes a save against this ability, it is immune to that golem's brightness
      for 24 hours. The DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Immune to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stained glass golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that
      allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against a stained glass golem, as noted here. A shatter spell
      damages a stained glass golem as if it were a crystalline creature. A keen
      edge spell affects all of a stained glass golem's slam attacks as if they
      were slashing weapons. A magical attack that deals cold damage slows a
      stained glass golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds (no saving throw). A
      magical attack that deals fire damage ends any slow effect on the golem
      and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would
      otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed
      its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A
      stained glass golem gets no saving throw against fire effects.
  - name: Reflect Spells (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a free action once every 1d4 rounds, a stained glass golem can align
      its internal structure to enhance its resistance to magic for 1 round.
      During this time, the golem reflects spells (even spells that function
      differently against the golem as described in its immune to magic ability)
      as if under the effect of a spell turning spell.
DuringCombat: >-
  The golem begins combat by leaping onto a creature from its perch (requiring a
  ranged touch attack and dealing 3d3 points of damage) and relying on its
  hardness to resist the damage to itself. It uses its reflect spells ability as
  often as possible.
