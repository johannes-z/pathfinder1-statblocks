    description: >-
      Ambithas has extensively studied arcane magic, allowing him to prepare
      spells from the sorcerer/ wizard spell list in addition to the cleric
      spell list. At the start of the day, Ambithas chooses to prepare either
      cleric or wizard spells; he is unable to prepare spells of the type not
      chosen. Ambithas can change which spells he can prepare by meditating for
      8 hours. Ambithas knows all wizard spells and can prepare any spell from
      memory. He gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat.
