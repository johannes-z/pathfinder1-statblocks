DuringCombat: >-
  The keches attempt to wait until a PC is within 5 feet before attacking,
  hoping to get a rend attack on the first round of combat. Unlike charau-ka,
  the keches are disturbingly silent when they fight.
Morale: A kech reduced to fewer than 9 hit points attempts to flee into the jungle.
