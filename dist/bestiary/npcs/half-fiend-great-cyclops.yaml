DuringCombat: >-
  The half-fiend great cyclopes prefer to fight in melee, and are capable of
  inflicting punishing blows since they prefer to attack with the aid of Power
  Attack. They use their spells against those who try to fight at range, but
  aren't afraid to take to the air to attack as well since the prison's spines
  won't fire on them.
Morale: Ever loyal, the two half-fiend great cyclopes fight to the death.
Gear: +2 breastplate, +1 wounding glaive
