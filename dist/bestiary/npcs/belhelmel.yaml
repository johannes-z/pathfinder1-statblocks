SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Creeping Necrosis (Su)
    description: >-
      Type disease-injury; save DC 14; onset 1 day; effect 1 Str damage and 1
      Dex damage and 1 Con damage as the flesh dies and peels away from the
      bones; frequency 1/day; cure 2 consecutive saves; Special burning the
      infected area with at least 2 points of fire damage within an hour of
      infection reduces the save DC to 6.
  - name: Daemonic Glare (Su)
    description: >-
      A belhelmel can stun its prey with its deep, unblinking eyes. As a
      standard action, the belhelmel can attempt to stagger a single target
      within 30 feet unless the target makes a DC14 Will save. The DC is
      Constitution-based. This is a mind-affecting effect.
  - name: Fondness for Flesh (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a sizable amount of fresh meat is available, the belhelmel has a 50%
      chance at the start of its turn of breaking off its attack and proceeding
      to the food instead (dead or unconscious creatures are considered food as
      well). It continues to eat for 2 rounds per pound of flesh (up to 5
      pounds) or until attacked.
  - name: Strangle (Ex)
    description: >-
      By crushing the victim's windpipe between its long fingers, the belhelmel
      can deliver a coup de grace using its natural weapon.
