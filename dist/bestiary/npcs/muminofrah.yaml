DuringCombat: >-
  Muminofrah is not a warrior and she knows it. She prefers to defuse any
  potentially hostile situation with her skills or spells, making full use of
  charm person, suggestion, reckless infatuation, or unnatural lust. Failing
  that, she lets her guards deal with any threat. If hard-pressed, Muminofrah
  uses her necklace of fireballs, even sacrificing her own guards if it means
  she can escape.
Morale: >-
  Muminofrah surrenders as soon as it becomes clear she and her guards will not
  prevail, offering her captors a sizable ransom for her release. She has more
  than enough money, but only one life, and she's willing to spend as much of
  the former as is necessary to preserve the latter.
Gear: necklace of fireballs (type III)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 dagger, bracers of armor +2, ring of protection +1, noble's outfit, signet
  ring, jewelry (worth 500 gp)
