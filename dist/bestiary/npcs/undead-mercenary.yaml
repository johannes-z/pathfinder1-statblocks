BeforeCombat: >-
  The undead mercenaries stand guard in the lobby. If they detect the PCs trying
  to break in, they take positions on either side of the double door to ambush
  the PCs once they enter. If an opportunity presents itself, the undead
  mercenaries shoot at the PCs through the arrow loops, but they only do so
  after the PCs start trying to break down the door.
DuringCombat: >-
  The undead mercenaries focus their attacks on obvious spellcasters, especially
  divine spellcasters, before moving on to attack the other PCs. If the PCs are
  easily hitting them, the undead mercenaries adjust their tactics to fight
  defensively. The undead mercenaries begin combat using Power Attack, but if
  after 2 rounds they find it difficult to hit the PCs, they instead attack
  normally.
Morale: >-
  If still alive after 5 rounds, the undead mercenaries shout to call for
  reinforcements from the south barracks (area D2). They fight until destroyed.
