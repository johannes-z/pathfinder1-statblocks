SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Accuracy (Ex)
    description: >-
      A sniper halves all range increment penalties when making ranged attacks
      with a bow or crossbow. This ability replaces trapfinding. Ranger's
  - name: Focus (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a guide can focus on a single enemy within line of sight as
      a swift action. That creature remains the ranger's focus until it is
      reduced to 0 or fewer hit points or surrenders, or until the ranger
      designates a new focus, whichever occurs first. The ranger gains a +2
      bonus on attack and damage rolls against the target of his focus. This
      ability replaces favored enemy.
  - name: Snap Shot (Ex)
    description: >-
      A rogue with this talent may treat her initiative roll as a 20 for a
      surprise round, regardless of her initiative, but she may only take an
      attack action with a ranged weapon. Her normal initiative roll is used in
      subsequent rounds. If two or more rogues possess this talent, their
      initiative determines the order in which they act, but they all go before
      any other creature. If a rogue is prevented from acting in the surprise
      round, this talent has no effect.
DuringCombat: >-
  The tribal hunters hold back in combat, using their longbows to pick off
  enemies if possible. Once the enemy engages them in melee, they abandon their
  bows and work in pairs to flank foes so they can make sneak attacks with their
  axes.
Morale: >-
  These tribal hunters fight to the death as long as the Radiant Muse
  lives&#8211;if they know she is dead, they flee combat once reduced to 15 or
  fewer hit points.

  darkvision, smokestick, thunderstone
