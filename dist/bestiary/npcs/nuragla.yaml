  - name: Skewer (Ex)
    description: >-
      Pit hags are masters at combat using the trident. In the hands of a pit
      hag, a trident deals damage as if it was one size category larger (usually
      2d6). In addition, if the pit hag hits with a trident and a claw attack in
      1 round, she can rend as if she had hit with two claw attacks. Spells A
      pit hag casts spells as an 11th-level sorcerer.
DuringCombat: >-
  When all of the hellwasps have been unleashed, Nuragla tries to further weaken
  the PCs with spells such as crushing despair, fireball, lightning bolt, and
  wall of fire before attacking with her unholy trident. If possible, she tries
  to throw weakened opponents down the stairs and into area D6 (see that area
  for details).
Morale: >-
  Nuragla tries to flee if reduced to fewer than 80 hit points (see Development,
  below).
Gear: +2 unholy trident, gold bracelets and anklets worth 500 gp total
