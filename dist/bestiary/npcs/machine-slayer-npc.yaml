  - name: Arc Grenade (Ex)
    description: >-
      An arc grenade is a splash weapon with a range increment of 20 feet,
      generally thrown at a grid intersection rather than a creature. When armed
      and thrown, it detonates at the beginning of the machine slayer's next
      turn. The explosion deals 5d6 points of electricity damage to all targets
      within a 20-foot-radius spread (Reflex DC 15 half). An arc grenade weighs
      1 pound and is worth 750 gp.
