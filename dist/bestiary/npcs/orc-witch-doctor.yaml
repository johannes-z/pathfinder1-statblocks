BeforeCombat: The witch doctor casts false life and mage armor on herself before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Before enemies reach the orcs, the witch doctor casts cloudkill in their
  midst. She then casts fly on herself so she can cast additional spells and
  uses hexes from above her enemies' melee reach. The witch doctor typically
  spends a couple of rounds weakening her strongest foes using   enervation and
  ray of exhaustion, then begins blasting with evocation spells.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds, wand of ray of exhaustion (4 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  mwk dagger, sling with 20 stones, belt of incredible dexterity +2, bracers of
  armor +1, cloak of resistance +1, ring of protection +1, 98 gp
