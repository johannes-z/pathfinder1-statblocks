BeforeCombat: >-
  Gnaeus casts bear's endurance, bull's strength, and shield if he can before
  combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Gnaeus feels vulnerable without his armor (which remains in his mistress's
  collection for now), so he casts invisibility and then displacement before he
  sets himself up for a good attack against the least-armored target. If he's
  not been able to cast his three preparatory spells, Gnaeus casts them as well
  before making his first attack. He uses arcane pool to enhance his first
  attack with shocking burst.

  Gnaeus surrenders if the charm monster effect in place on him is dispelled;
  otherwise, he fights to the death.
