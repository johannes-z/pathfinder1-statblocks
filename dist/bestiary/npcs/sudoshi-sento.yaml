BeforeCombat: Sento casts fly before fighting to maximize his movement options.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Sento attempts to demoralize his opponents with
  his Intimidate skill. Once he enters combat, Sento uses his flurry of blows to
  attack any enemies within reach, spending a swift action each round to exploit
  an enemy's weakness. Against a single foe, Sento uses Spring Attack to make a
  stunning fist attack and attempt to stagger his opponent, before closing in to
  attack with flurry of blows.
Morale: >-
  If seriously injured, Sento uses a withdraw action to fly upward, quickly
  casting darkness to hide until his regeneration restores his lost hit points.
  Defeat is inconceivable to Sento, so he fights until slain.
OtherGear: >-
  amulet of mighty fists +2, belt of physical perfection +2, bracers of armor
