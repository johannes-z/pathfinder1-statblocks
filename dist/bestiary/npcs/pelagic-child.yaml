SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blinding Light (Ex)
    description: >-
      A pelagic child can radiate a 60-foot-radius aura of blinding light as a
      free action. Creatures within the affected area must succeed at a DC 26
      Fortitude save or be permanently blinded. A creature that successfully
      saves cannot be affected again by the same pelagic child's aura for 24
      hours. The save is Constitution-based.
  - name: Breathing Skin (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because a pelagic child's skin aids in its breathing, it takes a -2
      penalty on Fortitude saving throws against gases and other inhaled
      effects.
  - name: Burning Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      A pelagic child corrupts the positive energy within a living creature into
      an unnatural burning light. For the next 5 rounds after a successful touch
      attack by a pelagic child, the target takes 2d6 points of fire damage. The
      burning light can be extinguished by casting darkness or deeper darkness
      on the target or if the target enters an area of natural darkness (not
      counting the light from the burning target).
  - name: Radiant Armor (Su)
    description: >-
      The light that surrounds a pelagic child grants it a deflection bonus to
      its AC equal to its Charisma bonus. The bonus is negated as long as the
      pelagic child is in the area of effect of a spell with the darkness
      descriptor that is at least 3rd level.
  - name: Searing Ray (Su)
    description: >-
      A pelagic child's primary attack is a ray of searing light. This attack
      has a range of 120 feet. The ray deals double damage to undead creatures.
      This attack functions underwater and is not blocked by the surface of a
      body of water.
BeforeCombat: If they expect trouble, the pelagic children each cast spell turning.
DuringCombat: >-
  Pelagic children attempt to separate their opponents with wall of force and
  turn them against each  other with scintillating pattern. They use their
  searing rays and touches against isolated foes.
Morale: Bound to serve Auberon, the pelagic children fight to the death.
