  The draugr captain focuses its attacks on the strongest-looking or
  best-armored foe in sight, fragments of its martial pride driving it to engage
  those it interprets as worthy combatants rather than to focus on archers,
  spellcasters, or scoundrel types.
Morale: The draugr captain fights until destroyed.
