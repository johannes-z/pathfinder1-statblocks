SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blackfire Pact (Su)
    description: >-
      Sophini gains a +1 profane bonus on saving throws, caster level checks,
      Charisma checks, and Charisma-based skill checks against daemons.
  - name: Blackfire Taint (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Sophini can create a destructive resonance between
      herself and a target within 30 feet. She gains a +1 profane bonus on
      attack rolls and caster level checks against the target, and the target
      takes a -1 penalty on saving throws against Sophini's attacks (&#8211;2 if
      the attack is a conjuration effect). The taint lasts for 3 rounds, though
      a successful DC 13 Will save reduces this to 1 round. The effect ends
      immediately if the target moves more than 30 feet away from Sophini.
  - name: Expanded Summoning List (Su)
    description: >-
      Sophini is able to summon a vargouille with summon monster III, and she
      can summon a yeth hound with summon monster IV. These are in addition to
      her normal options when casting summon monster spells.
Gender: Female
ProhibitedSchools: necromancy, transmutation
BeforeCombat: >-
  Sophini casts mage armor, mirror image, heroism, see invisibility,
  invisibility sphere, and shield when she senses trouble, such as if she sees a
  blackfire candle glowing or hears an alarm. She then continues her
  interrogation of Jahani while both she and the Riftwarden are invisible.
DuringCombat: >-
  Sophini summons allies while invisible and then employs a combination of area
  control spells and offensive spells to divide and strike down her enemies. She
  makes regular use of her shift arcane school ability to stay out of reach.
Morale: >-
  If Sophini reduced below 30 hit points but believes she still has many allies
  in the compound, she casts dimension door to rally the ceustodaemons and
  guards to attack while she spends several rounds recuperating. She then renews
  the attack. If Sophini has reason to believe that her allies were defeated,
  she fights until reduced to 15 or fewer hit points before using dimension door
  to teleport away.
Gear: >-

  of shield, scroll of wind wall, wand of mirror image (13 charges)
