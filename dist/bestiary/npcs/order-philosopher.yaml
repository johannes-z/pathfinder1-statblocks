  If possible, a philosopher's first attack is a stunning fist, as she seeks to
  incapacitate her enemy swiftly rather than allow a fight to be drawn out. The
  philosophers do not seek to slay intruders unless they are given no other
  choice, and they do not pursue foes off the manor grounds.
Morale: Philosophers fight to the death when defending Peacock Manor.
