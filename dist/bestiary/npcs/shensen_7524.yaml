SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Battle Dance (Ex)
    description: >-
      When Shensen uses bardic performance to inspire courage or inspire
      greatness, the bonuses granted are doubled but apply only to her (these
      bonuses are already adjusted accordingly in her special attacks above).
      All other functions of bardic performance function normally.
  - name: Meditative Whirl (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day when using battle dance, Shensen can spend a move action to
      apply the Quicken Spell metamagic feat to any cure spell she is about to
      cast (effectively spending a move action and a swift action to cast the
      spell); this does not alter the spell's level. Reincarnated Shensen was
      born a drow noble but was reincarnated into an aquatic half-elf; she
      retains her +2 bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma from her
      birth heritage, and a +2 bonus to Dexterity from her current incarnation.
      She also retains proficiency with the hand crossbow and poison use, but
      rarely uses such weapons or tactics. She's lost all other drow abilities
      as the result of the reincarnation.
  - name: Spinning Spellcaster (Ex)
    description: >-
      Shensen gains a +4 bonus on concentration checks to cast spells
      defensively.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: Shensen casts undetectable alignment every day.
DuringCombat: >-
  Shensen opens a fight by using her rod of wonder, always eager to see what
  fate has in store, then stows the rod before moving on to casting ranged
  spells or entering melee combat. She uses her wand of haste once it appears
  she has to engage in melee combat, then activates her battle dance and Arcane
  Strike abilities (her attacks above have been adjusted to account for these
  bonuses) and prefers to remain mobile in combat, making full attacks only if
  surrounded. She relies on her spells and her wand of sound burst for ranged
  combat. She occasionally brings her rod of wonder back into the fight,
  sometimes a bit too often, intrigued and delighted as she is by the rod's
  random effects. Her bardic performances do not bolster allies, and as such she
  generally takes on a more aggressive role in battle, rather than a support
  function.
Morale: >-
  Shensen fights to the death if allies are in danger, but otherwise flees
  combat if reduced to 25 hit points or fewer&#8211;with the exception of
  combats involving apes or gorilla-like foes, in which case she'll flee combat
  if reduced to 50 hit points or less. Because there's nothing more frightening
  than an angry gorilla.
Gear: >-
  potion of fly (2), rod of wonder, wand of haste (10 charges), wand of sound
  burst (14 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +2 mithral chain shirt, +1 flaming burst mithral scimitar, mwk whip, amulet of
  natural armor +2, belt of incredible dexterity +4, headband of alluring
  charisma +4, pearl of the sirines, ring of feather falling, ring of protection
  +2, earrings, noble's clothes, 74 gp
