Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Vahnwynne casts resist fire on herself on the first round of combat, then uses
  her wooden stakes in battle. She prefers not to use her slam attack, as the
  act of energy draining shames and enrages her-but if faced with a particularly
  vexing or dangerous foe, she'll put aside her shame to use her more dangerous
  natural weapon.
Morale: >-
  Vahnwynne fights until reduced to 0 hit points, at which point she flees to
  area B23 to recover.
Gear: +1 leather armor, +1 wooden stakes (2)
