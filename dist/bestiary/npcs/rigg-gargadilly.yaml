SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Natural Invisibility (Su)
    description: >-
      A quickling is invisible when motionless. It loses this invisibility and
      remains visible for 1 round in any round in which it takes any action
      other than a free action.
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      A quickling is never at risk of poisoning itself when handling poison.
      They usually use blue whinnis on their daggers.
  - name: Supernatural Speed (Su)
    description: >-
      A quickling moves with incredible speed. Save for when it remains
      motionless (at which point it is invisible), a quickling's shape blurs and
      shimmers with this speed, granting it concealment (20% miss chance). In
      addition, this ability grants the quickling evasion and uncanny dodge (as
      the rogue abilities of the same name).
  - name: Slow Susceptibility (Ex)
    description: >-
      A quickling that succumbs to a slow effect loses its supernatural speed
      ability and is sickened.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Fond of misdirection, Rigg tries to trick the PCs into splitting up; he uses
  dancing lights and ventriloquism to lure them in multiple directions. Once
  they're spread out, he rushes in to stab one of them and then Spring Attacks
  away to find a hiding spot where he can wait a round to become invisible again
  before repeating his dangerous, annoying tactic.
Morale: >-
  If brought below 15 hp, Rigg abandons the keep and flees, perhaps becoming an
  annoying recurring villain set on revenge against the PCs for chasing him out
  of his home.
Gear: blue whinnis (5 doses)
