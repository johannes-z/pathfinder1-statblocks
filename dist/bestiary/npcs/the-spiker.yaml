    description: >-

      weapons, he gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC against melee attacks until the
      beginning of his next turn. This bonus increases by +1 every four levels
      after 3rd. This ability replaces armor training 1 and 2.
  - name: Gaze (Ex)

      save or walk to the nearest wall or stable surface and stand there
      immobile. Characters standing against the wall are unable to speak or move
      until or unless the Spiker is slain. A successful save grants immunity to
