    description: >-
      Witchlights produce a luminance in their larval stage equal to a candle in
      brightness. In their adult and elder stage the light is up to half
      torchlight intensity (bright light in a 10 ft. radius). They can change
      the intensity or extinguish this light as a free action. The glimmer is a
      steady, soft glow, and may be silvery-white or just about any color,
      though the fey that raise them favor pastel shades. Each witchlight has
      its own unique color which it cannot change.
