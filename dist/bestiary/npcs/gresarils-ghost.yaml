SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Corrupting Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Gresaril is disfigured through violence, and has a gaze attack with a
      range of 30 feet that causes 2d10 damage and 1d4 Charisma damage
      (Fortitude save negates Charisma damage but not physical damage).
  - name: Corrupting Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      All ghosts gain this incorporeal touch attack. By passing part of her
      incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard action, Gresaril
      inflicts 7d6 damage. This damage is not negative energy-it manifests in
      the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures
      immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the
      damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A Fortitude save halves the
      damage taken.
  - name: Mimicry (Ex)
    description: Gresaril can imitate the sounds of almost any animal found near her lair.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      If destroyed, Gresaril restores herself in 2d4 days. The only way to
      permanently destroy Gresaril is to put the dying curse to rest by slaying
      Tylaca and Aelzeldra.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Gresaril begins combat using her corrupting gaze ability on the PC who holds
  her fragment. In the following rounds, she lashes out at the nearest PC with
  her corrupting touch.
Morale: >-
  Enraged and bitter, Gresaril fights until destroyed. Once destroyed, she
  repossesses the fragment and emerges from it again at midnight in 2d4 days.
