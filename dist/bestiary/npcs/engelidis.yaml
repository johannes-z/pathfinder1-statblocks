DuringCombat: >-
  On her own, Engelidis uses her area-affecting spells to damage as many foes as
  possible as quickly as possible. When fighting alongside King Irovetti, she
  takes a more supportive role, targeting those foes who seem to be specifically
  causing her lover the most harm and trouble.
Morale: >-
  As long as she's charmed by Irovetti, Engelidis fights to the death. If the
  charm monster spell on the spirit naga is removed or dispelled, Engelidis
  won't see things Irovetti's way. In fact, her rage and hatred in such a
  situation compels her to do everything in her power to murder
  Irovetti&#8211;as in the case with the remorhaz Rezatha, this gives the PCs a
  chance to swiftly recruit the king's allies against him in a battle. Of
  course, in her rage, Engelidis is unwilling to retain her loyalty to the PCs
  after Irovetti is dead; she tries to escape at once, and if the PCs oppose her
  flight, she attacks them as well. Engelidis knows about the sword Irovetti
  keeps hidden in area T3. She offers up its location as a bargaining chip to
  the PCs if she thinks that could help to buy her freedom and she's too wounded
  to carry on a fight against them.
