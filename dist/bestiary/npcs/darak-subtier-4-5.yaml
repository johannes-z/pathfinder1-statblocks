BeforeCombat: >-
  If aware of approaching enemies, Darak consumes his potion of blur before
  combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Darak uses the table or altar to gain a height advantage against the PCs. He
  attempts to position himself to make the most of his Improved Trip and
  Whirlwind Attack feats. If he suspects the presence of an invisible opponent,
  he uses his dust of dryness (currently in its pellet form) to flood the room,
  creating a thin layer of water on the floor so he can see his foes'
  footprints.
Morale: >-
  If Darak is reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, he attempts to fall back to
  Telda's position in area C5.
