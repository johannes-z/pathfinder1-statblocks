BeforeCombat: >-
  Once Natalya knows combat is nearing (likely after she hears the PCs fighting
  elsewhere in her hideout), she uses her wand of mage armor. She uses a scroll
  of shield as soon as she can once she fears combat will begin.
DuringCombat: >-
  Natalya uses charm person on non-spellcasters, and grease on beams or ladders
  leading to her position to prevent anyone from reaching her in melee. She
  prefers fighting at range with her crossbow and acid splash, but if forced
  into melee combat relies on her magically increased AC to protect her as she
  moves around to try to get into positions where she can use sneak attack. If
  she's confronted by two or more foes in melee, or if she's reduced to 10 or
  fewer hit points, she uses the Shard of Pride to create a major image of her
  shooting flames out of the shard to light the room on fire&#8211;she takes
  care to not put any PC directly in the flames, but puts up illusory fire
  between herself and any enemies.
Morale: >-
  Natalya's megalomania prevents her from fleeing or surrendering. If the PCs
  wish to take her alive, they'll need to keep that in mind and use appropriate
  tactics on her.
Gear: >-
  scrolls of shield (2), wand of mage armor (11 charges), smokestick, tanglefoot
  bag
