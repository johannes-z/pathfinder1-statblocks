BeforeCombat: >-
  When the fallen researcher comes out of stasis, it immediately consumes its
  cognatogen and its barkskin, false life, and stoneskin extracts. These effects
  are reflected in its stat block. (False life has not been accounted for, and
  you must roll to determine the number of temporary hit points it receives.)
DuringCombat: >-
  The fallen researcher prefers to use shock bombs since it and the Mutate are
  immune to electricity. It switches to fire bombs if the PCs appear resistant
  to electricity and drinks its targeted bomb admixture extract to increase its
  damage.
Morale: The fallen researcher fights to the death.
Gear: potion of greater magic fang, cognatogenUM
