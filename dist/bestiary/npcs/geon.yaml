SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animate Boulders (Sp)
    description: >-
      A geon can animate rocks within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two
      rocks at a time. Boulders move at a speed of 10 feet and fight as a geon
      in all respects. Animated boulders lose their ability to move if the geon
      that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. The ability is
      otherwise similar to liveoak (caster level 15th), but affects rocks rather
      than trees. Animated boulders have the same vulnerability to cold that a
      geon has.
