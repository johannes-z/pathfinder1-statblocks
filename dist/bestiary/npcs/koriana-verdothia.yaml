BeforeCombat: >-
  Koriana avoids drinking her mutagen before she meets the PCs, lest doing so
  would inhibit her negotiating skills.
DuringCombat: >-
  Koriana endeavors to keep Jyrnas or Mandas between her and any serious melee
  threats. She throws bombs, using her precise bombs discovery to select out
  Thalia, her wares, and her allies in that order. If she has no clear target,
  she drinks extracts and her mutagen until she has an opportunity to strike
  with bombs or poison.
Morale: >-
  Koriana is certain Thalia will see her imprisoned for life or exiled, but that
  is preferable to death. She surrenders when reduced to 4 or fewer hit points.
