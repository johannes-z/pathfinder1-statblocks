    description: >-
      Nefti is a prodigy of the Aspis Consortium, and the organization recruited
      him and began training him for service early in his life. As a result, his
      ability scores were generated using 25 points, rather than the standard 15
      points used to create most NPCs. This modification increases his total CR
      by 1.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Following Kafar's hunch about their impending meeting with the Diamond Sage,
  Nefti has cast heroism on himself and Kafar.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nefti uses his spells to inconvenience and incapacitate the PCs, sparing a
  moment to cast mirror image if attacked. If his foes disappear into one of
  Kafar's stink bombs, Nefti drinks his potion of delay poison, inspires
  courage, and joins his partner in the melee.
Morale: >-
  Nefti surrenders if reduced to 8 or fewer hit points or if Kafar attempts to
  parley with the PCs. If Kafar is unconscious, Nefti offers to parley. Should
  the PCs refuse to negotiate, Nefti casts calm emotions and attempts to settle
  matters diplomatically.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of delay poison, scrolls of comprehend
  languages (2), acid (2)
