SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Shadow Blend (Su)
    description: >-
      During any conditions other than bright light, a shadow demon can
      disappear into the shadows as a move-equivalent action, effectively
      becoming invisible. Artificial illumination or light spells of 2nd level
      or lower do not negate this ability.
  - name: Sprint (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per minute, a shadow demon increase its fly speed to 240 feet for 1
      round.
  - name: Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shadow demon is utterly powerless in bright light or natural sunlight
      and flees from it. A shadow demon caught in such light cannot attack and
      can take only a single move or standard action. A shadow demon that is
      possessing a creature using magic jar is not harmed by sunlight, but if it
      is struck by a sunbeam or sunburst spell while possessing a creature, the
      shadow demon is driven out of its host automatically.
