  - name: Integrated Laser Cannon (Ex)
    description: >-
      A pulsepounder's integrated laser cannon has a range of 300 feet, and
      firing it in melee doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Rather than
      firing a single shot, a pulsepounder can fire a blast of energy from this
      cannon as a standard action. When it does so, it doesn't attempt an attack
      roll; it simply targets a point within a maximum range of 300 feet. The
      robot must have line of effect to the target when it launches a blast; if
      the blast impacts a solid object before reaching the target area, it
      explodes at that point. The blast fills a 20-foot-radius spread, and all
      creatures caught in the blast radius take 10d6 points of fire damage
      (Reflex DC 20 half). The save DC is Intelligence-based.

    description: >-
