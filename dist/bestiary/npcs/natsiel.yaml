SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Passion (Su)
    description: >-
      Natsiel drains energy from a mortal she lures into an act of
      passion-unwilling victims must be grappled before she can use this
      ability. The passion bestows 1 negative level. She can use this ability up
      to 10 times a day; removing 1 of these negative levels requires a
      successful DC 20 Fortitude save.
Bloodline: Abyssal
BeforeCombat: Natsiel casts false life at the start of every day, as well as mage armor.
DuringCombat: >-
  Natsiel casts greater invisibility on the first round of combat, then
  stoneskin, shield and bull's strength over the next few rounds (or once the
  alarm is raised, either by Strea in room A3 or by hearing PCs hammering on the
  doors to the north from area A8). She relies on her green hags to distract
  foes while casting these spells, then switches over to spells like feeblemind,
  dominate person, scorching ray, and magic missile. If she enters melee combat,
  she tries to cast haste first. In any event, she always uses Arcane Strike to
  bolster her damage (this +3 bonus on damage rolls is calculated into her
  attacks above). Once her greater invisibility spell is about to expire (or as
  soon after it's dispelled), she casts mirror image.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 30 or fewer hit points, Natsiel uses dimension door to teleport
  out of the area to the city above, then flees to the Church of Asmodeus to
  offer her aid to Barzillai Thrune in destroying the PCs. Barzillai doesn't
  trust Natsiel that much, but knows that he can use as many allies as he can
  secure. He agrees to provide healing to the half-succubus and to assign her
  several erinyes devils as minions. Natsiel can make additional attacks on the
  PCs for the remainder of the adventure as you see fit, and could even be part
  of the final retaliatory attack on the PCs during the celebration at the end
  of the adventure (see page 62).
Gear: >-
  +1 human-bane rhoka sword, amulet of mighty fists +1, belt of mighty
  constitution +2, boots of elvenkind, cloak of resistance +2, key (unlocks all
  doors in the area), 775 gp
