SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bramble Jump (Su)
    description: >-
      A twigjack can travel short distances between brambles, shrubs, or
      thickets as if via dimension door as part of a move action. The twigjack
      must begin and end this movement while in an area of at least light
      undergrowth. The twigjack can travel up to 60 feet per day in this manner.
      This movement must be used in 10-foot increments and does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity.
  - name: Splinterspray (Ex)
    description: >-
      A twigjack can eject a barrage of splinters and brambles from its body
      three times per day as a standard action. This effect creates a 15-foot
      conical burst of jagged splinters, dealing 4d6 points of piercing damage
      to all creatures in the area. A DC 14 Reflex saving throw halves this
      damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
BeforeCombat: >-
  If the twigjacks detect intruders in Briar Henge, they use their bramble jump
  ability to assault the intruders from two different sides.
DuringCombat: >-
  The twigjacks are quick to use their splinterspray ability against groups of
  PCs. The twigjacks move to flank opponents when possible to benefit from their
  sneak attack ability.
Morale: The twigjacks fight to the death.
