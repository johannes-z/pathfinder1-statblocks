BeforeCombat: >-
  Leptonia casts magic vestment on her breastplate and greater magic weapon on
  her +1 anarchic halberd. She casts air walk on herself as the second wave
  begins and silence on a cultist at the start of the third wave.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Leptonia casts quickened shield of faith and
  hungry pit to control the battlefield. She follows this up on the next 2
  rounds with spiked pit and create pit. Since she cast air walk, she doesn't
  have to worry too much about her own navigation around these spells. If the
  PCs are able to navigate pits as  well, she switches to casting chaos hammer,
  unholy blight, and perhaps dispel magic. She stays as mobile as possible to
  avoid full attacks against herself. Once confronted, she moves to fight
  alongside the cultists or the nyogoth. If she's reduced to 50 hit points or
  fewer, she casts sanctuary on herself, or perhaps meld into stone, then heals
  herself as best she can before returning to the fight, entering melee only
  once foes are either scattered or softened up or she's out of offensive
  spells. Note that she's treated the blade of her halberd and all four of her
  daggers with doses of polymorph plague, so the first foe she wounds with each
  is exposed to the affliction (see page 9). She channels negative energy
  whenever she's surrounded.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 25 hit points, or if it becomes obvious to Leptonia
  that she has no chance of securing the scrolls for herself, she casts word of
  recall to return to area A6 in the Gecko. There, she recovers what allies and
  equipment she can from the site, leaving Og-Zeugus imprisoned if it still
  lives, and turns her attention to the long task of rebuilding her cult and the
  shorter task of securing revenge against the PCs. Her most likely plot is to
  travel to Kaer Maga and join up with Erigantus, in which case the PCs can
  encounter her again in the Shrine of the Seal. In this case, feel free to
  augment the shrine's defenses with a few more qlippoth called in via planar
  ally spells.
Gear: potions of cure moderate wounds (2)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 breastplate, +1 anarchic halberd, mwk daggers (4), amulet of natural armor
  +1, belt of mighty constitution +2, iron holy symbol of Yamasoth, 25 gp
