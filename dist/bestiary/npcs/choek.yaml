DuringCombat: >-
  Choek's spell-like abilities are not particularly potent, but the id ooze
  still uses quickened confusion each round for the first 3 rounds of combat,
  resorting to its normal confusion attacks only when desperate and facing foes
  it can't engage in melee.
Morale: >-
  Choek fights to the death, but if its opponents call for a truce at any time,
  the id ooze relents&#8211;it doesn't hold grudges.
