BeforeCombat: >-
  The high cultists cast mage armor each day. A high cultist who anticipates
  combat casts protection from energy of a type that seems most helpful (usually
  fire).
DuringCombat: >-
  Although high cultists prefer to turn enemies into pawns with charm person,
  they attempt to quickly dispatch powerful foes with lightning bolt, magic
  missile, and searing light. High cultists shun melee and cast unadulterated
  loathing to compel melee fighters to keep their distance, or drink a potion of
  invisibility to sneak away to a better tactical position.
Morale: High cultists fight to the death.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds,  potion of invisibility
