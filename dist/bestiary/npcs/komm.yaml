SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Beard (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a bearded devil hits a single opponent with both claw attacks, it also
      lashes at the same target with its spiky, filthy beard. The victim takes
      1d8+2 points of damage and must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or
      contract devil chills. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Infernal Wound (Su)
    description: >-
      The damage a bearded devil deals with its glaive inflicts persistent
      wounds that cause 2 points of bleed damage. Bleed caused from an infernal
      wound is particularly difficult to stanch; a DC 17 Heal stops the damage,
      and any attempt to heal a creature suffering from an infernal wound must
      succeed on a DC 16 caster level check or the spell does not function.
      Success indicates the healing works normally and stops all bleed effects
      on the victim. The infernal wounds caused by a bearded devil are a
      supernatural ability of the devil, not of the weapon.
