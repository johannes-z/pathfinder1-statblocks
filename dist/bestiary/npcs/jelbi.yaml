BeforeCombat: Jelbi's statistics above include the effects of Nedowyn's heroes' feast.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jelbi starts an audible bardic performance to inspire courage in herself and
  allies and casts greater invisibility. She casts haste as early in the combat
  as she can to affect all of the Fearless Crows, then moves on to use her
  offensive spells against opponents. If her greater invisibility ends, Jelbi
  casts it again unless she's out of 4th-level spell slots, in which case she
  casts mirror image instead. In melee combat, she always uses Arcane Strike,
  but she's ready to cast purging finale to get allies back in a fight or saving
  finale if an ally fails an important saving throw, restarting her inspire
  courage bardic performance on her next action.
Morale: >-

  she flees Barleybridge.
