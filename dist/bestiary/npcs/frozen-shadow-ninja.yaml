SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fast Stealth (Ex)
    description: A ninja can move at full speed using the Stealth skill without penalty.
  - name: Ki Pool (Su)
    description: >-
      A ninja has a pool of ki points, supernatural energy she can use to
      accomplish amazing feats. As long as she has at least 1 point in her ki
      pool, a ninja treats any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if she had
      a running start. By spending 1 point from her ki pool, a ninja can make
      one additional attack at her highest attack bonus, but she can do so only
      when making a full attack. In addition, she can spend 1 point to increase
      her speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a ninja can spend 1 point from
      her ki pool to give herself a +4 insight bonus on Stealth skill checks for
      1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action.
  - name: No Trace (Ex)
    description: >-
      A ninja learns to cover her tracks, remain hidden, and conceal her
      presence. The DC to track a ninja using the Survival skill increases by
      +1. In addition, her training gives her a +1 insight bonus on Disguise
      skill checks and on opposed Stealth checks whenever she is stationary and
      does not take any action for at least 1 round.
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      A ninja is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison
      herself when applying poison to a weapon.
DuringCombat: >-

  necessary.
