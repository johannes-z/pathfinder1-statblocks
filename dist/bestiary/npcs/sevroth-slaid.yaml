DuringCombat: >-
  If the PCs attack the complex, Sevroth orders the brigands to attack the PCs
  at range, using the gate as cover, while she observes the fight for a few
  rounds. If the PCs seem to be gaining the upper hand after a few rounds, she
  calls for a cease-fire and invites the PCs in to speak about a truce. In a
  fight herself, Sevroth focuses her attacks on the group's healers, using
  martial flexibility to gain Power Attack.
Morale: >-
  Sevroth surrenders if brought below 8 hit points and becomes quite cooperative
  with the PCs; the information she can share with them is detailed in
  Development, below.
