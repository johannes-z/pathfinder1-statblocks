BeforeCombat: >-
  The monk uses Stealth to find a hiding spot in an effort to gain the element
  of surprise.
DuringCombat: >-
  The monk uses Deflect Arrows to close in on ranged combatants. He uses Lunge
  to keep enemies at bay and flurry of blows to trip multiple opponents if
  surrounded, allowing him the full benefit of his Combat Reflexes when tripped
  opponents try to stand. A swift brawler uses Power Attack against enemies he
  has tripped or stunned, only risking the penalty on his attack rolls when his
  target's AC has been compromised in some way.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds, potion of mirror image
