    description: >-
      Kjaerulff is of venerable age. The resulting adjustments to his ability
      scores decreases his CR by -2.
Gender: Male
Bloodline: Boreal*
BeforeCombat: Kjaerulff casts mage armor before confronting any strangers.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kjaerulff casts obscuring mist over his opponents, then charges into combat to
  overrun foes with his Charge Through feat. He uses Arcane Strike and cold
  steel to make his axe into a +1 frost greataxe, focusing his attacks on
  spellcasters. If disarmed, he uses his wand of elemental touch to make cold
  attacks with his slams.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 40 hit points, Kjaerulff casts enlarge person and
  uses Power Attack. He pursues enemies until they are in sight of the road but
  does not follow them onto it. As long as intruders are trespassing in the
  barrow-lands, he never surrenders, fighting to the death to protect this
  sacred ground.
Gear: scroll of ventriloquism, wand of elemental touch* (12 charges)
OtherGear: greataxe, gold-plated astrolabe (worth 500 gp)
