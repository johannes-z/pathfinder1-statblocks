DuringCombat: >-
  Mezuk takes pride in being strong enough to defeat his foes without having to
  draw his greatsword, which he prefers to reserve for handling particularly
  "serious" foes. He attempts to demoralize foes while wielding his mace, but
  draws his sword if reduced below 16 hit points or faced with an enemy wielding
  an equally impressive weapon.
Morale: >-
  Mezuk is a stubborn combatant who keeps fighting so long as he seems to have
  any chance of winning. He flees only if both of his accomplices are defeated
  and he is faced with overwhelming odds.
