BeforeCombat: >-
  Given opportunity, Skulgrym casts vampiric touch on himself for his opening
  attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  Skulgrym begins combat by casting silence on his axe, then casts hold person.
  He focuses his death-stealing gaze on lightly armored foes, figuring they're
  more susceptible to the effects. If reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, he
  casts deeper darkness, then tries to summon 1d4 babaus before teleporting out
  of the crypt to cast regenerate. He waits a few rounds before teleporting back
  into area J3, then casts vampiric touch and sneaks back into this room to
  rejoin the fight, repeating these tactics as often as needed.
Morale: >-
  If Skulgrym is brought below 25 hit points and no longer has any healing
  magic, he teleports to safety and does not return to this location. He may
  return to this region to track down the PCs for revenge at a later date if you
  wish.
