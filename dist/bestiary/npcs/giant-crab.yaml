SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Constrict (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant crab can crush an opponent, dealing bludgeoning damage, after
      making a successful grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused
      by a successful check, including additional damage).
  - name: Grab (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a giant crab hits with its claws, it deals normal damage and attempts
      to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
      opportunity. Grab works only against opponents at least one size category
      smaller than the creature. The creature has the option to conduct the
      grapple normally, or simply use the part of its body it used in the grab
      to hold the opponent. If it chooses to do the latter, it takes a -20
      penalty on its CMB check to make and maintain the grapple, but does not
      gain the grappled condition itself. If a giant crab does not constrict,
      each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds
      automatically deals the damage indicated for the attack that established
      the hold. Otherwise, it deals constriction damage as well.
  - name: Water Dependency (Ex)
    description: >-
      Giant crabs can survive out of the water for 1 hour per point of
      Constitution. Beyond this limit, a giant crab runs the risk of
      suffocation, as if it were drowning.
DuringCombat: The giant crabs are mindless vermin and attack the nearest opponent.
Morale: The giant crabs fight to the death.
