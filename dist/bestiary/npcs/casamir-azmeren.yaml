BeforeCombat: Casamir casts create food and water every morning.
DuringCombat: >-
  Casamir spends the first few rounds of combat preparing defenses, casting
  freedom of movement and shield of faith on himself, then casting sanctuary so
  he can move with greater ease on the battlefield. He focuses his spellcasting
  on healing allies, using attack spells only if no allies appear to be greatly
  wounded.
Morale: >-
  Casamir tries to flee back to safety (preferably to the Pharus Pharasmae) if
  reduced to fewer than 10 hit points while no allies are nearby to protect him,
  wanting to try to stay alive so that he can at least call for help again via
  sending or report what happened to Windsong Abbey.
Gear: >-
  +1 studded leather, +2 starknife, cloak of resistance +1, Pharus Pharasmae
  statuette, silver holy symbol of Desna, spell component pouch, 32 gp
