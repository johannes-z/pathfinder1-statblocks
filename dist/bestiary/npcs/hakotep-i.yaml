SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      One day after Hakotep is destroyed, the necromantic energies within him
      begin to rebuild his body. This process takes 1d10 days. If the body is
      destroyed before that time passes, the process starts anew. After this
      time, Hakotep awakens fully healed. The normal methods for permanently
      destroying a mummy lord are insufficient to counteract Hakotep's
      rejuvenation. Only by placing the Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh on
      Hakotep's dead body (thus rejoining Hakotep's ka with the other fragments
      of his soul) can the Sky Pharaoh be permanently destroyed (see Concluding
      the Adventure on page 54).
Gender: Male
Bloodline: elemental (air)
BeforeCombat: >-
  Hakotep casts mage armor and false life on himself every day. As soon as the
  stone block in area E21 is opened, Hakotep casts bull's strength, mirror
  image, and shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Hakotep orders two of his shield guardians to guard him (all attacks against
  Hakotep take a &#8211;2 penalty for each golem adjacent to him) while the
  other two engage opponents in melee. Thereafter, Hakotep concentrates his
  attacks on the wearer of the Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh, preferring to use
  evocation spells he can cast at range, such as meteor swarm, polar ray,
  prismatic spray, and chain lighting, while taking advantage of the metamagic
  abilities of his crook and flail of kings.
Morale: >-
  The first time Hakotep takes damage in combat, he activates one of his shield
  guardians' shield other abilities. If reduced to 100 hit points or fewer,
  Hakotep casts tar pool to entangle as many of the PCs as possible, or casts
  mass hold person to slow them down. He then flies to reposition himself in the
  eastern portion of the room, ordering his shield guardian bodyguards to
  accompany him, and continues throwing spells at opponents. If reduced to 50
  hit points or fewer, Hakotep directs him golems to cover his retreat while he
  flees to the temple of Set (area E9). There, Hakotep kneels before the altar
  and beseeches Set for aid: "Father of Darkness! Would you deny your beloved
  our throne? We call for your aid!" Set does not answer this prayer, and
  Hakotep makes his final stand in the temple, fighting until destroyed.
