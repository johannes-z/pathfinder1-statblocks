Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Khrysm throws a bomb (she prefers acid bombs) on the first round of combat if
  there are still flat-footed targets available. She drinks an extract of shield
  otherwise (or drinks the potion on the second round), and in the next round
  uses invisibility, then makes another sneak attack with a bomb the next round.
  She repeats this tactic until she runs out of invisibility extracts and
  potions, after which point she levitates up out of reach to throw her
  remaining bombs. She saves deeper slumber for use against foes that seem
  capable of reaching her in melee easily.
Morale: >-
  When reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, Khrysm uses sound burst to try to
  stun a few PCs and then flees toward the stairs in area D8 to retreat back
  down to Nar-Voth&#8211;if she escapes, she does not return anytime soon, but
  may gather more resources to seek revenge on the PCs at a later date.
Gear: potions of cure moderate wounds (2), potions of invisibility (2), acid (4)
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork leather armor, masterwork aklys, headband of vast intelligence +2,
  key ring to doors in area D12
