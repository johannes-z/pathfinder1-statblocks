BeforeCombat: >-
  Nordris Kalm casts scrying to watch the PCs battle the invisible stalker. If
  he has time, he then uses his metamagic rod to cast the following spells on
  himself: bull's strength, divine power, and shield of faith (these spells are
  not figured into his stats).
DuringCombat: >-
  Nordris prefers melee combat, using Channel Smite to power his multiple short
  swords. If he had time to buff up before assaulting the PCs, he just charges
  in after them. If he didn't have time, he casts invisibility and sneaks up on
  the weakest-looking PC, striking when the time is right.
Morale: Nordris flees if reduced below 30 hit points.
Gear: >-
  mwk breastplate, short swords (2), amulet of natural armor +2, metamagic rod
  (extend), scabbard of keen edges
