  - name: Fiendish Sorcery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because of Ogash's strong connection to the forces of Hell and her
      infernal bloodrager bloodline, her fiendish sorcery racial trait allows
      her to treat her Charisma score as 2 higher for the purpose of her
      bloodline powers.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: infernal
BeforeCombat: Ogash enters her bloodrage as soon as she knows she is about to face battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ogash begins combat by using her darkness spell-like ability centered on
  Vegazi, then uses the effect as cover to attack the half-orc and any PCs in
  the way. She prefers to fight in melee with her orc double axe (making use of
  her hellfire strike to coat the weapon in flames), but hurls throwing axes at
  opponents who prove bothersome from a distance. She uses her scrolls and
  potions as needed.
Morale: >-
  Though Ogash is confident in her ability to abduct Vegazi and kill any who
  stand in her way, she is not blind to her mortality. If her hell hound ally is
  slain, she attempts to abduct Vegazi and escape, heedless of the remaining
  combatants. If her ally is slain and she's reduced to fewer than 20 hit
  points, Ogash flees without Vegazi. However, if a PC is wearing Jagan's black
  feather necklace, Ogash attacks that PC exclusively and fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  potions of cure light wounds (2), potion of magic weapon, scrolls of magic
  missile (2), scroll of ray of enfeeblement, smokestick (3)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 breastplate with armor spikes, mwk orc double axe, throwing axes (3), black
  feather necklace worth 15 gp, climber's kit, hemp rope (50 ft.), locked
  gauntlet, mwk manacles, signal hornUE, 91 gp
