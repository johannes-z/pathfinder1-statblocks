BeforeCombat: >-
  The tarnished smiths employ endure elements and bear's endurance routinely
  throughout the day. If they detect trouble approaching (such as the sounds of
  combat or alarm spells), they cast false life, shield, and stoneskin as well.
DuringCombat: >-
  If attacked, the tarnished smiths use their bonded objects; one casts
  cloudkill while the others cast telekinesis to hurl enemies back into the
  deadly cloud. Once opponents close in, they cast elemental body II on
  themselves to become Medium earth elementals, increasing their Strength by 4
  and their AC by 5 (not reflected in the statistics above). They then alternate
  between hammer blows and offensive spells such as cone of cold and lightning
  bolt.
