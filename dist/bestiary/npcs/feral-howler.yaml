SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Howl (Su)
    description: >-
      A howler's constant howling is a grating, exhausting baying that can drive
      listeners insane. All beings other than outsiders within 120 feet of a
      howling howler must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or become cursed by the
      creature's howl. Once a creature becomes cursed in this way, it takes no
      additional penalty for being exposed to additional howlers' howls until
      the current howler curse is lifted. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect.
      The save DC is Charisma-based. Howler Howl: Curse-howl; save Will DC 14
      negates; frequency 1/hour; effect 1 Wis damage; cure 1 save.
  - name: Pain (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a creature takes damage from a howler's quill attack or its quill
      defense, that creature must make a successful 16 Reflex save or one quill
      breaks off in its flesh, causing the target to become sickened until all
      embedded quills are removed. Removing one quill requires a successful DC
      15 Heal check made as a full-round action. For every 5 by which the check
      is exceeded, one additional quill can be removed. On a failed check, a
      quill is still removed, but the process deals 1d4+1 points of damage to
      the victim. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Quill Defense (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature that strikes a howler with a non-reach melee weapon, unarmed
      strike, or natural weapon takes 1d4+1 points of piercing damage from the
      howler's quills and suffers from the howler's pain attack.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Sensing prey nearby, the howlers begin to close in on the outbuilding by using
  the rain to conceal their approach. The howler in the haystack observes the
  Pathfinders and howls and attacks when the first PC enters the stable,
  signaling its kin to join the assault.
DuringCombat: >-
  The howlers utter mind-shattering howls immediately upon initiating combat and
  continue to howl for the duration of combat. They fight with pack tactics,
  attempting to surround and overwhelm the weakest-looking PC.
Morale: >-
  The howlers fight until reduced to 15 or fewer hit points, at which time they
  attempt to flee into the wilderness.
