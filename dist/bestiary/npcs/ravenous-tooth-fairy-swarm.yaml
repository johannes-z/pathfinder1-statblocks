SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      Anytime a tooth fairy swarm takes 5 or more points of damage from any
      source, several component fairies die in foul-smelling clouds of sparkling
      fairy dust. Any creature within 5 feet of the swarm must succeed at a DC
      23 Fortitude save or be sickened by the stench for 1d4 rounds. This is a
      poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Extraction (Su)
    description: >-
      At the end of its turn every round, the tooth fairy swarm attempts a
      single steal combat maneuver check. All creatures with a CMD equal to or
      lower than the result of this check suffer the forcible extraction of 1d6
      teeth, taking a number of points of Charisma damage and bleed damage equal
      to the number of teeth extracted. If the stolen teeth are returned within
      10 minutes and the character receives any amount of magical healing, the
      teeth reattach, the bleed damage ends, and the Charisma damage is cured.
DuringCombat: >-
  The tooth fairies hide as long as they can stand using their invisibility, but
  swarm over anyone who opens the barricade.
Morale: The swarm fights until destroyed.
