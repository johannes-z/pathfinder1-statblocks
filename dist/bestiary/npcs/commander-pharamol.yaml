BeforeCombat: >-
  Commander Pharamol casts barkskin and effortless armor before any combat, and
  he casts aspect of the falcon and gravity bow before engaging foes at range
  (already included in his stats).
DuringCombat: >-
  In a pitched battle, Commander Pharamol uses his hunter's bond to aid his
  troops as necessary. When fighting dangerous creatures who aren't one of his
  favored enemies, Pharamol casts instant enemy and declares a particular foe as
  his quarry, then focuses his attacks on that opponent, casting resist energy
  as needed depending on the nature of his foe. Pharamol relies on missile
  combat, but if necessary, he draws his bastard sword and readies an action to
  attack while his dragonkin partner Amerenth makes Flyby Attacks.
Morale: >-
  If fighting against spies or assassins, Commander Pharamol retreats to gather
  reinforcements if reduced to 50 hit points or fewer. In a battle to defend
  Spurhorn, however, Pharamol fights to the bitter end.
