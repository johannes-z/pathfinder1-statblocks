SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Horrific Pantomime (Su)
    description: >-
      Any living creature within 60 feet that views this ghost's attempt at
      pantomime (a standard action for one of the ghosts to perform) must
      succeed on a DC 18 Will save or immediately take 1d4 points of
      Intelligence damage, 1d4 points of Wisdom damage, and 1d4 points of
      Charisma damage. Insidiously, the ability damaging aspect of this attack
      is noticed only if the creature succeeds at a DC 20 Wisdom check
      (including any penalties for Wisdom damage). A creature that successfully
      saves against this effect cannot be affected by the same ghost's horrific
      pantomime for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Ex)
    description: If Scarwall's curse is lifted, these two ghosts are put to rest.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  The ghosts attempt to lull opponents into complacency using their horrific
  pantomime. If attacked, they fight back with their corrupting touches.
Morale: These two never did know when to quit. They fight until they are destroyed.
