BeforeCombat: >-
  Herifax casts resist energy against any form of energy she's seen the PCs
  wield, defaulting to fire.
DuringCombat: >-
  Herifax alerts Kanya with a shriek once she engages in battle, and the catfolk
  emerges from area A21 on the second round of combat to join the fight. The
  harpy then attempts to stay well out of range of the PCs, flying high above
  them while peppering them with arrows. She's particularly fond of using Deadly
  Aim to deal additional damage to easy targets, and goes for spellcasters and
  other archers first. If she ever spots a PC wandering alone in the garden, she
  uses her captivating song to try to get that PC to walk off the edge of the
  balcony or to stumble into the trash heap and anger the alchemical golem, but
  otherwise she avoids using this ability, preferring to focus on her arrows in
  combat.
Morale: >-
  If Kanya is reduced to negative hit points, Herifax swoops down to stand over
  her body and try to stabilize her wounds, ignoring any actions taken by the
  PCs until she's sure the catfolk woman is not dying. Herifax may well beg the
  PCs to save Kanya (or at the very least allow her the time to try to bind
  Kanya's wounds) in return for surrendering to them&#8211;if the PCs accept
  this surrender, the harpy sees this as her chance to get Berkanin out of the
  picture and promises to aid the PCs in killing the master of the house,
  provided they heal her up and promise Kanya comes to no harm. Herifax only
  makes this offer if she thinks Kanya is unconscious&#8211;otherwise, if she's
  reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, she flees into the city to nurse her
  wounds and make plans to return to rescue Kanya later.
