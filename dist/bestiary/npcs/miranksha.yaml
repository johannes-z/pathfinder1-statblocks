  - name: Dance of Disaster (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever Miranksha hits with a melee attack during a full-attack action,
      she can move 10 feet before making her next attack. Miranksha's normal
      speed doesn't limit this movement.
  - name: Dual Mind (Su)
    description: >-
      Miranksha can attempt two saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If
      either saving throw succeeds, the mind-affecting effect fails to affect
      Miranksha.
