    description: >-
      A skeletal redcap wears a tiny, shapeless woolen hat, dyed over and over
      with the blood of its victims. While wearing this cap, a skeletal redcap
      gains a +4 bonus on damage rolls (included in the above totals). Unlike
      living redcaps, a skeletal redcap doesn't gain fast healing 3 from its
      cap. These benefits are lost if the cap is removed or destroyed. A
      skeletal redcap can never create a new cap or replace a lost one. Caps are
      non-transferable, even between skeletal redcaps.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The skeletal redcaps make no attempt to hide. They hold their ground against
  the advancing party.
DuringCombat: >-
  The skeletons try to stay upright and shield Marigana . They use their high
  speed and initiative to deal as much damage as possible to PCs who engage in
  melee.
Morale: Skeletal redcaps fight until destroyed.
