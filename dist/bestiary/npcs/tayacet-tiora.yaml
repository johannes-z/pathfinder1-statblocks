Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: Tayacet drinks extracts of barkskin and shield before any fight.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tayacet prefers to avoid combat if possible, but if forced to fight, she uses
  her extracts to maintain superior mobility over her foes. She prefers to take
  her time in striking blows, and would rather spend a few rounds in hiding
  setting up a studied strike on an enemy rather than recklessly attacking each
  round. She seeks a defensive place to hide and heal whenever reduced to fewer
  than 25 hit points, returning to battle as soon as she's healed as much damage
  as she can.
Morale: Tayacet flees combat if reduced to fewer than 15 hit points.
