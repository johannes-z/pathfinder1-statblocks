SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Madness (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature within a 60-foot radius of the vespergaunt must succeed at a
      DC 21 Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. Once a creature
      successfully saves, it cannot be affected by the Emissary's aura again for
      24 hours. As a free action, the Emissary can suppress its aura. This is a
      mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Damage Reduction (Su)
    description: >-
      The vespergaunt's DR is bypassed by any weapons that are chaos-, evil-,
      good-, or law-aligned.
  - name: Siphon Spirit (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature touched by the Emissary from Beyond must succeed at a DC 21
      Will save or gain 1 negative level as the Emissary rips away a portion of
      its soul. A divine spellcaster gains an additional negative level with
      each failed save. The victim must save anew each time it is touched, and a
      character killed by this attack disintegrates completely except for its
      eyes and strands of brain matter, which become part of the Emissary. Only
      powerful magic such as miracle or wish can resurrect a creature slain in
      this manner.
DuringCombat: >-
  The vespergaunt has already used its greatest weapon (its monthly wish) to
  trigger the unnatural twilight and transformations in the Dustpawn environs,
  but it is still a dangerous foe. It begins combat by casting deeper darkness
  and tries to remain in the spell's area at all times if possible, but as it
  has no ranged options in combat, it can be lured out of the darkness by
  forcing it to exit the spell's area to make attacks. The monster focuses its
  attacks on divine spellcasters.
Morale: >-
  After traveling for so long to reach its destination, the alien does not
  consider flight or surrender to be a viable option. It fights to the death,
  even if it's been crippled by the destruction of the orrery of distant worlds.
