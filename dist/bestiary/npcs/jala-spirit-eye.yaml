SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Military Tradition (Ex)
    description: >-
      Jala is proficient with greatswords and longbows. This alternate racial
      trait originally appeared in Inner Sea Races, and replaces the bonus feat
      he would receive as a human.
  - name: Spirit Eye (Su)
    description: >-
      Jala Spirit-Eye has undergone a grueling series of vision quests that
      granted him the ability to see invisible and ethereal creatures, as if
      under the constant benefits of the see invisibility spell.
BeforeCombat: As he senses the PC arrive, Jala casts heroism on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jala begins combat by using his inspire courage ability and casting
  glitterdust to identify invisible PCs and blind the rest. On subsequent
  rounds, he casts offensive spells or dispels his foes' spells as appropriate.
Morale: >-
  Jala is loath to abandon his companions, so he uses invisibility and cure
  serious wounds to keep himself in the fight until it's clear the Ghost Wolves
  are defeated. In that event, he orders a retreat and attempts to escape to
  inform Xol-Nomag of the PCs' actions. Failing that, he surrenders.
