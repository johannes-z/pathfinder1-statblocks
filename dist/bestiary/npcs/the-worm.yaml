SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Confusion (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature struck by a voidworm's tail slap must succeed at a DC 14 Will
      save or become confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Curious about the PCs, the Worm hides while casting dancing lights and ghost
  sound to lure the new arrivals into the water in search of treasure.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Worm flits between targets, trying to bite the PCs to see how each one
  tastes. If harmed, the Worm neutralizes its attacker with its tail slap before
  reverting to its taste-testing.
Morale: Inquisitive even about death, the voidworm fights gleefully until destroyed.
