BeforeCombat: >-
  The sisters patrol the area around the portal from the air, circling near the
  edge of the Moonscar's atmosphere on the backs of their shantak mounts.
DuringCombat: >-
  The sisters attack from a distance and summon babaus to fight interlopers in
  melee, preferring to use their own longbows and spell-like abilities rather
  than engage opponents at close quarters.
Morale: >-
  The succubi are delighted if an opponent proves worthy of them, as this may
  indicate the Insatiable Queen will be pleased with a new prisoner. Once
  reduced below 25 hit points, or if one of their kind is slain, a sister
  teleports back to the Shrine of Rest and Fulfillment to spread the joyous news
  that worthy flesh is near, while any remaining sisters remain to capture or
  kill the intruders.
