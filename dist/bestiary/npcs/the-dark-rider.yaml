SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Behead (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature reduced to negative hit points by one of the Dark Rider's
      weapon attacks must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be beheaded.
      Beheading instantly slays the victim, and its head automatically tumbles
      down to the Dark Rider's side to attach to his armor via a stained leather
      cord. The Save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Hurl Head (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action up to once every 1d4 rounds, the dark rider may hurl
      any severed head up to 30 feet. The head explodes on contact into a
      20-foot burst of negative energy, dealing 10d6 points of negative energy
      damage (Reflex DC 22 half) to all creatures in the area of effect. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Recruit Hound (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature slain by the Dark Rider must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or
      be immediately returned to life as a shadow mastiff-one of the dullahan's
      hounds. The creature's soul remains trapped, cognizant of its fate and
      able to recognize former companions but unable to directly defy the
      dullahan's orders. As long as this shadow mastiff lives, the soul cannot
      be restored to life via raise dead or other effects. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Summon Mount (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, the Dark Rider can summon a unique mount with the
      statistics given below.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  The Dark Rider prefers to fight from horseback, making frequent use of Mounted
  Combat and Spirited Charge to lash at foes with his spine flail. If forced to
  dismount, he maneuvers so that he can make full attacks. He uses his hurl head
  ability against foes who cluster or try to stay at range.
Morale: >-
  The Dark Rider has no fear of death. He fights until destroyed, at which point
  his body disintegrates and sinks into the ground, leaving behind only his
  armor and gear. His mount immediately dies and fades into nothingness.
Gear: +3 full plate, +2 handaxe, spine flail, three severed heads
