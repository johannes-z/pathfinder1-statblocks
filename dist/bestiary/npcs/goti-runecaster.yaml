DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Goti drinks his potion of eagle's splendor
  (thereby increasing the save DCs of his spells). He attacks opponents with
  spells for as long as possible. In melee combat, Goti uses Arcane Strike to
  make his pick magical and increase its damage, and maneuvers to make sneak
  attacks against foes.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, Goti uses his fugitive's grenade to
  flee. He may return at a later time to continue harassing the party. If
  cornered and unable to escape, Goti uses his size alteration ability to change
  his size to Large and renews his attacks on his foes, fighting to the death.

  fugitive's grenade (see page 60), potion of eagle's splendor, scroll of
  animate dead, wand of command undead (11 charges), deathblade poison (1 dose)
