BeforeCombat: >-
  One speaker of murder uses inspire courage as soon as the bandits begin down
  the road, and continues until out of performance rounds or dead. The other
  uses countersong if any casters try to use sonic effects on the bandits,
  taking over inspire courage instead if his comrade falls.
DuringCombat: >-
  Both hold back from melee, staying mounted and using spells and arrows to
  fight. They each lob vials of alchemist's fire at the center of the barricade
  each round, attempting to burn it away, and use tanglefoot bags to confound
  their foes on the other side of the barrier.
Morale: >-
  Both speakers of murder remain as long as there are bandits to assist; if all
  tengus on the barricade are killed before the final wave, the speakers retreat
  up the road to meet with the reinforcements.
Gear: >-
  potions of cure light wounds (2), potion of cure moderate wounds, alchemist's
  fire (4), tanglefoot bags (2)
OtherGear: >-
  leather lamellar*, buckler, katana*, masterwork shortbow with 20 arrows, light
  horse (combat trained), military saddle
