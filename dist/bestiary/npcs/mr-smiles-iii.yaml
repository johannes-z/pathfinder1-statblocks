BeforeCombat: Mr. Smiles prepares for combat by casting mirror image on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Mr. Smiles knows his best role in combat is to use his bardic performances to
  inspire courage in his allies. He alternates melee attacks with spells such as
  hideous laughter, lesser confusion, and scare to sow chaos among his victims.
Morale: >-
  Knowing his reputation is all that keeps him employed in Oppara, Mr. Smiles
  III fights until reduced to 7 hit points or fewer, at which point he attempts
  to flee out the office window and use his disguise self spell-like ability to
  blend in among the bodies of silent initiatives the PCs have already bested.
