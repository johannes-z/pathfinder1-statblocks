SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Boot Stomp (Ex)
    description: >-
      A redcap wears heavy iron boots with spiked soles that it uses to deadly
      effect in combat. These boots give the redcap a kick attack that it can
      make as a secondary attack, either as part of a full-attack action or as
      part of its movement just as if it had the Spring Attack feat.
  - name: Heavy Weapons (Ex)
    description: A redcap can wield weapons sized for Medium creatures without penalty.
  - name: Irreligious (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bitter and blasphemous, redcaps cannot stand the symbols of good-aligned
      religions. If a foe spends a standard action presenting such a holy
      symbol, any redcap that can see the creature must make a DC 15 Will save
      or become frightened for 1 minute and attempt to flee. A redcap who
      successfully saves is shaken for 1 minute.
  - name: Red Cap (Su)
    description: >-
      A redcap wears a tiny, shapeless woolen hat, dyed over and over with the
      blood of its victims. While wearing this cap, a redcap gains a +4 bonus on
      damage rolls (included in the above totals) and fast healing 3. These
      benefits are lost if the cap is removed or destroyed. Caps are not
      transferable, even between redcaps. A redcap can create a new cap to
      replace a lost cap with 10 minutes of work, although until the redcap
      takes a standard action to dip the cap in the blood of a foe the redcap
      helped to kill, the cap does not grant its bonuses.
