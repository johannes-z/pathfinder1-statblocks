SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ferocious Fetch (Ex)
    description: >-
      Helkit grants Brimstone Improved DragAPG as a bonus feat. As a swift
      action, Helkit can command Brimstone to move toward an opponent within 30
      feet and attempt a drag combat maneuver to pull the target back toward
      her. Brimstone can move before and after performing the maneuver, but this
      movement counts toward its total movement during its turn.
  - name: Takedown (Ex)
    description: >-
      Helkit grants Brimstone the takedown special ability, detailed further in
      its stat block.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Helkit drinks either her potion of enlarge person or potion of haste once
  combat begins, depending on which would be more advantageous. If her Slayers
  are still faring well, she moves closer and uses her Dazzling Display feat to
  demoralize as many PCs as she can. Her tactics are otherwise simple but
  brutal: she begins to rage, charges into melee, and makes judicious use of
  Power Attack and her performance combat feats while commanding Brimstone to
  flank with her.
Morale: >-
  Helkit yields if reduced to 25 hit points or fewer or if all but one of her
  allies (including Brimstone) fall. If the PCs "accidentally" ignore her
  surrender, she grits her teeth and fights to her death, cursing them for their
  dishonor.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds, potion of enlarge person, potion of haste
OtherGear: >-
  +1 spell storingUE piecemeal armor (contains CL 5th vampiric touch; see
  sidebar on page 20), +1 greataxe, javelins (3), 77 gp
