BeforeCombat: >-
  The dorus remain within the jar, awaiting release. They maintain invisibility
  until their first opportunity to strike.
DuringCombat: >-
  The divs bite at the nearest PC under the cover of invisibility, then use
  suggestion to encourage the PCs to abandon the combat. They become invisible
  when not biting or casting other spells.
Morale: >-
  The dorus retreat invisibly if they take more than 5 points of damage, but
  they circle back around and attack whenever the PCs enter a new combat. If
  another div is present, they fight to the death.
