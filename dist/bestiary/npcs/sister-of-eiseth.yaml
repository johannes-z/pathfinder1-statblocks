  Having trained together for hours on end, the Sisters work together in teams
  to harry their foes. Half of the Sisters fight defensively with a flurry of
  blows (+0/+0)  using their ki pool to confer a +4 dodge bonus, further raising
  their total Armor Class to 23. The remaining Sisters attack from reach with
  their crimson habits, draining their ki pool to add a third attack to their
  flurry. Where possible they employ trip attacks to keep their foes
  off-balance.
