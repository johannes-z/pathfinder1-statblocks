SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Arcane Mortar (Ex)
    description: >-
      An arcane bombardier's mortar has a range increment of 50 feet and deals
      6d6 points of bludgeoning and force damage on a hit with a x4 critical
      modifier. The bombardier must spend a swift action to charge an arcane
      munition; this allows the golem to take two shots per round with the
      mortar.
  - name: Arcane Munitions (Ex)
    description: >-
      A verdant bombardier's slam and mortar attacks count as adamantine, cold
      iron, magic, and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
  - name: Blasting Critical (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a verdant bombardier confirms a critical hit with a slam attack, it
      can make one mortar attack against that target as a free action (as long
      as the mortar is loaded).
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A verdant bombardier is immune to spells and spell-like abilities that
      allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently
      against it, as noted below. &#8226; Any spell with the electricity
      descriptor that affects a verdant bombardier renders its arcane mortar
      unusable for 1 round (no save). &#8226; A shocking grasp spell
      additionally causes the bombardier's mortar to instantly backfire, dealing
      6d6 points of damage to the bombardier and staggering it for 1 round (no
      save).
  - name: Reinforced Mortar (Ex)
    description: >-
      A verdant bombardier adds its Strength modifier to the damage dealt by its
      mortar.
DuringCombat: >-
  The verdant bombardier follows Umbarno's orders, entering melee to prevent
  enemies from reaching Umbarno. It uses its arcane mortar liberally, even if
  doing so provokes attacks of opportunity from its foes.
Morale: The verdant bombardier fights until destroyed.
