  As her first move action, the goblin shaman lights the signal fire, and then
  fires her pre-loaded crossbow at the party approaching the tower. When the PCs
  get to the base of her tower, she lobs a vial of alchemist's fire down on
  them, and descends the ladder to the tower's ground floor. She readies to cast
  burning hands on whoever batters down the door (she's unconcerned about
  hitting other goblins). She then tries to bring down other foes with her sleep
  spell, scare them with cause fear, and finally weaken them with touch of
  fatigue.
