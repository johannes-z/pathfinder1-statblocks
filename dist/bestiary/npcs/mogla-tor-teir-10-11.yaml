BeforeCombat: >-
  Mogla-Tor is in the midst of ritual and hears the PCs approach just in time to
  cast spell immunity on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Mogla-Tor begins combat by casting darkness on the PCs and then casts
  invisibility on himself. Once invisible, if his skum are keeping the PCs
  occupied, he casts his beneficial spells on himself. If his skum appear to be
  losing quickly, he casts confusion, dispel magic, hold person, or silence to
  help turn the tide. If he has time, he casts detect law and then hits the
  closest lawful PC with chaos hammer. If forced into melee, he fights
  ferociously with his war razor.
Morale: Mogla-Tor fights to the death.
