DuringCombat: >-
  Senenmerek focuses his attacks on one foe at a time, using Power Attack,
  Channel Smite, and his destructive smite to maximize his damage. If he reduces
  an enemy to unconsciousness, he moves to a different target. Senenmerek uses
  his hand of the acolyte ability to attack opponents at range rather than
  throwing his spear.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, Senenmerek withdraws to heal himself
  with channeled energy or spontaneous inflict spells, then rejoins combat.
  Otherwise, he fights until destroyed.
Gear: >-
  mithral shirt, spear of the watchful guardian (+1 spear; see page 61), wooden
  holy symbol of Nethys, keys to temple crypts (areas D12 through D20)
