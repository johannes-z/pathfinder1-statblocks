  Khorak activates his snakehead shield immediately upon entering battle so it
  can attack independently while he attacks with his sword, using Power Attack
  to inflict as much damage as possible. If he can only make a single attack, he
  employs Improved Vital Strike to mete out further damage.
Morale: Khorak zealously fights to the death.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds
