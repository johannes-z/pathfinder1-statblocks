  - name: Invisible in Light (Su)
    description: >-
      In bright light, a hellcat is naturally invisible. In normal light, a
      hellcat has partial concealment (20% miss chance), while in dim light, it
      has no special concealment. Darkness smothers the creature's flickering
      glow and conceals it normally.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once conjured into the room, the hellcat attacks the creature closest to the
  red door. If a foe in a mixed group seems particularly good at hurting it, the
  hellcat switches to attack that enemy.
Morale: The hellcat fights to the death.
