    description: >-
      A WARDEN gains a +8 bonus on Disguise checks to appear human (but not to
      impersonate a specific human).
DuringCombat: >-
  Both WARDENs' safety protocols failed long ago, and as such they don't hold
  back their punches. As they  fight, they offer advice to their foes, giving
  the PCs sound tactical advice on such things as flanking or when to fight
  defensively. The WARDENS both use martial flexibility to gain Improved
  Critical (unarmed strike), Critical Focus, and Staggering Critical during the
  fight.
Morale: The WARDENs fight until destroyed, but don't pursue foes beyond this room.
