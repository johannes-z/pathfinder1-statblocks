DuringCombat: >-
  Kadraz stays near the rear of the chamber and chooses a lightly armored
  target, preferably a spellcaster. He fires as many arrows at that PC as
  possible, hoping to kill that PC before choosing another target.
Morale: >-
  Kadraz tries to flee out of the crypt's entrance if reduced to fewer than 20
  hit points, not remembering that  if the loci spirit is still blocking the
  cemetery entrance, he won't get far.
