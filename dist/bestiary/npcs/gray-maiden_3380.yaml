DuringCombat: >-
  The Gray Maidens fight ferociously, favoring Power Attack and using bull rush
  to force PCs into squares occupied by other enemies or furniture in order to
  make them fall down. Favoring melee over ranged combat, they fight in pairs,
  working to flank foes or to prevent themselves from being flanked. They rely
  upon their high AC in combat to protect them from attacks of opportunity.
  Should they be reduced to 15 hit points or fewer, they drink a potion of cure
  light wounds.
Morale: The Gray Maidens fight ferociously and to the death.
Gear: potions of cure light wounds (2)

  full plate, heavy steel shield, light crossbow with 15 bolts, masterwork
  longsword, 30 gp
