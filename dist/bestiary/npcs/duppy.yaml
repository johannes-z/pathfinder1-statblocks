SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ravenous Hounds (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a duppy can bring into being a pack of
      incorporeal hounds for 1d4+3 rounds. The ravenous hounds attack as a
      single unit, have a +11 attack bonus, deal 2d6+3 points of force damage on
      a successful hit, and threaten a critical hit on a natural 20. This
      ability is otherwise identical to mage's sword (CL 7th).
  - name: Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)
    description: >-
      A raise dead or similar spell that is cast on a duppy destroys it (Will
      save negates). Using the spell in this way does not require any material
      components.
  - name: Strength Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures hit by a duppy's touch attack must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude
      save or take 1d6 points of Strength drain. On each successful attack, the
      duppy gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The duppies summon their ravenous hounds on the first round of combat, then
  attack with their incorporeal touch attacks. The duppies focus their attacks
  on obvious pirates and sailors first.
Morale: The duppies fight until destroyed.
