BeforeCombat: >-
  Given time to prepare, Myra casts freedom of movement and protection from
  good. If she is aware of intruders approaching, she uses her master's illusion
  ability to make herself and the cult look like pitiful, starving refugees to
  lure intruders into complacency.
DuringCombat: >-
  Myra avoids melee and debilitates opponents with chaos hammer, confusion,
  unholy blight, and channel negative energy. She relies on the cultists to stay
  between her and the PCs.
Morale: >-
  If Myra is reduced to half her hit points or fewer, she tries to bargain for
  her life and the lives of her followers. She offers what she believes the PCs
  are after&#8211;the Clavis Somnus&#8211;by hoisting the key aloft and saying,
  "Just take the key! It opens the door we locked behind them!" If this gambit
  fails, Myra fights until killed.
Gear: potions of cure serious wounds (2)
OtherGear: >-
  breastplate, mwk sickle, Clavis Somnus (see page 33), cloak of resistance +2,
  headband of inspired wisdom +2, silver dust (worth 25 gp), 52 gp
