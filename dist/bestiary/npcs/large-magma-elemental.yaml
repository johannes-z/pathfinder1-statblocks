SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burn (Ex)
    description: >-
      A magma elemental's burn DC includes a -2 racial penalty, as their fires
      don't burn quite as hot as true elemental flames.
  - name: Earth Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A burrowing magma elemental can pass through stone, dirt, lava, and almost
      any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through
      water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create
      any ripple, though the area it passes through feels warm for 1 round
      afterward and often retains a strangely smooth texture, as if the stone
      had been polished. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a
      burrowing magma elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the
      creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.
  - name: Lava Puddle (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a full-round action, a magma elemental can vomit forth a
      puddle of lava (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444) that fills its space to
      a depth of 2&#8211;3 inches and counts as difficult terrain. Any creature
      that moves through this puddle of lava takes 2d6 points of fire damage.
      This damage continues for 1d3 rounds after the creature leaves the lava
      pool, after which it only inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage per round.
      The lava puddle solidifies and is safe to touch after a number of rounds
      equal to the elemental's Hit Dice. At the GM's discretion, this puddle of
      lava could start secondary fires.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The magma elemental remains hidden beneath the surface of the lava vent until
  PCs come near, rising seamlessly through the ground with its earth glide
  ability in conjunction with the vent's eruption.
DuringCombat: >-
  The magma elemental begins combat by using its lava puddle attack on as many
  PCs as possible. It attempts to bull rush PCs into the lava pool, then resorts
  to standard slam attacks. The elemental flees under the surface of the earth
  if foes use cold energy attacks against it, earth gliding beneath the
  cold-wielding foe and rising from beneath to attack him.
Morale: >-
  The magma elemental is territorial and angry and fights to the death. It
  pursues PCs as far as possible if they flee.
