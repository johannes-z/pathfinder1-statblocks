  Bjormundal, perhaps feeling a need to compensate for his shorter sized
  compared to his minions, leaps down to confront the PCs in melee as soon as he
  spots them, leaving the cloud giants to make attacks at range. Bjormundal
  fights with Power Attack. Faced with a foe using a powerful weapon, he'll try
  to sunder it with a Vital Strike.
Morale: Bjormundal flees if reduced to fewer than 30 hit points.
Gear: potions of cure serious wounds (3)
OtherGear: +2 breastplate, +3 greataxe, ring of feather falling
