SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sound Imitation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A decapus can mimic any creature it has previously encountered with near
      total accuracy, though it cannot mimic humanoid speech for more than two
      or three words at a time. A DC 13 Will save detects the ruse. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
  - name: Uncanny Climber (Su)
    description: >-
      A decapus can climb with ease, as if using spider climb. It can use the
      accelerated climb action to cover any distance up to four times its climb
      speed, with each check allowing it to climb a distance equal to its climb
      speed. Climbing a distance equal to or less than its climb speed is a
      move-equivalent action.
DuringCombat: >-
  The decapus hangs on to the side of the pit with one tentacle and attacks with
  the rest, but it can only use three tentacles at a time against a single foe.
  It makes no distinction between the PCs and the charau-ka, attacking whoever
  is within its reach.
Morale: The decapus flees back into the pit if reduced to 8 hit points or fewer.
