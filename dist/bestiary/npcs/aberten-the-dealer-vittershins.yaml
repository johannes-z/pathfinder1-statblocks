SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blessing of the Harrow (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Aberten can perform a Harrow reading for himself and all
      allies within 20 feet-this takes 10 minutes. After the reading, count up
      the suits that appeared in the reading; whichever suit had the most cards
      showing grants a +1 bonus to all the affected creatures for 24 hours. The
      bonuses granted are as follows: Strength (+1 on attack rolls); Dexterity
      (+1 to AC); Constitution (+1 on weapon damage rolls); Intelligence (+1 on
      all skill checks); Wisdom (+1 on all saving throws); Charisma (+1 on all
      caster level checks). All of these bonuses are insight bonuses. If you
      don't have a Harrow deck, you can simply determine which bonus applies to
      Aberten and his allies for the day by rolling 1d6.
  - name: Harrow Casting (Su)
    description: >-
      Up to three times a day as he casts a spell, Aberten can draw three cards
      from his Harrow deck. This adds a somatic component to the spell if it
      didn't have one already, and also adds a focus component, but does not add
      to the spell's casting time. For each card from the suit of Intelligence
      he draws, he gains a +1 bonus on caster level checks made to penetrate
      spell resistance. For each card from the suit of Strength he draws, the
      spell he casts deals +1 point of damage per die (provided the spell
      inflicts damage). Cards from other suits provide no bonuses, and cards
      that match his alignment grant twice the bonus. These bonuses stack with
      each other and are insight bonuses. You can randomly determine the suit of
      a card drawn by rolling 1d6 for each of the abilities; there's a 10%
      chance that a card drawn is neutral evil.
Gender: Male
Bloodline: destined
BeforeCombat: >-
  Aberten casts alarm each morning at area E2. If Aberten suspects that trouble
  is afoot, he casts blur, fly, shield, and tongues.
DuringCombat: >-
  Aberten prefers to avoid melee combat, using flight to remain at range, and
  spells like enervation, scorching ray, and magic missile to attack while his
  underling thieves keep the enemy busy in melee. Forced into melee, Aberten
  avoids casting spells, instead enhancing his attacks with Arcane Strike.
Morale: >-
  If Aberten is reduced to 35 or fewer hit points, he switches his attacks to
  any surviving thieves and tells the PCs he wants to parlay. He also
  immediately lowers his attacks to parlay if all of the thieves in sight are
  slain and he's got any wounds at all. If the PCs aren't interested in talking
  with the Dealer, he tries to flee through the ruined wing of the manor,
  delaying pursuit where he can with arcane locks on doors as he passes through
  them. He hopes to emerge on the other side into area E10 after slowing the
  party down on a chase through the building so he can flee by flying through
  the alleyways to somewhere he can hide out for the remainder of this
  adventure's events-in this case, he can become a recurring villain, and can
  encounter the PCs again in the adventures to come as you see fit.
Gear: wand of invisibility (19 charges), wand of lightning bolt (33 charges)
