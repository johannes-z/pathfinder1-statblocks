IsTemplate: '0'
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Molly is unlikely to engage in combat in this adventure, but she still keeps
  10 of her hand crossbow bolts prepared with oil of taggit.
DuringCombat: >-
  Molly has little interest in fighting or revealing her wererat nature yet, and
  as such she is unlikely to shift forms. If faced with a fight that she can't
  avoid, however, she assumes her hybrid form&#8211;in this shape, her physical
  body is bolstered by her feral nature.
Morale: >-
  If Molly's confronted with violence, she either attempts to flee or begs for
  mercy, trusting in her appearance as a frail old woman if she thinks that will
  stay her enemy's hand. If she escapes, she plots revenge.
Gear: >-
  +1 studded leather, +1 hand crossbow with 10 bolts poisoned with oil of
  taggit, mwk rapier, ring of protection +1, small gold locket (contains a
  miniature painting of a smiling halfling child) engraved with the words "To my

  enamel head and set with a matching grinning devil locket worth 700 gp, gold
  ring set with black obsidian ravens worth 250 gp, gold earrings designed to
  resemble rampant owlbears worth 250 gp each.
