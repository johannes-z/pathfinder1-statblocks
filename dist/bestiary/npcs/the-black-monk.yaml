SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath of Death (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, the Black Monk can exhale a
      30-foot cone of tomb gas. Living creatures in this area must make a
      successful DC 22 Fortitude save or gain 1d4 negative levels. A creature
      killed by these negative levels rises as a juju zombie (Pathfinder RPG
      Bestiary 2 291) in 1d4 rounds. A juju zombie created in this manner is
      under the Black Monk's control and remains so until it or the Black Monk
      is destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Despair (Su)
    description: >-
      This functions as a typical mummy's despair, save that once a paralyzed
      creature recovers from the effect, it remains staggered for 1 additional
      round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Mummy Rot (Su)
    description: >-
      This functions as the typical mummy rot curse and disease, save that the
      Black Monk can afflict foes with it via his flurry of blows.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  The Black Monk uses Improved Trip and Stunning Fist against foes in melee to
  keep them off balance. He uses his spell-like abilities against foes who can
  remain out of reach of his melee attacks or who prove too canny to trip, but
  never uses earthquake for fear of damaging the Black Tower itself.
Morale: The Black Monk fights to the death.
Gear: belt of giant strength +4, ring of the ram (45 charges)
