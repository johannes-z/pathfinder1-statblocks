BeforeCombat: Ishani casts shield of faith before combat if possible.
DuringCombat: >-
  Casting shield of faith is Ishani's first act in combat if the spell isn't
  already active. Otherwise, he starts by casting sanctuary and then seeks to
  heal and support allies for the duration. A pacifist by nature, he avoids
  combat himself unless there's no other option.
Morale: >-
  If confronted alone, Ishani seeks to use fly to escape. If cornered, though,
  he fights to the death.
Gear: potions of cure moderate wounds (3)
OtherGear: +1 light crossbow with 10 bolts, dagger, silver holy symbol of Abadar, 12 gp
