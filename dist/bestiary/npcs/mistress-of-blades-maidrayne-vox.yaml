  Mistress of Blades Maidrayne Vox uses her halberd to deadly effect on the
  battlefield, and can easily lay into a number of foes at a time with Cleave.
  While she's fighting atop the steep battlements and towers of Citadel Vraid,
  she is quick to bull rush enemies toward the edge, either forcing them to
  surrender or sending them spiraling to their quick deaths.
Morale: >-
  The Mistress of Blades is vigilant to the end, and couldn't stand to see her
  domain fall under the rule of unlawful miscreants. She fights to the death to
  defend the citadel and her order.
