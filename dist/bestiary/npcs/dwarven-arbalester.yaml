  The fighter applies oil of greater magic weapon to his heavy crossbow, then
  drinks potions of barkskin and heroism.
DuringCombat: >-
  For as long as he can, the fighter stays mounted and takes shots from long
  range. He takes most shots with magical ammunition, tailoring the bolt to the
  foe. He uses Greater Vital Strike unless he has trouble hitting, in which case
  he switches to Pinpoint Targeting. He nearly always uses Deadly Aim.
