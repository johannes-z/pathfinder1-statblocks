DuringCombat: >-
  Corinstian doesn't fully recall his life, but if the PC who struck the death
  blow against him in Pathfinder Adventure Path #100: A Song of Silver is
  present, the dread wraith directs all of his attacks against  that foe.
  Otherwise, he attacks a random target, continuing to focus on that victim
  until she is dead before moving on to a new foe.
Morale: Corinstian fights until destroyed.
