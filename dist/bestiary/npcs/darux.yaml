SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Anxiety Spores (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature struck by the fear eater's claws must succeed at a DC 17
      Fortitude saving throw or be infected with anxiety spores, which cause
      nervousness and muscle tremors. Anxiety Spores: Disease-injury; save Fort
      DC 17; onset 1 round; frequency 1/minute; effect cumulative &#8211;1
      penalty on saving throws against effects with the emotion descriptor
      (maximum &#8211;5); cure 2
  - name: consecutive saves  Dread Burst (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a fear eater can cause mushrooms to erupt from any
      creature within 30 feet already infected with its anxiety spores. The
      targeted creature takes 1d6 points of Charisma damage (Fortitude DC 17
      negates) as the growing spores siphon away her emotions. If the affected
      creature is currently shaken, frightened, or panicked, any creature within
      10 feet gains the same condition for 1d4 rounds (Will DC 17 negates). This
      is a mind-affecting fear effect with the emotion descriptor. The save DCs
      are Charisma-based.
  - name: Fungal Snare (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a fear eater can spew a fungal mass up to 30 feet,
      which coats all creatures within a 10-foot-radius burst with sticky
      filaments. Creatures other than fear eaters are entangled (Reflex DC 17
      negates). An entangled creature can attempt to break free with a
      successful DC 14 Strength or Escape Artist check as a move action. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
