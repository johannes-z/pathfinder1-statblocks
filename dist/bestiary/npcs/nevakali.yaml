  Nevakali begins combat by casting sound burst to try to stun the PCs, then
  casts darkness to give herself an area to lurk in while she casts magic stone
  or uses other ranged spells on the PCs. If reduced to fewer than 20 hit
  points, she casts invisibility on herself and flees to area U5 to recruit the
  aid of her mobat ally, returning to this room with the giant bat to finish the
  fight after she uses her scrolls and spells to heal herself back to full hit
  points.
