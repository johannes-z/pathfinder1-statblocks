BeforeCombat: >-
  Zanathura casts mage armor and mind  blank on herself each morning. Before
  combat, she casts displacement, resist energy, elemental aura, and spell
  turning on herself as well.
DuringCombat: >-
  Like her duplicate (see page 60 of "Siege of Stone"), Zanathura loves to
  immobilize others for slow punishment, using forceful hand, crushing hand, and
  forcecage to trap victims and then subjecting them to acid fog and prismatic
  spray. If opponents close in, she switches to polymorph any object to
  transform attackers into harmless pets.
Morale: >-
  Zanathura does not share the hobgoblins' zealotry. If reduced below 50 hit
  points, she attempts to flee using greater teleport.
Gear: >-
  potions of shield of faith +4 (3), scroll of banishment, scroll of chain
  lightning, scroll of flesh to stone, scrolls of simulacrum (3), scroll of
  greater teleport, and scroll of wall of iron
OtherGear: >-
  amulet of natural armor +4, belt of physical might +4 (Dex, Con), headband of
  mental prowess +4 (Wis, Cha)
