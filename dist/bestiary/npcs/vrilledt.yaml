    description: >-
      Vrilledt infects those he hits with his claw with a less virulent strain
      of russet mold than normally found in this dangerous fungus. A creature
      hit can resist infection with a successful DC 15 Fortitude saving throw.
      If a creature fails this save, the slowly growing spores take root, and
      deal 2 points of Constitution damage per day. A new saving throw can be
      attempted each day to halt the growth. Once an infected creature dies
      (either from the spores themselves or another source), the body generates
      vegepygmies after 24 hours, as normal russet mold (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary
      273). The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vrilledt swiftly moves to melee with foes in combat, sending his two bodyguard
  vegepygmies to flank or even to provoke attacks of opportunity from enemies as
  needed so that he can move into more advantageous positions himself.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, Vrilledt surrenders and begs for
  mercy, knowing that should he die, his spores die as well. He offers all his
  treasure as tribute to the PCs, and may even be convinced to aid them in
  defeating the robots, but the longer any alliance with the vegepygmy lasts,
  the more likely it is that he seizes an opportunity to betray the PCs.
