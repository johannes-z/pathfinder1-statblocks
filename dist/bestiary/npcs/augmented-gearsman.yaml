SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adaptive Learning (Ex)
    description: >-
      This gearsman has used this ability to gain proficiency with firearms, and
      does not use it to reallocate skill ranks.
  - name: Charge Weapon (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any metal melee weapon wielded by a gearsman becomes charged with
      electricity and deals +1d6 points of electricity damage on a hit.
      Self-Repair (Ex) This gearsman's nanites heal it of damage at the rate of
      8 hit points per hour. Up to once per day as a full-round action, it can
      heal any robot it touches of 4d6 points of damage-if it uses this ability
      on itself, it automatically heals 24 points of damage.
DuringCombat: >-
  The augmented gearsman attacks with its laser rifle, preferring to make
  semi-automatic fire attacks when possible and taking 5-foot steps to avoid
  firing in melee. If no option is available, the robot opts to provoke attacks
  of opportunity and fires the laser rifle in melee, resorting to slam attacks
  only if its weapon's charges are depleted. It always uses Deadly Aim when
  attacking with its laser rifle.
Morale: This augmented gearsman fights until destroyed.
