SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Avoidance (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a mindslaver mold is infesting a living or an undead creature, it can
      attempt a Reflex save as an immediate action to completely avoid an attack
      that would normally have hit it. This attack instead harms the infested
      creature-the mold effectively slithers out of the way of the incoming
      attack so that the blow strikes the creature it controls. The mindslaver
      mold must choose to attempt avoidance after the attack roll is resolved
      but before damage is rolled.
  - name: Infestation (Su)
    description: >-
      A mindslaver mold can climb onto and attach itself to a willing or
      helpless host as a standard action. As long as the mold infests its host,
      the mold shares the same 5-foot square with its host's space; this does
      not negatively impact the host or the mold. As long as a mindslaver mold
      infests a host, the host takes a &#8211;4 penalty on all Will saves made
      against the mindslaver mold's dominate person spell-like ability, and the
      duration of that spell-like ability on the host becomes permanent as long
      as the mold remains attached. Each day, an attached mindslaver mold deals
      1d4 points of damage to its host as it feeds on the host's blood and other
      bodily fluids. A mindslaver mold can be torn free from its host with a
      successful DC 15 Strength check made as a standard action&#8211;doing so
      deals 2d6 points of damage as the mold's tendrils tear free. A dead
      mindslaver mold deals no damage when it is so removed.
  - name: Mold Mindlink (Su)
    description: >-
      A mindslaver mold can communicate telepathically with any other mindslaver
      mold within 10 miles, and knows the condition of all other mindslaver
      molds in this area as if it had a status spell in effect on all other
      molds.
  - name: Spore Pod (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mindslaver mold's sole physical attack is to launch a spore pod the size
      of a sling bullet. This is a ranged touch attack with a range increment of
      20 feet.
  - name: Spores (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a mindslaver mold hits a creature with its spore pod, or whenever
      a creature touches a mindslaver mold (including when a creature hits the
      mold with a touch attack, unarmed strike, or natural attack), the creature
      must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid taking 1d4 points of
      Wisdom damage as the mold's spores swiftly drain away the victim's
      willpower and sense of self. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The mindslaver mold uses its avoidance  ability to evade attacks, firing spore
  pods at anyone attacking it or Finngarth.
Morale: >-
  If the mindslaver mold is removed from Finngarth, or if Finngarth is slain,
  the mold attempts to find a new host. It casts dominate person on the closest
  creature to allow it to infest a new victim.
