SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blackfire Pact (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a Blackfire Adept can create a destructive resonance
      between herself and a target within 30 feet. She gains a +1 profane bonus
      on attack rolls and caster level checks against the target, while the
      target takes a -1 penalty on saves against the adept's attacks and spells
      (&#8211;2 against conjuration effects). This effect lasts for 2 rounds
      (Will DC 16 reduces to 1 round), and the effect ends if the target moves
      more than 30 feet away from the Blackfire Adept.
  - name: Blackfire Taint (Su)
    description: >-
      A Blackfire Adept gains a +1 profane bonus on saving throws, caster level
      checks, Charisma checks, and Charisma-based skill checks against demons.
Bloodline: abyssal
BeforeCombat: A Blackfire Adept casts bull's strength, mage armor, and shield before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  A Blackfire Adept prefer to hang back in combat. She begins by casting mirror
  image, followed by a summon monster III spell to summon a dretch. An Adept is
  fond of using grease on weapons or holy symbols, and of preparing an action to
  cast magic missile at spellcasters in order to disrupt their spellcasting.
Morale: >-
  A Blackfire Adept saves at least one 4th-level spell to escape, casting
  dimension door once reduced to fewer than 15 hit points to relocate to area
  Q16, where she knocks on the door to area Q19 to report. Adepts may be
  encountered again at Vang's side if the PCs reach area Q19 within 24 hours;
  otherwise, adepts return to their duties. At Vang's side, a Blackfire Adept
  fights to the death.
