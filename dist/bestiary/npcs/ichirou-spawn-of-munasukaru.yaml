SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Auspicious Mark (Su)
    description: >-
      Ichirou's impressive scars and tattoos mark him as touched by the spirits.
      Once per rage, as a swift action that costs 2 rounds of rage, Ichirou can
      call upon the spirits' favor, granting him a +1d6 bonus on one d20 roll he
      has just made. Ichirou can call on the auspicious mark after seeing the
      result of the d20 roll.
  - name: Scarification (Ex)
    description: Ichirou can ignore 1 point of bleed damage per round.
  - name: Terrifying Visage (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ichirou adds 1/2 his barbarian level (+2) on Intimidate checks against
      humanoids who are not members of barbarian tribes. When dealing with
      barbarians, Ichirou may add this bonus on Diplomacy checks instead. The DC
      of any fear effect created by Ichirou also increases by +1.
  - name: Tolerance (Ex)
    description: >-
      If Ichirou fails a save against an effect that causes him to become
      nauseated, sickened, fatigued, or exhausted, he can make a second save to
      negate the effect on the start of his next turn. Only one additional save
      is allowed. If the effect does not allow a saving throw, its duration is
      halved instead (minimum of 1 round).
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ichirou has little interest in helping the monks defend this area, but he
  casts bull's strength, fly, and magic weapon if alerted to the presence of
  intruders.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ichirou orders the two Sisters of the Broken Path to engage opponents while he
  remains in the rear watching the fray and using his spell-like abilities. If
  enemies get past the monks, Ichirou rages and attempts to bull rush foes into
  the pit in area C9.
Morale: >-
  A lustful coward, Ichirou withdraws from combat once he is reduced to 60 hit
  points or fewer. He attempts to bargain for his life with information,
  preferably with an attractive female. Ichirou knows the general layout of the
  Penance, although not many specifics (he's far more interested in sating his
  lusts than paying attention to such mundane matters as personnel and
  staffing). If his parlay is refused, Ichirou rages once more and fights to the
  death.
Gear: >-
  +2 studded leather, masterwork composite longbow (+6 Str) with 20 arrows,
  masterwork nodachi*, ring of protection +1
