BeforeCombat: Mrs. Pedipalp casts undetectable alignment each day to conceal her nature.
DuringCombat: >-
  Mrs. Pedipalp's spells and aging body aren't especially deadly, but she is
  well suited to subduing enemies and leaving them for her allies. She casts
  mirror image if attacked and unadulterated loathing on adventurers to make
  them hate their allies, especially any obvious clerics or healers. After that,
  she targets foes with color spray and sleep, and casts suggestion to order
  individuals to wait for her in the garden. If she manages to subdue the PCs,
  she won't do the dirty work herself,  instead binding them in silk rope and
  leaving them in area F2 for Mictena to dispatch.
Morale: >-
  Mrs. Pedipalp fight tenaciously, but she's practical. If reduced below 6 hit
  points, she begs for mercy.
