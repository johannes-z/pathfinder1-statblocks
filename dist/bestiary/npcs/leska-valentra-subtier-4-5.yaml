Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Leska draws her kukris and stands where the PCs will easily notice her as they
  attempt to leave the temple, waiting for Momota to get into position for the
  ambush. She casts resist energy, selecting the type she sees the most evidence
  of in the PCs' battles against the rest of the agents in the temple. If the
  PCs were especially brutal in their handling of the other defeated Aspis
  Consortium agents in the temple, she drinks her potion of bull's strength as
  well.
DuringCombat: >-
  Leska targets any of her favored enemies in the party first, after which she
  focuses her attention on the PC who seems to be dealing the most damage to her
  and her allies. If faced with a particularly adept ranged combatant, she drops
  one kukri and throws a chakram at the target before moving in to engage the PC
  in melee.
Morale: >-
  Leska is enraged at the PCs' incursion and avenges deaths of the Aspis
  Consortium agents who fell at the party's hands, fighting to the death and
  using her orc ferocity to strike a last blow against the nearest PC.
