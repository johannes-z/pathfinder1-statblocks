  Pamari casts mage armor on herself. The effects of this spell are included in
  her statistics.
DuringCombat: >-
  Pamari casts her spells from afar. She begins with a fireball if she can catch
  multiple enemies within the blast. If someone attempts to close the distance,
  she either casts fly or mirror image or blocks them with a spell like create
  pit. If the PCs hit Jathune with a debilitating spell effect, Pamari casts
  dispel magic to try and get rid of it.

  If Jathune falls unconscious and Pamari is reduced to 12 hit points or fewer,
  she attempts to flee, surrendering if fleeing seems unlikely to succeed.
