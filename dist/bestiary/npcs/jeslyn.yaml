BeforeCombat: >-
  Jeslyn casts bull's strength, bear's endurance, false life, and shield of
  faith once she fears the PCs are drawing near.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jeslyn casts divine favor on the first round of combat, then attacks with her
  scythe. If she's having trouble hitting foes, she abandons the scythe and
  instead uses her inflict spells. She uses bestow curse to lower ability scores
  against foes&#8211;she's particularly fond of reducing Wisdom scores for
  clerics, but doesn't bother using spells with saving throws against paladins.
Morale: Jeslyn fights to the death.
