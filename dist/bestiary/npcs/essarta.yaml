BeforeCombat: If Essarta expects trouble, she casts freedom of movement.
DuringCombat: >-
  Essarta prefers to attack with her wrappings, but she casts searing light
  against foes that remain at a distance. Eager to recover some of her former
  stature as a reaper of souls, she casts death knell on fallen opponents.
