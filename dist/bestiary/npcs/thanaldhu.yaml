BeforeCombat: >-
  If the PCs follow Thanaldhu into the government house, it uses Stealth to hide
  behind one of the pillars on the balcony of the building's second floor. When
  one of the PCs gets within 30 feet, Thanaldhu fires its crossbow from cover
  for a sneak attack. The ugothol prefers to target PCs it knows to be divine
  spellcasters first.
DuringCombat: >-
  Initially, Thanaldhu prefers to stay on the move, keeping distance from the
  PCs and firing upon them with its crossbow. Thanaldhu closes for melee combat
  when it's most tactically advantageous, such as catching an opponent unaware
  so it can benefit from flanking.
Morale: >-
  Thanaldhu knows that failure in this important mission means a fate worse than
  death at the hands of its aboleth master, and it fights to the death.
