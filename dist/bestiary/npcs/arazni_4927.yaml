    description: >-
      Arazni has the wealth of a 20thlevel PC, rather than an NPC. This
      increases her CR by 1. She used some of this wealth to create and read the
      following books to gain inherent bonuses to her ability scores: manual of
      gainful exercise +5, manual of quickness in action +4, tome of clear
      thought +5, and tome of leadership and influence +5. Permanent Spells
      Using permanency, Arazni gave herself the constant effects of arcane
      sight, resistance, and see invisibility. She is under the effect of a
      contingency that casts harm on her if she's brought below 100 hit points.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Every day, Arazni casts detect scrying, false life, greater magic weapon,
  mythic mage armor (cast from her staff of the magi), and overland flight on
  herself, using her arcane metamastery path ability to gain the benefit of
  Extended Spell with each. The effects of these spells and the use of mythic
  power already expended are reflected in Arazni's statistics.
