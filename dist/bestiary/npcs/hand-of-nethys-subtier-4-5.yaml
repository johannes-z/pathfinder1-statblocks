  - name: Pus Burst (Su)
    description: >-
      When a giant crawling hand damaged by a piercing or slashing melee weapon,
      a spray of vile pus strikes the attacker unless it succeeds at a DC 15
      Reflex save. Weapons that provide reach protect the attacker completely
      from a pus burst. Creatures struck by pus become nauseated for 1d3 rounds
      and take 2d6 points of negative energy damage. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The giant crawling hand attacks one creature to mark it as its quarry and
  focuses the rest of its attacks on that creature.
Morale: The giant crawling hand fights to the death.
