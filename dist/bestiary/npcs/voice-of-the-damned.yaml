SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blasphemous Embrace (Ex)
    description: >-
      If the Voice of the Damned grapples a foe, it can, as a swift action,
      cause its blasphemy-stained pages to flense the grappled creature. The
      pages deal the Voice of the Damned's swarm damage. If a creature takes
      damage from the pages, it is also subject to the swarm's distraction
      ability, and must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude saving throw or be
      nauseated for 1 round. The Voice of the Damned can have only one embraced
      target at a time, but it doesn't have to continue grappling in order to
      maintain the embrace. If the Voice of the Damned moves more than 5 feet
      from the pages or dismisses them (a free action), the pages are rendered
      inanimate. Any area attack that would damage a swarm or any severe or
      stronger wind effect ends the blasphemous embrace.
  - name: Consume (Su)
    description: >-
      If the Voice of the Damned begins its turn with an opponent in its
      blasphemous embrace, it can attempt a new combat maneuver check, as though
      attempting to pin the opponent. If it succeeds, its foe takes swarm damage
      and vanishes into a nightmare realm of slashing pages and murderous
      blasphemies within the Voice of the Damned. The target must be of Large
      size or smaller. The Voice of the Damned can't consume a creature that has
      the good subtype or that is affected by holy aura. A consumed creature
      takes 8d6 points of damage each round as it drifts within the Voice of the
      Damned's accumulated heresies. Nonevil creatures must each also succeed at
      DC 32 Will saving throws each round or be affected as per the spell
      insanity. The Voice of the Damned can expel any consumed creature as a
      move action, causing it to appear in any square adjacent to it. Any
      creature that is deafened or affected by silence or a similar effect is
      immune to the insanity effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Each round
      on its turn, a consumed creature can attempt a DC 20 Wisdom check as a
      full-round action. If the subject succeeds at this check on two
      consecutive turns, it escapes, emerging into a space adjacent to the Voice
      of the Damned. The Voice of the Damned cannot attempt to consume an
      escaped creature again until 24 hours have passed. A consumed creature can
      also escape by using plane shift or similar magic. The Voice of the Damned
      is stunned for 1 round and forced to expel all consumed creatures if a
      creature inside casts holy aura or summons a creature with the good
      subtype, or if a creature (either inside or out) targets it with
      atonement, freedom, or holy word.
  - name: Discorporate (Su)
    description: >-
      The Voice of the Damned can collapse into a cyclone of whirling pages as a
      free action. All held, worn, and carried items fall to the ground, and its
      Strength score drops to 1. The Voice of the Damned functions as a swarm of
      Diminutive creatures while discorporated, with a reach of 0 feet (its
      space remains unchanged). While discorporated, the Voice of the Damned
      maintains its defensive abilities. It loses its claw, slam, and wing
      natural attacks, but can make a swarm attack and use its spell-like
      abilities. The Voice of the Damned can reform into its true form as a
      full-round action as long as it has at least 1 hit point.
  - name: Malevolence (Su)
    description: >-
      As an immediate action, the Voice of the Damned can attempt to merge its
      body with a creature it has consumed. This ability is similar to a magic
      jar spell (caster level 25th), except that it does not require a
      receptacle. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 32 Will
      saving throw. If the creature fails, the Voice of the Damned vanishes and
      the possessed creature reappears in its space (along with any other
      creatures the Voice of the Damned had consumed). A creature that
      successfully saves is immune to the Voice of the Damned's malevolence for
      24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Master of Symbols (Su)
    description: >-
      The Voice of the Damned can speak, read, and write all languages, as per
      the spell tongues. It casts any spell with the word "symbol" in its name
      as though its casting time were a standard action. Additionally, it does
      not need a surface on which to inscribe symbols-they merely float in the
      air for their duration.
  - name: Tenacious (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Voice of the Damned gains a +8 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks
      to grapple and a +4 racial bonus to its CMD.
  - name: Wracking Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      The Voice of the Damned has a gaze attack with a range of 50 feet that
      deals 8d10 points of damage and 1d4 points of Strength damage. A
      successful DC 32 Fortitude saving throw negates the Strength damage but
      not the physical damage.
