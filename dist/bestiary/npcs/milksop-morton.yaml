BeforeCombat: Morton casts mage armor daily, and casts shield before confronting the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once combat begins, Morton casts tiny hut to provide one-way concealment
  around the helm of the Dryad's Grave. As his ship closes in, Morton casts
  solid fog to slow the PCs' ship, followed by confusion, fireball, or stinking
  cloud on large groups of enemies. When close enough, Morton casts resilient
  sphere to neutralize enemy spellcasters, then summons groups of fire
  elementals or a fiendish crocodile aboard the PC's ship. Once the two ships
  are grappled, Morton uses his dimensional steps ability to board the PCs' ship
  with his familiar Xicorax.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, or if it's clear that the PCs have the
  upper hand, Morton calls for parley and begs for mercy. He is loath to lose
  his ship, but he freely offers the ring of the iron skull in exchange for
  freedom for himself and the Dryad's Grave. If given no other choice, he fights
  to the death.
Gear: >-
  potions of cure moderate wounds (2), potion of invisibility, scrolls of dispel
  magic (2), scroll of fly
