BeforeCombat: >-
  Caraniel casts mage armor at the start of her shift, and shield as soon as she
  suspects combat is about to occur.
DuringCombat: >-
  Caraniel opens combat by casting greater invisibility on herself, followed by
  shield if that spell isn't already active. She casts haste on allies early in
  combat long as they still stand to benefit. She then casts mind fog, followed
  by her more powerful mind-affecting spells. When she's a few rounds away from
  running out the duration of greater invisibility (or as soon as she can after
  this effect is removed early), she casts mirror image.
Morale: >-
  Caraniel fights until reduced below 10 hit points, at which point she attempts
  to teleport to her home in Kyonin. She remains there for a day until, racked
  with guilt at abandoning her post, she pays for a scroll of sending to contact
  Knight Commander Phand to offer additional aid free of charge; in this case,
  the PCs may well encounter her again fighting at his side, in which event she
  fights to the death.
Gear: wand of hold person (15 charges), wand of mage armor (CL 11th, 8 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  dagger, amulet of natural armor +2, belt of incredible dexterity +2, ring of
  protection +2, 24 pp, 43 gp
