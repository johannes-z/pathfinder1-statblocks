DuringCombat: >-
  The Radiant Muse's first act in combat is to cast greater invisibility and
  inspire courage with her bardic performance. If she has allies nearby, she
  lets them fight while bolstering them with her spells or hindering the PCs
  with the same. On her own, she stays in motion for the first several rounds of
  combat, using spells while flying from rooftop to rooftop. Once she's got the
  party disorganized with her magic, she settles down on a rooftop and focuses
  her longbow attacks on a single foe.
