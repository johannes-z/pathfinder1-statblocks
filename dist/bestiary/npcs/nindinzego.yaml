SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sense of Doom (Ex)
    description: >-
      The sense of doom that fills Nindinzego's alien mind causes it to take a
      -4 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. In addition, each time
      it rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll or saving throw, and each time it
      takes a critical hit, it becomes shaken for the following round, taking a
      &#8211;2 penalty on all d20 rolls for that duration.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nindinzego is a powerful melee combatant, but its sense of doom prevents it
  from immediately swooping in to fight foes in melee. Instead, it hovers near
  the ceiling so it can use unholy blight and its wand of scorching ray for the
  first few rounds of combat, flying in to cast poison on the most
  heavily-armored foe. It retreats into the air to use its wand for 1d3 rounds
  after each time its sense of doom activates.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 7 or fewer hit points, Nindinzego spends its next turn shrieking
  into the air, "Father! Help! Faaaathhhherrrr! Pazuzu!" If the creature
  survives this round, it continues to fight thereafter to the death.
