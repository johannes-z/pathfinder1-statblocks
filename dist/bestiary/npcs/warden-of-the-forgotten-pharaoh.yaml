DuringCombat: >-
  The cultists use Stealth to hide behind cover before firing flaming arrows at
  opponents. Once opponents are within 60 feet, a cultist drops her bow and
  draws her scimitar and shield, charging into melee to take advantage of her
  Opening Volley feat and make Power Attacks.
Morale: >-
  The cultists are fanatically devoted to the Forgotten Pharaoh and fight to the
  death, which triggers their Troth of the Forgotten Pharaoh feat, destroying
  their bodies. If a cultist is knocked unconscious or her capture seems
  inevitable, her Troth of the Forgotten Pharaoh feat activates as an immediate
  action to prevent capture.
