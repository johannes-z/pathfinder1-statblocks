  The Consortium Wizard is sound asleep in the wagon next to his prize beast. He
  is still protected by an extended mage armor spell cast earlier in the day
  (already included in his stats).
DuringCombat: >-
  Startled in the night, the Consortium Wizard responds quickly to any sounds of
  attack by using a scroll of invisibility and then surveying the situation. If
  the camp is under attack, he releases the beast from its cage and either
  continues to buff or uses his wand of black tentacles depending on the
  situation. He continues to fight with a mix of controlling and damaging
  spells.
Morale: >-
  The Consortium Wizard continues to fight until the cause is lost, after which
  he drops to his knees and pleads for his life. If he hasn't found out already,
  he attempts to identify the attackers.
