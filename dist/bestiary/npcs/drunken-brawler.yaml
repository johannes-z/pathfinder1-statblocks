DuringCombat: >-
  These drunken brawlers are just looking for a friendly fight, and fight with
  unarmed strikes and Power Attack. If any of the PCs pull out weapons or deal
  lethal damage with their attacks, the brawlers snatch up tankards of ale and
  smash chairs to use as improvised weapons. The brawlers flank with each other
  to make sneak attacks, and use combat maneuvers to disarm foes or dirty trick
  maneuvers to blind opponents for a round or 2 (possibly by throwing ale in
  their faces) and sneak attack those opponents.
Morale: >-
  A drunken brawler attempts to flee if he takes 20 or more points of lethal
  damage.
Gear: leather armor, dagger, improvised weapon, 2d20 gp each
