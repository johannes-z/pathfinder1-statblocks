  If he has to fight, Zincher likes to have allies nearby to take blows for him,
  be they one of his beloved axe beaks, his bodyguard Mister Magenta, or even
  one of the PCs. He often tries to demoralize foes by yelling profanities and
  curses at them before attacking at range with his alchemical weapons or
  throwing axes. In melee, he prefers to fight defensively.
Morale: >-
  Even with his arrangement with the church of Besmara, Clegg doesn't want to
  die. If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, he flees, preferably by drinking
  his potion of gaseous form to aid his escape. However, he's careful to not
  appear cowardly, so he tends to bluff and bluster his way out of trouble by
  maneuvering his employees between himself and his foes before he makes a
  strategic withdrawal.
Gear: acid (2), alchemist's fire (12), potion of gaseous form
