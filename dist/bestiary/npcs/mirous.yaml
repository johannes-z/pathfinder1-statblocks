BeforeCombat: >-
  Mirous prepares for battle by drinking his mutagen to increase his Strength.
  If the PCs were not the first group to encounter the zuvembie, he has already
  used his daily corpse call ability to attract a rival racing team, expending
  his oils of animate dead to create two additional zuvembies from the corpses
  of his fallen victims. If the PCs are the first group of racers to face the
  zuvembie, he instead summons 1d2 constrictor snakes to assist him in battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  Mirous initially fights from range, hurling explosive bombs at the PCs. He
  uses targeted bomb admixture if his foes disperse to avoid splash damage. If
  pressed into melee, he uses ghoul touch to weaken his foes before tearing into
  them with his claws.
Morale: Mirous fights until he is destroyed.
Gear: oils of animate dead (3)
