BeforeCombat: >-
  Zolerim casts extended mage armor and extended false life every morning. Once
  he's alerted to trouble, he casts sending to alert Ardathanatus that the PCs
  are in the dungeon. He casts extended shield, fly, freedom of movement, and
  extended shield of faith on himself before entering combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zolerim uses flight to stay mobile in combat and relies on his damaging spells
  to hit the PCs at range, but casts mirror image on the first round of the
  fight. Whenever he's surrounded and can't get to safety to cast spells, he
  simply channels negative energy. He heals himself whenever he's reduced to 40
  or fewer hit points.
Morale: >-
  If he's reduced to 20 or fewer hit points, Zolerim casts wall of force to try
  to seal the PCs off from him, then flees. As soon as he's out of sight, he
  casts meld into stone to hide in the dungeon floor for an hour or so before
  emerging. At this point, he heals himself and then moves out into the dungeon
  to seek the PCs for revenge. He doesn't expect mercy, and if escape isn't an
  option, he fights to the death. If captured, he is unrepentant, claiming that
  Nethys cares nothing for petty human politics and that he sided with the
  source of stronger magic (Ardathanatus), as his god demanded&#8211;he only
  reveals what he knows of the dungeon if magically compelled. In this case, you
  can use a charmed or compelled Zolerim to give the PCs whatever hints you wish
  about the parts of the dungeon they have yet to explore.
