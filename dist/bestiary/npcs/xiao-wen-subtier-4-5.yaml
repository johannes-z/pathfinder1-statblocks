SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Spell Combat (Ex)
    description: >-
      Xiao can cast spells while wielding a weapon at the same time. This
      ability functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the off-hand weapon
      is a spell that is being cast. As a full-round action, she can make all of
      her attacks with his melee weapon at a -2 penalty and can also cast any of
      her prepared spells with a casting time of 1 standard action (any attack
      roll made as part of this spell also takes this penalty). If Xiao casts
      this spell defensively, she can decide to take an additional penalty on
      her attack rolls, up to her Intelligence bonus, and add the same amount as
      a circumstance bonus on her concentration check. If the check fails, the
      spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. Xiao can choose
      to cast the spell first or make the weapon attack first.
  - name: Spellstrike (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever Xiao casts a spell with a range of "touch," she can deliver the
      spell through any weapon she wields as part of a melee attack. Instead of
      the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, Xiao
      can make one free melee attack with her weapon (at her full base attack
      bonus) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack
      deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If Xiao makes
      this attack in concert with spell combat, this melee attack takes all the
      penalties accrued by her spell combat melee attacks. This attack uses the
      weapon's critical range, and the spell effect deals x2 damage on a
      successful critical hit.
  - name: Spell Recall (Su)
    description: >-
      With a swift action, Xiao can recall any single magus spell she has
      already prepared and cast that day by expending a number of points from
      her arcane pool equal to the spell's level (minimum 1). The spell is
      prepared again, just as if it had not been cast.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Xiao waits belowdecks to avoid ranged attacks until she can board the PCs'
  ship. In the rounds before boarding, Xiao uses her arcane pool ability to turn
  her scimitar into a +1 shock scimitar, imbibes her potion of bull's strength,
  and casts blur on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Xiao uses spell combat to make a scimitar attack and cast a spell each round,
  starting with scorching ray. After exhausting her ranged spells, Xiao uses her
  spellstrike ability to deliver touch spells through her scimitar attacks.
  After expending all of her combative spells, she uses spell recall to recover
  one use of either chill touch or shocking grasp.
Morale: >-
  Xiao knows enough about the empire's plans for the Braid of a Hundred Masters
  to realize it is of crucial importance, and thus fights to the death for the
  glory of Lingshen.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of bull's strength
OtherGear: >-
  +1 leather lamellar*, masterwork scimitar, jade pendant worth 100 gp,
  spellbook (contains all prepared spells plus burning hands, expeditious
  retreat, fog cloud, magic weapon, mount, and all cantrips), spell component
  pouch, 236 gp
