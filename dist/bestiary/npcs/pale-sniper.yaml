    description: >-
      A pale sniper fights with the rifle it wielded in life. While rifles
      normally consume bullets when fired, a pale sniper's rifle supernaturally
      reloads the instant it fires. The pale sniper gains a bonus equal to its
      Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing a rifle. In addition, any
      rifle a pale sniper wields functions as a +1 rifle. A pale sniper does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity when it fires a rifle in melee.
DuringCombat: >-
  The pale snipers use their stranger's shot ability against targets at extreme
  range. At closer ranges, they use Deadly Aim and Rapid Shot to harass any
  creatures in view with well-placed shots.
Morale: The pale snipers fight to the death if cornered.
Gear: Mosin-Nagant M1891 rifle (see page 65) with scope (see page 67)
