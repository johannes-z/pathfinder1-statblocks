  These harpies are fond of using their captivating song to attract prey, flying
  out over the river, and luring victims into walking off the edge of the cliff.
  They prefer to enter melee only when they can all gang up on a single foe at a
  time.
Morale: A harpy flees into the mountains if she is reduced to 20 hit points or fewer.
