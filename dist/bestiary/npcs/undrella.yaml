  - name: Captivating Song (Su)
    description: >-
      A harpy's song has the power to infect the minds of those that hear it,
      calling them to the harpy's side. When a harpy sings, all creatures aside
      from other harpies within a 300-foot spread must succeed at a DC 17 Will
      saving throw or become captivated. A creature that successfully saves is
      not subject to the same harpy's song for 24 hours. A victim under the
      effects of the captivating song moves toward the harpy using the most
      direct means available. If the path leads it into a dangerous area such as
      through fire or off a cliff, the victim receives a second saving throw to
      end the effect before moving into peril. Captivated creatures can take no
      actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the
      harpy simply stands and offers no resistance to the harpy's attacks. This
      effect continues for as long as the harpy sings and for 1 round
      thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
