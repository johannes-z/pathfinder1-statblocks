DuringCombat: >-
  Ekram remains a performer and show-off at heart. He dives into the middle of
  combat, making trip attacks with his natron fang and striking with his kukri,
  then attacking again when prone opponents attempt to right themselves.
Morale: >-
  Ekram knows he can pass valuable information about the PCs to the cult if he
  survives. If reduced to fewer than 7 hit points, he attempts to withdraw from
  combat and lose any pursuers in the twisting alleys and canals of the Veins.
Gear: >-
  studded leather, composite shortbow (+3 Str) with 20 arrows, mwk kukri, natron
  fang (+1 khopeshUE; see page 63), key to area F2, gold funerary mask (worth 50
  gp), 21 gp
