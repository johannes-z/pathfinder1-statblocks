SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dormancy (Su)
    description: >-
      The Husk of Xhamen-Dor has shielded itself from conventional detection
      while recuperating, which makes it difficult to find until it moves. As a
      full-round action, the husk can become inanimate, during which time it
      bends light and sounds around itself to disguise its presence. This grants
      it a +20 bonus on Stealth checks and the benefits of a nondetection spell
      (CL 20th). The husk can use its spell-like abilities and telepathy while
      in this state, but any other action causes this effect to end immediately.
  - name: Dread Decay (Su)
    description: >-
      The Husk of Xhamen-Dor's tentacles inflict a horrible affliction that
      withers the flesh, digesting the victims with sickening speed. This
      catastrophic withering begins when the tentacle deals damage and continues
      for 4 rounds thereafter. Each round the rot persists, the target must
      succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or take 2 points of Constitution damage
      and 2 points of Wisdom damage. If the target succeeds at two consecutive
      saving throws, the effect is cured. Heal also ends the effect. Latent
      Great Old One The Husk of Xhamen-Dor is all that remains of the
      once-mighty Great Old One Xhamen- Dor. Until it recovers its power
      completely, it gains all the benefits from all of the Great Old One
      subtype (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 306) save for immortality and mythic.
  - name: Unspeakable Presence (Su)
    description: >-
      Failing a DC 27 Will save against the Husk of Xhamen-Dor's unspeakable
      presence causes the victim to capitulate to the husk's rotting attacks and
      become a seeded creature; the victim loses its Dexterity bonus to AC
      against the husk's attacks. If the creature is also infected with the
      seedborne consumption-even if it is are otherwise immune to the disease's
      effects-a failed save also forces that creature to move at least its speed
      toward the husk each round; once a creature enters the husk's reach, the
      victim is staggered until the end of its next turn. This ends the
      compulsion to move closer but not the loss of Dexterity.
