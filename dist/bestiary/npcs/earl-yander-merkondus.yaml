BeforeCombat: >-
  If he expects a fight or is fleeing, Earl Yander Merkondus drinks his potion
  of barkskin and uses his wand of bear's endurance on himself (not reflected in
  these statistics).
DuringCombat: >-
  Yander opens fights with a glorious epic to leave his opponents flat-footed,
  then switches to satire to impose a -2 penalty on their attack and damage
  rolls. He prefers to leave the fighting to his loyal bodyguards while sowing
  chaos among his enemies with spells such as dispel magic, hideous laughter,
  sound burst, and they know, sound burst.
Morale: >-
  Earl Merkondus knows he is ineffective in melee. If his allies are defeated
  and he's unable to incapacitate his opponents with spells, he attempts to
  flee.

  potions of barkskin (2), scroll of cure serious wounds, wand of bear's
  endurance (10 charges), wand of shield (30 charges)
