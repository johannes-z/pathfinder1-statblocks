BeforeCombat: >-
  Prior to the exhibition round, Nearidei casts air walk, barkskin, and freedom
  of movement.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nearidei uses air walk to move 15 feet off the ground, out of reach of her
  tethered animal, and creates a 10-foot-tall wall of thorns to shield it from
  view. On subsequent rounds, she casts spike stones, call lightning, and
  flaming sphere to restrict her foes' movements and to deal ongoing damage to
  the opposing animal. If her animal is ever threatened in melee, she casts
  animal growth on it to increase its viability in combat.
Morale: >-
  Nearidei does whatever she can to protect her animal, including putting
  herself in harm's way, fighting until knocked unconscious before allowing her
  animal to go down.
Gear: +3 hide armor, +1 spear, ring of protection +1
