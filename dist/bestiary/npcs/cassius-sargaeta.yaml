DuringCombat: >-
  Cassius is a bombastic fighter and enjoys humiliating foes in battle by
  pushing them around (preferably off the decks of ships to send them tumbling
  into the briny deep) or sundering their weapons (typically in combination with
  Vital Strike in order to do as much damage to the weapon as possible), only
  resorting to normal attacks when desperate or to finish off his foes. He
  prefers to stay mobile, using Vital Strike to minimize foes making full
  attacks against him. He generally uses Power Attack only against foes who
  don't appear to be heavily armored, but if he's hitting his targets often and
  they don't seem to be giving him a challenge, utilizing Power Attack certainly
  helps to satisfy Cassius's passion for dramatics.
Morale: >-
  Cassius surrenders once he is reduced to 10 hit points or fewer if he suspects
  his foes are capable of mercy. Otherwise, he fights to the death.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of water breathing
