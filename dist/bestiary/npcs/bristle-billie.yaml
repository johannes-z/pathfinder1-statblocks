BeforeCombat: >-
  Billie rarely expects a fight, as he's generally too involved with his work to
  notice intruders.
DuringCombat: >-
  Billie lashes out with acid arrow before thinking to protect himself, only
  casting mage armor after his initial attack. Afterward, he takes swings with
  the heavy wrench he wields as a mace, and casts blink on himself and slow on
  his opponents if reduced to fewer than half his hit points.
Morale: Billie is too stubborn to call for help, and fights to the death.
