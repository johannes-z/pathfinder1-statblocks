  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature as noted below. A transmute rock to mud
      spell slows the golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving
      throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points. A
      stone to flesh spell does not actually change the golem's structure but it
      negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.
  - name: Slow (Su)
    description: >-
      A stone golem can use a slow effect, as the spell, as a free action every
      2 rounds. The effect has a range of 10 feet in a burst centered on the
      golem and a duration of 7 rounds, requiring a successful DC 15 Will save
      to negate. The save DC is Constitution based.
