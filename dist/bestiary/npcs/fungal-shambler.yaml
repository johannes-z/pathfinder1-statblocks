BeforeCombat: >-
  Fungal shamblers are slow and therefore they rely on the element of surprise,
  concealing themselves among the leaf litter and fungal growths of the blighted
  Fangwood.
DuringCombat: >-
  A fungal shambler launches ambushes with its slam attacks. If prey attempts to
  flee, it uses its spore cloud to slow escaping enemies.
Morale: A fungal shambler fights until destroyed.
