  - name: Blood Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant stirge drains blood at the end of its turn if it grapples a foe,
      dealing 1 point of Constitution damage. A giant stirge continues to drain
      blood until it has dealt 8 points of Constitution damage, then drops its
      prey to return to its lair to digest its meal.
DuringCombat: >-
  The giant stirge quickly crawls out of its nest to buzz hungrily at intruders,
  attacking anyone who enters this room or whom it hears on the outer balcony.
  If the stirge hears any form of music (such as that created by certain bardic
  performances or a Perform skill check), it ceases its attacks and swoops down
  to land next to the musician. As long as the bardic performance continues, or
  as long as the musician can continue to make DC 15 Perform checks (or as long
  as no one else attacks it), the giant stirge remains docile.
Morale: The giant stirge fights to the death.
