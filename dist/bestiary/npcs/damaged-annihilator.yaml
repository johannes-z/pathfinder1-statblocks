SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Chain Gun (Ex)
    description: >-
      This advanced integrated firearm has a range increment of 200 feet,
      automatically reloads as a free action, and has a 1-2 misfire range. If a
      misfire occurs, the attack misses and the robot must use its next action
      clearing the chamber of the jammed gun (the robot doesn't attempt to fire
      a jammed chain gun). An annihilator's core can process scrap metal into
      new ammunition, effectively giving the annihilator infinite ammo with this
      weapon.
  - name: Combined Arms (Ex)
    description: >-
      When taking a full attack action, an annihilator can attack with melee and
      ranged integrated weapons simultaneously.
  - name: Plasma Lance (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once every 3 rounds, the annihilator may fire a
      120-foot-long line of plasma from its tail. All creatures in this area
      take 14d6 points of plasma damage (half fire, half electricity; DC 18
      Reflex halves). The save DC is Intelligence-based, and includes a &#8211;4
      penalty for damage suffered.
  - name: Unrepaired (Ex)
    description: >-
      The damage the robot suffered has done more than lower its hit points and
      reduce its hardness&#8211;it's also rendered one of its chain guns
      inoperative, ruined its booster jets and its force field, and prevents it
      from using its chain gun to perform suppressing fire. Finally, if the
      robot suffers critical hit damage, it loses 1 point of hardness in
      addition to the regular effects robots suffer on a critical hit. Despite
      all this damage, though, the annihilator remains a deadly foe&#8211;and
      foreshadows a fight against a fully operational annihilator at the start
      of the final adventure in the Iron Gods Adventure Path.
DuringCombat: >-
  The lumbering construct attacks as soon as PCs enter the carved cavern,
  starting combat with a plasma lance attack and then moving in to melee foes
  while using its integrated chain gun. It pursues foes for no more than 3
  rounds if they flee this room.
Morale: The damaged annihilator fights until it is destroyed.
