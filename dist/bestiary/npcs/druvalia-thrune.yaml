BeforeCombat: >-
  Druvalia casts greater magic weapon on her crossbow every day. Once it's clear
  that her flagship is going to be attacked, she casts freedom of movement,
  heroism, ward the faithful (which affects her allies as well), defile armor,
  and invisibility purge. She also drinks a potion of bull's strength and casts
  weapon of awe on her crossbow.
DuringCombat: >-
  At the beginning of combat, Druvalia casts divine power and flames of the
  faithful on her crossbow, and activates her judgment ability, typically making
  destruction and justice judgments, switching to other judgments as needed to
  counter the tactics of her opponents. While her allies engage foes in melee
  combat, Druvalia attacks with her crossbow, using her Deadly Aim and Rapid
  Shot feats. She alternates these attacks with spells such as flame strike,
  rebuke, or blistering invective. If her opponents are able to hit her with
  their attacks, Druvalia casts unwilling shield on an enemy combatant. All crew
  members aboard the Abrogail's Fury carry a case of five bolts for Druvalia's
  crossbow, and are trained to reload her crossbow whenever they are adjacent
  and she calls for ammunition, to save her the time of reloading it herself.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, Druvalia dismisses her invisibility
  purge and drinks a potion of invisibility, retreating to the poop deck of the
  Abrogail's Fury or her cabin belowdecks to use her wand to heal herself before
  re-entering the fray. Druvalia has wagered everything on victory and fights to
  the death rather than surrender to pirates, knowing her soul is lost to Geryon
  whatever happens.
Gear: >-
  potions of bull's strength (2), potions of invisibility (2), wand of cure
  critical wounds (20 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 mithral light fortification breastplate, crossbow of retribution (+1 human
  bane seeking repeating heavy crossbow, see page 54) with 10 bolts, +1 heavy
  mace, belt of physical might +4 (Con, Dex), brooch of shielding, headband of
  inspired wisdom +4, ring of force shield, robe of powerlessness, signet ring
  (worth 100 gp), silver unholy symbol of Asmodeus, spell component pouch,
