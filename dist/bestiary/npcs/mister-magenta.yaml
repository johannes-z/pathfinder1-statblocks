DuringCombat: >-
  Cautious but deadly, Mister Magenta knows it's best not to fight alone. If
  that is the only possible solution, he prefers to fight with his back against
  the wall or from the edges of combat. He uses one potion of invisibility if he
  needs to set up an opportune flanking attack, but he saves the second for
  emergencies.
Morale: >-
  Magenta has no wish to die, but he has a reputation to protect. As a result,
  he fights until reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, at which point he tries to
  drink a potion of invisibility and flee. In this event, he flees Riddleport
  entirely and starts over in a new city, rather than suffer the humiliation of
  rumors he fled from a fight.
