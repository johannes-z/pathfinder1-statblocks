DuringCombat: >-
  Janks stands in the square marked X and attacks the PCs at range with his
  crossbow, preferring to target anyone wearing light or no armor first. He
  hopes to draw the PCs into the swinging axe trap by making himself a target.
  Once the axe trap has been activated, Janks backs toward the staircase in the
  west wall, firing and moving each turn. Janks prefers not to enter melee, but
  will as a last resort.
Morale: >-
  Janks fights until he has 5 or fewer hit points and then tries to flee up the
  staircase to area A5.
