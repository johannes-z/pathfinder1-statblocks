BeforeCombat: >-
  Using their ability to climb, the morlocks position themselves on the cavern
  wall and ceiling. Using stealth, they wait for PCs to enter the room and then
  drop down upon them, surprising them and blocking their egress.
DuringCombat: >-
  If they can swarm an opponent, the morlocks do so in order to take their sneak
  attacks. Upon finishing a strike, they scurry back up the walls, trying to get
  enemies to chase them. During the retreat they throw nightmare vapor flasks,
  and hide again hoping to repeat the first tactic, or at least lure attackers
  into risky positions.
Morale: >-
  Fiercely dedicated to their mistress and distinctly insane, the morlocks have
  few fears and fight to the death.
