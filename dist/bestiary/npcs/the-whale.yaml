DuringCombat: >-
  The Whale's distended mouth enables it to swallow opponents whole, and its
  hunger drives it to this action, though it may regret doing so later. If a
  swallowed victim deals damage to the Whale, the giant grindylow vomits up its
  undigested meal on the following round as a free action.
Morale: >-
  Unable to leave the confines of the Cauldron, the Whale fights to the death.
  If the Brinebrood Queen is slain, the Whale flies into an incredible rage,
  focusing its attacks solely on the character who killed her, ignoring any
  other threats to avenge its dead mother.
