DuringCombat: >-
  Muminah stays in the back and uses channel positive energy to heal her crew.
  She uses her Selective Channeling feat to keep the two most hurt PCs out of
  the blast of positive energy. Should a PC get close to her, she uses her next
  action to cast cause fear on that PC, and if that fails, she casts sanctuary.
Morale: A brave adventurer and Pathfinder, Muminah fights to the death.
