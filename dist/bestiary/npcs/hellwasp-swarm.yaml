    description: >-
      When hellwasps swarm together, they gain an Intelligence of 6 and the
      ability to use skills and feats, and can speak Infernal with a voice made
      up of an amalgamation of their constant droning.

    description: >-
      A hellwasp swarm can enter the body of a helpless or dead creature by
      crawling into its mouth and other orifices. Inhabiting the body requires 1
      minute, and the victim must be Small, Medium, or Large. The swarm can
      abandon the body at any time, although doing so takes a full-round action.
      Any attack against the host deals half damage to the hellwasp swarm as
      well, although the swarm's resistances and immunities may negate some or
      all of this damage. If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a dead body, it can
      restore animation to the creature and control its movements, effectively
      transforming it into a zombie of the appropriate size for as long as the
      swarm remains inside. If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a living victim, it can
      neutralize the effects of its own poison and control the victim's movement
      and actions as if using dominate monster on the victim. The hellwasps
      quickly consume a living victim, dealing 2d4 points of Constitution damage
      per hour they inhabit its body. A hellwasp-inhabited creature is
      relatively easy to spot, since its skin crawls with the forms of the
      insects inside. The swarm is intelligent enough to attempt to hide beneath
      loose clothing or a large cloak to keep its presence from being detected.
      The swarm can attempt a Disguise check to conceal its inhabitation of a
      host, taking a -4 penalty if it inhabits a Small host. A remove disease or
      heal spell cast on an inhabited victim forces the hellwasp swarm to
      abandon its host.
