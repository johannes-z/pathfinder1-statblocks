SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burning Cold (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an owb can conjure a ball of flickering flames and
      hurl it at an opponent. The flames can be thrown as a ranged touch attack
      at a range of 120 feet with no range increment, and deal 3d6 points of
      cold damage.
  - name: Curse of Darkness (Su)
    description: >-
      With a touch, an owb can make bright light unbearable to the victim. Any
      creature touched must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or gain the light
      blindness weakness. This ability also robs the victim of its coloration,
      leaving the creature and its equipment in washed-out shades of gray. This
      effect can be removed with break enchantment or remove curse, unless the
      target has the dark folk subtype, in which case the effect can only be
      removed by wish or similar magic. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Feign Death (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a nightmare creature is unconscious, it appears dead. A conscious
      nightmare creature can also make itself appear dead as an immediate
      action. Any creature that physically interacts with a nightmare creature
      feigning death must succeed at a DC 19 Heal check or Will saving throw to
      recognize it is actually alive.
  - name: Illusion Resistance (Ex)
    description: >-
      A nightmare creature automatically disbelieves illusions (no saving throw
      required) and has a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist illusion effects.
  - name: Frightful Presence (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability activates when the nightmare creature charges, attacks during
      a surprise round, or succeeds at a DC 15 Intimidate or Perform check. Its
      frightful presence has a range of 30 feet.
  - name: Fear Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures within a 60-foot radius that see or hear a nightmare
      creature must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for as long as they are
      within the aura. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature
      cannot be affected again by the same nightmare creature's fear aura for 24
      hours. This is a mind-affecting fear affect.
  - name: Night Terrors (Su)
    description: >-
      Once a nightmare owb enters a target's mind with its dream or nightmare
      spell-like ability, it can attempt to control the target's dream. If the
      target fails a Will saving throw, it remains asleep and trapped in the
      dream world with the nightmare creature. Thereafter, the nightmare
      creature controls all aspects of the dream. Each hour that passes, the
      target can attempt another saving throw to try to awaken (it automatically
      awakens after 8 hours or if the nightmare creature releases it). The
      target takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage each hour it is trapped in the
      dream; if it takes any Charisma damage, it is fatigued and unable to
      regain arcane spells for the next 24 hours. The target dies if this
      Charisma damage equals or exceeds its actual Charisma score.
DuringCombat: >-
  The owb uses its spell-like abilities to extinguish the PCs' light sources and
  attack from the cover of darkness.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 or fewer hit points, the owb retreats to heal its wounds
  before attacking again. If the PCs do not seem impeded by darkness, it instead
  fights to the death.
