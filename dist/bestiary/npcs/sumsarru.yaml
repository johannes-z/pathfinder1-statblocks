DuringCombat: >-
  Sumsarru opens combat by staying at range, using his bow against anyone he
  suspects can use positive energy or carries silver weapons. In melee, he
  abandons  one claw attack for an energy draining slam attack each round, and
  on the first hit with a claw or slam uses his poisoner's glove to inject a
  dose of polymorph plague into the victim as well. Unlike most vampires,
  Sumsarru doesn't have a dominating gaze ability-a curious side effect of his
  legacy, perhaps, but this lack of offense is bolstered by the fact that he
  isn't bothered by the scent of garlic or the sight of a mirror, nor is he
  inconvenienced by running water.
Morale: Sumsarru fights until destroyed.
