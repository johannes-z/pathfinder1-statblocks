Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Singe casts resist energy, specifying cold. If the PCs make any noise as they
  approach (such as removing the gemstones in area B1), then Singe also casts
  entropic shield on herself, and bull's strength on her two bodyguards. These
  spells are not included in the above statistics.
DuringCombat: >-
  Singe opens combat casting boiling blood on any obvious non-orc spell caster.
  Singe stays close to her bodyguards, positioning them between herself and the
  bulk of her enemies. She regularly casts fireball to catch as many foes as she
  can, capitalizing on her bodyguards' immunity to fire.
Morale: Singe fights until reduced below 10 hit points, at which time she surrenders.
Gear: jingasa of the fortunate soldierUE
OtherGear: breastplate, heavy steel shield, shortspear
