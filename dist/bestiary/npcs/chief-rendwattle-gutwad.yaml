DuringCombat: >-
  Chief Gutwad hangs back for the first few rounds of a fight, using his
  skyrockets and arrows to attack. He only has six normal arrows left, and even
  in his frantic state he won't use his precious animal bane arrows except
  against animal companions the PCs may have. Once out of arrows, he continues
  the fight with his spear. The chief drinks a potion of cure light wounds if
  he's reduced to fewer than 15 hit points.
Morale: >-
  Chief Gutwad hates humans only a little more than he hates those who associate
  with humans. He fights to the death as long as he's faced with human foes (or
  those he suspects of being human sympathizers).
