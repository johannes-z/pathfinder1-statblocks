SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Crimson Throne (Su)
    description: >-
      As long as she remains seated in the Crimson Throne, the false Ileosa
      gains a +10 deflection bonus to her AC and is immune to illusions and
      mind-affecting effects.
  - name: Redirection (Su)
    description: >-
      As long as this simulacrum lives, any divination spell that attempts to
      locate or otherwise target the real Queen Ileosa is instead redirected to
      target this simulacrum. The caster of the divination spell has a small
      chance to notice the redirection with a successful DC 40 Spellcraft check
      as the divination spell is cast, but even if the redirection is noted, it
      remains impossible to tell where the effect was redirected from. This
      effect also affects long-distance spells like demand, dream, nightmare,
      and sending, but not mental communication such as telepathy.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  The false Ileosa starts combat by using inspire courage on all her allies,
  then maintains that performance as she casts spells using Harmonic Spell,
  starting with displacement on the first round. In each subsequent round, she
  casts suggestion on one PC, suggesting he abandon his weapons and leave
  Korvosa. She relies on her guardians to prevent anyone from engaging her in
  melee, but if this tactic fails, she draws her dagger and fights back as best
  she can.
Morale: >-
  The false Ileosa fights until destroyed. Once reduced to 0 hit points, she
  suddenly becomes rigid and motionless. A moment later, her features run red as
  she melts swiftly into a pool of blood. A character who succeeds at a DC 27
  Spellcraft check recognizes she was some form of variant simulacrum, although
  further details are not available until the PCs can study the Everdawn Pool in
  the Sunken Queen.
Gear: >-
  +1 glamered chain shirt, +1 returning dagger, replica nonmagical Crown of
  Fangs worth 5,000 gp
