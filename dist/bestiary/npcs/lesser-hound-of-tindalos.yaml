SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Angled Entry (Su)
    description: >-
      Lesser hounds of Tindalos may use greater teleport (self only) once per
      round as a swift action and plane shift (self only) 3/day as a standard
      action (caster level 7th). This ability is otherwise identical to the
      angled entry ability of a regular hound of Tindalos.
  - name: Otherworldly Mind (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any non-outsider attempting to read the thoughts of a hound of Tindalos or
      communicate with it telepathically takes 5d4 points of nonlethal damage
      and must make a DC 16 Will save or become confused for 2d4 rounds. This is
      a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Ripping Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      5d4 slashing damage, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 16 negates. A creature that
      succeeds on its save is immune to that hound's gaze for 24 hours. This
      ability is otherwise identical to the ripping gaze ability of a regular
      hound of Tindalos.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The hound of Tindalos casts invisibility on itself then lurks in the temple,
  analyzing the PCs. If the akata or undead attack, the hound immediately joins
  the fight; otherwise, it waits for the PCs to study the temple and strikes
  when their guard is down.
DuringCombat: >-
  The hound of Tindalos attacks from invisibility, appearing only when it can
  subject the PCs to its ripping gaze. The hound makes use of its angled entry
  ability to leap around the room, attack from unexpected angles, and avoid
  retaliation.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 10 or fewer hit points, the hound of Tindalos casts plane shift
  to escape. It returns after a few rounds and remains invisible, stalking the
  PCs. If discovered, it flees again and does not come back until the PCs leave.
