SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Around Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A derghodaemon's multiple eyes grant it a +8 racial bonus on Perception
      checks. It cannot be flanked.
  - name: Feeblemind Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      By grinding and clicking its mandibles and chitinous plates together (a
      free action), a derghodaemon can affect all creatures within 30 feet as if
      by a feeblemind spell. Daemons are immune to this effect, but all other
      creatures must make a DC 20 Will save to resist the effects. A subject
      that succumbs to this effect remains affected by it as long as the
      derghodaemon continues to maintain the aura and the subject remains within
      30 feet of the derghodaemon. Once either condition ends, a victim of this
      effect can attempt a new DC 20 Will save once per hour to recover from the
      effect; otherwise, it can be cured by a heal, limited wish, miracle, or
      wish spell. A derghodaemon cannot use its spelllike abilities or its gnaw
      attack in any round in which it uses its feeblemind aura. This is a sonic
      mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Swarmwalking (Su)
    description: A derghodaemon is immune to damage or distraction effects caused by swarms
DuringCombat: >-
  The derghodaemon attempts to summon another of its kind on the first round of
  combat and then casts insect plague and creeping doom on the following rounds,
  supplementing its swarm creation each round with quickened summon swarm
  attacks. It changes to melee attacks if surrounded.
Morale: The derghodaemon fights to the death.
