SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Curse of Envy (Su)
    description: >-
      Ardathanatus suffers from the curse of the Shard of Envy. He becomes
      sickened whenever he's within 30 feet of a cleric or elf. Physical contact
      with another cleric or elf (including being the target of or while
      delivering touch spells) nauseates Ardathanatus unless he makes a
      successful DC 20 Fortitude save.
  - name: Mark of Yamasoth (Su)
    description: >-
      Ardathanatus has pledged his soul to Yamasoth by undergoing a foul ritual,
      at the climax of which he gouged out and ate his own left eye. As a
      result, he gains a +2 profane bonus to his Armor Class and an additional
      +4 hit points per Hit Die-but only as long as he remains of value to
      Yamasoth. In addition, he takes no penalties on Charisma checks made while
      interacting with conjured qlippoth.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ardathanatus casts lesser restoration every day to remove the effects of
  fatigue brought on by lack of sleep, then casts heroes' feast so that he and
  the creatures that aid him in his long-running ritual can be fed. He casts
  magic vestment on his armor and greater magic weapon on his halberd every day.
  Once he knows that the PCs are drawing near, he also casts air walk, freedom
  of movement, stoneskin, and spell resistance on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ardathanatus casts quickened shield of faith on the first round of combat
  (this bonus is already calculated into his AC above along with repulsion to
  prevent PCs from approaching him. He then remains at the northern end of the
  chamber and uses ranged magic such as blade barrier, flame strike, and
  blasphemy. He resorts to using his halberd in melee once foes come to him, or
  in the unusual event that he has used up his ranged attack options. Whenever
  he's reduced to fewer than 150 hit points, he uses a quickened cure spell on
  himself. He saves heal for when he's fallen below 50 hit points.
Morale: >-
  Ardathanatus fights to the death, as long as his faith in Yamasoth remains
  unshaken (but see his Side Quest). If faced with certain defeat, he casts
  earthquake in a last-ditch attempt to bring down the dungeon on both himself
  and his enemies.
Gear: >-
  +1 adamantine full plate, flaying halberd, belt of physical might +4 (Str,
  Con), cloak of resistance +2, doomsday key, headband of inspired wisdom +2,
  Shard of Envy, spell component pouch, unholy symbol of Yamasoth, diamond dust
  (for casting stoneskin, worth 750 gp)
