BeforeCombat: >-
  If her alarm snare trap in area A13 is triggered, Melira casts shield and uses
  her wand of cat's grace to prepare for combat; she then uses her wand of
  invisibility to hide and ambush intruders.
DuringCombat: >-
  Melira prefers ranged combat, using her Point-Blank Master feat to fire arrows
  even in melee combat. She targets humans and dwarves first to take advantage
  of her favored enemy bonuses, making use of Deadly Aim and Rapid Shot as long
  as her attacks are hitting. If encountered in areas A14 and A15, Melira first
  targets those enemies caught in her snare traps in the bilges.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 15 hit points or fewer, Melira activates her wand of
  invisibility, then uses Acrobatics and Stealth to reposition herself while
  invisible so she can drink her potion of cure serious wounds. Once healed, she
  casts ghost sound to make it seem as if she is running away. Whether or not
  opponents fall for the ruse, Melira once again tries to avenge her lover. If
  subsequently reduced to fewer than 8 hit points, Melira reluctantly
  surrenders, always keeping an eye open for an opportunity to escape.

  invisibility (6 charges), acid (2), tanglefoot bag
