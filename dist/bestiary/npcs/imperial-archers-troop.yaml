    description: >-
      An imperial archers troop is trained and optimized for ranged combat. As a
      standard action, the troop can fire a volley of arrows. This attack takes
      the form of up to four lines with a distance of up to 100 feet each. These
      lines can each start from any corner of any square in the troop's space,
      and the troop can accurately shoot over friendly creatures or large groups
      of individual creatures (though it cannot shoot over spaces smaller than a
      10-foot-by-10-foot square). Each creature in any of these lines that is
      not excluded in this way takes 4d8+3 points of piercing damage per line
      that hits it (Reflex DC 20 half). The save is Dexterity-based. The archers
      wield composite bows but are not accustomed to melee combat; this lowers
      the troop's AC by 2 and its troop melee damage by two die steps. These
      effects have already been calculated into the troop's stat block.
