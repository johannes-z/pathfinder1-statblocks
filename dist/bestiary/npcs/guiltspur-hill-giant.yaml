  The two giants on mastodons below immediately prepare to attack intruders,
  waiting for the giants stationed in the towers to pull open the gate&#8211;
  during this round, these two giants drink their potions of haste. On the
  second round, the mastodon-mounted giants charge out while the giants in the
  towers drop the ropes used to open the gates (causing the gates to swing back
  shut), then join the others in throwing boulders.
Morale: The giants fight to the death.
Gear: potions of cure serious wounds, potion of haste
