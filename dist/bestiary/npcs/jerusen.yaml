DuringCombat: >-
  Jerusen prefers to strike from hiding. A battle against the vampire should be
  a frustrating and harrowing experience, with the vampire making a sneak attack
  on a target (using vital strike with a slam attack) and then fleeing into the
  shadows to hide and await a chance to strike again. The vampire's speed and
  Spring Attack feat make this a particularly effective tactic.
Morale: >-
  If destroyed, Jerusen becomes gaseous and flees to his lair in area C5 to
  recover. If he suspects the PCs know where his lair is, or if he knows they've
  already ruined it, he instead seeks out another of his many hideaways in
  northern Westcrown's ruins-if he manages to escape the PCs and recover, he can
  become a recurring villain and return to track them through the Nessian
  Spiral-he has no further role to play in the Adventure Path, so you can use
  him as you see fit to continue to vex and haunt the PCs.
