BeforeCombat: >-
  Calipharo attempts to convert the PCs to his worship of Ahriman. After
  delivering his ultimatum, he plays his pipes of terror, waiting to activate
  their frightening ability if the PCs decline his offer.
DuringCombat: >-
  Calipharo begins by activating the pipes of terror to panic his foes,
  releasing the dorus from the jar immediately after, precluding their need to
  make a save. The salamander remains in the fire pit during the fight,
  attacking with reach with his tail. If he succeeds on a grapple with his tail,
  he attempts to drag the victim into the fire pit to stab with his spear or
  deal a flurry of blows.
Morale: Calipharo is a religious zealot and fights to the death.
