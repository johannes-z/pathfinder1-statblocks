    description: >-
      Whenever a sneak attack or critical hit is scored against Tar-Baphon's
      dragon, there is a 25% chance that the extra damage is negated and damage
      is rolled normally.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Tar-Baphon's dragon casts mage armor and shield on itself as soon as it
  detects intruders.
DuringCombat: >-
  The dragon opens combat with its breath weapon, trying to catch as many
  enemies in its effect as possible. It continues to use its breath weapon as
  often as it is able, but if the majority of its foes seem resistant to fire
  damage, it forgoes its breath weapon in favor of melee attacks. The dragon
  uses Awesome Blow to attempt to knock opponents off the bridge into the molten
  canal below.
Morale: Bound to the city by ancient magics, the dragon fights until destroyed.
