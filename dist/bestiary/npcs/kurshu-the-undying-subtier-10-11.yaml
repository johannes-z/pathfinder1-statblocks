SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Intelligence Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      The herald drains 1d4 points of Intelligence each time she hits with her
      slam attack. (The herald does not heal any damage when she uses her
      Intelligence drain.)
  - name: Weakness (Su)
    description: >-
      Kurshu is experiencing even worse symptoms from not feeding due to her
      proximity to Krune's rune foci, which draw power directly from outsiders.
      As a result, Kurshu is emaciated, has shed a number of scales, and has
      lost some of her magical talents. In addition to her penalties for having
      3 negative levels, her natural armor bonus is 2 lower than normal, and her
      spell resistance is 2 points lower. These penalties disappear 1 hour after
      Kurshu removes all of her negative levels from her divine separation
      ability.
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Kurshu believes that she is hidden when intruders arrive, she casts
  displacement in anticipation of trouble. She has already used 1 limited wish
  for the day, and the effects of her 3 negative levels from not feeding are
  already factored into her stats.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kurshu uses ranged spells to harm intruders, favoring any outsiders with her
  attacks. If an outsider dies, Kurshu eagerly feeds on its corpse to regain her
  lost strength. Otherwise she is flexible in her tactics and uses her mobility,
  spells, and abilities to best effect.
Morale: Kurshu begrudgingly fights to the death.
