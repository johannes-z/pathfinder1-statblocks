SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Elite Troop (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a highly trained and well-equipped Molthuni unit, an imperial infantry
      troop gains an additional +4 natural armor bonus to its AC, increases the
      damage dice of its troop melee attack by one step, and gains 2 additional
      hit points per Hit Die. These effects are included in the troop's stat
      block.
  - name: Protect Ally (Ex)
    description: >-
      An imperial infantry troop provides soft cover to any creature it
      recognizes as an ally who shares its space. Such protected allies treat
      squares occupied by the troop as difficult terrain and must succeed at a
      concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level) to cast spells while so
      protected, but they do not take troop damage from being within the troop's
      space.
  - name: United Spirit (Ex)
    description: >-
      An imperial infantry troop is united by its dedication to its nation. When
      the troop takes damage that would reduce it to 0 or fewer hit points, it
      can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + the troop's number of negative
      hit points). On a success, the troop is instead reduced to 1 hp. The troop
      can benefit from this effect once every 24 hours.
