BeforeCombat: >-
  Mokmurian casts mage armor and greater magic weapon on his club every morning
  after he prepares his spells. Once he learns that the PCs are coming (likely
  via the headless ogre's head), he casts resist energy (to resist a type of
  energy he knows the PCs favor, or otherwise fire), see invisibility, and
  stoneskin. If he suspects the PCs are very close, he casts fly and uses his
  wand of bear's endurance. All of these effects are incorporated into his stats
  above. He then casts fog cloud near the entrance to the room and waits to
  ambush the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  Mokmurian's first action when the PCs enter his room is to cast solid fog,
  catching as many of them as possible in the spell's area of effect. He uses
  his fog-cutting lenses so he can target the PCs with ease with his ranged
  attack spells. As soon as someone emerges from the fog, he casts cloudkill on
  that area, followed by stinking cloud. If a PC gets too close to him, he uses
  telekinesis to hurl her across the room and hopefully back into one of the fog
  spell effects. His goal is to maintain range superiority on his enemies, but
  if melee seems inevitable, he casts mass reduce person first to shrink down
  foes, coupling that with his quickened shield spell. Then, on the first round
  of actual melee, he casts enlarge person on himself and begins making melee
  attacks. If any hounds of Tindalos survive, he calls on them to aid him in
  battle as well.
Morale: >-
  Mokmurian fights until reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, at which point he
  uses dimension doors to retreat to area B13, hoping to get healing from his
  lamia minions. If they're dead, he flees up to the surface and gathers a group
  of a dozen stone giants and any of the named giants who still live to mount an
  attack on the library to finish off the PCs. If the PCs have secured an
  alliance with Conna and she still lives, she's among the giants whom Mokmurian
  recruits&#8211;when and if this patrol encounters the PCs, Conna switches
  sides to aid them, a move that throws the other stone giants into chaos. The
  next round, half of those giants defect as well, renouncing Mokmurian as an
  unworthy runt and joining Conna and the PCs against him. In this event,
  Mokmurian fights again until reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, then tries
  to use his scroll of limited wish to teleport to Xin-Shalast. Yet
  unfortunately for him, Karzoug, who has been watching his actions through the
  link their souls have shared ever since Mokmurian's trip to the City of Greed,
  has other plans for him (see Development, below).
Gear: scroll of limited wish, wand of bear's endurance (13 charges)

  collection also contains most of the spells in the Core Rulebook, up through
  and including 6th-level spells. Feel free to introduce new spells from other
  sources via these books&#8211;if you do, you should also consider swapping
  some of these spells in for those he normally prepares.
