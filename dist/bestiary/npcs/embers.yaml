  Embers prefers to attack Small foes rather than Medium ones. He uses Power
  Attack on all attacks, gaining a +6 bonus on damage rolls while taking a
  &#8211;3 penalty on attack rolls. The bear knows better than to attack Large
  humanoids, and only attacks them in self defense.
Morale: Embers fights to the death.
