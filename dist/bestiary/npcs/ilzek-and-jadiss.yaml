DuringCombat: >-
  The ghouls use their scrolls of summon monster V to each summon a babau and
  then cast protection from law in the first 2 rounds of combat while they let
  the other ghouls engage the PCs in melee. They then cast spiritual weapon,
  following that up with channeled negative energy before casting divine favor
  and stepping in to melee. The ghouls keep a few cure spells prepared to cast
  on Nulkineth, should he require their aid.
Morale: >-
  The ghouls retreat to Nulkineth's side to protect him if reduced to fewer than
  15 hit points.
