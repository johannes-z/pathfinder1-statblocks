SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Spritely (Ex)
    description: >-
      Creepers are smaller and faster than the average morlock, but also weaker.
      Their size category is Small and they gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity, but
      they also take a -2 penalty to Strength. These modifications do not affect
      a creeper's challenge rating.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Prior to combat, the creeper coats two blowgun darts with bloodbrain venom and
  finds a hiding place in the nooks of the cavern wall.
DuringCombat: >-
  The creeper fights from afar with its blowgun whenever possible. It clings to
  walls and makes repeated shots at enemies using its sneak attack ability and
  poisoned darts. It prefers to snipe enemies (taking the -20 penalty on Stealth
  checks) rather than reveal itself immediately.
Morale: >-
  The creeper is cowardly for a morlock, and if reduced below 10 hit points, it
  flees to reinforce other defenders.
Gear: bloodbrain venom (4 doses; see page 16)
OtherGear: padded armor, mwk blowgun, mwk short sword, amulet of natural armor +2
