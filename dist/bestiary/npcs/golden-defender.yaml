SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Conductivity (Ex)
    description: >-
      A magical attack that deals electricity damage speeds up the golden
      defender as the haste spell for 1d4 rounds. The golden defender gets no
      saving throw against electricity effects.
  - name: Heat Shimmer (Ex)
    description: >-
      The intense heat radiating from the golden defender's body creates a
      wavering shimmer in the air that makes the construct difficult to see
      clearly. This gives the golden defender concealment (20% miss chance).
  - name: Molten Core (Ex)
    description: >-
      The golden defender's body generates intense heat, dealing an additional
      1d6 points of fire damage whenever it hits with a melee attack, as well as
      1d6 points of fire damage each round to any creature in a grapple with the
      construct. Creatures attacking the golden defender with unarmed strikes or
      natural weapons are also subject to this damage. Additionally, when
      reduced to 0 hit points, the golden defender superheats and instantly
      melts into a pile of molten gold. All creatures within a 10-foot-radius
      spread take 6d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 14 half). The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
