DuringCombat: >-
  Bog Mother casts entangle, hoping to snare as many of the PCs as she can,
  though she leaves a path in front of her log free so Snap Jaw can attack
  unimpeded. On the second round of combat, Bog Mother casts shillelagh and
  enters melee combat. If she has taken no damage herself but Snap Jaw is
  defeated, she spontaneously casts summon nature's ally I to summon a poison
  frog; otherwise, she heals herself as necessary.
Morale: Bog Mother fights to the death, believing the PCs want to harm her "children."
