BeforeCombat: Munasukaru casts bull's strength and fly before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Munasukaru flies into combat, firing screaming bolts from her repeating
  crossbow at approaching foes. Once in melee combat, Munasukaru wields her
  stolen naginata with precision, even though using it gives her a negative
  level. A mighty combatant, Munasukaru believes herself to be the progeny of
  the gods, and she attempts to intimidate opponents by describing to them
  exactly what tortures she plans to subject them to once she defeats them.
Morale: >-
  The least and last of the Five Storms, Munasukaru considers it her sacred duty
  to guard the kimon and remain in the House of Withered Blossoms so that the
  kami outside cannot abandon their watch. If reduced to fewer than 50 hit
  points, she retreats temporarily to activate her armor's healing ability or
  drink one of the potions of cure serious wounds in area E7 before returning to
  the fray. Munasukaru does not surrender.
Gear: screaming bolts (10)
