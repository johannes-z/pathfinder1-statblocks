  If the captives are in the gallows, Hagla first kicks out the bench from
  underneath them. He then moves to block PCs from rescuing them using his Stand
  Still feat. If the PCs catch Hagla unaware, he stands his ground unless the
  PCs all attack from a distance. If reduced to half his hit points, he
  threatens to coup de grace Greudemoffit or Ramenophesa, following through 1
  round later.
Morale: >-
