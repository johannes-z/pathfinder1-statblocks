BeforeCombat: Erigantus casts false life and mage armor.
DuringCombat: >-
  Erigantus begins combat by casting invisibility, followed by shield and mirror
  image. He's careful to cast first, then move, using Stealth to prevent foes
  from easily targeting his location. Once his defensive spells are in effect,
  he begins casting his most powerful spells on choice targets-finger of death
  on a healer, grasping hand against an arcane spellcaster or rogue- followed by
  his area spells on those who remain.
Morale: Erigantus fights to the death.
