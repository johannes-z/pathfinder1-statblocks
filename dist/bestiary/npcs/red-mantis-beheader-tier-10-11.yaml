SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Prayer Attack (Su)
    description: >-
      To initiate a prayer attack, a Red Mantis assassin holds her sawtooth
      sabre (or sabres) out, point down, and weaves the blade in the air. She
      must be within 30 feet of and visible to her victim. Beginning a prayer
      attack is a standard action, and causes her victim to be fascinated by her
      unless he makes a Will save. She can maintain this effect by
      concentrating. The victim may attempt a new save to escape the fascination
      each time a threat (other than the fascinating assassin) appears. At any
      point after 3 rounds, she may make a coup de grace attack against the
      target, provided the target is still fascinated. Activating or
      concentrating on maintaining a prayer attack does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity.
  - name: Red Shroud (Su)
    description: >-
      A Red Mantis assassin can create a veil of red mist as a move-equivalent
      action. The red shroud persists for 1 round per class level. It grants a
      +1 dodge bonus to AC and fast healing equal to the assassin's Constitution
      bonus. This mist cannot be dissipated by wind. If she is slain while this
      ability is active, she can choose whether to remain corporeal or to
      disintegrate into a cloud of red mist that leaves behind only her gear in
      order to deprive her enemies of access to her remains.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If they detect the PCs' approach, the assassins drink their potions of bull's
  strength and heroism (the effects of which are not included in the stat block)
  before they ambush the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  The assassins team up with their enforcer minions in groups of three to attack
  single targets in order to gain the benefits of the Gang Up feat. On their
  first successful hit, they use their positioning attack rogue talent to
  maneuver into an optimal flanking position without provoking attacks of
  opportunity.
Morale: >-
  If their obedient enforcer minions are incapacitated and the beheaders are
  reduced below 15 hit points, they cast feather fall (negating the damage of
  the fall) and leap through the water curtain, trusting their foes will not
  follow.
Gear: ', assisting glove*, potion of bull strength, potion of heroism'
OtherGear: >-
  mithral shirt, masterwork daggers (2), masterwork sawtooth sabres** (2), cloak
  of resistance +1, Red Mantis outfit with a nonmagical Red Mantis mask
