SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath of Unlife (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, the Lord Navarre can exhale a blast of negative
      energy in a 10 ft. cone. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 27
      Reflex save or take 2d4 points of Strength damage. A creature reduced to 0
      Strength dies. The save DC is Constitutionbased.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoid slain by a Lord Navarre's breath of unlife becomes a shadow
      demon in 2d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of Lord Navarre and
      remain enslaved until his death. They do not possess any of the abilities
      they had in life.
  - name: Dark Blessing (Su)
    description: >-
      The blessing bestowed by Orcus on Navarre allows him to wear any type of
      armor with the normal associated movement and AC modifier penalties.
  - name: Lay on Hands (Su)
    description: >-
      Navarre may use his touch of corruption ability to heal damage to himself
      as if he were a paladin equal to level in antipaladin.
  - name: Spell Turning (Su)
    description: >-
      Spells not resisted by Navarre have a 55% chance of being reflected back
      at the caster. Unlike a ring of spell turning, the entire spell is
      reflected back at the caster.
Gear: >-
  +3 full plate, +2 vorpal greatsword (poisoned), greater ring of elemental
  resistance (fire, included above), unholy symbol, spell component pouch
