BeforeCombat: >-
  Kazakador casts greater magic weapon on his dwarven waraxe every day. Before
  combat, he casts freedom of movement and shield of faith on himself. Every
  morning, Knight Commander Graxus Phand casts status on Kazakador.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kazakador typically uses his judgment class ability to gain judgments of
  sacred healing and sacred protection-his statistics reflect these bonuses. For
  the first few rounds of combat, he remains at range and casts spells, starting
  with a greater command to "drop" and following that with searing light or
  spiritual weapon. He prefers to bolster himself with both divine power and
  righteous might before entering melee if possible; if forewarned about the
  prospect of a fight (such as by hearing combat in area A22), he instead casts
  these two spells and abandons other spells in combat, immediately moving to
  attack in melee. Note that as soon as Kazakador takes damage or suffers an
  ailment, the status effect alerts Knight Commander Graxus Phand, who drops
  everything to come to area A23 to provide aid (assume that Graxus can arrive
  in this room 4 minutes after the first alert during the day or in 1 minute
  during the evening-this includes the time he takes to cast short-duration
  defensive spells such as bull's strength).
Morale: Kazakador fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  +2 breastplate, +2 heavy steel shield, +1 dwarven waraxe, amulet of natural
  armor +1, belt of giant strength +4, cloak of resistance +2, skeleton key for
  most doors in Citadel Dinyar, keys to the guardroom and stockades (areas
  A6-A8), 150 gp
