DuringCombat: >-
  Lullaby starts combat with a bardic performance to inspire courage in herself
  and her allies, then hangs back to support them with spells, starting with
  daze monster. If possible, she saves sleep for occasions where the PCs are in
  a group. If engaged in combat, she does her best to flank with allies, but she
  prefers to stay at range and rely on her magic. If she and the Roadkeepers
  defeat the PCs, they rob them of all their coins and jewelry but leave them
  alive; in this case, Hallen crosses back over the river to help them get back
  on their feet.
Morale: >-
  If the PCs defeat her Roadkeepers or reduce Lullaby to less than 20 hit
  points, she realizes she's in over her head. She cries out, "Oh! Sorry...
  here, have my magic coin and leave me alone!" as she tosses the copper piece
  she was  flipping to the ground. The coin is not magic-she's just trying to
  buy a few more precious seconds' head start as she runs away. She casts
  invisibility on herself as she flees if she can.
Gear: >-
  +1 leather armor, daggers (4), rapier, lucky blue hat (buffering capUE), belt
  pouch, pearls (5, worth 50 gp each), 32 gp, 1 cp
