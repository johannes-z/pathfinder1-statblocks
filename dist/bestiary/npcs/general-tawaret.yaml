  Tawaret keeps her chariot of the conqueror in constant motion, firing arrows
  from the chariot as it careens through the air from one end of the chamber to
  the other. She switches targets frequently, and varies which magic arrows she
  uses to keep her enemies guessing. She makes frequent use of Manyshot and
  Rapid Shot to pepper foes with as many arrows as possible. She saves her
  javelins of lightning until she runs out of arrows, then resorts to using her
  greatsword with Ride-By Attacks.
