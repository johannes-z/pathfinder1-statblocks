BeforeCombat: Whiskifiss casts longstrider before entering combat if he can.
DuringCombat: >-
  If the PCs rescue him but wish to keep fighting the Smilers, Whiskifiss cowers
  near the back of the party or hides during combat until he is healed up and
  given a few weapons. Once he's armed, armored, and healed, the ratfolk's
  natural bravery returns. Whiskifiss prefers to attack constructs if given the
  option, but otherwise favors ranged combat in battle.
Morale: >-
  Whiskifiss fights to the death to protect allies or his pet rust monster (see
  area J), but he otherwise flees combat if reduced to fewer than 10 hit points.
Gear: studded leather, +1 light crossbow with 10 bolts, short sword
