SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bewitching Brume (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature within 10 feet of a hungry fog or currently being affected by
      its enveloping mists must succeed on a DC 10 Will save at the start of
      that creature's turn or become shaken for 1 round at the half-glimpsed
      shapes of phantoms floating within the fog. This is a mind-affecting fear
      effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Enveloping Mists (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hungry fog can engulf foes who fail a Reflex save, as per the engulf
      universal monster rule. A creature engulfed by a hungry fog does not gain
      the pinned condition and may move normally-such a creature is not in
      danger of suffocating, but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, it is
      staggered in addition to the damage the attack causes. The save DC to
      avoid the enveloping mists is Constitution-based.
  - name: Gaseous (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hungry fog has a body composed of eerie mist. It can pass through small
      holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, but cannot enter water or
      other liquid. It has no Strength score, and cannot manipulate objects as a
      result.
  - name: Vulnerable to Wind (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hungry fog is treated as a Tiny creature for the purposes of determining
      the effects high wind has upon it.
DuringCombat: >-
  The fog floats over and engulfs the PCs. If damaged for more than half its hit
  points, it flies upwards and attacks using its reach.
Morale: Starving and mindless, the hungry fog fights until killed.
