  One abrikandilu noisily begins breaking apart the control panels as the other
  one inspects its surroundings.
DuringCombat: >-
  The abrikandilu berserker on the platform takes cover behind the control panel
  and continues to damage it, redirecting its attacks to nearby enemies. The
  other abrikandilu defends the stairs, throwing hunks of rubble and metal at
  distant foes. The demons delight in breaking weapons, armor, wands, and
  potions as well as using the knockback rage ability to push enemies off the
  stairs and platform.
Morale: >-
  After decades of stasis, the demons are itching for a chance to destroy
  something. They fight to the death.
