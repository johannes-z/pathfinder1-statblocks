BeforeCombat: >-
  Before he engages in combat, Tef-Naju casts stoneskin, bear's endurance, and
  shield on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tef-Naju prefers to fight in melee combat, combining his skill at arms with
  casting melee-based spells in battle, yet he prefers to avoid putting himself
  in situations where he's outnumbered or surrounded. Tef-Naju generally spends
  the first few rounds of combat establishing control of the battlefield,
  starting by casting invisibility on himself and then remaining mobile while
  using spells like mass reduce person, telekinesis, transmute rock to mud, or
  wall of stone, to disarm foes at range. If Tef-Naju finds himself surrounded,
  he uses detonate to deal electricity damage, since he's immune to this effect.
  Once in melee, Tef-Naju casts mirror image, followed the next round by haste.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, Tef-Naju flees combat (preferably by
  simply stone gliding into the ground), whereupon he flees to his bastion (area
  J) to recover from the battle as swiftly as possible (likely with the aid of
  healing magic cast by his lover, Aiveria), hoping to return to the scene of
  the attack to continue the fight if intruders still threaten the Slave
  Trenches.

  stone to flesh (2), wand of lightning bolt (CL 10th, 14 charges), holy water
