BeforeCombat: >-
  Zarskia drinks an extract of false life every day and consumes her mutagen and
  extracts of barkskin and stoneskin as soon as she becomes aware of visitors or
  trouble at the apothecary. If she knows intruders are close, she drinks
  extracts of fly, protection from energy (fire), expeditious retreat, and
  bear's endurance before a confrontation (not included in her stats).
DuringCombat: >-
  Zarskia drinks an extract of greater invisibility, followed by extracts of
  bomber's eye and haste at the beginning of combat. She throws force bombs
  against fire-resistant foes or to knock swift enemies prone. If cornered or if
  she runs out of bombs, Zarskia drinks her extract of displacement and poisons
  her swords using her swift poisoning ability.
Morale: >-

  Shackles, so unless it's possible to successfully flee, she fights to the last
  breath.
