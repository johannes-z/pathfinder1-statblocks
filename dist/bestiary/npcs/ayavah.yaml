BeforeCombat: >-
  In this new hostile land, Ayavah casts mage armor on herself each morning, as
  well as nondetection&#8211; while not evil, she believes her demonic heritage
  and heretical faith shine like beacons to paladins. If obvious danger looms,
  she also casts shield from her wand.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ayavah prefers to hide and support others in a fight, casting vanish and then
  enhancing others with her touch of destiny and blur. If forced to defend
  herself, she casts blur, touch of idiocy, and magic missile until she gets an
  opportunity to retreat with gaseous form.
Morale: >-
  Ayavah hates a fair fight, and flees if reduced to fewer than half her hit
  points, but she remembers humiliations, holds long grudges, and plots to
  sabotage  her foes' livelihoods down the road. She won't abandon friends in
  combat&#8211;true friends are rare for her&#8211;but she happily lets them
  stand between her and any danger.
