DuringCombat: >-
  Sajan uses his fast movement and Acrobatics to get into a strategic location
  in combat, and uses a combination of Combat Reflexes and flurry of blows to
  deal as much damage as possible to his targets. He employs combat maneuvers
  when doing so is strategically advantageous&#8211; grappling spellcasters and
  tripping foes with his temple sword when his allies flank them. Against a
  particularly powerful single enemy, he utilizes Stunning Fist to take the
  combatant out of commission. When overmatched, he's quick to withdraw and use
  his +1 shuriken to harass a foe at range or from more defensible ground, or by
  using his speed to keep just out of reach.
