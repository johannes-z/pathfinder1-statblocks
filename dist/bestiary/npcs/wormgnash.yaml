SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Abandon Flesh (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, Wormgnash can abandon an inhabited body, crawling
      hideously out of his host and leaving behind an empty sack of skin and
      bits of gristle. In so doing, he absorbs much of the body's flesh to heal
      himself, regaining 2d6+3 hit points. Wormgnash cannot later reclaim this
      body with his inhabit body ability.
  - name: Flesh Armor (Su)
    description: >-
      When Wormgnash wears a humanoid body (see Inhabit Body below), he treats
      the dead flesh and muscle as armor and gains a +3 armor bonus to his AC.
      This bonus is already included in Wormgnash's statistics above; when not
      inhabiting a corpse, his statistics are AC 12, touch 9, flat-footed 12 (-1
      Dex, +3 natural).
  - name: Inhabit Body (Su)
    description: >-
      Wormgnash can crawl into the body of any dead Medium humanoid, consuming
      and replacing the bulk of the humanoid's skeleton and internal organs as
      he does so. This process takes 1d4 rounds to complete, during which
      Wormgnash is considered flat-footed. Once the process is complete,
      Wormgnash appears for all practical purposes to be a living but bloated
      version of the previous humanoid. He gains a +8 racial bonus on Disguise
      checks to appear as a normal humanoid while wearing a dead body in this
      manner, but does not gain any of the abilities the dead creature had in
      life, including natural attacks, unusual movement types, or bonuses to
      natural armor. He loses his own burrow speed while inhabiting a body, but
      gains the ability to wield weapons or wear armor shaped for humanoids
      (although note that the armor bonus granted by wearing armor does not
      stack with the bonus granted by the vermlek's flesh armor ability).
  - name: Negative Energy Affinity (Ex)
    description: >-
      Wormgnash is healed by negative energy and harmed by positive energy,
      exactly as if he were an undead creature.
  - name: Summon Slimy Dretch (Sp)
    description: >-
      The dretches (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 60) that Wormgnash summons are
      covered in demon's bile, and their abilities are also altered. Instead of
      their usual spell-like abilities, these dretches can cast grease twice per
      day as a spell-like ability.
