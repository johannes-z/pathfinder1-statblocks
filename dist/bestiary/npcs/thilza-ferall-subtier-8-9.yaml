SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mark I Dermal Plating (Ex)
    description: >-
      Thilza has a cybernetic implant in her skin, which grants her a +1
      enhancement bonus to natural armor. This is a non-magical effect that
      cannot be dispelled, though anything that prevents technology from working
      negates this cybertech's bonus as well. For more information on cybertech
      and dermal plating, see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: rakshasaUM

  Prior to combat, Thilza casts mage armor and shield upon herself, drinks her
  potion of shield of faith, and ensures her hide aura ability is active. These

DuringCombat: >-
  Thilza attempts to disable any opposition using spells such as slow and black
  tentacles, and resorts to using baleful polymorph against particularly

  is complete and expects the same of all under her command.
