SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Evil Eye (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, the Kallas Devil can cast its dire gaze upon any
      single creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 20 Will
      save or be staggered as a strange nebulous distress and a gnawing sense of
      impending doom plague the victim. If the Kallas Devil uses its evil eye on
      someone already afflicted by this curse, the victim must succeed at a DC
      20 Fortitude save or be overwhelmed with fright and collapse into a
      comatose state for 3 days. Each day that passes, the comatose victim must
      succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or perish. The evil eye is a
      mind-affecting fear effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based. Evil Eye
      Curse: Gaze-failed save; save Will DC 20; frequency 1/day; effect
      staggered (or fall comatose if already under the effects of the evil eye).
