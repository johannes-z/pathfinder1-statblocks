DuringCombat: >-
  Numarak wades into battle with his pick,  using Power Attack and his Impaling
  Critical feat. He targets obvious spellcasters to take advantage of his
  Disruptive and Spellbreaker feats. In the heat of battle, the orc general
  incites his band with shouted curses. Numarak is a focused and disciplined
  fighter, but can be maddened by the cowardice of his servants, and he might
  temporarily turn away from a powerful foe in order to cut down a fleeing orc
  with one of his throwing axes.
Morale: >-
  If the orc ambassadors have been slain and Numarak has been reduced to fewer
  than 45 hit points, the general tries to negotiate a truce as outlined above.
  If talks have already proved fruitless, however, he fights to the death.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds
