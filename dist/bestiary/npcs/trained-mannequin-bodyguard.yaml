SpecialAbilities:
  - name: False Flesh (Ex)
    description: >-
      The synthetic flesh and hair of a mannequin robot give it a +8 bonus on
      Disguise checks to appear human (but not to impersonate a specific human).
      Closely inspecting a mannequin or touching its cold, synthetic skin
      automatically reveals its non-human nature.
  - name: Robot Subtype (Ex)
    description: >-
      "Robot" is a special subtype applied to a construct without changing its
      CR. All robots are vulnerable to critical hits (see below), vulnerable to
      electricity, and are intelligent. A creature can identify a robot by using
      Knowledge (arcana or engineering), but only if he also has the
      Technologist feat (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide 7);
      otherwise the creature is limited to identifying the robot as an
      unfamiliar construct (DC 10 reveals the type and basic construct traits).
  - name: Vulnerable to Critical Hits (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a robot takes extra damage from a critical hit, it must succeed
      at a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being stunned for 1 round. If its
      saving throw is successful, it is staggered for 1 round. The robot remains
      immune to other sources of the stunned condition.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The mannequin remains quiet while Na'alu speaks, though it sometimes sways
  slightly or makes other small movements to feign life.
DuringCombat: >-
  The mannequin tries to pin down any foes trying to cross the bridge and attack
  Na'alu.
Morale: The mannequin fights until destroyed.
