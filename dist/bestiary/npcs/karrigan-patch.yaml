DuringCombat: >-
  Karrigan studies the most formidable-looking PC and tries to assassinate that
  character after a round of study. If that fails, she simply focuses the full
  might of her blades on that PC. If not fighting alone, she always moves to
  flank with her allies.
Morale: >-
  Karrigan is stubborn, but she doesn't want to die. She attempts to surrender
  if reduced to 20 or fewer hit points and orders any other wereboars in the
  vicinity to do the same. She promises to leave the temple complex if the PCs
  spare her life, taking any surviving members of her family with her. While
  she'd rather keep her treasure if possible, she values her life more, and if
  giving her loot up to the PCs helps ensure her survival, she'll do so.
