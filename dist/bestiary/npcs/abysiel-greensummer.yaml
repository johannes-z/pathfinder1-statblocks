SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Site Bound (Su)
    description: >-
      Abysiel is bound in place by sturdy chains and ancient magic. His speed is
      0 ft. and he is incapable of any movement. He is immune to all combat
      maneuvers or any other ability or spell that could move him or knock him
      prone. Abysiel is always considered flat-footed, even when aware of
      attacks. The process that bound him to the Tangle also granted Abysiel a
      +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution and infused him with the light
      fortification armor quality.
  - name: Site Bound Defenses (Su)
    description: >-
      Abysiel is protected by the device in which he is held captive. Because of
      its moving parts and magical energies, it grants him a +2 deflection bonus
      and a +4 shield bonus to his AC. The shield bonus functions like the
      shield spell and thus makes him immune to magic missile.
  - name: Site Mastery (Su)
    description: >-
      By mingling his essence with his grand device, Abysiel can reflexively
      control its components. As a move action, he may move any one of the
      following components and gain the listed benefits: Chains: Abysiel
      animates the workshop's many chains to grapple a single target, as if
      using the animate rope spell, with the exception that the chains can reach
      any opponent within the workshop. Paneling: By shifting the outer paneling
      of his grand device, Abysiel grants himself total cover from one-quarter
      of the chamber below. This cover remains in place until changed again.
      This cover does not apply to opponents on the catwalks. Pendulums: Abysiel
      causes one of the device's massivependulums to swing at a target that
      inflicts 1d8 bludgeoning damage with a +3 melee touch attack. Abysiel can
      target anyone in the room with this ability, even those on the catwalk.
Gender: Male
Bloodline: aberrant
DuringCombat: >-
  Abysiel is madness incarnate and is far beyond reason&#8211;he attacks the
  moment he sees the PCs. Abysiel begins combat by casting hypnotism on heavily
  armored PCs, ordering them to cast aside their weapons. He uses site mastery
  to attack any obvious casters, and casts obscuring mist to gain cover if
  anyone engages him in melee. He then rains down acidic rays or magic missiles.
Morale: Abysiel is beyond reason and rational thought. He fights to the death.
