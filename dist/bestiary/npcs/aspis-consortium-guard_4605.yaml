BeforeCombat: Consortium guards begin combat with their crossbows drawn.
DuringCombat: >-
  The guards fight practically, taking cover behind nearby crates, firing at the
  PCs with their crossbows, and focusing on the biggest, toughest opponents
  first. They switch to scimitars immediately if any PCs close to melee.
Morale: Guards flee or surrender when reduced below 3 hit points.
Gear: studded leather, light crossbow with 10 bolts, sap, scimitar
