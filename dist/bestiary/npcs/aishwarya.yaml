SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury or spit&#8211;contact; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for
      6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. Spells
      Aishwarya casts spells as an 8th-level sorcerer, and can cast spells from
      the cleric list as well as those normally available to a sorcerer. Cleric
      spells are considered arcane spells for a guardian naga.
  - name: Spit (Ex)
    description: >-
      A guardian naga can spit its venom up to 30 feet as a standard action.
      This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Opponents hit by
      this attack must make successful saves (see above) to avoid the effects.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  A shrewd creature, Aishwarya casts mage armor and expeditious retreat on
  herself on her way down to the main square. As the PCs can theoretically fight
  her outside of the final combat, these spells are not already incorporated
  into her stat block.
DuringCombat: >-
  The naga casts greater invisibility on herself in the first round of combat,
  following up with lightning bolt and scorching ray in the subsequent rounds.
  Selfish and focused on defeating her enemies to gain power, Aishwarya does not
  heal her allies.
Morale: >-
  Aishwarya doesn't let herself be defeated if at all possible. She flees if
  reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, or if she uses up all of her 3rd-level
  spells, hoping to rebuild her gang and strike out at Dhanishta in the coming
  days or weeks.
