SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Paranoid (Ex)
    description: >-
      Teka suffers from paranoia as a result of the vault's midnight spores.
      Teka takes a -4 penalty on Will saves and Charisma-based skill checks,
      cannot receive benefit from or attempt the Aid Another action, and cannot
      willingly accept aid (including healing) from another creature unless he
      makes a DC 22 Will save.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: Teka casts magic stone and shield of faith before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Teka casts spells and makes ranged attacks while his boggards engage foes in
  melee. He casts silence on any obvious spellcasters. He channels negative
  energy (using Selective Channeling on the boggards) and activates his aura of
  madness if enemies break through the boggards' line. If pressed into melee
  combat himself, Teka casts righteous might.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 25 hit points, or if all of the boggards are killed,
  Teka flees to area H8 to join the Kaava Bush-Devil.
Gear: scroll of cure serious wounds, scroll of flame strike
OtherGear: >-

  (worth 30 gp), spell component pouch, bone holy symbol of Lamashtu
