DuringCombat: >-
  The archers make full attacks with their bows whenever possible, using arrows
  poisoned with shadow essence on their first two attacks. The archers avoid
  melee; they withdraw when necessary and continue shooting on later rounds. If
  forced into melee, the archers attempt to flank their foes.
Morale: >-
  When reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, a wyrwood archer flees. When only two
  archers remain, they call off their attack, ask for peace, and attempt to
  parley with the PCs, grudgingly allowing them to talk to the leader of the
  village.
