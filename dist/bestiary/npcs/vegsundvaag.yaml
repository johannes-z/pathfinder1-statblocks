  Vegsundvaag prefers to cover her approach with multiple fog clouds, or to
  burrow close to her prey before bursting out of the ice. She avoids directly
  engaging groups that might surround her, but targets them with her breath
  weapon, and makes Flyby Attacks at isolated foes. Vegsundvaag typically
  reserves full attacks for enemies challenging her in the air, but foes who
  separate themselves from their allies also invite her to swoop close to bite
  with her great reach, then drop to the ground for a full attack on the
  following round.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, Vegsundvaag attempts to flee, using
  fog cloud to cover her escape via flight or burrowing into the ice, but she
  may return later to wreak vengeance on her attackers.
