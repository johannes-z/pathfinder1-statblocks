BeforeCombat: >-
  Before combat, Ghartone drinks an extract of shield and casts mage armor on
  himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ghartone casts mirror image on the first round of combat, then uses his
  grenade launcher to fire grenades into the midst of his foes. Once his minions
  engage the PCs, Ghartone switches to his alchemical bombs so he can exclude
  allies from the blast. He's fond of using pyrotechnics on those who catch fire
  from one of his explosive bombs.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 35 or fewer hit points, Ghartone attempts to flee to Ozmyn
  Zaidow's side&#8211;confronted with him, he fights to the death. If he's
  prevented from fleeing, Ghartone surrenders, but takes every chance he can to
  escape.   He remains close-mouthed about the Technic League during
  interrogations&#8211;at your discretion, Ozmyn Zaidow could trigger his
  cranial bomb in the middle of an interrogation!
