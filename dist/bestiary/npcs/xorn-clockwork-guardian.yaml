SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Integrated Hammers (Ex)
    description: >-
      A xorn clockwork guardian's integrated hammers are primary natural attacks
      that deal bludgeoning damage and can't be disarmed.
  - name: Spring Jump (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a move action, a xorn clockwork guardian can jump up to 30 feet into
      the air. The guardian can convert up to 20 feet of the height into
      horizontal movement in 5-foot increments. A xorn clockwork guardian takes
      damage from falls as if they were 30 feet shorter than they actually are,
      preventing it from taking damage until it falls 40 or more feet.
DuringCombat: >-
  The xorn clockwork guardians choose targets randomly, preferring to target
  creatures that aren't fighting another guardian.
Morale: The xorn clockwork guardians fight until they are destroyed.
