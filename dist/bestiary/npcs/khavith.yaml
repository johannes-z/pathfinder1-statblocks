ProhibitedSchools: Divination, Illusion
BeforeCombat: >-
  Khavith casts false life and mage armor every day. If she has the opportunity,
  she also casts blur, mirror image, resist energy (fire), shield, and stoneskin
  before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Khavith tries to control the battlefield as soon as possible, casting mass
  hold person, slow, and black tentacles. She casts unwilling ally as soon as
  possible on a strong warrior type, and uses spells like forcecage or hungry
  pit to entrap dangerous opponents.
Morale: >-
  Khavith's research is much more important to her than Vyr-Azul's plans. If
  wounded enough to trigger her contingency spell, she likely teleports to
  safety into the Sanctum of Ydersius (after stopping to retrieve her spellbook
  from area N27), unless she feels that she can come back later to defeat the
  PCs with surprise. If she flees, you can have the PCs encounter her again in
  the next adventure.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds, potion of invisibility

  +1 frost dagger, masterwork light crossbow with 10 bolts, amulet of natural
  armor +2, ring of protection +2, diamond dust (worth 500 gp), ruby dust (worth
