  - name: Fast Healing (Sp)
    description: >-
      An inquisitor troop's fast healing is a reflection of the fact that each
      round, some of the inquisitors in the troop cast cure light wounds spells
      on wounded members. Not all inquisitors in a troop use this ability
      simultaneously, and they can only grant fast healing to the troop for up
      to 10 rounds per day. Activating this ability is a free action that does
      not provoke an attack of opportunity.
