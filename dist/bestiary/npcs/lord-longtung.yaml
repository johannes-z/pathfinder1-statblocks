SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Tongue (Ex)
    description: >-
      Lord Longtung's tongue is a primary attack with reach equal to three times
      his normal reach (15 feet). His tongue deals no damage on a hit, but can
      be used to grab. Lord Longtung does not gain the grappled condition while
      using his tongue in this manner.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vorka's lucky frog does as it is told, attacking in the confines of the bridge
  or using its tongue to attack those climbing the rigging.
Morale: >-
  If Vorka is slain, Lord Longtung flees into the marsh to soon die of a broken
  heart.
