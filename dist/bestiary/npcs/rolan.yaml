DuringCombat: >-
  Once combat begins, Rolan orders his toys to attack his foes while he hangs
  back to support the constructs with his crossbow, firing at the nearest enemy.
  He switches to his club only if he has no other option.
Morale: >-
  Once three or more of his toys have been destroyed, Rolan becomes aggressive
  in combat, pursuing his foes with a psychotic fervor. If all of his constructs
  are defeated, he drops his weapon and falls to his knees in tears&#8211;as
  long as any of his constructs remain functional, he fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  +1 padded armor, masterwork club, masterwork light crossbow with 20 bolts,
  goggles of minute seeing
