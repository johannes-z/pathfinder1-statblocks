BeforeCombat: >-
  The bone sage casts extended mage armor and extended false life every day.
  Upon noticing the PCs approaching (either by hearing battle or seeing their
  approach via a spy eye), he casts see invisibility and, as soon as possible
  before confrontation, shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Maligast relies on his damage reduction to blunt most physical attacks, and
  casts summon monster V on the first round to conjure up 1d3 Medium air
  elementals. He follows that up by trying to dismiss the most heavily armored
  PC (remember, here in the Dark Forest, the PCs are extraplanar creatures!),
  following that up with his combat spells.
Morale: >-
  Maligast has little alternative but to fight until destroyed, at which point
  his nature as a simulacrum becomes clear as he melts into a shapeless heap of
  ice and snow.
Gear: >-
  amulet of natural armor +2, spy eyes (page 59), spellbook (contains only
  spells prepared, since as a simulacrum, Maligast cannot learn more spells than
  that)
