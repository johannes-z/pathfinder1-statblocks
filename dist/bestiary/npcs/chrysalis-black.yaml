BeforeCombat: >-
  If the alarm spell in area C5 is triggered, Chrysalis casts his defensive
  spells that have a duration of at least 1 hour per level. Once Chrysalis hears
  the PCs at the doll door, he casts his defensive spells (including those on
  scrolls) that have durations measured in minutes and rounds, using his
  metamagic rod to extend three of their durations (GM's choice). Once he has
  finished his preparations (including using potions and scrolls), if the PCs
  have not bypassed the doll door, Chrysalis opens it from a distance with a
  remote unlocking mechanism. He then prepares himself using the information he
  gathered from his earlier scrying.
DuringCombat: >-
  Chrysalis casts black tentacles, followed by spells such as lightning bolt and
  magic missile before resorting to unnatural lust, feeblemind, and ray of
  enfeeblement.
Morale: >-

  to escape via teleport.
