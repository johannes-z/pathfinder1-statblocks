BeforeCombat: Before entering combat, Hyrsek drinks a potion of cat's grace.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Hyrsek uses his rapier to attack a flat-footed
  character for sneak attack damage if possible. If encountered after dark or in
  areas of dim light, Hyrsek casts darkness to create an area where he can hide
  while making sneak attacks using his longbow (or using his rapier if anyone is
  foolish enough to come into the darkness without being able to see). Without
  this option, he prefers to stay mobile and use Vital Strike and Power Attack
  against foes. When brought below 90 hit points, he drinks a potion of
  invisibility, repositions and drinks a potion of cure serious wounds, then
  moves in to attempt a sneak attack (with Vital Strike and Power Attack)
  against a foe he's selected as a studied target.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 30 hit points or less, Hyrsek drinks a potion of invisibility
  and tries to flee or surrender if he has no potions left. If he escapes, he
  doesn't flee far. He'll switch over to stalking and observing the PCs as best
  he can but avoids re-engaging in combat with them, focusing instead on his
  original task to find Therace. If he surrenders, he'll admit that he's a
  mercenary working for the Technic League and is looking for a missing member
  of that group for the bounty offered&#8211;see Development for further
  details.
