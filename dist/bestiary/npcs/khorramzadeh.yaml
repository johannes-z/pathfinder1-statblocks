IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Deflective Defense (Ex)
    description: Khorramzadeh's touch AC is modified by armor and natural armor bonuses.
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      Khorramzadeh's death throes are more devastating than those of a typical
      balor. When killed, Khorramzadeh explodes in a flash of fire that deals
      200 points of damage (half fire damage, half unholy damage) and
      permanently blinds anything within 200 feet (Reflex DC 38 halves the
      damage and negates the blindness). One round after this explosion, an
      earthquake (CL 20th) is triggered as well, centered on the point where the
      Storm King's body fell. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Greater Nondetection (Sp)
    description: >-
      Khorramzadeh is constantly warded by a powerful nondetection effect-this
      effect works as nondetection, but is always in effect. There's no chance
      of penetrating this ward with a caster level check.
  - name: Resist Smite (Ex)
    description: >-
      Khorramzadeh is difficult to affect with smite attacks, such as by a
      paladin's smite evil ability. When a creature attempts to make
      Khorramzadeh the target of any smite effect, Khorramzadeh can try to
      resist the smite by attempting a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the Hit
      Dice of the creature attempting the smite attack + the Charisma modifier
      of the creature attempting the smite attack). On a successful save, not
      only is that smite attack wasted, but the backlash of power also causes
      the source of the smite attempt to become staggered for 1 round unless it
      succeeds at a DC 38 Will save. This save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Stormlord (Su)
    description: >-
      Khorramzadeh's spell-like abilities, death throes, and flaming body
      abilities can deal electricity damage instead of fire damage, as
      appropriate&#8211;he can decide to adjust his fire damage in this way
      instantaneously. Electricity resistance is halved against this electricity
      damage, and electricity immunity is treated as resist electricity 20. Up
      to once per round when he is affected by electricity damage, he can choose
      to be healed of an amount of damage equal to the amount of electricity
      damage dealt rather than simply be immune to the damage.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: Khorramzadeh casts storm of vengeance over the area.
DuringCombat: >-
  Khorramzadeh uses his spell-like abilities at first, using telekinesis to hurl
  non-flying PCs off the cliff edge, dominating others, and blasting survivors
  with fire storm and implosion. Once he moves on to melee combat, he casts
  righteous might on himself and then focuses on healers first in battle.
Morale: >-
  Khorramzadeh has little choice when the final battle begins&#8211;he fights to
  the death rather than face greater punishment by Deskari for his failure.
