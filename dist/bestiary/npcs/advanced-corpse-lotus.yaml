  The corpse lotus attacks multiple opponents with its vines to grab as many
  meals as possible. Once it has all of its targets within reach grabbed, it
  constricts them until they stop moving and swallows them one at a time,
  starting with the largest. If badly injured, the corpse lotus consumes the
  goat carcass in this room to grant itself fast healing.
Morale: The corpse lotus fights until it is destroyed.
