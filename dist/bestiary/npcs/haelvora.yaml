DuringCombat: >-
  When combat starts (or if she has advance warning), Haelvora casts fly and
  rises 30 feet up to keep out of melee range. She casts summon monster III to
  summon 1d3 hell hounds. She then casts bane before targeting foes with vision
  of Hell, murderous command, dread bolt, and hold person. She only channels
  negative energy if she can do so without harming her allies. Once out of
  spells and channel energy uses, she enters melee with her battleaxe.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 15 hit points or less, Haelvora casts sanctuary and then tries
  to flee to area C1, where she drinks her healing potions and makes her final
  stand. She fights to the death.
