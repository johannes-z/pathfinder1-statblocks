SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Exceptional Statistics (Ex)
    description: >-
      Belimarius's ability scores were generated using 25 points rather than the
      standard 15. In addition, she has much more gear than an NPC of her level
      would normally carry. These modifications increase her CR to 20.
  - name: Immortal (Ex)
    description: >-
      Belimarius is immortal and immune to the negative effects of aging,
      disease, and madness. She's gained the benefits to her mental ability
      scores from her advanced age but does not take any penalties to her
      physical ability scores.
  - name: Inherent Bonuses (Ex)
    description: >-
      Belimarius has used numerous wish spells to gain a +5 inherent bonus to
      her Intelligence and +4 inherent bonuses to all other ability scores.
      Permanent Spells Belimarius has made arcane sight, darkvision, and tongues
      permanent on herself.
Gender: Female
ProhibitedSchools: evocation, necromancy
BeforeCombat: >-
  Belimarius uses her wand to cast stoneskin on herself before combat. She casts
  mind blank and nondetection on herself daily, using her greater rod of extend
  metamagic on the nondetection spell.
DuringCombat: >-
  Belimarius casts quickened shield and uses her greater rod of extend metamagic
  while casting time stop on the first round. During any rounds she gains via
  time stop, she casts the following spells in the order presented: greater
  invisibility and quickened mirror image, deflection, spell turning, true
  seeing, and repulsion. If she has additional rounds after this, she uses them
  to set up prismatic walls, areas of reverse gravity, and magical pits. Once
  she reemerges into the normal flow of time, she finishes casting any spells
  she wasn't able to cast during the time stop, casts quickened suggestion in
  the first few rounds of battle and then uses spells to break up the
  party-imprisonment, temporal stasis, and maze are favorites. Belimarius seeks
  to capture the PCs alive rather than kill them all so that she can use them to
  escape Crystilan, but she isn't above killing a few of them if they prove to
  be particularly uncooperative.
Morale: >-
  Belimarius recognizes when she's defeated. If brought below 50 hit points, she
  attempts to surrender and negotiate a deal with her enemies.
Gear: >-
  greater extend metamagic rod, ring of telekinesis, rod of negation, wand of
  stoneskin (CL 15th, 11 charges)
