SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Lure of the Labyrinth (Su)
    description: >-
      As a move action, Karsos can utter the name of a creature in his maze,
      which fascinates the creature and entices it to wander aimlessly. On the
      creature's next turn, it spends a move action traveling its speed in a
      random direction, after which it can act normally as long as it does not
      retrace its steps. Karsos can only affect a creature with this ability
      once per 24-hour period, and a DC 16 Will save negates this effect.
  - name: Natural Cunning (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although minotaurs are not especially intelligent, they possess innate
      cunning and logical ability. This gives them immunity to maze spells and
      prevents them from ever becoming lost. Further, they are never caught
      flat-footed.
  - name: Phantasmagoria (Su)
    description: >-
      Karsos was tied to his former maze abode and this persists into his
      undeath. Once per day, Karsos can create an elaborate illusion within the
      ruins of the maze that restores it to its former glory. This illusion
      functions similarly to the spell mirage arcana in combination with
      multiple major images, allowing Karsos to recreate the maze. Karsos can
      even incorporate himself into the illusion as if he were under the effects
      of the spell alter self. The illusion is treated as a 6th-level spell
      created at CL 11th. If any part of the illusion is dispelled, the entire
      illusion fades. The save DC is Charisma-based.
