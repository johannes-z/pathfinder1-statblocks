SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Snake bite; save Fort DC 24; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4
      Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based.
      Separated Until she recovers her body, Aeonte is unable to attack with her
      longbow.
  - name: Unpetrify Legions (Su)
    description: >-
      Aeonte can return a petrified creature to life (as if using stone to
      flesh) for 1 minute; this process takes 3 rounds of concentration while in
      contact with the creature, though Aeonte can perform this as a standard
      action on a creature within 30 feet by expending one use of mythic power.
      The creature is under her control (as if using dominate monster) and
      reverts to a statue at the end of this time. If Aeonte expends an
      additional use of mythic power, she can unpetrify up to three creatures
      within range simultaneously, or if she expends three uses of mythic power,
      the creature remains unpetrified for 24 hours instead of 1 minute. This
      ability modifies a mythic medusa's unpetrify ability and replaces the
      summon snake ability.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Aeonte casts eagle's splendor, freedom of movement, and invisibility purge.
  She also casts resist energy against any energy types she's seen the PCs use
  (this is not reflected in her statistics).
DuringCombat: >-
  Aeonte prefers to fight from above, striking with her snakes and using her
  gaze to petrify her opponents. She descends to bludgeon softer targets.
Morale: >-
  Once her cetus is defeated and she is reduced to 75 hit points or fewer,
  Aeonte uses her earth glide ability to flee Fallowdeep.
