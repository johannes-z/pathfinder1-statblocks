SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon(Su)
    description: >-
      Rivozair's breath weapon is hellfire. Half of the damage is fire damage
      and half is damage from unholy energy.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: Rivozair casts mage armor on herself well before combat begins.
DuringCombat: >-
  Rivozair opens combat with her breath weapon, then circles back in flight,
  summons a barbed devil, and casts mirror image before landing amid the PCs to
  engage them in melee. In melee she uses Arcane Strike (the bonuses are
  included in her statistics above), using her breath weapon or a fireball now
  and then to hit multiple PCs at once. Against a single particularly dangerous
  foe, she retreats to range and hits that target with ray of enfeeblement and
  reduce person before returning to melee.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, Rivozair casts invisibility and flees
  the region for a time; she may well return to attack the PCs again during the
  celebration of the Silver Span (see From Hell's Heart on page 62).
