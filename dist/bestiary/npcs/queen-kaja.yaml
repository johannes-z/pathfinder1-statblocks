SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Special Arrows (Ex)
    description: >-
      A pixie can sprinkle his arrows with pixie dust before shooting them as a
      free action as long as it is then fired by that same pixie. Queen Kaja can
      generate 20 uses of dust per day. Once applied to an arrow, it persists on
      that missile for one round. A pixie can choose from the following three
      effects; save DCs are Charisma-based. Charm: Succeed on DC 16 Will save or
      be affected as though by charm monster for 10 minutes. Memory Loss:
      Succeed on a DC 16 Will save or be affected by a modify memory spell (this
      effect can only eliminate the previous 5 minutes of memory). Sleep:
      Succeed on a DC 16 Will save or fall asleep for 5 minutes.
