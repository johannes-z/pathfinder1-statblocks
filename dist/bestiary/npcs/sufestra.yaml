BeforeCombat: >-
  Every morning at dawn, Sufestra casts status on the two vrocks in area A21.
  Once that status spell alerts her to combat, she prepares for battle by using
  a dose of stone salve on herself to gain stoneskin, and 1 dose each on the
  hill giant and redcap to gain two allies eager to earn their lives back. She
  ends her preparation by casting freedom of movement, protection from energy
  (fire), and invisibility on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  If possible, Sufestra hopes to have her giant and redcap minions deal with the
  PCs. She remains invisible during the first few rounds of combat, moving to
  cast healing spells on the most wounded ally each round. Once they're
  defeated, or once she's discovered, she casts confusion on as many PCs as
  possible (which also exposes the PCs to her gaze attack), then channels
  negative energy on the following rounds to wear the PCs down.
Morale: Sufestra fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  +3 chainmail, +1 frost punching dagger, doomsday key, stone salve (4 doses),
  gold unholy symbol of Mestama worth 230 gp, precious necklace worth 2,500 gp
