SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoids slain by a spectre become spectres themselves in 1d4 rounds.
      Spawn so created are less powerful than typical spectres, and suffer a -2
      penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, receive -2 hp per HD, and only drain
      one level on a touch. Spawn are under the command of the spectre that
      created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose
      their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and free-willed spectres.
      They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
  - name: Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)
    description: >-
      A raise dead or similar spell cast on a spectre destroys it (Will
      negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material
      component.
  - name: Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)
    description: >-
      Spectres are powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell)
      and flee from it. A spectre caught in sunlight cannot attack and is
      staggered.
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Animals, whether wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of
      a spectre at a distance of 30 ft. They do not willingly approach nearer
      than that and panic if forced to do so unless a master succeeds at a DC 25
      Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. A panicked animal remains so
      as long as it is within 30 ft. of the spectre.
