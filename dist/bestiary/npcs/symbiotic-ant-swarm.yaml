    description: >-
      Swarm-injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/ round for 3 rounds; effect 1d2
      Str; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The ants' most basic instinct is to defend the bullhorn acacia that serves as
  their home and food source, so they attack the PCs as soon as they come near
  enough to witness the scene.
Morale: >-
  The ants typically don't need to attack a creature for long before it runs
  away, so they harass the PCs for only 6 rounds before dispersing into the
  jungle and eventually returning to the bullhorn acacia.
