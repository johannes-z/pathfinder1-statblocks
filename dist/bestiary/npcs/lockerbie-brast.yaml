DuringCombat: >-

  maximize his sneak attacks. Once the battle begins in earnest, he fights using
  Combat Expertise and disarms foes, dropping weapons into the water to give
  himself a greater advantage.

  If reduced to fewer than 12 hit points, Lockerbie flees south to area D7, then

  slums to recover. He does not return to these sewers, nor does he seek revenge
  on the PCs.
