DuringCombat: >-
  Aron fights with an intense focus, moving in to engage foes in melee as
  swiftly as possible and staying mobile via 5-foot steps to try to flank. He
  attacks with his sword and shield, using them to great effect when he can make
  sneak attacks. When facing foes on his own where he can't get sneak attacks
  in, Aron fights defensively and does his best to reposition himself closer to
  allies.
Morale: >-
  Aron is no coward, but he's also a realist. If faced with no chance at
  securing an advantage in combat, he withdraws and attempts to escape, either
  to strike soon thereafter in ambush or to return with allies. Only if his
  lover Sosiel is in danger does Aron never retreat from battle, regardless of
  the odds.
