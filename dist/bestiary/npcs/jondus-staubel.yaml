DuringCombat: >-
  Jondus first casts cat's grace while the grassling moves into melee. If there
  are humans among his opponents, Jondus also uses his hunter's bond ability to
  share his favored enemy bonus with the grassling. He thereafter wades into
  melee with his earth breaker, using Furious Focus and Power Attack to deliver
  devastating blows.
Morale: Eager to prove himself by defeating intruders, Jondus fights to the death.
