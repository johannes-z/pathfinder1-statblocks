SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Rider Bond (Su)
    description: >-
      A dragonkin can form a permanent bond with its rider. Once this bond is
      made, a dragonkin cannot form another rider bond until its current rider
      dies. A dragonkin and its rider can communicate with each other as if they
      both had telepathy 100 ft. In combat, when a rider is mounted on her
      dragonkin, both creatures roll initiative separately and treat the highest
      result as their single result.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Efrixes follows Bescaylie's orders in combat, alternating use of his breath
  weapon with melee attacks.
Morale: >-
  Efrixes fights as long as Bescaylie does. If Bescaylie is slain, Efrixes is
  overwhelmed with wrath and fights to the death, focusing on killing her
  murderer.
