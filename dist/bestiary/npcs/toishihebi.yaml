Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Toishihebi uses charm monster to gain an upper hand whenever possible. He
  tries to scout out enemies first with arcane eye, and attacks only if the odds
  are favorable. When possible, he hides inside a fog cloud and uses his
  blindsight to direct his breath weapon. As Hiyuke, he sometimes tries to trick
  samurai with his keen edge spell, mimicking the sharpening of their blade with
  a "magic" whetstone and selling this service as a permanent effect.
DuringCombat: >-
  In the open, Toishihebi tries to stay away from melee combat, using his breath
  weapon and spells as much as possible. He retreats once his spells are
  depleted, unless he thinks he can finish his enemies in a hand-to-hand fight.
  When posing as Hiyuke, he prefers to flee from superior foes rather than
  reveal his true nature.
Morale: >-
  Toishihebi withdraws if he cannot defeat his foes. He fights to the bitter end
  only in defense of his hoard.
Gear: >-
  quarterstaff, knife grinder's tools, haversack with provisions, peasant's
  outfit, wicker hat, pouch containing coins and trinkets worth 10 gp in total
