SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ghostly Swarm (Su)
    description: >-
      Nareem was devoured by army ants, and their ghostly bodies still crawl
      over and around him. These incorporeal ants swarm over any living creature
      within 10 feet of Nareem. Affected creatures take 3d6 points of damage per
      round and are nauseated for as long as they remain within the aura (a DC
      17 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the nausea).
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Nareem does not immediately manifest when intruders arrive, but he takes note
  of them from hiding within the stones of the ruined building. If the intruders
  make no sign of leaving after a minute, he moves to attack, eager to drive
  them off from the city he still feels is rightfully his discovery. When he
  attacks, the first things that manifests are the ghostly ants of his
  swarm&#8211;these army ants appear to crawl out of the walls and ground in
  swiftly increasing numbers. Nareem himself remains inside of the solid stone
  or ground for 1 round; if the manifestation of his swarm doesn't scare off the
  intruders, he emerges to attack. Nareem focuses his attacks on anyone who is
  obviously (or likely to be) a Pathfinder, shrieking phrases like, "It's mine!
  I found it! The city is mine!" while he tries to kill (or at least run off)
  the intruders.
Morale: >-
  Nareem fights until destroyed, rejuvenating in 2d4 days. During this period of
  rejuvenation, solitary ghostly ants can be seen crawling around on the ruins
  or the ground. Nareem can be laid to rest permanently only by ensuring that
  the discovery of Saventh-Yhi is credited to him in a printed copy of the
  Pathfinder Chronicles. It's possible for a deceptive character to trick Nareem
  into accepting a forgery or illusory Pathfinder Chronicle as the real thing
  and thus put him to rest&#8211;doing so requires either a successful opposed
  Linguistics check (for an actual forgery) or a failed Will save on Nareem's
  part (for an illusion).
