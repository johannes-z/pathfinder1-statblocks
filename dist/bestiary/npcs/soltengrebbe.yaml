SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Coordinated Bites (Ex)
    description: >-
      If Soltengrebbe attacks a single target with both of its bite attacks, it
      treats that target as if the target were flat-footed against those
      attacks.
  - name: Crushing Jaws (Ex)
    description: >-
      If Soltengrebbe hits a creature with both bite attacks, it can expend one
      use of mythic power to savage its prey as an immediate action. This
      immediately deals 2d6+1d8+7 points of damage as it chews on the victim. In
      addition, the victim must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save to resist
      being staggered by the pain for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Demonic (Ex)
    description: >-
      Soltengrebe's transformation into a mythic creature has infused it with
      many demonic resistances and immunities. It counts as if it had the demon
      subtype for the purposes of effects that have additional effects against
      demons.
  - name: Dual Initiative (Ex)
    description: >-
      Soltengrebe gets two turns each round, one on its initiative count and one
      on its initiative count -20. See page 227 of Pathfinder RPG Mythic
      Adventures for more information on this mythic monster ability.
  - name: Mythic Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Soltengrebe's breath weapon is enhanced from a normal chimera's. It deals
      6d8 cold damage and 2d8 piercing damage in a 40-foot cone of freezing wind
      and shards of jagged ice (Reflex DC 19 half). The save DC is
      Constitution-based, and includes a +2 bonus from Ability Focus.
