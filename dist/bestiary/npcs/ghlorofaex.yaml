DuringCombat: >-
  Ghlorofaex first attempts a breath weapon pass if two or more opponents are in
  a line. He then casts displacement and haste before he attempts to crush as
  many enemies as possible and fights in melee until reduced below 150 hit
  points, at which point he takes to the air again to use his breath weapon and
  ranged spells.
Morale: >-
  If reduced below 100 hit points, Ghlorofaex flees the area&#8211;he may come
  back to attack the PCs again in the future at your discretion.
