SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Paranoid (Ex)
    description: >-
      The charau-ka all suffer from paranoia caused by the vault's midnight
      spores. A paranoid charau-ka takes a -4 penalty on Will saves and
      Charisma-based skill checks, cannot receive benefit from or attempt the
      Aid Another action, and cannot willingly accept aid (including healing)
      from another creature unless it makes a DC 22 Will save.
  - name: Shrieking Frenzy (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a charau-ka can enter a state of shrieking frenzy as a free
      action. While in this state, the charau-ka automatically fails Stealth
      checks and cannot speak or cast spells that use verbal components (or use
      items that require command words to activate), but functions as if under
      the effects of a haste spell. The charauka can continue shrieking for up
      to 3 rounds, after which it is staggered for 1 round. Thrown-Weapon
  - name: Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Charau-ka are masters of thrown weapons. All charau-ka gain Throw Anything
      as a bonus feat. In addition, a charau-ka gains a +1 racial bonus on all
      thrown weapons, and the threat range for thrown weapons is doubled, as if
      the charau-ka possessed the Improved Critical feat for all thrown weapons.
      This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat
      range of a weapon.
DuringCombat: >-
  The charau-ka rage and swing their spiked logs at intruders on the trail
  below. If a log hits one of the PCs, the charau-ka may make an immediate bull
  rush combat maneuver check against that PC (using the charau-ka's strength
  surge rage power). If the check is successful, the PC is knocked from the
  trail and falls into the brambles below. Four of the charau-ka follow this
  attack with thrown javelins while the other four quickly climb down the ravine
  wall. These four enter a shrieking frenzy and attack any PCs left on the
  trail. If their fellows below are killed or when they run out of javelins, the
  four charau-ka still atop the cliff enter shrieking frenzies and climb down to
  attack as well.
Morale: Enraged and paranoid, the charau-ka fight to the death.
