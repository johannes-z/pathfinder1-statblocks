SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Summon (Sp)
    description: >-
      Due to the specifics of her contract with Shayle, Kelseph can use her
      summon spell-like ability to summon a single gaav with a 100% chance of
      success instead of the lemure she would normally be able to summon.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Kelseph drinks her potion of cat's grace and her elixir of tumbling if she
  knows a battle is imminent. These changes are factored into her statistics.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kelseph uses her summon ability as soon as combat begins, and relies on her
  fiendish minions to keep the PCs at bay while she plugs them with arrows from
  her angelfall bow. If melee seems inevitable, she launches into the fray with
  her falchion, using Acrobatics to maneuver the battlefield and avoid being
  flanked. She uses her fear spell-like ability against whomever she deems to be
  the biggest damage-dealer, and uses unholy blight if she is surrounded. She
  drinks a potion of cure moderate wounds when her hit point total falls below
  20.
Morale: Kelseph has run out of options at this point, and fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  +1 arrows (5), +1 cruel arrows (5), potions of cure moderate wounds (2),
  potion of cat's grace, smokestick (3)
OtherGear: >-
  mwk half-plate, angelfall bow (see page 53) with 20 arrows, mwk falchion, mwk
  silver dagger, elixir of tumbling, red diamond pendant worth 200 gp
