BeforeCombat: >-
  If he expects any sort of trouble (such as before meeting the PCs in Event
  10), Linton drinks extracts of anticipate peril, false life, and shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Linton deplores combat, but knows his strength rests in the efficiency of his
  bombs. If he has time, he quaffs an extract of invisibility at the beginning
  of combat in hopes of catching his enemies off guard. Linton targets foes with
  his bombs, making sneak attacks whenever possible. He uses his extended reach
  to grapple targets moving into melee combat with him, but breaks the grapple
  almost immediately to lob more bombs.
Morale: >-
  Linton is a born and bred survivor, and attempts to retreats from combat using
  all means available once reduced to 20 hit points or fewer. If he survives
  and    escapes, Linton assumes a new identity in town by killing and replacing
  a friendly NPC such as Loredana Viorica or any other character with whom the
  PCs are allied, and attempts to exact revenge on his enemies.
