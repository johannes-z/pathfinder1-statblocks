SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures killed by the Mutate rise as juju zombies 1d10 minutes after
      they die. The juju zombies raised in this way are under the control of the
      Mutate and share a telepathic link with it to a range of 500 feet. The
      juju zombies remain under control of the Mutate until it is killed. The
      Mutate can enslave a number of juju zombies equaling no more than double
      its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become
      free-willed undead instead.
  - name: Empower Ooze (Su)
    description: >-
      The Mutate can to bolster creatures of the ooze type. When the Mutate is
      within 30 feet of an ooze, that creature gains a +2 insight bonus on
      attack rolls, saves, and skill checks. An ooze affected by this ability
      retains this bonus for as long as it remains with 30 feet of the Mutate
      and for 1 minute after leaving the Mutate's presence.
