  - name: Daemonic Osmosis (Su)
    description: >-
      If a facestealer (in its doppelbear form) spends at least 24 hours
      watching a mark (or just being within 50 feet of him) it may permanently
      gain a feat that the mark has used, even if the facestealer does not meet
      the requirements. Alternatively, it may gain one 0-level or 1st-level
      spell that the mark casts during that time as a spell-like ability (CL
      3rd), usable 3 times a day. This effect uses the creature's Charisma to
      determine the spell's DC. This ability can be used only to obtain spells
      with a material component worth less than 5 gp. Once daemonic osmosis is
      used on a mark, the ability only functions if used on the same mark.
  - name: Stolen Face (Ex)
    description: >-
      Facestealers receive a +10 bonus to Disguise when imitating its mark
      (included above). It can speak with the mark's voice, but does not
      understand the language, repeating catchphrases and gibberish.
  - name: Unusual Anatomy (Ex)
    description: >-
      Facestealers have a 25% chance to treat any critical hit they suffer as a
      normal hit.
