BeforeCombat: >-
  If she's warned of the PCs' presence, Hilda casts air walk and spell
  resistance on herself, and then positions herself near the ceiling within
  range of the other cultists so she can support them with her healing spells.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Hilda casts repulsion to keep enemies away from
  her. She then casts her most damaging spells that can affect multiple targets,
  such as destruction, flame strike, mass inflict moderate wounds, and unholy
  blight. She also makes good use of her channel the void ability to damage the
  PCs. She uses Selective Channeling to exclude the other cultists from the
  effect. Hilda supports the other cultists  with her scrolls of mass cure
  serious wounds and her mass cure moderate wounds spell.
Morale: >-
