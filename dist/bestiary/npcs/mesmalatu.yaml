DuringCombat: >-
  Mesmalatu's first action in combat is to attempt to devour the soul of the
  most dangerous looking target&#8211;if the possessed nalfeshnee from area E6
  is with the party, she targets it with this ability in preference to the PCs.
  On the second round, she uses wail of the banshee. On the third round, she
  casts her most devastating spell. She repeats this pattern, periodically
  augmenting it with inflict wounds spells to heal herself. If she's targeted by
  holy smite or shatter, Mesmalatu's next action is to cast spell immunity to
  make herself immune to these spells.
Morale: Mesmalatu fights until destroyed.
