SQ: infernal contract, infernal investment
Source: Academy Of Secrets
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Binding Contracts (Ex)
    description: >-
      The long contracts draped over Chyvvom's horns and body are animated, and
      the devil can attack with two of them at a time as secondary natural
      attacks.
  - name: Infernal Contracts (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, Chyvvom can produce an infernal contract for a
      single living mortal creature. The mortal must sign its true name to the
      document of its own free will, gaining up to three wishes, as per the
      spell wish, usable immediately or in the future by calling on the devil.
      While the mortal chooses the intention of the wishes, Chyvvom decides upon
      the specifics, allowing for his own diabolical interpretation of the
      results should the mortal imprecisely phrase its wish.
  - name: Infernal Investment (Su)
    description: >-
      Chyvvom can scry at will upon any creature with whom he has a contract.
      The target creature always fails its save against Chyvvom's scrying
      attempt.
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Chyvvom is aware of the PCs (and he is if they have interacted with either
  Terentius or Marijkal, both of whom have contracts with the devil), he casts
  quickened shield of faith prior to their entry into area 7.
DuringCombat: >-
  Chyvvom much prefers to defeat his foes through trickery and cleverly worded
  contracts, avoiding combat in favor of negotiation. If combat is unavoidable,
  he summons a squad of bearded devils as bodyguards, using his spell-like
  abilities like bestow curse, delayed blast fireball, hold person, and
  scorching ray from distance. If forced into melee, he fights viciously with
  his natural attacks, as much out of anger at being so provoked as out of
  self-defense.
Morale: >-
  Chyvvom's orders from Lorthact are precise: he is to retain the souls of all
  who enter Belzeragna or perish preventing their escape.
