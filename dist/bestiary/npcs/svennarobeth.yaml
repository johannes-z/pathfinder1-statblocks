  Svennarobeth follows his mistress's orders to the letter, but if left on his
  own, he prefers to attack obvious worshipers of good deities. He uses Power
  Attack unless he goes an entire round without successfully hitting, in which
  case he abandons that tactic against that foe.
Morale: Svennarobeth fights to the death.
