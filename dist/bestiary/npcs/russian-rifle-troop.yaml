SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fusillade (Ex)
    description: >-
      Rifle troops can fire a fusillade of rifle bullets as a standard action.
      This attack takes the form of up to four lines with a range of 200 feet.
      These lines can start from the corner of any square in the troop's space.
      All creatures in one of these lines' areas of effect take 6d10+6 points of
      bludgeoning and piercing damage (Reflex DC 23 for half). The save DC is
      Dexterity-based, and includes the bonus from the troop's Ability Focus
      feat.
  - name: Gas Masks (Ex)
    description: >-
      The soldiers of a rifle troop are all equipped with gas masks. This makes
      the troop immune to inhaled poisons and other nonmagical airborne attacks
      that require breathing, and grants it a +2 bonus on saving throws against
      magical cloud or gas attacks.
  - name: Grenade Volley (Ex)
    description: >-
      Rifle troops are equipped with grenades. As a move action, a rifle troop
      can target a single square up to 60 feet away with a volley of
      fragmentation grenades. A volley deals 12d6 points of piercing and
      slashing damage in a 30-foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 21 for half). The
      save DC is Dexterity-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  These troops are veterans of the Great War, and even when faced with fantastic
  foes (such as armored, sword-wielding, or spellcasting PCs), these hardened
  soldiers maintain a steely resolve, concentrating their rifle fusillades on
  flying opponents or supernatural threats, or readying actions to launch
  grenade volleys at charging opponents. In the absence of armor, troops seek
  any scrap of cover they can earn&#8211;particularly trenches, fortifications,
  and walls.
Morale: A troop disperses when reduced to 0 hit points or fewer.
