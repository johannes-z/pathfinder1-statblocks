SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ravenous Appetite (Ex)
    description: >-
      Nibs can consume leather, paper, parchment, and wood at a phenomenal rate.
      Her natural attacks and swarm damage ignore the first 5 points of hardness
      on such materials. Each round she deals swarm damage to a creature, she
      can attempt a special grapple combat maneuver against that creature as a
      free action. If successful, she deals her swarm damage to one book,
      scroll, or similar object in that creature's possession, selected at
      random.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  When Nibs first hears trouble, she casts barkskin, burrow, freedom of
  movement, greater magic fang, pass without trace, and resist energy (fire) on
  herself. She then lays a blast rune just north of the stairwell door and
  another four blast runes throughout the room.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nibs activates her warding rune on the first creature that triggers a blast
  rune. She delights in flooding the stairs with vermin, such as with creeping
  doom and insect plague. Otherwise she uses her spells to blast foes and grabs
  hold of spellcasters to consume their scrolls.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 40 hit points or clearly outclassed, Nibs leaps out the window
  and tries to burrow to safety.
Gear: >-
  +2 leather armor, belt of mighty constitution +2, cloak of resistance +2,
  headband of inspired wisdom +2, sapphire worth 1,000 gp
