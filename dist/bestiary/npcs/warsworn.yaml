SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Absorb (Su)
    description: >-
      A warsworn can consume any creature with -1 or fewer hit points that is
      dying by moving into the same space. Doing so immediately kills the
      creature and heals the warsworn by an amount equal to the creature's
      Constitution score. This ability cannot heal a warsworn beyond its maximum
      number of hit points. Nonliving creatures or completely dead corpses
      cannot be absorbed. Absorbed corpses cannot be resurrected by any effect
      short of a miracle or wish spell until the warsworn that consumed them is
      destroyed.
  - name: Haunt Armor (Sp)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a warsworn can violently take control of a suit of
      heavy armor or its wearer. This limited form of possession manifests much
      like the violent thrust effect of the spell telekinesis. A warsworn can
      only target a suit of heavy armor with this effect or a creature wearing a
      suit of heavy armor. Creatures affected by protection from evil are immune
      to this effect. The effect is CL 18th.
  - name: Haunt Weapons (Sp)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a warsworn can animate a number of unattended weapons
      as per the spell animate objects. A warsworn can animate a number of
      Medium or smaller weapons equal to its Charisma bonus (typically 7) for up
      to 10 minutes. (Most weapons sized for Medium creatures are considered
      Tiny or Small animated objects.) These weapons must be within 50 feet of
      the warsworn and are all animated at once. This effect only affects
      weapons and no other type of object. Each weapon animated by this effect
      appears to be wielded by ghostly hands. Aside from being able to be
      individually destroyed or dispelled as per normal animated objects, any
      object animated by this effect can also be damaged by channel energy as if
      it were an undead creature. Creatures affected by protection from evil are
      immune to this effect. The effect is CL 18th.
