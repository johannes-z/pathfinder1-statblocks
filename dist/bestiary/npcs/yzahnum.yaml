DuringCombat: >-
  As Trifaccia, Yzahnum avoids the use of his spell-like abilities. When he
  fights in human form, his size is Medium, making his AC is 1 higher, and he
  uses his "Melee (as Trifaccia)" attack. If he is reduced to fewer than 150 hit
  points, he reverts to his true form so he can use flight, cast scorching ray
  and wall of fire, and use change size to shrink foes. He reverts to melee only
  as necessary.
Morale: >-
  Yzahnum knows when he's outmatched. If reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, he
  attempts to escape via invisibility and flies back to Castle Korvosa-the terms
  of his current bargain with Ileosa prevents him from using plane shift to do
  so. If he escapes, the PCs might encounter him again once they begin to
  explore the castle.

  resistance, ring of protection +2
