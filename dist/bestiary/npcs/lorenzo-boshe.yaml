BeforeCombat: >-
  If Lorenzo is aware of the PCs and isn't occupied with another task, he drinks
  his daily mutagen, increasing his Constitution. He always coats his short
  sword with a dose of greenblood oil at the start of the day, and has thus far
  avoided using it in the party's previous encounters.
DuringCombat: >-
  Lorenzo tries to stay behind the heavily armored brothers, preferring to throw
  bombs from range.
Morale: >-
  Lorenzo fights to the death, completely dedicated to the task at hand, even if
  it costs him his life. That is, after all, what he signed on for.
