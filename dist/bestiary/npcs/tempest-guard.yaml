  Trained to fight as a unit, the Tempest Guards maintain a tight formation and
  work in pairs against enemies. They prefer to close to melee as soon as
  possible and use Power Attack, but they use their javelins of lightning if
  they notice two or more opponents in a line.
Morale: Tempest Guards fight until destroyed.
Gear: javelin of lightning
