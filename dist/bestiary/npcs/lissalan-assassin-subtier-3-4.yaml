Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  When the cultist knows the PCs are closing on her, she drinks her potion of
  protection from good, her potion of blur, and a potion of invisibility,
  preparing to ambush them when they come within striking distance, preferably
  with her death attack. She has already placed one dose of large scorpion venom
  on her short sword.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Lissalan assassin combines invisibility and her darkness spell-like
  ability to gain sneak attacks on her foes, drinking healing potions and
  applying poison to her sword as needed under the cover of invisibility. When
  her allies arrive, she flanks enemies to gain sneak attacks once she runs out
  of magical means of doing so.
Morale: >-
  Having never met a foe she couldn't best and driven by her zeal for Lissala,
  the Lissalan assassin fights until she is likely too close to death to escape.
  If reduced to 10 hit points or less, she attempts to flee.
Gear: >-
  potion of blur, potion of cure moderate wounds, potions of invisibility (2),
  potion of protection from good, large scorpion venom (2 doses), tanglefoot bag
OtherGear: >-
