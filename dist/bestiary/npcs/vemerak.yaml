SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A vemerak's acidic breath weapon has no effect on inorganic or undead
      material. If the breath weapon deals damage to a living, fleshy creature,
      the acid creates a transparent cloud of foul-smelling vapor that fills
      that creature's space and persists for 1 round. Any creature that is
      within the cloud or passing through it must make a DC 24 Fortitude save or
      be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. This cloud is a poison effect. The save DCs
      are Constitution-based.
  - name: Earthquake (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a vemerak can burrow its tentacles, legs, and
      mouth into the ground-this action does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
      At the start of the next round, it creates an effect identical to an
      earthquake spell (CL 17th). A vemerak can maintain this zone of trembling
      earth indefinitely, as long as it continues to take full-round actions to
      maintain the effect.
  - name: Spore Cloud (Su)
    description: >-
      A unique form of magic-resistant mold grows upon the body of a vemerak.
      This mold is the source of the vemerak's spell resistance. When the
      vemerak moves, the mold exudes a cloud of spores in a 30-foot radius that
      acts as a targeted greater dispel magic spell (CL 17th) against the
      highest caster level magical effect the cloud touches as part of the
      vemerak's move that turn.
DuringCombat: >-
  The vemerak attacks at range with its breath weapon. As opponents draw closer,
  the vemerak creates an earthquake, then makes full attacks at any creatures
  within range, hoping to grab and constrict them.
Morale: >-
  The vemerak attempts to flee into the canyons if reduced to fewer than 40 hit
  points, using its breath weapon to deter pursuit.
