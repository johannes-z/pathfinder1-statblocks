SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Call Magma (Sp)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as per call lightning, except the damage it deals
      is half bludgeoning damage, half fire damage. In Subtier 6-7, the damage
      increases to 3d10.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Jiraku casts longstrider  and pass without trace. By the time combat begins,
  assume that only 3 rounds remain of her wind wall's duration.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jiraku casts dispel magic on any PCs whom she saw resist Ngon Le's scorching
  ray during the Nagaji Ambush encounter. She then barrages the PCs with her
  call magma ability until a PC comes close enough for her to make a full attack
  with her tetsubo.
Morale: >-
  When Jiraku is incapacitated (for example, paralyzed or pinned) or reduced to
  22 hp or less, her stony form crumbles and she immediately transforms into her
  oni form (see below). As part of her transformation, she may teleport up to 30
  feet as an immediate action. Unless she has been disarmed, her tetsubo
  teleports with her.
