DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Gregganor leaps to his feet and seizes the
  dining table in front of his throne to lob it at enemies with his Awesome
  Throw feat. Treat the table as a thrown rock that can hit up to three Medium
  adjacent enemies in a line (he must roll an attack roll against each creature
  in the line). Thereafter, the hersir uses his feats to take advantage of his
  reach and keep opponents from getting inside the reach of his massive glaive,
  while making attacks against as many foes as possible.
Morale: >-
  If he thinks escape is possible, Gregganor flees to his quarters (see
  Development below) when reduced to 45 hit points or fewer. Otherwise, he
  fights to the death.
Gear: frost boulders (6; see the sidebar on page 32)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 mithral breastplate, belt of giant strength +6, glaive, everburning torch,
  key to pit trap bypass lock (see Trap below), signal horn
