BeforeCombat: >-
  Khalib casts false life, overland flight, and nondetection on himself every
  day. Once an alarm is raised, he also casts stoneskin, quickened shield, and
  cat's grace on himself before entering battle. He casts greater magic weapon
  on his masterwork dagger as well, even though he's long believed that if he's
  been forced to resort to using his dagger in combat, something has gone
  horribly wrong.
DuringCombat: >-
  Khalib begins his battles by casting summon monster spells, augmenting them
  with quickened spells at the same time, as appropriate. He's not all that
  concerned that these monsters aren't attuned to the occluding field&#8211;
  since if they're cut down early by the zone's damaging pulses, he can always
  summon more. He saves temporal stasis for particularly troublesome enemy
  spellcasters. He prefers to fight alongside giants and lamias, and if he finds
  the PCs before they're already in a fight, he attempts to rally the nearest
  group of monstrous allies to attack before he confronts them.
Morale: Khalib fights to the death.
