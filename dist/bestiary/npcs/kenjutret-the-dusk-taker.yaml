BeforeCombat: >-
  Kenjutret casts mythic mage armor and mind blank every evening before he takes
  off on a patrol.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Dusk-Taker's first act in combat is to use reverse gravity from a height
  of at least 150 feet above a target it's hovering over so it can snatch
  targets out of the sky. It prefers to use its mythic magic power on
  telekinesis. With mythic telekinesis, the Dusk-Taker prefers to make a ranged
  disarm or bull rush or other combat maneuver against foes while using Improved
  Vital Strike to attack one nearby creature with its bite. Against single foes,
  it prefers to make full attacks when possible.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 75 hit points, Kenjutret flees the Slave Trenches,
  retreating into the mountains to recover from its wounds. Once healed, it uses
  greater scrying to spy upon the PCs and to plan revenge against them.
