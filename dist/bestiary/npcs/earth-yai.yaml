      As a swift action, an earth yai can fire an incredibly dense stone from
      its third eye. This attack has a range of 200 feet, with no range

  The earth yai cast earthquake to collapse the bridge, dropping attackers into

  missiles at any remaining foes.
Morale: >-
  If one of the earth yai is slain, the other takes to the air and flees the
  city.
