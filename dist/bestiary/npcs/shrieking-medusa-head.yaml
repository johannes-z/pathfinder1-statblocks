  - name: Petrifying Bite (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures bitten by a shrieking medusa head must make a DC 16 Fortitude
      save or turn to stone for 1d4 rounds. Targets immune to poison are immune
      to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Scream (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a shrieking medusa head can open its jaw and emit a
      bone-chilling scream. Each creature within 30 feet must make a DC 16 Will
      save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear
      effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is
      immune to the same head's scream for 24 hours.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, one of the medusa heads screams while the other
  bites the closest opponent. They alternate screaming to affect as many foes as
  possible while trying to turn foes to stone with their petrifying bites.
Morale: The medusa heads fight until destroyed.
