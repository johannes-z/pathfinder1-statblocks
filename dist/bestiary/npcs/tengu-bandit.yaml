SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gifted Linguist (Ex)
    description: >-

      each time they gain a rank in Linguistics rather than 1 language.
  - name: Swordtrained (Ex)
    description: >-
      Tengus are trained from birth in swordplay, and as a result are
      automatically proficient with swordlike weapons (including bastard swords,
      daggers, elven curve blades, falchions, greatswords, kukris, longswords,
      punching daggers, rapiers, scimitars, short swords, and two-bladed
      swords).
BeforeCombat: >-
  The tengus are amusing themselves by tormenting the family and are not
  particularly alert; as a result, they take a &#8211;4 on any Perception checks
  to notice the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  The mounted tengus use ride-by attacks as much as possible, charging and
  moving out of retaliation range. Once their companions on foot engage in
  melee, the riders close as well and attempt to flank.
Morale: If two of the tengus fall, the rest attempt to flee.
Gear: >-
  leather lamellar*, shortbow with 20 arrows, wakizashi*, light horse (combat
  trained), riding saddle
