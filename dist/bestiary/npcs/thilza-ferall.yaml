SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mark I Dermal Plating (Ex)
    description: >-
      Thilza has a cybernetic implant in her skin, which grants her a +1
      enhancement bonus to natural armor. This is a non-magical effect that
      cannot be dispelled, though anything that prevents technology from working
      negates this cybertech's bonus as well. For more information on cybertech
      and dermal plating, see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: rakshasaUM
BeforeCombat: >-
  Prior to combat, Thilza casts mage armor and shield upon herself, and ensures
  her hide aura ability is active. These bonuses are already incorporated into
  her statistics.
DuringCombat: >-
  Thilza attempts to disable any opposition using spells such as slow and
  command, and resorts to using mass reduce person against particularly
  resistant opposition.
Morale: >-
  Failure to destroy the book is not an option. Thilza fights until the mission
  is complete and expects the same of all under her command.
Gear: potion of shield of faith (CL 12th), wand of stone shape (5 charges)
OtherGear: dagger, cloak of resistance +2, mark I dermal plating, 323 gp
Land: 1
BaseStatistics: >-
