SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dream Whisper (Su)
    description: >-
      The Splatter Man cannot physically leave area U11, but he can extend his
      consciousness outside of this area to touch the dreams of sleeping mortals
      once every 1d4+2 nights. This allows the Splatter Man to send visions and
      hideous dreams to a single sleeping creature within a mile. The target can
      resist these dreams with a DC 17 Will save; otherwise, the target is
      affected by the dreams as if by a nightmare spell (the victim gains the
      same Will save modifiers as afforded to those who are targeted by an
      actual nightmare, meaning that once the Splatter Man has firsthand
      knowledge of a creature after it fails the Will save, he tends to stick to
      that target on successive nights). The second time a target fails to
      resist the effects of the Splatter Man's dream whisper, the Splatter Man
      can, instead of causing 1d10 points of damage with the nightmare effect,
      implant a suggestion in the dreaming creature's mind. If the suggestion is
      successful, the creature immediately rises in a somnambulistic state to
      carry out the commands of the suggestion, which must be something the
      victim can accomplish before sunrise, at which point the sleepwaking
      victim wakens with no memory of the dream or his actions while under the
      influence. If the Splatter Man manages to escape Harrowstone, this ability
      increases in power, becoming a full-fledged ghostly malevolence ability.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  While the Splatter Man was careful to not reveal the true scope of his limited
  but not insignificant spellcasting when he was a living prisoner, he does not
  need to abide by those limitations as a ghost. He begins combat by attempting
  to maintain ranged superiority, moving through the various walls of the cells
  to force the PCs to constantly be on the move to keep up with him. He starts
  by casting his empowered summon monster II spell to summon 1d3+1 dire rats to
  serve as distractions, then follows that up with magic missiles (working down
  from maximized to empowered to normal versions of the spell)-he'll generally
  split up his magic missiles among different targets rather than focusing fire
  on one foe, in a cruel attempt to prolong and distribute the suffering. Once
  his summoned rats are gone, he'll use summon monster II to begin summoning
  giant spiders or octopuses to vex the PCs as appropriate. The Splatter Man's
  corrupting touch is one of his most powerful attacks, but he saves it to use
  against foes who seem to be able to significantly damage him-while he's a
  ghost, old habits die hard, and he tends to try to avoid getting into melee
  confrontations. The Splatter Man is bound to this room-he cannot leave area
  U11 to pursue foes, but he certainly attempts to use his dream whisper ability
  on the PCs later if they flee a battle against him, for now that he has
  firsthand knowledge of the PCs, they gain no bonuses to resist that ability.
Morale: The Splatter Man fights until destroyed.
