SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Absorb Dying Beast (Su)
    description: >-
      The horse thing can consume any dying animal or magical beast by moving
      into that creature's space. This immediately kills the creature, absorbs
      it into the horse thing, and restores a number of hit points to the horse
      thing equal to the absorbed creature's Constitution score. Absorbed
      corpses can't be resurrected by any effect short of a miracle or wish
      spell until the horse thing that consumed them is destroyed.
  - name: Profane Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      Protection from evil blocks attacks from the horse thing's spell-like
      abilities.
DuringCombat: >-
  The horse thing attempts to trample as many foes as possible as it lurches
  forward then lashes out with its hooves. It uses telekinesis only if it can't
  reach its opponents in melee.
Morale: The horse thing fights until destroyed.
