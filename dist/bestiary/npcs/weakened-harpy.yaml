    description: >-
      A harpy's' song has the power to infect the minds of those that hear it,
      calling them to the harpy's' side. When a harpy sings, all creatures aside
      from other harpies within a 300 ft. spread must succeed on a DC16 Will
      saving throw or become captivated. A creature that successfully saves is
      not subject to the same harpy's' song for 24 hours. A victim under the
      effects of the captivating song moves toward the harpy using the most
      direct means available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such
      as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving
      throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Captivated creatures can
      take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of
      the harpy simply stands and offers no resistance to the harpy's' attacks.
      This effect continues for as long as the harpy sings and for 1 round
      thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
