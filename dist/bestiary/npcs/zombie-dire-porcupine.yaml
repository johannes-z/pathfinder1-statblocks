    description: >-
      When a dire porcupine zombie strikes with its tail or slam attacks, it
      dislodges 1d6 quills that automatically break off and lodge in the
      opponent's flesh. A lodged quill imposes a -1 circumstance penalty to
      attacks, saves, and checks. Every 1 minute thereafter, the quill moves
      deeper into the opponent's flesh, dealing 1d2 additional points of damage.
      Removing the quill takes 1 full round and deals 1d4 additional points of
      damage. If the quill has been embedded for more than 10 rounds, a DC 10
      Strength check is required to remove the quill. For every minute after
      that, the DC to remove a lodged quill increases by 1. An unarmed or melee
      touch attack against a dire porcupine causes 1d4 quills to break off and
      lodge in the attacker.

DuringCombat: >-
  If controlled by Marigana, the zombies have orders to fight defensively and
  guard her. If not, they shamble toward the PCs to attack them.
