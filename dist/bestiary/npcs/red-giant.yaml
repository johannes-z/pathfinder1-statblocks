    description: >-
      Once per day, a red giant can form a volume of sand within 40 feet into
      the shape of a 20-foot-long arm that ends in a clenched fist. The arm has
      a space of 10 feet and a reach of 20 feet. The arm and fist cannot move
      from the location where it was created. The arm and fist have AC 20 and hp
      65. It can attack once per round and has an attack bonus equal to the
      giant's base attack bonus (+15), +10 for the arm's Strength score (30),
      and -1 for being large; thus the typical red giant can create an arm/fist
      with an attack bonus of +24. The fist deals 1d8+10 points of damage on
      each attack, and any creature struck must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude
      save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based. The arm
      remains for a number of rounds equal to the red giant's Hit Dice (17
      rounds for a typical red giant). A red giant does not need to concentrate
      to maintain the arm and can direct it to attack a new target as a free
      action. The arm loses shape if it is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, the
      duration expires, or the red giant dies.
DuringCombat: >-
  The red giant bides his time. He first uses his shape earth ability and drops
  the sand arm in the midst of the rust girallons' exude dust clouds. Then he
  waits for the PCs to exit the cloud and attacks anyone who does. The red giant
  is not immune to the exude dust ability like the rust girallons are.
Morale: >-
  The red giant knows Adril will slay him should he disobey him&#8211;so he
  fights to the death.
