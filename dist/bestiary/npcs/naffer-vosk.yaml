    description: >-
      Naffer's disability reduces his speed by 10 feet and imposes a -4 penalty
      on Initiative checks. A regeneration spell is required to remove these
      penalties. Securing a regeneration spell for Naffer earns the PCs an XP
      award as if they overcame an encounter that has a CR equal to their
      average party level.
