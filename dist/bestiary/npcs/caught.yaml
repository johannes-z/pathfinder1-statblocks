    description: >-
      Caught once bet a djinni that the kitsune could tell a joke so exquisite
      that it would make a will-o'-wisp weep with mirth. The djinni granted
      Caught a single wish after the deed, and the bard asked to be even more
      dashingly handsome, resulting in a permanent +1 inherent bonus to his
      Charisma score.
