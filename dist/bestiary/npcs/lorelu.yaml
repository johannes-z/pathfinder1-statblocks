SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Consume Life (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, Lorelu can make a touch attack
      to reach into a creature's head and absorb portions of that creature's
      vitality, dealing 1d3 points of ability damage to a randomly determined
      physical ability score (roll a d6: 1-2 = Strength, 3&#8211;4 = Dexterity,
      5&#8211;6 = Constitution) and causing the creature to become staggered for
      1 round. Lorelu gains 5 temporary hit points each time she uses this
      ability; these temporary hit points last for a maximum of 1 hour but do
      not stack. A successful DC 17 Fortitude save reduces the ability damage to
      1 point and negates the staggered effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      Lorelu's mortal remains must be exposed to the light of the rising sun in
      order to bring peace to her restless spirit.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Lorelu uses her ability to consume life as often as she can, taking advantage
  of the rounds in between to set up combat positioning so that in following
  rounds she can use Improved Feint to add her sneak attack damage to her
  corrupting touch (note that even then, a creature can attempt a DC 17
  Fortitude save to reduce this 10d6 points of damage by half).
Morale: >-
  Lorelu fights until destroyed, but cannot pursue foes out of area C11. If foes
  attempt to attack her from outside the room, she simply retreats into a wall
  or floor to await an opportunity to attack once again.
