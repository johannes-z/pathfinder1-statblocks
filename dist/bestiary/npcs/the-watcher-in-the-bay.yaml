IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Always Watching (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Watcher in the Bay has extraordinary vision, granting it a +20 bonus
      on Perception checks and the effects of true seeing at all times. This
      effect cannot be dispelled or suppressed. The Watcher can see into and out
      of water with perfect ease, and its vision is never impaired by water. It
      can see underwater as far as it can see on land, regardless of the water's
      level of obscurity. Water never provides cover from the Watcher in the
      Bay. As a free action, the Watcher can shift its vision to view the world
      through the eyes of any mutant created by its transformation ability,
      provided the mutant is within 10 miles of the Watcher. The Watcher in the
      Bay can determine the location of all mutants it has created within this
      10-mile radius as if via status.
  - name: Insanity (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature that attempts to interact directly with the Watcher in the
      Bay's thoughts (such as via detect thoughts or telepathy) must succeed at
      a DC 33 Will save or be driven permanently insane (as per insanity, or the
      insanity rules on page 250 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide, in
      which case this save DC is also the starting DC for the save to recover
      from the insanity). When the Watcher uses its telepathy to communicate
      with creatures, this ability doesn't activate unless the watcher focuses
      its mind on one opponent as a standard action. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Otherworldly Insight (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Watcher gains a +10 insight bonus on initiative checks and to its AC
      and CMD.
  - name: Powerful Tentacles (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Watcher's tentacles are a primary attack, and the Watcher adds 1-1/2
      times its Strength bonus to damage rolls with the tentacles.
  - name: Swallow Whole (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature swallowed by the Watcher suffers Charisma drain. Each round the
      Watcher inflicts Charisma drain in this manner, it regains 5 hit points
      per point of Charisma drained. A creature drained to 0 Charisma is
      transformed (see Transformation).
  - name: Transformation (Su)
    description: >-
      When a swallowed creature is drained to 0 Charisma by the Watcher, it
      instantly transforms into a hideous, warped mockery of its previous form.
      The swallowed creature gains the mutant template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary
      5 180), and its alignment becomes chaotic evil. When a creature gains the
      template, all Charisma drain inflicted on the creature by the Watcher's
      swallow whole attack is healed. The Watcher can regurgitate a transformed
      mutant as an immediate action. A mutant created in this manner is
      free-willed, but regards the Watcher as its mother and obeys the Watcher's
      commands without question when they are given. These mutants are immune to
      the Watcher's unspeakable presence.
  - name: Unspeakable Presence (Su)
    description: >-
      The Watcher in the Bay emanates an aura that inflicts intense mental
      anguish and torment on all creatures within 300 feet that can see and hear
      the Watcher. Any subjected creature must succeed at a DC 33 Will save or
      become staggered by this anguish for 1 round. A creature that successfully
      saves against the Watcher's unspeakable presence in 2 consecutive rounds
      is immune to the Watcher's unspeakable presence for 24 hours. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
