    description: >-
      Because of their high intelligence, angazhani are proficient with light
      and medium armors, simple weapons, and one martial weapon of choice.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Olujimi starts combat by throwing his nonmagical throwing axes at different
  targets, then roars in to attack other foes with his magic axe and claws. If
  he drops a foe to negative hit points, his bloodlust gets the better of him
  and he abandons both shield and weapon to fight the rest of the battle with
  his claws, eager to finish the fight with some rending ruin. He saves fear and
  dominate monster to use against any spellcasters who seem to be particularly
  troublesome or against foes he can't engage in melee. If he dominates a foe,
  he orders that foe to cast aside his weapons, drop to his knees, and pay
  homage to him.
Morale: >-
  Olujimi uses dimension door to escape if brought below 40 hit points, seeking
  out Akkituk and ordering her to use stone salve on the statue of the ape
  demon. He attempts to use dominate monster on the ape demon to send it against
  the PCs, but if that fails, he tries to lure the monster back so that the PCs
  need to fight it anyway. When he reenters combat with the PCs, Olujimi fights
  to the death.
Gear: >-
  +1 light wooden shield, +1 throwing axe, masterwork throwing axes (7), bracers
  of armor +2, leather axe harness
