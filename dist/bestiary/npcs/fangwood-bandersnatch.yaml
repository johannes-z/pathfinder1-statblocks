IsTemplate: '0'
BeforeCombat: >-
  The bandersnatch hides if it hears strangers approach, taking advantage of the
  thick foliage of its den.
DuringCombat: >-
  In dense foliage like that in this den and the forest above, the bandersnatch
  relies on its bounding charge, pounce, and rake abilities to attack quickly,
  then fall back out of sight. In more open terrain (such as the rest of the
  palace) it instead harries prey with its quills.
Morale: >-
  If reduced below 60 hit points, the bandersnatch flees to let its fast healing
  restore its strength. Afterward, it stalks the PCs once again, attacking when
  they seem distracted.
