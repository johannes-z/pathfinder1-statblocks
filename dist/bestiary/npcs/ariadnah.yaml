SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Exceptional Resources (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ariadnah has the wealth of a PC rather than an NPC. This increases her CR
      by 1.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ariadnah casts arcane sight, cloak of dreams, greater false life, and mage
  armor before combat. She also casts true seeing from a scroll. These spell
  effects are included in her statistics block, except for the amount of
  temporary hit points received from greater false life. You must roll to
  determine this.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ariadnah first uses maze on obvious divine spellcasters and then, using
  greater possession, attempts to possess the nearest enemy wearing the least
  amount of armor. If reduced to less than half her total hit points, she
  spontaneously casts harm on herself using one of her 7th- or 8th-level spell
  slots.
Morale: >-
  Ariadnah fights to the death, trusting that the PCs are too preoccupied with
  the threat of Hastur to hunt down her phylactery.
Gear: scroll of true seeing
OtherGear: >-
  +2 quarterstaff, belt of incredible dexterity +6, cloak of resistance +4,
  headband of mental prowess +6 (Int, Cha), ring of freedom of movement, ring of
  protection +5
Land: 1
TemplatesApplied: lich|
BaseStatistics: >-
  Without the effects of the spells cast as listed in Before Combat, Ariadnah's
  statistics are as follows: AC 24, touch 19, flat-footed 20 (+5 deflection, +4
  Dex, +5 natural).
