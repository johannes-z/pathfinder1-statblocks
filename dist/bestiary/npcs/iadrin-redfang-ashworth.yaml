BeforeCombat: Before entering combat, Iadrin casts barkskin, gravity bow, and longstrider.
DuringCombat: >-
  Iadrin prefers to fight with his bow, favoring constructs and aberrations as
  targets whenever they're present. His accuracy allows him to provide effective
  support to melee combatants, and he always uses Deadly Aim on his attacks
  unless he consistently misses. He abandons ranged attacks for melee only when
  necessary, but isn't above putting himself at risk in order to help an ally
  escape from a dangerous situation. One notable tactic Iadrin uses is to fight
  defensively and deliberately provoke attacks of opportunity from foes if
  threatened allies need to stand up from prone, retreat from combat, or
  otherwise take actions that would put them at risk from attacks of
  opportunity.
Morale: >-
  If he's fighting on his own and is reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, Iadrin
  retreats to seek shelter and recover, but he would never abandon an ally or
  fellow citizen of Iadenveigh&#8211;he fights to the death to protect such
  companions as long as they remain threatened.
