  - name: Skullface (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a krenshar can pull the skin back from its face,
      revealing the musculature and bony structures of its skull. This action
      counts as using Intimidate to demoralize an opponent, and is an
      extraordinary ability. The krenshar can emit a loud screech while peeling
      back its skin, causing potent fear in a single creature within 100 feet
      that can see the krenshar. The targeted creature must make a DC 12 Will
      save or become frightened (if the target has 6 or fewer Hit Dice) or
      shaken (if the target has more than 6 Hit Dice) for 1d4 rounds. A creature
      that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same krenshar's
      skullface ability for 24 hours. This ability is a sonic, mind-affecting
      fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
