Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Alasen prefers to wait for the PCs to be engaged in a battle with other
  defenders of the palace, so that she can skulk into place and attack from
  invisibility with pounce. She retreats to invisibility after attacking, then
  repositions for another attack; she does her best to avoid ever being caught
  in melee for more than a few rounds at a time.
Morale: >-
  Alasen's loyalty to Irovetti collapses if she's reduced to fewer than 40 hit
  points, at which point she attempts to flee the palace and Pitax altogether.
