SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Charging Trip (Ex)
    description: >-
      A festrog that hits with its bite after making a charge attack on all
      fours can attempt to trip its opponent (+4 bonus). This trip does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity.
  - name: Diseased Pustules (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a festrog takes damage from a piercing or slashing weapon, some of
      its boils rupture, squirting the attacker with puslike fluids. The noxious
      secretions carry a potent contact disease that causes those infected to
      break out into painful necrotic boils. Necrotic Boils: Disease-contact;
      save Fort DC 13; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con; cure 1
      save.
  - name: Feed (Su)
    description: >-
      Every time a festrog makes a successful bite attack, it feeds on its
      opponent's flesh and gains 5 temporary hit points. The festrog cannot have
      more than 5 temporary hit points gained by this ability at one time.
      Four-Footed
  - name: Run (Ex)
    description: >-
      A festrog can run on all fours at speed of 50 feet if it doesn't hold or
      carry anything in its hands. When running on all fours, it is treated as
      if it had the Run feat.
