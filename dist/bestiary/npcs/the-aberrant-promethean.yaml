SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Moan (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Promethean can emit an infrasonic moan as a standard action, with one
      of two effects. Fear: All creatures in a 30-foot spread must make a DC 14
      Will save or become panicked for 2 rounds. Nausea: All creatures in a
      30-foot cone must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or fall prone and be
      nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. A creature that successfully saves against the
      Promethean's moans cannot be affected by that same moan effect for 24
      hours. Save DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Paralytic Tentacles (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Promethean can transfer a grappled victim to its tentacles as a move
      action. The tentacles grapple with the same strength as its slam attacks
      but deal no damage, instead exuding a paralytic secretion. Anyone held in
      the tentacles must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save each round on the
      creature's turn or be paralyzed for 6 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. While held in the tentacles, paralyzed or not, a
      victim automatically takes 2d4+9 points of damage each round.
  - name: Quickness (Su)
    description: >-
      The Promethean is supernaturally quick. It can take an extra move action
      during its turn each round.
  - name: Strangle (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Aberrant Promethean has an unerring talent for seizing its victims by
      the neck. A creature that is grappled by the Promethean cannot speak or
      cast spells with verbal components.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Promethean attacks the closest moving target, lashing out with its limbs
  and trying to inflict as much damage as possible.
Morale: The Promethean fights until destroyed.
