BeforeCombat: >-
  Garaudhilyx abhors violence and first tries to subdue even the most evil
  opponents without causing injury. If he believes a creature significantly
  threatens innocents&#8211;or if his allies are placed in harm's way&#8211; he
  unleashes his full fury to put an end to the evil. When combat is unavoidable,
  Garaudhilyx employs time stop to raise his defensive and offensive
  capabilities, using quickened spells as necessary to maximize the efficiency
  of his time stop spell.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ever the pacifist, Garaudhilyx accepts any foe's unconditional surrender
  during battle. When the dragon's enemies do not relent, Garaudhilyx often
  injures them terribly and then uses his powerful healing magic to prevent
  their deaths, choosing to imprison them on Valkus Isle instead.
Morale: >-
  Garaudhilyx is steadfast in the face of evil, and only retreats if reduced to
  fewer than a quarter his total hit points. When reduced to half his total hit
  points, he casts time stop and uses the time to heal himself and augment his
  defenses (either restoring dispelled abjurations or changing his tactics based
  on his enemy's arsenal).
