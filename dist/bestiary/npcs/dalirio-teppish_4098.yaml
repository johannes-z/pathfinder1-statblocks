  If the druids in act 5 spent at least one round shouting, Dalirio is aware
  that the PCs are coming.
DuringCombat: >-
  Dalirio lets his heucuvas do most of the fighting, preferring to hit melee PCs
  with cause fear and lesser confusion. If any of the PCs happen to mention that
  Luscilia is dead (whether or not she really is), Dalirio howls in anger and
  charges that PC. Dalirio uses Channel Energy to heal his heucuva servant or
  harm the PCs whenever appropriate.
Morale: Dalirio is a fanatic and fights to the death.
