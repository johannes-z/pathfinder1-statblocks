SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Demanding Challenge (Ex)
    description: >-
      As long as the target of a samurai's challenge is within the threatened
      area of the samurai, it takes a -2 penalty to its AC on attacks made by
      anyone other than the samurai.
  - name: Honorable Stand (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a swift action, a samurai can make an honorable stand to
      continue battling the target of his challenge. While making an honorable
      stand, the samurai is immune to the shaken, frightened, and panicked
      conditions. He does not fall unconscious while his hit point total is
      below 0. Finally, whenever a samurai making an honorable stand must make a
      saving throw, he can spend one daily use of his resolve to reroll the
      saving throw after the first roll is made. He must take the result of the
      second roll, even if it is worse. If a samurai making an honorable stand
      ever retreats from battle against his challenged foe, he loses the ability
      to make a challenge for 24 hours.
