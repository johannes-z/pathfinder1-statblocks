SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Abyssal Torment (Su)
    description: >-
      If a victim takes ability damage from a greater apocalypse locust's
      poison, it suffers wracking pain and takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls,
      skill checks, and ability checks until the damage is healed.
  - name: Accursed Brand (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that fails its saving throw against a greater apocalypse
      locust's breath weapon has his flesh branded by the fire and suffers
      hallucinations for 24 hours. During this time, the victim becomes
      tainted&#8211; good-aligned clerics and all druids, monks, and paladins
      are treated as if they'd temporarily broken their codes of conduct.
      Characters who have a class that's restricted to a good alignment or
      lawful alignment are treated as ex-members of that class for 24 hours.
      Atonement instantly ends this effect.
  - name: Maddening Buzz (Su)
    description: >-
      As long as three or more apocalypse locusts live and churn their wings,
      any creature within a range of 100 feet + 10 feet per apocalypse locust
      must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or become confused (CL equals 14 +
      number of apocalypse locusts present). This is a sonic mind-affecting
      effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sting&#8211;injury; save Fort DC 22; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds;
      effect 1 Con plus Abyssal torment; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Powerful Pincers (Ex)
    description: A greater apocalypse locust's pincers are primary attacks.
DuringCombat: >-
  The greater apocalypse locusts each begin the battle by casting creeping doom
  on their foes. In melee, they coordinate their attacks on paladins first,
  seeking obvious worshipers of good deities if no such targets are apparent. At
  range, they are fond of using telekinesis to disarm foes.
Morale: The greater apocalypse locusts fight to the death.
