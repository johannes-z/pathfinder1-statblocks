BeforeCombat: >-
  Deyrubrujan never enters combat without sizing up her opponent and carefully
  planning her approach. If her fortress is breached, she uses her mirage
  ability to engage intruders in the grand hall.
DuringCombat: >-
  Deyrubrujan prefers to fight out in the open above the hot desert sands,
  swooping down from great heights. She uses a mix of her brute strength,
  spells, and special abilities, depending on the situation.
Morale: >-
  If overwhelmed, Deyrubrujan retreats to her inner sanctum either by using
  dimension door or greater teleport, depending on her distance from her lair.
  If confronted there, she fights to the death.
