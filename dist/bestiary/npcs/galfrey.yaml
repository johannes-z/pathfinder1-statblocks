SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aging Effects (Ex)
    description: >-
      Queen Galfrey is well over 100 years old, but thanks to having imbibed a
      few doses of the sun orchid elixir (The Inner Sea World Guide 301), she
      appears to be in her late twenties. As a result, she takes none of the
      penalties for her advanced age, but still gains the +3 bonus to her
      Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores-these bonuses are already
      incorporated into her statistics.
  - name: Wealthy (Ex)
    description: >-
      Queen Galfrey has the full support of the Mendevian Crusade; as a result,
      she has gear equivalent to a PC. This increases her CR by 1.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Queen Galfrey uses her divine bond to enhance her already powerful sword to
  transform it into a +4 axiomatic holy evil-outsider-bane cold iron longsword.
  When facing foes she knows are particularly deadly, she opts for a more
  defensive version, turning the sword into a +5 defending holy
  evil-outsider-bane cold iron longsword. And against particularly heavily
  armored foes, she turns it into a +2 brilliant energy holy evil-outsider-bane
  cold iron longsword. When she enhances her composite longbow, she prefers to
  simply turn it into a +5 evil-outsider-bane composite longbow. None of these
  augmentations are included in her stats above. She prefers to fight in melee,
  and is swift to use her smites against foes rather than save them up for later
  battles that might or might not occur in a given day. She generally reserves
  at least six of her uses of lay on hands for emergencies, and has no problem
  breaking off a combat to come to the aid of a fallen ally&#8211;although she
  generally prefers using channeled energy to save dying allies, since she can
  affect more targets this way.
Morale: >-
  Galfrey is no coward, but she also knows that her death would devastate
  crusader morale and undermine the entire war effort. As a result, if she
  realizes she's facing a foe she either cannot defeat or that is likely to
  defeat her first, she does her best to escape using her boots of
  teleportation. She's had to abandon allies to terrible fates before as a
  result, and while each one of those unfortunate choices nags at her, she knows
  that as the ruler of Mendev, she cannot sacrifice herself to save one or two
  allies when her continued life can save so many more.
