BeforeCombat: >-
  Odexidie casts mage armor, invisibility, shield, and fly on himself before
  combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Odexidie uses flight and transportation powers to avoid being cornered, and
  battlefield control spells to hinder the PCs' access to him. He prefers to
  capture foes alive if possible.
Morale: >-
  Odexidie offers to parley at 100 hit points or fewer, hoping to turn the
  battle into a productive discussion. If the PCs aren't interested in talking,
  he teleports away to gather resources and returns, fully healed, in 3d10
  minutes with four rust devils (see page 82) and four barbed devils. He
  teleports away each time he's reduced to 30 or fewer hit points, continuing
  this tactic until he's slain or the PCs finally give up and agree to talk (or
  simply flee); he can repeat this tactic up to five times before exhausting his
  rust devil and barbed devil resources, at which point he abandons his offices
  to the PCs.
Gear: ring of spell storing (mark of justice)
OtherGear: >-
  amulet of magecraft, ring of protection +3, spellbook (containing those spells
  he has prepared plus 3d4 spells of each level from 1st to 5th of your
