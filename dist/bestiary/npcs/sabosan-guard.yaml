DuringCombat: >-
  Armed with their heavy crossbows, the sabosan take defensive positions within
  the Sultur Mill Outpost while shooting from afar. If the outpost is
  compromised, they attempt to take to the air and shoot down invaders, but
  resort to their swords or claws in melee when they realize the raging power of
  the mana storm.
Morale: >-
  The sabosan are not prepared to die for their meager positions among
  Gurstweld's army, but they realize that abandoning their clan may be just as
  dire a fate. If reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, the sabosan try to flee
  to Megator Facient to warn Gurstweld of the intruders.
