SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Militant (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shadow giant is proficient in all simple weapons, all martial weapons,
      and one exotic weapon of its choice; Krellan chose the spiked chain.
  - name: Shadow Cloak (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because of her connection with the Plane of Shadow, as a move action in
      any illumination other than direct sunlight, Krellan can cloak herself in
      moving shadows that act as the blur spell for 1d6+6 rounds. She can use
      this ability three times per day.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Krellan uses detect alignment to scan opponents, then casts corruption
  resistance to protect herself from the most likely alignment-based attacks. If
  needed, she casts see invisibility as well.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Krellan pronounces judgment as a swift action
  (likely destruction or justice, though she switches to healing or protection
  as needed), activates her shadow cloak as a move action, then casts flames of
  the faithful on her spiked chain. On the following round, she activates her
  bane ability and attacks, using her spiked chain to trip or disarm foes and
  taking advantage of her Outflank and Shake It Off feats.
Morale: >-
  Krellan's true loyalties lie elsewhere, and she is not willing to lay down her
  life for the Storm Tyrant. If reduced to fewer than 70 hit points, she
  activates her shadow cloak and attempts to flee. If she escapes, she might
  reappear later in the adventure to further harass the PCs.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds
