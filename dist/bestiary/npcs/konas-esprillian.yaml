SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Body (Ex)
    description: >-
      A blood knight can store items within its liquefied form. It can retrieve
      any item stored in its body as a move action or as a free action that is
      part of a move. An item to be stored must be of a size and shape that fits
      within whatever portion of the blood knight's armor it is placed.
  - name: Blood Drinking (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any living creature damaged by a blood knight's slam attack takes 1 point
      of Constitution damage in addition to the normal damage. If the blood
      knight grapples an opponent, it deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage
      each round that the grapple is maintained. The blood knight gains 5
      temporary hit points for 1 hour each round it drains blood.
  - name: Blood Slick (Ex)
    description: >-
      A blood knight constantly drips slippery blood in a 10-foot-radius spread
      around itself. The blood slick functions as a grease spell with a save DC
      of 20. Blood knights are immune to any blood knight's blood slick.
  - name: Bonded Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      A blood knight always wears the armor in which it died. It cannot remove
      this armor or exchange it for another suit. If the armor is destroyed, the
      blood knight is destroyed as well. The blood knight has a +5 bonus on
      saving throws made on behalf of its armor.
  - name: Fountain of Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a blood knight can spray blood from its armor in a
      great cascade. Each creature within a 15-foot radius is covered in blood
      and must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save as though it had ingested the
      blood knight's poisonous blood. The blood fills the area until the blood
      knight's next turn. Creatures entering the spray while it persists are
      subject to its effects, but a creature can be affected only once per
      round. The area covered by the blood spray becomes coated as though by a
      blood slick and remains slippery for 6 rounds, or until the blood is
      washed away with at least 5 gallons of water or other liquid, or burned
      away with normal or magical fire as a full-round action. Creatures and
      objects within the area that do not have total cover are coated with the
      blood, which functions as a grease spell for the purpose of using and
      handling items (DC 20 Reflex save negates). Failure means the item is
      immediately dropped. A creature coated in blood gains a +10 bonus on
      Escape Artist checks. Once the blood knight has used its fountain of blood
      attack, it must wait 1d4 rounds before it can do so again. Blood knights
      are immune to any blood knight's fountain of blood.
  - name: Poison Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      Fountain of blood-contact or ingested; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round
      for 6 rounds; initial effect 1 Con damage; secondary effect nauseated for
      1 minute; cure 2 consecutive saves.

  of blood ability to produce a blood slick to poison and knock down opponents,

  his Disruptive feat and to eliminate any clerics before they can channel
  positive energy to harm him.
Morale: The blood knight fights until destroyed.
