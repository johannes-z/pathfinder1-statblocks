BeforeCombat: >-
  If he has time before combat starts, Mol Kor casts bull's strength and spell
  immunity ( fireball and magic missile), and activates his touch of glory
  domain power.
DuringCombat: >-
  The cleric begins battle trying to intimidate the most powerful-looking
  opponent. He then alternates between using spells to weaken magically enhanced
  foes and charging into battle with his greatsword. Mol Kor channels positive
  energy to heal his allies as needed, and doesn't shy away from including the
  PCs in such bursts, as he looks forward to a prolonged battle for the glory of
  his god.
