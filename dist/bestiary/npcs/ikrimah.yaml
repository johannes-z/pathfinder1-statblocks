BeforeCombat: >-
  Ikrimah casts false life, greater magic weapon (unarmed strike), mage armor,
  overland flight, and protection from arrows on himself at the start of each
  day. When an alarm spell triggers, Ikrimah casts spells on himself in this
  order: protection from energy (fire), resist energy (electricity), heroism,
  stoneskin, blur, alter self, mirror image, owl's wisdom, expeditious retreat,
  protection from good, shield, displacement, haste, and transformation. (All
  are included in his statistics.)
DuringCombat: >-
  Ikrimah uses smokesticks to cloud the area as he engages the PCs, using his
  Blind-Fight feat to gain a tactical edge. He stays in the air to prevent the
  PCs from surrounding him and attacks enemy spellcasters first.
Morale: >-
  Ikrimah's contingency spell triggers if he drops below 30 hit points, turning
  him invisible. However, Ikrimah can't cast spells while under the effects of a
  transformation spell, so he might need to lurk invisibly until it expires
  before casting dimension door to retreat to the fighting arena (B12).

  potion of bear's endurance, potions of bull's strength (2), potions of cat's
  grace (2), potions of cure moderate wounds (2), scroll of greater dispel
