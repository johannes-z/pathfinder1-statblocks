SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Divine Separation (Su)
    description: >-
      The herald has been separated from Lissala for thousands of years, and
      doesn't know where her master is. The loss of her connection to the
      goddess severely weakens the herald, and she gains 1 negative level per
      day, up to a maximum of 16 negative levels. These negative levels cannot
      be suppressed or removed in any way (including restoration spells), except
      by using her feed ability. (Refer to weakness, below, for her current
      negative levels.) If Lissala returns and the herald regains her connection
      to her master, she permanently loses this weakness and its associated
      negative levels.
  - name: Feed (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, the herald can devour an outsider's corpse as a full-round
      action. For each Hit Die of the devoured outsider, the herald
      automatically removes 1 negative level gained from her divine separation
      ability. The consumed outsider must have at least 8 Hit Dice.
  - name: Intelligence Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      The herald deals 1d4-1 (minimum 0) points of Intelligence damage and
      drains 1 point of Intelligence each time she hits with her slam attack.
      (The herald does not heal any damage when she uses her Intelligence
      drain.)
  - name: Power Surge (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a swift action, the herald can increase the DC of
      her next spell-like ability cast that round by 2. Spell-Like
  - name: Crafting (Su)
    description: >-
      The herald may use any of her spell-like abilities when crafting magic
      items as if they were actual spells.
  - name: Weakness (Su)
    description: >-
      Kurshu is experiencing even worse symptoms from not feeding due to her
      proximity to Krune's rune foci, which draw power directly from outsiders.
      As a result, Kurshu is emaciated, has shed a number of scales, and has
      lost some of her magical talents. In addition to her penalties for having
      5 negative levels, her natural armor bonus is 6 lower than normal, her
      maximum hit point total is 50 lower, her damage reduction is reduced by 5
      points, her energy resistances are 10 points lower, and her spell
      resistance is 5 points lower. These penalties disappear 1 hour after
      Kurshu removes all of her negative levels from her divine separation
      ability.
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Kurshu believes that she is hidden when intruders arrive, she casts
  displacement in anticipation of trouble. She has already used 2 of her limited
  wishes for the day, and the effects of her 5 negative levels from her divine
  separation weakness and not feeding are already factored into her stats.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kurshu uses ranged spells to harm intruders, favoring any outsiders with her
  attacks. If an outsider dies, Kurshu eagerly feeds on its corpse to regain her
  lost strength. Otherwise she is flexible in her tactics and uses her mobility,
  spells, and abilities to best effect.
Morale: Kurshu begrudgingly fights to the death.
