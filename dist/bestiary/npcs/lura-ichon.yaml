BeforeCombat: >-
  If Ichon knows the PCs are coming, her spotters in the street outside have
  message cast on them and warn her when the PCs approach. At this point, she
  casts magic fang (twice, once on each hand for two enhanced slam attacks) and
  mage armor on Bellu (these spells are already figured into her stats) and
  palms her potion of invisibility, drinking it as soon as the PCs start to
  cause trouble.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once the fight begins, Ichon consumes her potion of invisibility, leaving the
  bulk of the combat to Bellu. She spends combat casting guidance on Bellu. When
  her potion wears off or the PCs otherwise locate her, she targets their
  weapons with grease and only fights with her morningstar if there is no other
  option.
Morale: >-
  Born and bred on the mean streets of Bloodcove, Lura Ichon would sooner die
  that publicly show weakness.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds, potion of invisibility
