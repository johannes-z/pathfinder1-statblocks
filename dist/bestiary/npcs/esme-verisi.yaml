BeforeCombat: If she hears the sounds of combat, Esme casts mage armor from her scroll.
DuringCombat: >-
  Esme commands her skeletal handmaidens to attack, then casts color spray,
  trying to catch as many opponents as possible in the spell's effect. She casts
  cause fear on anyone attacking her from a distance (such as another
  spellcaster) and uses her scroll of ghoul touch against any foe who gets past
  her handmaidens. Esme uses her spells as long as possible but if forced into
  melee combat, she screams curses at her attackers, swinging wildly with her
  dagger and fists.
Morale: >-
  Esme fears death, or at least destruction, and begs for her (un)life if
  reduced to 11 hit points or fewer.
