DuringCombat: >-
  Ryssina casts invisibility on the first round of combat and then follows that
  up on the next few rounds with shield and mirror image. She breaks her
  invisibility by casting lightning bolt if she can line up at least three
  targets. Otherwise, she targets an armored or tough-looking foe with charm
  monster, ordering anyone who falls victim to this tactic to stand back and not
  take part in the fight. She prefers to stay mobile and use her damaging spells
  for the remainder of the combat, favoring bites for attacks of opportunity as
  the chance arises.
Morale: >-
  Ryssina saves one 2nd-level spell for emergencies, so she can cast
  invisibility on herself to escape if brought below 20 hit points. If she
  flees, she may well return to the library later, in which case she likely
  brings a few charmed monsters along to serve as guardians on the off chance
  that her foes, the PCs, return to the library.
