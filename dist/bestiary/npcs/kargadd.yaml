SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sunlight Petrification (Ex)
    description: >-
      A rock troll exposed to natural sunlight is staggered and must make a DC
      20 Fortitude save each round to resist permanently turning to stone. A
      stone to flesh spell (or similar effect) restores a petrified rock troll,
      but if it remains exposed to sunlight it must immediately start making new
      Fortitude saves to avoid petrification. Spells like sunray or sunburst
      that create powerful natural sunlight cannot petrify a rock troll, but
      they do become staggered for 1d4 rounds after being exposed to such an
      effect.
DuringCombat: Kargadd has no grasp of tactics; he flails at and rends the nearest foe.
Morale: >-
  Kargadd relies on his fast healing to keep him in the fight and it is utterly
  surprised if he is slain.
