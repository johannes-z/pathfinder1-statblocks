  - name: Invisible in Shadows (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a ghost-faced orc stands still or moves slowly (no more than 5 feet
      per round) in shadowy illumination or complete darkness, it becomes
      effectively invisible to all natural and extraordinary sight, including
      darkvision and other sight-based senses. A ghost-faced orc invisible in
      shadows can still be detected by hearing and smell. A true seeing spell
      (or other similar magic) reveals its location as well.
