    description: >-
      When the mutant dire bear fails a Reflex save, for 1 round it can't take
      attacks of opportunity or immediate actions and loses its Dexterity bonus
      to AC, Dexerity-based ability checks, and Dexterity skill checks.
DuringCombat: >-
  The mutant bear is a straightforward combatant and attempts to maul the
  closest enemy to death before moving on to the next. If a PC takes an action
  that triggers its spasm deformity, it attacks that PC instead.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, the mutant bear attempts to flee the
  cathedral, squeezing through any doors the PCs left open and attempting to
  batter down any closed doors.
