BeforeCombat: >-
  If Ilarris knows a fight is imminent, she casts bear's endurance, shield, and
  mirror image on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  If forced to fight, Ilarris attacks a flat-footed foe on the first round of
  combat&#8211;if none of her opponents are flat-footed, she casts glitterdust
  to try to blind foes. She focuses her attacks on blind foes thereafter, so she
  can gain sneak attack damage. If she doesn't have allies in the fight, she
  uses Improved Feint to maximize sneak attacks, or stays mobile and uses her
  wand of lightning bolts to minimize full attacks against her.
Morale: >-
  Ilarris is vindictive but canny. If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, she
  flees by using her rift boots or casting vanish. She's hot-tempered and
  harbors grudges, so if she does escape, she immediately begins planning
  revenge.
Gear: wand of lightning bolt (20 charges)
