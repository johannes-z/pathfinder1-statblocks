BeforeCombat: >-
  Khonnir casts fly, mage armor, and resist energy (fire) before a fight, but
  these effects are not calculated into his stats above, since when he's first
  encountered in this adventure, he has no spells prepared.
DuringCombat: >-
  Khonnir prefers to avoid combat if possible, since once a fight starts, his
  tactics tend to be somewhat explosive and incendiary, and he prefers to
  minimize collateral damage if possible. Once combat becomes unavoidable,
  though, he begins battle by casting web to slow foes down, following that up
  with a fireball. He uses his bombs on following rounds, enhancing them to be
  spellblast bombs. He uses his wand of magic missile in situations where he
  needs to be more exact in the targeting of attacks. He seeks cover and drinks
  a potion of cure light wounds whenever he's reduced to 10 or fewer hit points.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 10 hit points and he's exhausted his healing
  supplies, Khonnir flees so he can re-examine an opponent or challenge rather
  than risk his life with depleted resources.
