  The goblin shaman stays in the back and tries to hit the PCs with sleep, then
  relies on her light crossbow. Should the PCs get close to her, she casts
  burning hands on the next round, trying to get as many PCs possible
  (unconcerned about hitting other goblins). She then tries to hit one PC each
  round thereafter with touch of fatigue.
Morale: The goblin shaman fights to the death.
