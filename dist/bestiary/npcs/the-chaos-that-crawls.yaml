SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Eye Rays (Su)
    description: >-
      A retriever's eyes can produce four different magical rays, each with a
      range of 100 feet. Each round, it can fire one ray as a free action. A
      particular ray is usable only once every 4 rounds. A retriever can fire an
      eye ray in the same round that it makes physical attacks-firing an eye ray
      does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The save DC for eye rays is 21,
      the save DC is Constitution-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. The eye
      ray effects are the following. &#8226; Fire: Deals 12d6 fire damage
      (Reflex half). &#8226; Cold: Deals 12d6 cold damage (Reflex half ).
      &#8226; Electricity: Deals 12d6 electricity damage (Reflex half ). &#8226;
      Petrification: Target must succeed on a Fortitude save or turn to stone
      permanently.
  - name: Relentless (Su)
    description: >-
      A retriever is constantly under the effects of spider climb and water
      walk; these abilities cannot be dispelled.
