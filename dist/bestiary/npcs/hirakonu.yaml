    description: >-
      Hirakonu is possessed by the spirit Tobun Rei, and while the spirit cannot
      control the oni's actions, it has spent a century whispering in his ear
      and slowly influencing his personality. While possessed by this spirit,
      Hirakonu can spend 5 minutes listening to the grief-stricken father's
      whispers to gain a +2 insight bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks
      regarding children for 24 hours.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Hirakonu prefers to learn about potential enemies before fighting them, either
  changing shape to converse with them as a fellow traveler or becoming
  invisible to study them from afar.
DuringCombat: >-
  Hirakonu relies heavily on his flight and increased mobility in combat. He
  casts shield before battle, and uses invisibility or darkness to disorient
  foes. While his hands tremble should he threaten innocents, he has no qualms
  about killing in combat.
Morale: >-
  A fugitive and survivor, Hirakonu flees when a battle turns against him, using
  gaseous form or invisibility to escape and wait for his regeneration to close
  his wounds.
