SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Pawn of Unity (Ex)
    description: >-
      When Ophelia became Unity's pawn, the AI performed invasive and
      experimental surgical procedures on the gargoyle that increased her
      Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma by 4 each. Unity can communicate with
      her telepathically and issue orders at will as if via a demand
      spell-Ophelia cannot save against this effect. A successful DC 20 Sense
      Motive check is enough to let someone know that Ophelia is being
      controlled by an external force, but this control can't be disrupted as
      long as Unity survives.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ophelia casts magic vestment on her armor and greater magic weapon on her rail
  gun.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ophelia casts quickened shield of faith on the first round of combat (this
  bonus is included in her stats above), and then quickened freedom of movement,
  quickened irradiate, silence, and hold person on the following rounds. When
  multiple the PCs are in a line, she'll fire on them with her rail gun;
  otherwise, she uses offensive spells against them. As Unity's favored minion,
  she doesn't need to attempt caster level checks to successfully cast fire
  spells within the Divinity Drive's influence. She uses her quickened healing
  magic on herself during any round where she has fewer than 150 hit points,
  saving heal for emergencies. She prefers to hold off on casting miracle unless
  she needs a specific spell she hasn't prepared, but if reduced to fewer than
  100 hit points, she attempts to cast miracle to not only restore herself to
  full hit points but to restore all destroyed evaluator robots to full
  functionality at her side.
Morale: Ophelia fights to the death.
