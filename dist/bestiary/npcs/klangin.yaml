SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fungal Sight (Ex)
    description: >-
      The long exposure to cytillesh and the chemical admixtures Klangin has
      been subjected to have destroyed her eyes and replaced them with glowing
      fungal growths. Her normal vision has been replaced with blindsight and an
      ability to see the taint of cytillesh or absence of it in other creatures.
      Both abilities have a range of 60 feet.
  - name: Vomit (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action every 1d3 rounds, Klangin may spew noxious
      fungus-filled vomit from her mouth to a distance of 10 feet at a single
      target. This is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity. A creature struck by the vomit must succeed at a DC 17 Fort
      save or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. With a successful save, the
      creature is sickened instead for the same amount of time. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
