SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Scroll Blade (Su)
    description: >-
      Cathixia can wield any paper, parchment, or cloth scroll as if it were a
      melee weapon, treating it as a short sword with an enhancement bonus equal
      to 1/2 the level of the highest-level wizard spell on the scroll; a scroll
      with only a cantrip or 1st-level spell on it counts as a masterwork short
      sword. She is proficient with this weapon, and feats and abilities that
      affect short swords apply to this weapon. She cannot wield two scroll
      blades at the same time. Activating this ability is a free action. A
      scroll blade only retains its abilities in the hands of the scrollmaster.
      The scroll blade has hardness 0 and hit points equal to the highest-level
      wizard spell on the scroll. Each successful hit by the scroll blade
      reduces its hit points by 1; this damage cannot be repaired, but does not
      affect casting from the scroll. When its hit points reach 0, the scroll is
      destroyed.
  - name: Scroll Shield (Su)
    description: >-
      Cathixia can wield any paper, parchment, or cloth scroll as if it were a
      light wooden shield. In her hands, the scroll grants a +1 shield bonus
      with an enhancement bonus equal to 1/2 the level of the highest-level
      wizard scroll on the scroll; a scroll with only a cantrip or 1st-level
      spell counts as a masterwork light shield. The scroll has no armor check
      penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or maximum Dexterity bonus. The
      scrollmaster is considered proficient with this scroll shield, and can use
      a scroll blade in one hand and a scroll shield in the other. Activating
      this ability is a free action. A scroll shield only retains its abilities
      in the hands of the scrollmaster. The scroll shield has hardness 0 and hit
      points equal to the highest-level wizard spell on the scroll. Each
      successful attack roll against the wizard reduces the scroll shield's hit
      points by 1; this damage cannot be repaired, but does not affect casting
      from the scroll. When its hit points reach 0, the scroll is destroyed.
Gender: Female
ProhibitedSchools: abjuration, illusion
BeforeCombat: >-
  Cathixia has placed her physical enhancement bonus in Constitution. Once she
  becomes aware of the PCs, Cathixia casts mage armor and draws   her scrolls,
  preparing to enter combat. These effects are already included in her
  statistics.
DuringCombat: >-
  Cathixia hopes the PCs will underestimate her combat ability, and readies for
  someone to approach her. Otherwise, she acts defensively, letting Neevindi
  protect her. Cathixia uses her 2nd-level scrolls first as both her scroll
  blade and scroll shield (her AC and melee entries above assume she is using
  these scrolls). When either is destroyed, she switches to a 1st-level spell in
  its place. She doesn't use her scroll of tongues for either ability, however,
  valuing it as her most expensive resource.
Morale: Cathixia fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  scroll of bear's endurance, scroll of cause fear, scroll of charm person,
  scroll of false life, scrolls of identify (2), scroll of tongues
OtherGear: >-
  spellbook (contains all cantrips and all prepared 1st-level spells, as well as
  burning hands, charm person, and feather fall), spell component pouch, silver
  Aspis Consortium badge, 5 gp
