BeforeCombat: >-
  In the round before the start of the battle, two brawlers use martial
  flexibility to gain the benefits of Power Attack, while the remaining two use
  martial flexibility to gain the benefits of Improved Grapple.
DuringCombat: >-
  In the first round, the two wayang brawlers with Power Attack move to flank
  the most armored PC. The remaining two attempt to grapple other PCs,
  preferring obvious spellcasters or those with large weapons. If the brawlers
  have trouble hitting, they use martial flexibility to gain the benefits of
  Weapon Focus (unarmed strike), and proceed to make lethal unarmed attacks.
Morale: >-
  While under the charm person effect, the wayang brawlers do not surrender. If
  the enchantment is somehow removed, the affected brawler immediately stops
  fighting.
