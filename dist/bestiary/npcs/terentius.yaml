DuringCombat: >-
  Terentius begins combat by casting resilient sphere around himself, inside
  which he casts shield, displacement, and greater invisibility, then casts
  summon monster VI to conjure a shadow demon. The following round, he dismisses
  the sphere, releasing the shadow demon to attack. Terentius uses his most
  powerful damaging spells each round thereafter, beginning with mage's sword,
  and he employs his metamagic rod as appropriate.
Morale: >-
  Terentius is crazed and desperate to escape Belzeragna. If he must die to do
  so, then so be it.
