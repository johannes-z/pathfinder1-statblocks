DuringCombat: >-
  The mountain roper lashes out at the closest foes, but isn't unintelligent. It
  knows to focus its first attacks on heavily armored foes.
Morale: >-
  The mountain roper is usually hungry, but it's not foolish&#8211;it won't
  fight to the death if it can help it. If reduced to fewer than 50 hit points,
  the monster attempts to break off combat and bargain for its life. If the PCs
  can communicate and agree to parley, the mountain roper becomes an unlikely
  source of information&#8211;it knows much about the region, and you can use it
  to guide the PCs toward creatures that possess Sihedron rings or otherwise
  encourage them along whatever track of exploration you wish.
