BeforeCombat: >-
  Lyone casts mage armor and false life daily, both of which are already
  reflected in his statistics. Before engaging in combat, he casts keen edge,
  cat's grace, mirror image, and shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Lyone hangs back and attempts to finish casting his preparatory spells while
  his underlings fight. Once he feels sufficiently prepared or is engaged in
  melee, he fights with his falcata, always using Power Attack and Arcane
  Strike. If adjacent to multiple opponents he uses Cleave rather than iterative
  attacks. After losing 20 hit points, he casts vampiric touch to heal himself.
  When reduced to one-third of his total hit points, he casts blink and
  continues fighting.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 10 hit points or less, he casts vanish to turn invisible for 6
  rounds and attempts to flee, but is extremely willing to surrender given the
  opportunity.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds
