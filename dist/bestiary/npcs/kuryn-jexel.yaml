BeforeCombat: >-
  As Kuryn and his acolytes approach the town and set their sights on the PCs,
  he casts eagle's splendor, prayer, shield of faith, and bless, in that order.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kuryn initiates combat by casting consecrate and follows up by channeling
  energy to harm undead. The following round, he casts searing light at the PC
  he judges to be the largest threat (note that this does not affect the PCs as
  if they were undead). From then on, he alternates channeling energy to harm
  the PCs and to heal his acolytes.
Morale: >-
  If convinced the PCs are not truly the undead they appear to be, Kuryn calls
  off the attack. Otherwise, he fights to the death, fully willing to make the
  ultimate sacrifice for the Lady of Graves.
Gear: >-
  masterwork heavy mace, +1 full plate, masterwork heavy steel shield, hat of
  disguise
