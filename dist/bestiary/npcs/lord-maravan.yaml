DuringCombat: >-
  During the first round of combat, Maravan  uses his arcane pool to make his
  rapier a +1 keen rapier, and casts shield. (The modifiers for this are
  included in his stat block.) If there are already foes in melee range, he does
  this using spell combat and makes a melee attack. As soon as possible
  afterward he casts blur. He uses spell strike to deliver his ray spells (with
  the close range magus arcana), using scorching ray on the toughest looking foe
  in melee, and ray of enfeeblement on the melee foe doing the most damage. He
  uses true strike on a heavily armored foe he has already missed, then shocking
  grasp. When out of other spells he uses spell strike with acid splash to get
  two melee attacks a round (one with the extra acid splash damage).
