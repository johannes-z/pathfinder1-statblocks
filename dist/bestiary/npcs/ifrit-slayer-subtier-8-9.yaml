  Hearing the combat outside the gates of Fury's hold, the ifrits have their
  weapons out and ready for combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Both of the ifrit slayers attempt to study the same target using their studied
  target slayer class ability and then flank them, taking advantage of their
  outflank feat sneak attack class ability. If the PCs connecting are connecting
  their attacks with ease, they wish for obscuring mist and use combat expertise
  to increase their AC.
Morale: Both ifrit slayers fight to the death.
