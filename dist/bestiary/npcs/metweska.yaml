BeforeCombat: >-
  Metweska activates both of her chainsaws before combat if she can&#8211;doing
  so may well alert the PCs to her presence in area D8 before they arrive.
DuringCombat: >-
  Metweska prefers to take full-attack actions with her chainsaws if possible,
  and closes to melee with foes as quickly as she can, trying to corner them so
  that any attempt to back off provokes attacks of opportunity. She focuses her
  attacks on lightly armored foes, knowing that it's best to take out a party's
  healer or magical support as soon as possible.
Morale: >-
  Metweska is loyal to Deacon Hope, but not a fanatic. If reduced to fewer than
  40 hit points, she attempts to flee to the command deck; she knows of Ophelia,
  and if service to Deacon Hope becomes too perilous, she shifts her loyalty to
  the gargoyle. If you wish, you can have the PCs encounter her again on the
  command deck, at which point Metweska flees again if reduced to fewer than 40
  hit points. Whether she flees to Silver Mount to serve another powerful minion
  there or departs for points beyond is left to you.
Gear: inferno grenades (4)

  +3 full plate, +1 chainsaw, +1 shock chainsaw, daggers (6), belt of mighty
  constitution +4
