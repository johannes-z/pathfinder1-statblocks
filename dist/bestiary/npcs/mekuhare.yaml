SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Enciphered Mind (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature attempting to contact Mekuhare's mind or read his thoughts
      with a divination spell or similar ability must succeed at a DC 27 Will
      save or be overwhelmed by the chaos and vast scope of the knowledge
      within. Those who fail are affected by feeblemind. Mekuhare can suppress
      this ability at will as a free action. This is a mind-affecting effect,
      and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Enigma (Su)
    description: >-
      Mekuhare has removed himself from the mundane world to contemplate the
      mysteries of the universe-and beyond. To facilitate this, he possesses an
      uncanny ability to elude detection and discovery by those that could
      possibly interrupt his meditations. Any creature (other than another
      sphinx), that leaves line of sight of Mekuhare for more than 1 hour must
      succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be unable to recall details of the
      encounter, as if the sphinx had cast modify memory to eliminate all
      recollection of itself. The exact details of this memory loss are decided
      by Mekuhare subconsciously during the encounter, and he may eliminate up
      to an hour of memories. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect and the
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Litany of Riddles (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Mekuhare can telepathically project a befuddling
      series of riddles, puzzles, and paradoxes at all creatures in a 60-foot
      cone. Creatures caught in this effect must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or
      be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that succeed on their saving throw
      glean snippets of lore from this brush with the sphinx's mind, granting
      them a +5 insight bonus on all Knowledge checks for 1 hour and the ability
      to attempt Knowledge checks with a DC higher than 10 untrained. Once a
      creature successfully saves against this ability, it can't be affected by
      Mekuhare's litany of riddles for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect
      and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Roar (Su)
    description: >-
      Mekuhare can roar up to three times per day as a standard action. Each
      successive roar has a different effect, depending upon whether it is the
      first, second, or third of the sphinx's roars for that day. Each of these
      roars is a sonic effect that fills a 60-foot-radius burst, centered on
      Mekuhare; the save DCs are Charisma-based. Sphinxes are immune to all of
      the effects of Mekuhare's roars. First Roar: Affected creatures become
      frightened for 2d6 rounds (DC 27 Will negates). This is a mind-affecting
      fear effect in addition to being a sonic effect. Second Roar: Affected
      creatures are paralyzed with fear and deafened for 1d4 rounds (DC 27 Will
      negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect in addition to being a
      sonic effect. Third Roar: Affected creatures take a 2d4 penalty to
      Strength for 2d4 rounds and take 2d8 points of sonic damage. Creatures
      smaller than the sphinx are knocked prone. A DC 27 Fortitude save negates
      the Strength penalty and being knocked prone. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. Spells Mekuhare casts divine spells as a 13th-level
      cleric. He doesn't gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.
  - name: Sphinx Monolith (Su)
    description: >-
      Mekuhare can enter a state of suspended animation and transform his
      massive body into a stone monument. This transformation takes 1 minute to
      complete, during which Mekuhare is immobile. Once he transforms into his
      monolith form, Mekuhare's body hardens to stone, granting him hardness 30
      and 350 hit points. If his stony body is reduced to 0 hit points, it is
      destroyed and Mekuhare is slain. While transformed, Mekuhare doesn't need
      to breathe, eat, drink, or sleep. He is aware of his surroundings and can
      use astral projection at will when in this form. Anytime Mekuhare's body
      takes damage while he's using astral projection, his astral form
      immediately becomes aware that he is in danger and can, as a free action,
      end the astral projection and begin reverting back to his natural form
      (though the process still takes 1 minute). When Mekuhare ends his
      transformation, he is immediately healed of all hit point damage he may
      have sustained while transformed. Mekuhare can remain in his sphinx
      monolith form indefinitely.
