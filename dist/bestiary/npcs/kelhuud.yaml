    description: >-
      While the two Kelhuuds are physically separate, mentally they are the same
      person. They can communicate with one another telepathically to a range of
      1,000 feet and gain a +3 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting
      effects. If one is subjected to a mind-affecting effect, it affects the
      other automatically. Whenever the two are more than 1,000 feet apart, they
      both become shaken. As a result, the Kelhuuds do not willingly put this
      distance between them.
DuringCombat: >-
  Both Kelhuuds cast barkskin on the first round of combat. They save entangle
  to cover their retreat and slow pursuit if needed. Otherwise the two focus
  their attacks on a single foe at a time, one Kelhuud in melee and one at
  range. If the Kelhuud in melee drops below 40 hit points, they switch
  positions if possible.
Morale: >-
  If either Kelhuud drops below 15 hit points, both flee by leaping into the
  river and swimming for safety on the far shore, hoping to vanish into the
  forest.
