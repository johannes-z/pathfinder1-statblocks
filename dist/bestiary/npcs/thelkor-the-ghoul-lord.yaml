SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Command Undead (Ex)
    description: >-
      Undead lords Command Undead as the feat, even if they do not meet the
      prerequisites for it. Thelkor may only command ghouls and ghasts.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature slain by Thelkor rises in 1d4 minutes as a ghoul (or ghast, if
      it has 4 or more HD). Spawn are under Thelkor's control.
  - name: Desecration Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Thelkor constantly projects an aura in a 20-foot radius that functions as
      a permanent desecrate spell. Undead within the area (including the undead
      lord) gain a +1 profane bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves. In
      addition, all channel checks made in the area suffer a -3 profane penalty.
      Summoned or created undead that appear in the area gain +1 hit points per
      HD.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Ghoul Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 16; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC
      is Charisma-based. A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at
      the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none
      of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of any
      other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like
      a normal ghoul in all respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as
      a ghast.
  - name: Summon Undead (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Thelkor can summon a total number of HD worth of ghouls or
      ghasts equal to his HD x 1-1/2. Thelkor cannot summon an undead creature
      that has more HD than he does.
  - name: Undead Telepathy (Su)
    description: >-
      Thelkor can communicate telepathically with any other undead within 100
      feet, including mindless undead such as zombies and skeletons.
