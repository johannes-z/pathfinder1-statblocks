SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Nightmare Mount (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Lavrenti can summon a nightmare (Bestiary 216) as a
      mount. This nightmare remains until it is slain or Lavrenti dismisses it.
      He can only have one such nightmare in his service at a time.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Lavrenti typically relies on a clever mixture of aggressive melee lance or
  scimitar attacks from atop his charging mount and ranged harassment with his
  revolver, taking full advantage of his gunslinger abilities. He uses his
  targeting ability to disarm foes, followed by utility shots to scoot their
  weapons out of reach before his nightmare mount tramples the disarmed
  opponents. Against opponents behind cover, he uses his dimensional grenades.
  If threatened by one whose name he knows, Lavrenti uses the target's name to
  take full advantage of his death's calling ability.
Morale: >-
  Though unafraid of death, Lavrenti does not wish to face it again so soon, and
  makes use of his mount's flight or plane shift ability to retreat from ambush
  or surprise, returning to meet opponents on his own diabolical terms.
Gear: dimensional grenades (6; see page 60)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 scimitar, +2 Nagant M1895 revolver (see page 65) with 70 metal cartridges,
  mwk lance, belt of incredible dexterity +4, ring of protection +2
