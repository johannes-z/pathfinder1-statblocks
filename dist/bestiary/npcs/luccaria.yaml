BeforeCombat: >-
  Luccaria casts greater magic weapon on her swords and magic vestment on her
  armor. As soon as she hears her cultists in area D9 shouting, she casts air
  walk, bear's endurance, and invisibility on herself. She also casts spell
  immunity, choosing spells she knows the PCs favor.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once combat starts in area D9, and once she is invisible, Luccaria sends her
  two attendant cultists into area D9 as well to join the fight. She follows,
  casting quickened shield of faith and heroism as she enters the room. If the
  opportunity presents itself, she casts blade barrier to block escape routes.
  Once she's visible, Luccaria casts her ranged attack spells. If she's engaged
  in melee she casts quickened divine might before attacking, then channels
  negative energy as a swift action the following round to activate her
  grayflame short sword (which increases the weapon's enhancement bonus by +1
  and deals +1d6 points of damage for 6 rounds). Luccaria casts heal on herself
  if she ever drops below 40 hit points.
Morale: >-
  If dropped below 15 hit points, Luccaria casts mislead and attempts to escape
  to Harrigan's side (in area G3) to inform him of the PCs and to aid him in
  combat. She does not abandon Harrigan as long as he lives, but if he is slain,
  she attempts to flee the Shackles entirely.
Gear: wand of cure serious wounds (14 charges), unholy water (2)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 glamered chain shirt, +1 grayflame* short sword, masterwork short sword,
  headband of inspired wisdom +2, ring of mind shielding, spell component pouch,
  silver unholy symbol of Norgorber worth 25 gp
