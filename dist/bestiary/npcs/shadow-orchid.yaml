SpecialAbilities: []
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Shadow Orchid attempts to parlay with the PCs first to determine their motives
  and gauge whether or not they are threats. As she speaks, she attempts to use
  Bluff to make the PCs think she's a harmless and aged bookshop owner. She
  tries to extend this parlay period for 3 rounds so she can target one of the
  PCs with her death attack ability.
DuringCombat: >-
  When combat erupts, Shadow Orchid attempts to use her death attack if
  possible, though the PCs know she's an assassin and the death effects are
  ineffective. She knows she's weak in combat when not doing sneak attacks, and
  tries to flank with her bodyguards whenever she can.  She moves about the shop
  using her ki points as needed to bolster her AC and speed, and relies on her
  Mobility and Spring Attack feats to get in sneak attacks when her movement
  allows her to hit a PC on the run. If cornered, she uses flurry of blows each
  round combined with stunning fist in the hopes of regaining free range of
  movement.
Morale: >-
  Shadow Orchid believes she is destined to reincarnate as a dragon in her next
  life. Proud and fearless, she fights to the death.
