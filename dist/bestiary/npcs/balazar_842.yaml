SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Life Link (Su)
    description: >-
      Your life and your eidolon's are closely bound. Whenever the eidolon takes
      enough damage to send it back to its home plane, you can, as a free
      action, sacrifice any number of hit points. Each hit point sacrificed in
      this way prevents 1 point of damage done to the eidolon. This can prevent
      the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane. In addition, you and
      the eidolon must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to
      remain at full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than
      1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%.
      Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when the eidolon gets
      closer to you, but its maximum hit point total does return to normal.
  - name: Summon Monster I (Sp)
    description: >-
      You have summon monster I as a spell-like ability. Using this ability is a
      standard action, and the summoned creature remains for 1 minute (instead
      of 1 round). You cannot have more than one summon monster spell active in
      this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing summon
      monster spell immediately ends.
