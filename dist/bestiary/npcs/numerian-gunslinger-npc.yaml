SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Laser Pistol (Ex)
    description: >-
      The gunslinger's laser pistol is a one-handed firearm that shoots a beam
      of highly focused light at its target, dealing 1d8 points of fire damage
      on a successful hit. The gun has a range increment of 50 feet, and its
      attacks resolve against the target's touch AC. Lasers can pass through
      force fields and force effects like a wall of force without damaging that
      field to strike a foe beyond. Objects like glass or other transparent
      barriers do not provide cover from lasers (but unlike force barriers,
      glass still takes damage from a laser strike passing through it).
      Invisible creatures are immune to damage caused by lasers. Fog, smoke, and
      other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks.
      Each shot expends 1 charge of the gun's 10-charge capacity. As a
      semiautomatic weapon, the gun fires one shot per attack. If the gunslinger
      wishes, he can fire an additional shot per round as if using the Rapid
      Shot feat. This additional shot can stack with the additional shot granted
      by Rapid Shot, but when it does so, it increases the penalty for all shots
      fired that round to -6. A laser pistol is worth 10,000 gp and weighs 2
      pounds.
  - name: Numerian Silverdisks (Ex)
    description: >-
      These small, coin-sized discs are etched with circuitry, and contain 10
      charges each. When placed in a special slot in the gunslinger's laser
      pistol, a silverdisk transfers its charge into the gun's internal
      capacitors, effectively reloading the weapon. A silverdisk can be
      recharged (with a 20% chance of being destroyed) with an active generator.
      A charged silverdisk glows with light equivalent to that of a candle. A
      Numerian silverdisk is worth 100 gp as long as it is capable of holding a
      charge; a dead silverdisk is worth 1 gp.
  - name: Rare Resources (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Numerian gunslinger's access to the rare and expensive technology of
      the land's many metal ruins increases his wealth to that of a PC of her
      level. This increases his CR by 1.
