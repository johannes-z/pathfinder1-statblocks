SpecialAbilities:
  - name: False Arcanist (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hidden priest is able to disguise her divine spellcasting as the arcane
      spellcasting of a sorcerer. Solveig must succeed at a Knowledge (arcana)
      check (DC 10 + twice the level of the spell) to disguise the spell she is
      casting as a sorcerer spell and successfully cast the spell. Solveig must
      still use any divine focus components for her spells, but she can use a
      symbol of Milani stitched into the palm of her glove instead of her more
      obvious holy symbol. A successful Spellcraft check identifies Solveig's
      spells as normal, but the result of the check must exceed the DC by 10 or
      more to recognize the spell as divine. Solveig adds half her class level
      (+2) on all Bluff checks to send secret messages about religious matters,
      Sense Motive checks to recognize similar messages, and Perception and
      Sense Motive checks relating to agents of the laws of Irrisen (the White
      Witches, mirror men, the Iron Guard, the Winter Guard, and the like). This
      ability replaces Solveig's 1st-level Liberation domain power.
