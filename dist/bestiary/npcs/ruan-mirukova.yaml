DuringCombat: >-
  Ruan loathes combat, and prefers to avoid fights if possible. He casts sleep
  and illusion spells to end fights before they get out of hand, but if forced
  to fight, he casts mirror image and cat's grace to increase his defenses. He
  prefers to fight with daggers or a rapier if given the choice. In a fight with
  allies, Ruan hangs back and uses his healing spells to keep those allies alive
  so they can defend him.
Morale: Ruan flees any fight if reduced to fewer than 10 hit points.
