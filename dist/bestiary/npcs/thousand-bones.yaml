BeforeCombat: Thousand Bones casts unseen servant every morning.
DuringCombat: >-
  In battle, Thousand Bones relies upon his allies to handle the bloody details
  of combat; he uses his quarterstaff in a fight if forced to do so, but prefers
  to stay back, using spells like hold person and spiritual weapon to attack
  from range. His primary goal in combat, though, is to support and heal his
  allies, rather than to harm enemies. If he can, he avoids violent
  confrontations, relying on diplomacy or spells such as charm person to prevent
  fights from occurring.
Morale: >-
  When even one ally still fights, Thousand Bones will not abandon the battle.
  On his own, the old man flees a fight or surrenders if he believes his foes to
  be honorable and capable of taking prisoners and treating them well.
  Otherwise, he fights to the death, secure in his faith that the spirit world
  will see to his comfort in the afterlife if he is slain by his foes.
