SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Contingency (Sp)
    description: >-
      If Karzoug ever becomes affected by a hostile spell effect that prevents
      him from acting on his own, that spell effect is targeted by a greater
      dispel magic spell.
  - name: Exceptional Stats (Ex)
    description: >-
      Karzoug was destined from birth to become one of the greatest wizards of
      his age. As a result, his ability scores were generated using 25 points,
      rather than using the standard 15 point buy used to create most NPCs.
      Additionally, Karzoug has much more gear than an NPC of his level would
      normally have. These modifications increase his total CR by +2.
  - name: Immortal (Ex)
    description: >-
      Secrets from ancient Thassilon and the realm of Leng have allowed Karzoug
      to sustain his life indefinitely. Unless slain by violent means, he is
      immortal. He gains the +3 bonus to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
      scores for having lived beyond venerable age, yet retains the youth of a
      young man and does not gain the penalties to Strength, Dexterity, or
      Constitution. This immortality also grants Karzoug complete immunity to
      disease and to all forms of madness (including confusion effects and
      feeblemind).
  - name: Inherent Bonuses (Ex)
    description: >-
      Karzoug has used wish spells to increase his stats. He has a +5 inherent
      bonus to his Intelligence, and a +4 inherent bonus to his other five
      ability scores.
  - name: Permanent Spells (Sp)
    description: >-
      Karzoug has made the following spells permanent on himself: arcane sight,
      darkvision, see invisibility, and tongues.
Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: enchantment, illusion
BeforeCombat: Karzoug casts mind blank and false life at the start of every day.
DuringCombat: >-
  Karzoug starts combat seated upon his immense throne, and strives to remain
  out of melee as long as possible. On the first round of combat, he casts
  meteor swarm on the party, then uses his rod of greater quicken metamagic to
  cast time stop as a quickened spell. During the 1d4+1 rounds he gains, he
  casts spells like prismatic wall, wall of force, and cloudkill among the PCs
  to disrupt their tactics, and casts defensive spells on himself like spell
  turning, true seeing, and globe of invulnerability. He'll also use his wand of
  stoneskin on himself during this time. He'll repeat this tactic on the second
  round (pairing a quickened time stop with horrid wilting this time) to finish
  casting any spells he didn't get a chance to cast the first time. On following
  rounds, Karzoug hits the PCs with area-affecting spells like wail of the
  banshee and finger of death, saving spells like temporal stasis and maze to
  use against anyone who seems to be particularly dangerous. Karzoug's glaive
  takes actions on its own as well, unleashing fireballs on non-spellcasters and
  curing Karzoug of wounds whenever he drops below 220 hit points. If it comes
  down to melee, Karzoug releases his glaive to dance as soon as possible,
  fighting with his talons and using quickened spells like lightning bolt and
  magic missile to support his attacks. Whenever he drops below 200 hit points
  (or otherwise suffers a crippling effect) he casts wish to restore himself and
  his living allies to full health.
Morale: Karzoug has nowhere to flee to&#8211;he fights to the death.
