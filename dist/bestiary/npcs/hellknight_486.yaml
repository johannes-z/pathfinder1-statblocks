SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Law (Ex)
    description: >-
      The power of a Hellknight's aura of law (see the detect law spell) is
      equal to his Hellknight level.
  - name: Detect Chaos (Sp)
    description: >-
      At will, a Hellknight can use detect chaos, as the spell, in the same
      manner as a paladin using her detect evil ability.
  - name: Smite Chaos (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action once per day, a Hellknight can smite chaos. This grants
      the Hellknight a bonus to hit a chaotic target equal to his Wisdom
      modifier (if any) and adds his Hellknight level to all damage rolls
      against chaotic targets. If the target is an outsider with the chaotic
      subtype, a chaotic-aligned aberration, or a fey creature, the bonus to
      damage increases to 2 points of damage per class level the Hellknight
      possesses. Regardless of the target, smite chaos attacks automatically
      bypass any DR the chaotic creature might possess. In addition, while smite
      chaos is in effect, the Hellknight gains a deflection bonus equal to his
      Wisdom modifier (if any) to his AC against attacks made by the target of
      the smite. The smite effect remains until the target is dead or the next
      time the Hellknight rests and regains the use of this ability.
DuringCombat: >-
  If a chaotic target is obvious, a Hellknight generally attacks it instead of
  other targets. Hellknights work together to flank foes and support each other,
  favoring melee combat over ranged if a choice is possible.
Morale: Hellknights fight to the death.
