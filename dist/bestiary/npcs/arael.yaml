BeforeCombat: >-
  Arael casts guidance and virtue on any unskilled rebels present and protection
  from evil and shield of faith on anyone he believes is especially vulnerable.
DuringCombat: >-
  Arael casts bless if he has allies, uses sound burst in the hopes of stunning
  multiple opponents, and hold person to disable a dangerous adversary.
Morale: >-
  Arael surrenders when he reaches 5 hp if he believes his foe will accept a
  surrender. He is willing to hold off an enemy even at great risk to himself if
  it gives his allies more time to succeed at a task or escape, but prefers to
  make a tactical retreat rather than dying needlessly.
