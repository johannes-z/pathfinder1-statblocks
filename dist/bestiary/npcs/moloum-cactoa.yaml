  Moloum has stored the extract fluid form APG in his body using delayed
  consumption. He consumes his mutagen and his extracts of barkskin, freedom of
  movement, perceive cues, shield, and stoneskin if he believes that combat is
  imminent.
DuringCombat: >-
  Moloum blankets his foes in bombs, changing the types frequently to keep his
  foes off-balance. He bolsters his mobility with haste and fly extracts if
  necessary, but keeps his necrocraft between him and his strongest foes.
Morale: >-
  If at serious risk or reduced to 40 or fewer hit points, Moloum activates his
  suspended fluid form extract and seeps into the floor to escape and recover.
