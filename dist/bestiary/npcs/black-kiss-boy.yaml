  The Black Kiss Boys focus their attacks on Jasper, who defends himself using
  total defense rather than fight back. They do lethal damage with their
  attacks, but as soon as Jasper drops, they abandon him and flee into the city.
  If the PCs intervene, the thugs turn their attention one at a time to the PCs,
  only abandoning the attack on Jasper if all three of them are attacked. They
  prefer to gang up on smaller or less armored foes, flanking to maximize sneak
  attacks.
Morale: A Black Kiss Boy flees the combat if reduced to less than 8 hit points.
