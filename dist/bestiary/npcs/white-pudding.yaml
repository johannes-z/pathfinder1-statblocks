SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      A white pudding secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material
      quickly, but does not affect metal or stone. Any melee hit or constriction
      attack deals acid damage, and the opponent's clothing and armor (non-metal
      only) take the same amount of damage unless they succeed on DC 19 Reflex
      saves. A wooden weapon that strikes a white pudding takes 2d6 acid damage
      unless it succeeds on a DC 19 Reflex save. If a white pudding remains in
      contact with a wooden object for 1 full round, it inflicts 19 points of
      damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    description: >-
      Since a white pudding looks like normal ice and snow when at rest, it
      takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with
      ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills
      instead of Perception to notice the white pudding. Dwarves can use
      stonecunning to notice a subterranean-dwelling white pudding.
  - name: Corrosion (Ex)
    description: >-
      An opponent that is being constricted by a white pudding suffers a -4
      penalty on Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing
      and armor.
  - name: Suction (Ex)
    description: >-
      The white pudding can create powerful suction against any surfaces as it
      climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. A white
      pudding can establish or release suction as a swift action, and as long as
      it is using suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a
      white pudding's CMD score gets a +10 circumstance bonus to resist bull
      rush, awesome blows, and other attacks and effects that attempt to
      physically move it from its location.
