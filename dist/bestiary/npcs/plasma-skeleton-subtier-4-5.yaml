SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Plasma Aura (Ex)
    description: >-
      Creatures adjacent to a plasma skeleton take 1d6 points of electricity and
      fire damage at the start of their turn. Anyone striking a plasma skeleton
      with an unarmed strike or natural attack takes 1d6 points of electricity
      and fire damage. In addition, a plasma skeleton is immune to electricity
      and fire damage.
  - name: Plasmatic Death (Su)
    description: >-
      A plasma skeleton explodes in a burst of plasma when it dies. Anyone
      adjacent to the skeleton when it is destroyed takes 1d6 points of
      electricity and fire damage. A successful DC 11 Reflex save halves this
      damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  Each round, one skeleton not in melee combat attempts to intimidate opponents
  using Dazzling Display while the rest attack, swarming a single foe if
  possible. They stay close together so that their plasmatic death explosions
  overlap if they are destroyed.
Morale: The skeletons fight until destroyed.
Gear: ion gauntlet (functions as spiked gauntlet; see page 19)
