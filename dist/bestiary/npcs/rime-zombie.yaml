    description: >-
      Zombies have poor reflexes and can only perform a single move action or
      standard action each round. A zombie can move up to its speed and attack
      in the same round as a charge action. A cold zombie loses the staggered
      special quality when in cold environments. Additionally, even in a cold
      environment, a cold zombie is staggered for 1 round if it takes any fire
      damage. This effect does not stack with the zombie's normal staggered
      special quality; for example, if a cold zombie is in a warm environment
      and takes fire damage, it is still only staggered.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The rime zombies are invisible and have been ordered to wait for all of the
  PCs to enter the engine room before attacking.
DuringCombat: >-
  The rime zombies are dumb brutes and always simply attack the closest target.
  The engine room is frigid, around 20ยบ F, so the rime zombies are not staggered
  as combat begins (see below).
Morale: The rime zombies fight until destroyed.
