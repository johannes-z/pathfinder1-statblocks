SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Exceptional Stats (Ex)
    description: >-
      Nefti is a prodigy of the Aspis Consortium, and the organization recruited
      him and began training him for service early in his life. As a result, his
      ability scores were generated using 25 points, rather than using the
      standard 15 point buy used to create most NPCs. This modification
      increases his total CR by 1.
  - name: Favored Class Bonus (Ex)
    description: >-
      Nefti has selected the human bard favored class option (Advanced Player's
      Guide 22) three times. As a result, he knows one additional 1st-level
      spell and two additional 2nd-level spells.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Following Kafar's hunch about their impending meeting with the Diamond Sage,
  Nefti has cast glibness, heroism, and misdirection (using a beetle he found
  earlier)  on himself and has cast heroism on Kafar.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nefti uses his spells to inconvenience and incapacitate the PCs, sparing a
  moment to cast mirror image if attacked. If his foes disappear into one of
  Kafar's stink bombs, Nefti drinks his potion of delay poison, inspires
  courage, and joins his partner in the melee.
Morale: >-
  Nefti surrenders if reduced to 12 or fewer hit points or if Kafar attempts to
  parley with the PCs. If Kafar is unconscious, Nefti offers to parley. Should
  the PCs refuse to negotiate, Nefti casts calm emotions to settle matters
  diplomatically.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of delay poison, potion of
  invisibility, scrolls of comprehend languages (2), acid (2)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 studded leather, +1 human bane sap, mwk shortbow with 20 arrows, shortsword
  with false-bottomed scabbardUE, cloak of resistance +1, ring of protection +1,
  273 gp
