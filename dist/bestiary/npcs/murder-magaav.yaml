SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a magaav can exhale a noxious cloud of reeking
      corruption upon a creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed at a DC
      17 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. A creature that
      successfully saves cannot be affected by the same magaav's breath weapon
      for 24 hours. This is a poison effect.
  - name: Infernal Wound (Su)
    description: >-
      The damage a magaav deals with its claws or rend inflicts persistent
      wounds that cause 1 point of bleed damage. Bleed damage caused by an
      infernal wound is particularly difficult to stanch-a successful DC 17 Heal
      check stops the damage, and any attempt to heal a creature suffering from
      an infernal wound must succeed at a DC 17 caster level check or the spell
      does not function. Success indicates the healing works normally and stops
      all bleed effects on the victim.
  - name: Master Grappler (Ex)
    description: >-
      A magaav can wield a weapon in both hands and still attempt to grapple. If
      it's not wielding a weapon, a magaav gains a +4 bonus on combat maneuver
      checks to grapple. A magaav does not provoke an attack of opportunity when
      attempting to grapple.
  - name: Shared Senses (Su)
    description: >-
      All host devils (gaavs and magaavs) within 100 feet of each other share
      the same senses. If one individual perceives something, all others within
      range are immediately aware of it. It is still possible for a magaav to be
      surprised or flat-footed even if other host devils within range are not.
BeforeCombat: The murder magaavs drink their potions of invisibility before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  While the PCs deal with the major image, the murder magaavs study their foes
  for 3 rounds in preparation to make death attacks. Thereafter, they attack in
  pairs, flanking with one another to make sneak attacks using their Outflank
  and Precise Strike feats.
Morale: The magaavs fight to the death.
Gear: potion of invisibility
OtherGear: +1 ranseur
