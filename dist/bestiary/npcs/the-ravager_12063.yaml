SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Resistance (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Ravager possesses an innate resistance to effects that would kill or
      permanently incapacitate it, including petrification and imprisonment.
      Against such effects it is considered to automatically make any required
      saving throws.
  - name: Energy Resistance (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Ravager possesses energy resistance against all forms of energy attack
      (fire, cold, electricity, acid, and sonic). Form-Shifting (Ex) The Ravager
      can physically alter its physiology to take on one of the three listed
      forms: the crawler, the brawler, or the flier. Doing so takes one minute,
      and during this period it cannot take any other actions, though it is not
      considered helpless.
  - name: Magic Disruption (Su)
    description: >-
      Every time the Ravager comes into contact with a spell or spell-like or
      supernatural effect, there is a chance as indicated above that the magic
      does not affect it. In the case of ongoing effects, a new check is made
      each round.
  - name: Regeneration (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Ravager and its brood treat all damage as subdual, except damage from
      epic-level weapons and artifacts.
  - name: Trample (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Ravager gains its vampiric healing ability on this damage where
      appropriate. The Ravager does not have this ability in its flier form.
      Instead, it gains Snatch as a bonus feat.
  - name: Vampiric Healing (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever the Ravager hits with a melee attack, it is healed hit points
      equal to half the damage it inflicts on its opponent. This ability cannot
      heal it above its natural maximum hit points. This ability extends to its
      trample special attack, where applicable.
