BeforeCombat: The monk drinks his potions of barkskin and bear's endurance.
DuringCombat: >-
  The monk expends a point from his ki pool at the beginning of combat to
  increase his speed. He then closes with a single opponent to deliver an
  Improved Vital Strike combined with Stunning Fist. If successful, he makes a
  full attack with his flurry of blows in the next round, attempting to finish
  the hampered opponent. He uses this tactic whenever possible, using flurry of
  blows or Power Attack only against targets that have already had their AC
  compromised from being stunned or tripped. Otherwise, he uses his mobility and
  high Acrobatics skill to move in and out of melee. When fighting four or more
  opponents, the monk activates his feather token (whip) and targets
  spellcasters first with Stunning Fist combined with Medusa's Wrath.
