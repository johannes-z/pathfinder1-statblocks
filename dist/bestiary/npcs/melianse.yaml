BeforeCombat: Melianse casts mage armor every day.
DuringCombat: >-
  Melianse casts blur on the first round of combat, and casts grease from her
  wand on the shore if anyone approaches her pool. She focuses most of her
  attacks on Corax, hoping that if she removes their leader, the other loggers
  will run away. Against the PCs, she attacks the obvious leader (if any) or the
  most dangerous-looking character for the same reason. She targets spellcasters
  with magic missile to disrupt their spells.
Morale: >-
  When reduced to 15 hit points or fewer, Melianse uses her last charm person to
  charm one of her opponents, casts water breathing on that person, and retreats
  beneath the pool, bringing her new "friend" to use as a hostage for future
  negotiation.
Gear: wand of grease (29 charges)
