BeforeCombat: >-
  Given time to prepare, Eshimal casts bull's strength and mirror image before
  attacking the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  In the first round of combat, Eshimal summons a pair of bone devils to engage
  the PCs directly. The heresy devil prefers to avoid melee, instead harrying
  the PCs from afar with his searing word and blasphemous bile abilities. Only
  if his opponents seem weakened does he engage in melee to finish them off.
Morale: >-
  Eshimal values his existence more than the opportunity to study the
  Necronomicon, and uses greater teleport to flee if reduced to fewer than 50
  hp.
Gear: >-
  iron amulet, spellbook (contains all cantrips, all  prepared spells, and the
  following: burning gaze, contact other plane, detect undead, dream, erase,
  finger of death, glitterdust, mage's lucubration, magic missile, misdirection,
  stone to flesh, true seeing, waves of fatigue)
