DuringCombat: >-
  Ausio is no fighter and he knows it. He prefers to flee combat, fighting only
  if he's cornered. He won't resist offers of a better weapon, of course, but
  even well-armed he remains a relatively cowardly man (though he would say
  "realistic").
Morale: >-
  Ausio flees if brought to fewer than 10 hit points; if flight is impossible,
  he begs for mercy unless the foe is obviously one that won't grant it. Only in
  that dire situation does Ausio fight to the death.
Gear: dull paint knife (improvised dagger)
