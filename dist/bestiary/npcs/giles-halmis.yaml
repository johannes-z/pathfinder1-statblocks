BeforeCombat: >-
  Giles coats two crossbow bolts with deathblade poison, but since he risks
  poisoning himself if he rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with a poisoned
  weapon, he drinks a vial of antitoxin as a precaution beforehand.
DuringCombat: >-
  Being a consummate professional, Giles makes sure of his kill by firing at
  least one more crossbow bolt at Corlan, even if the tengu fell in the surprise
  round. Giles shoots at anyone moving toward his position, and at those who try
  to help Corlan. If a PC wounds him, he uses his second poisoned bolt on that
  PC. Giles targets humans, especially those of native Mwangi ethnicity, as a
  priority. He always uses his Deadly Aim feat (taking a &#8211;3 penalty on
  attack rolls, but gaining a +6 bonus to damage). If forced into melee combat,
  Giles spends a move action to affix his sharpshooter's blade to his crossbow,
  then attacks with the bayonet.
Morale: >-
  Once he is convinced that Corlan is dead and has ensured that no one can use
  magic to save the tengu, Giles backs off to the rooftop's far side, climbs
  down the rope he secured earlier, and disappears into an alleyway. If the PCs
  prevent his escape, he fights to the death rather than face the ignominy of a
  murder trial and execution.
