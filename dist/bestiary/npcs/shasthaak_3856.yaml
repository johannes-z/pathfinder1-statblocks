DuringCombat: >-
  Shasthaak spends the first 2d6 rounds of combat making purely physical
  attacks, roaring foul insults and curses at Xin in Giant. If he survives this
  initial period, he realizes he's not fighting Xin, and switches to using his
  spell-like abilities in an attempt to control the PCs. If he manages to gain
  control of them all via magic, see Development, below.
Morale: Shasthaak fights until destroyed.
