BeforeCombat: >-
  Each lamia casts magic vestment at the start of her day&#8211;if the PCs
  arrive at this room after sundown, that spell has expired. If the lamias hear
  the dragons or trolls fighting to the north or south, they take several rounds
  to cast preparatory spells (freedom of movement, bull's strength, mirror
  image, and finally protection from good) before moving into the neighboring
  room to join the battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  Each lamia casts divine favor on the first round of combat, then moves in to
  fight the enemy in melee. They focus their attacks on the same target, one
  lamia attacking with her melee attacks while the other casts spells at the
  target, then they switch off the next round. These lamias are merciless, and
  if one of them drops to negative hit points, the other doesn't hesitate to use
  death knell on her dying sister.
Morale: >-
  If a lamia is reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, she tries to cast sanctuary
  and then uses her healing magic on herself while attempting to put some
  distance between her and the PCs. If reduced to 20 hit points, a lamia casts
  sending to warn Mokmurian before she attempts to flee to another room in this
  complex, where she can find an ally to aid her.
Gear: >-
  masterwork leather armor, +2 falchion, headband of inspired wisdom +2, ring of
  protection +2
