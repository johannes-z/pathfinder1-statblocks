SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Beguiling Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature who is sexually attracted to women runs the risk of being
      beguiled by a nereid if he or she looks upon her beauty from a distance of
      30 feet or less. Creatures who fail a DC 21 Will save are immediately
      fascinated. The nereid may use her suggestion spell-like ability at will
      against creatures that are fascinated by her beguiling aura. This is a
      mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Drowning Kiss (Su)
    description: >-
      A nereid can flood the lungs of a willing, helpless, or fascinated
      creature by touching him (traditionally by kissing him on the lips). The
      target immediately begins to drown if he cannot breathe water. On his
      turn, the kissed creature can attempt to cough up this supernatural water
      by succeeding on a DC 23 Fortitude save; otherwise he begins to drown
      (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 445). Each round the drowning continues, the
      victim may attempt a new DC 23 Fortitude save to cough up the water. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Touch or spray (range 30 ft.)-contact; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round
      for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con plus blindness; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Shawl (Ex)
    description: >-
      A nereid's shawl (hardness 2, hp 6), contains a portion of her life force.
      If the shawl is ever destroyed, the nereid takes 1d6 points of
      Constitution drain per hour until she dies. The nereid can craft a new
      shawl from water by making a DC 25 Will save, but each attempt takes 1d4
      hours to complete. Attempts to destroy or steal the shawl should be
      treated as sunder or disarm attempts.
  - name: Transparency (Su)
    description: >-
      When underwater, a nereid's body becomes transparent, effectively
      rendering her invisible. She can become visible or transparent at will as
      a free action.
  - name: Unearthly Grace (Su)
    description: >-
      A nereid adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on all her saving
      throws, and as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class as long as she wears
      no armor.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Evindra casts summon monster VI to conjure a water elemental on the first
  round of combat, then retreats into the water and uses poison against the PCs.
  If this tactic proves unworkable, she assumes the form of a water elemental to
  attack physically.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, Evindra attempts to flee into the nearby
  pool to hide.
