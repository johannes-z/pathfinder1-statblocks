Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Grib feels combat is imminent, he drinks his mutagen to increase his
  Dexterity and his extracts of false life  and expeditious retreat; he also
  charges a vial of alchemist's fire within his explosion pocket. The benefits
  of these abilities are included in his statistics.
DuringCombat: >-
  Grib attempts to stay in or near the cloud of gas near the fleshwarping pits,
  hurling bombs in a way that will hit the most enemies. He uses a stink bomb on
  the first round and standard bombs on subsequent rounds, unless the PCs prove
  resistant to fire. If he runs out of bombs or another good opportunity
  presents itself, he drinks his extract of fire breath. He doesn't care about
  hitting allies with his bombs or breath and laughs maniacally if he does so.
Morale: >-
  If he runs out of ways to attack the PCs with extracts or bombs or is reduced
  to 10 or fewer hit points, Grib tries to flee to area A10 and alert Zoagusk.
