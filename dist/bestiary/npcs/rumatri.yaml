Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If she has time to prepare for combat, Rumatri casts heroism on herself,
  followed by invisibility just before the PCs enter the room.
DuringCombat: >-
  Rumatri favors her spells in combat, and attempts to stay out of melee range
  as long as possible. She opens combat with glitterdust, hoping to blind as
  many PCs as possible. She then uses damaging spells such as chord of shards
  and ear-piercing scream, or spells that can take PCs out of combat such as
  hideous laughter.
Morale: Unafraid of death, Rumatri fights until destroyed.
