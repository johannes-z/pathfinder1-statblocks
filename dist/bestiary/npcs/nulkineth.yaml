SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Consume Flesh (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Nulkineth can entirely consume the body of a human, which
      takes the half-nabasu 10 minutes of grisly work-doing so grants Nulkineth
      a +2 profane bonus on all attack rolls and damage rolls, as well as to his
      AC. In addition, the act grants the half-nabasu 2 temporary hit points per
      Hit Die. These effects last for 1 hour per Hit Die. Nulkineth has already
      fed upon a 5th-level prisoner, and the benefits from this ability are
      figured into his stat block above.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: Nulkineth casts corruption resistance (evil) and expeditious retreat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nulkineth first pronounces a justice judgment on his foes and casts weapon of
  awe on his +1 battle aspergillum. He then attacks, smiting good against anyone
  who appears to be a cleric, paladin, or other holy servant of a good deity.
Morale: >-
  Once reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, Nulkineth flees after casting
  darkness to throw off pursuit. Once he's escaped, he heals his wounds as best
  he can and then heads straight for Drezen, hoping to trade information about
  the PCs' army in exchange for safe quarter there.
Gear: wand of hold person (10 charges), unholy water (3)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 breastplate, heavy steel shield, +1 battle aspergillumUE, holy symbol of
  Kabriri, powdered silver worth 250 gp, key to area D8
