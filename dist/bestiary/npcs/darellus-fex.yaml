BeforeCombat: >-
  Fex casts greater false life and mage armor at the beginning of each day.
  Before teleporting to the Inferno Gate, Fex casts fly, protection from evil,
  shield, and stoneskin, and uses his wand of heroism.
DuringCombat: >-
  Fex casts displacement on the first round of combat, then uses his summon
  spell-like ability to conjure an erinyes. He then continues to summon
  additional allies, using his Summon Evil Monster feat to summon a bearded
  devil (summon monster V), a hell hound or yeth hound (summon monster IV), or
  an augur kyton (summon monster III). If successfully targeted by opponents,
  Fex casts quickened invisibility to reposition himself, followed by mirror
  image from his wand. He uses spells such as acid fog and wall of force to
  divide and hinder enemies, relying on his summoned minions to deal damage for
  him.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 40 hit points, Fex uses a scroll of slow to impede
  his closest foes before imbibing a potion of cure serious wounds. Fex has
  pooled all his resources into this betrayal, and fights to the death to ensure
  his scheme succeeds.
