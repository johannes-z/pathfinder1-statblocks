SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Charming Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature within 10 feet of the idol of the forgotten god that meets
      its gaze must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or be affected as though by a
      charm monster spell (caster level 7th). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Fear Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, the idol of the forgotten god can project a continuous
      aura of fear. Every creature within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 21 Will
      save or be shaken for 1 hour. Creatures charmed by the idol are immune to
      this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Power from Worship (Su)
    description: >-
      For every 10 creatures with Intelligence scores of 6 or higher that are
      currently charmed by the idol of the forgotten god's charming gaze, the
      idol gains 2 temporary hit points and a +1 bonus on Perception checks.
  - name: Spit Ooze (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, the idol of the forgotten god
      can spit an advanced glacial ooze (see below) from its mouth at a single
      target within 60 feet. This is a ranged touch attack that deals 3d6 points
      of bludgeoning damage plus the ooze's slam attack damage to the target. On
      a successful hit, the ooze also automatically engulfs the target. An ooze
      takes no damage from being spit, and does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity as it travels to its target.
