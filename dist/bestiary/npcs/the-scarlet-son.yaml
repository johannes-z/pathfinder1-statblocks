DuringCombat: >-
  The Scarlet Son watches from his vantage point atop a nearby roof, using his
  freeze ability to stay hidden. As soon as he realizes Zadendi is being
  ambushed, he swoops down and tries once to grab the cleric and fly away with
  her, relying on his damage reduction to prevent him from taking much damage
  from attacks of opportunity.
Morale: >-
  The Scarlet Son abandons Zadendi as soon as she is killed, or as soon as the
  gargoyle is reduced below 25 hit points, fleeing back to the Old Shrine.
