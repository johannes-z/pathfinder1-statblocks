BeforeCombat: >-
  By the time the PCs reach the throne room, Kibizax is almost certainly alerted
  to their presence (either from his alarm spell in area 2c or from the sound of
  fighting with Yippitok) and has false life, mage armor, and stoneskin active
  when they arrive (included in stat block).
DuringCombat: >-
  When combat starts, Kibizax stops concentrating on the dragon illusion (it
  remains an additional 2 rounds) and casts lightning bolt, hoping to get as
  many PCs in the aisle as possible. Then he hides behind his throne and casts
  invisibility. Kibizax focuses on disorienting and misleading his enemies,
  using invisibility, obscuring mist, and illusions of himself to disorient and
  misdirect enemies as much as possible. Kibizax uses his lightning bolt
  whenever he can get two or three enemies in its arc. Otherwise, he tries to
  pick off targets with scorching ray and magic missile. Above all, Kibizax
  plays to the kobold audience in the balconies, as he knows this is his last
  performance and wants to go out in style and in a way that encourages them to
  push for his successor to continue the war with the Pathfinder Society.
Morale: Kibizax fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure light wounds, scroll of stoneskin, wand of false life (7
  charges)
