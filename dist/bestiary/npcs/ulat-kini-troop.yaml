SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bracing Tactic (Ex)
    description: >-
      An ulat-kini troop can make an attack of opportunity against any creature
      that ends its movement within the troop's melee reach (5 ft.). If the
      attack of opportunity is made against a creature that charged the troop,
      the damage is doubled.
  - name: Dispelling (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per round as a free action that does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity, an ulat-kini troop can attempt to dispel a magical effect
      within 200 feet as per dispel magic. This represents sorcerers embedded
      within the troop formation who are attempting to overcome enemy magical
      effects. The ulat-kini troop has an effective caster level of 10 for this
      purpose. An ulat-kini troop can use this ability up to 10 times per day.
  - name: Volley (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a standard action, an ulat-kini troop can throw a
      volley of tridents. This attack takes the form of up to two lines with a
      range of 40 feet. These lines can start from the corner of any square in
      the troop's space. All creatures in one of these lines take 4d8 points of
      piercing damage (Reflex DC 20 half). The saving throw DC is
      Dexterity-based, and includes the bonus from the ulat-kini troop's Ability
      Focus feat.
