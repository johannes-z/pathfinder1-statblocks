DuringCombat: >-
  If it gets the chance, Sargota attempts to possess one of the PCs with magic
  jar to make use of a physical body. If unsuccessful or prevented from
  possessing an opponent, Sargota lashes out with its incorporeal touch attacks
  and spell-like abilities.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 60 hit points, Sargota attempts to flee. The
  Sightless Sphinx's wards, however, prevent it from using greater teleport, so
  it flees through the walls back to the maftet-held areas of the Sphinx.
