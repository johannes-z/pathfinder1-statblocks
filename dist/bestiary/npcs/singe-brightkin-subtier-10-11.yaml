BeforeCombat: >-
  Singe casts resist energy, specifying cold. If the PCs make any noise as they
  approach (such as removing the gemstones in area B1), then Singe also casts
  entropic shield and freedom of movement on herself, and bull's strength on her
  two bodyguards. She also directs her bodyguards to quaff their potions of
  protection from energy. These spells are not included in the above statistics.
DuringCombat: >-
  Singe opens combat casting spiritual ally, directing the summoned ally to
  attack enemy spellcasters. She then bisects the battlefield with a wall of
  fire, trying to separate the PCs into two groups. Singe stays close to her
  bodyguards, while positioning her guards between herself and the bulk of her
  enemies. She regularly casts fireball to catch as many foes as she can,
  capitalizing on her bodyguards' immunity to fire.
Morale: Singe fights until reduced below 18 hit points, at which time she surrenders.
