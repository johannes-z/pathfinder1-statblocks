DuringCombat: >-
  Kul-Inkit rages on the first round of combat and makes use of Power Attack
  with her axe in melee. She prefers to make full attacks if possible, but won't
  hesitate to stay mobile and make only one attack per round against foes who
  have stronger full attacks than she. Her only ranged options are her grenades,
  so she prefers to save them for emergencies.
Morale: >-
  Kul-Inkit surrenders if reduced to 50 hit points or less so that she has a few
  hit points left once she ends her rage, but if she's got fewer than 43 hp, she
  fights to the death, knowing that dropping her rage would put her at her foes'
  mercy.
