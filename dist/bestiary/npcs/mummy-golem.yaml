  - name: Grasping Wrappings (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mummy golem can grapple and constrict with bandages from anywhere on its
      body, allowing it to continue attacking with its slams and constrict
      ability against other foes. Grappled creatures keep the grappled
      condition, but the mummy golem does not. A grappled creature can try to
      cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon, or it can
      just try to escape the grapple. The mummy golem's wrappings are AC 15 and
      have 6 hit points for the purpose of a grappled creature cutting itself
      free. A mummy golem has plenty of wrappings, allowing it to continue using
      this ability even if a creature cuts itself free. A mummy golem can
      constrict up to four opponents at one time using this ability.
