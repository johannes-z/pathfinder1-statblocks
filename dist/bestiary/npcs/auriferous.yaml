SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cowering Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature shaken by the ravener's frightful presence is cowering
      instead of shaken for the first round of the effect, and shaken for the
      rest of the duration.
  - name: >-
      Any creature that is frightened by its frightful presence is instead
      cowering for Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A very young or older gold dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form
      three times per day as if using polymorph.
  - name: Detect Gems (Sp)
    description: >-
      A young or older gold dragon can detect gems three times per day. This
      functions as locate object, but can only be used to locate gemstones.
  - name: Divine Aid (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once a week, a great wyrm gold dragon can call upon celestial powers for
      aid. This functions as a miracle.
  - name: Fast Flight (Ex)
    description: >-
      A young or older gold dragon is treated as one size category larger when
      determining his fly speed.
  - name: Fire Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      An old or older gold dragon is surrounded by an aura of fire. All
      creatures within 5 ft. of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at the
      beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient gold dragon's aura extends to
      10 ft. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. The dragon can activate or
      suppress this aura as a free action.
  - name: Luck (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can touch a gem, usually one
      embedded in the dragon's hide, and enspell it to bring good luck. As long
      as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature within a given
      radius of it (10 ft. per age category) receives a +1 luck bonus on all
      saving throws. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature,
      only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours
      per age category of the dragon. This ability is the equivalent of a
      2nd-level spell.
  - name: Soul Ward (Su)
    description: >-
      An intangible field of siphoned soul energy protects a ravener from
      destruction. This ward has a maximum number of hit points equal to twice
      the ravener's Hit Dice, but starts at half this amount. Whenever a ravener
      would be reduced below 1 hit point, all damage in excess of that which
      would reduce it to 1 hit point is instead dealt to its soul ward. If this
      damage reduces the soul ward to fewer than 0 hit points, the ravener is
      destroyed.
  - name: Soul Consumption (Su)
    description: >-
      When a living creature within 30 ft. of a ravener dies, that creature's
      soul is torn from its body and pulled into the ravener's maw if the dying
      creature fails a Will save (DC equals the save DC of the ravener's breath
      weapon). This adds a number of hit points to the ravener's soul ward equal
      to the dead creature's Hit Dice. Creatures that have their souls consumed
      in this way can only be brought back to life through miracle, true
      resurrection, or wish.
  - name: Soul Magic (Sp)
    description: >-
      A ravener retains the base creature's spellcasting capability, adding
      three levels to the base creature's caster level. This increases the
      number of spells known by the ravener, but the ravener loses all spell
      slots. Instead, whenever the ravener wishes to cast any one of its spells
      known, it consumes a number of hit points from its soul ward equal to the
      spell slot level necessary to cast the spell (including increased levels
      for metamagic feats and so on). If the soul ward has insufficient hit
      points, the ravener cannot cast that spell. Casting a spell that reduces
      its soul ward to exactly 0 hit points does not harm the ravener (though
      most are not comfortable without this buffer of soul-energy and try to
      replenish it quickly).
  - name: Weakening Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Instead of a cone of fire, a gold dragon can breathe a cone of weakening
      gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1
      point of Strength damage per age category (Will save half).
