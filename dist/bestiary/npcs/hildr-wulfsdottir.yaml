BeforeCombat: >-
  If Hildr is aware of the PCs' approach, she spends a full round putting on her
  cleats to give her better mobility on the ice. Otherwise, she wears normal
  cold-weather boots that provide no additional traction.
DuringCombat: >-
  Hildr enters a rage and charges at the first target in sight. She is a
  whirlwind in a fight, moving from target to target unless doing so will open
  her to excessive attacks of opportunity. She and Skell are competitive and do
  not aid one another in battle, though if her brother falls, she focuses all
  her attention on the enemy who dealt the killing blow.
Morale: >-
  While raging, Hildr fights to the death. She only flees or surrenders if her
  brother is somehow forced to do the same.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds
OtherGear: >-
  chain shirt, masterwork heavy wooden shield, battleaxe, light crossbow with 10
  bolts, cleats*, cold weather outfit, bronze Aspis Consortium badge, 26 gp
