BeforeCombat: >-
  Aran Thokskaw tries to avoid combat at all cost, but if he suspects a
  confrontation is unavoidable, he applies his oil of keen edge to his sword and
  his oil of greater magic weapon to his bow. He prefers to shoot first and keep
  opponents at a distance. If he can snipe opponents, all the better, targeting
  those who might obviously be spellcasters or posses a long range weapon.
DuringCombat: >-
  If he can avoid melee, Aran does so, attempting to shoot and run. If forced to
  sword fight, he flies into a rage and tries to maneuver into a position that
  best allows him to take advantage of his sneak attack ability.
Morale: >-
  So long as he remains unaccompanied, Aran is as craven as they come. He
  attempts to flee as soon as possible, to alert his allies. If forced to fight,
  he seeks every opportunity to escape, though if dropped below 10 hit points,
  he prefers surrender to being slain. He can only be forced to talk if PCs
  guarantee to protect him from the inevitable wrath of his icy mistress.
