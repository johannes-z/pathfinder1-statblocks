  - name: Witchbolt (Su)
    description: >-
      Narlysa's close association with storms has infused her undead incarnation
      with flickering green electricity rather than flames. Damage from her
      witchbolts deals electricity damage rather than the usual fire damage from
      a normal witchfire, and while she is not immune to fire damage herself,
      she is immune to electricity damage. Any creature damaged by her witchbolt
      must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or become shrouded in sickly green
      tendrils of electricity. While this eerie energy deals no additional
      damage, the affected creature glows as per faerie fire and becomes
      sickened. While under the effects of the witchbolt, the victim gains
      vulnerability to electricity. This effect persists for 10 minutes and can
      be ended early by break enchantment, miracle, remove curse, or wish
      (effective CL 11th). Any creature entering the same square as Narlysa or
      striking her with a melee attack must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or
      become shrouded in witchbolts. This ability otherwise functions as the
      typical witchflame ability as detailed on page 284 of Pathfinder RPG
      Bestiary 2.
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Narlysa hears combat in area G1, she attempts to summon two will-o'-wisps
  to aid her.
DuringCombat: >-
  Narlysa uses flight to stay at range, and she casts defensive shock on the
  first round of combat. She hurls witchbolts while staying out of melee combat,
  periodically using a ray of enfeeblement on enemies who hit hard in melee or
  are wearing heavy armor (so that the reduction in strength could well encumber
  such foes).
Morale: >-
  Narlysa uses invisibility and takes advantage of her incorporeal body to flee
  combat if reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, but she emerges to fight until
  destroyed if it becomes apparent that the PCs intend to leave the cave with
  the thunderbird's egg. If confronted elsewhere (such as after she's been
  recruited to the Stormreaders to replace a fallen hag), the witchfire flees
  combat if reduced to 15 or fewer hit points, returning to her caves here to
  rest and recover. Whether or not she seeks revenge against the PCs at a later
  date is left for you to decide.
