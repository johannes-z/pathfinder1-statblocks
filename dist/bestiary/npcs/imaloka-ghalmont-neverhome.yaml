Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Imaloka moves incorporeally through the House of Reflections to assess her
  enemies' weaknesses, harrying them with visual and auditory illusions to test
  their meddle. She activates her mirror of opposition (area 4) and mirror of
  life trapping (area 6) from within the floor or walls in the hopes of
  eliminating her enemies without needing to become directly engaged.
DuringCombat: >-
  Imaloka uses dirge of doom to weaken her foes' defenses before making flyby
  attacks to inflict them with terror. She uses her incorporeal nature to her
  advantage, moving through walls, floors, and ceilings to escape and confuse
  her enemies.
Morale: >-
  Imaloka is mad and cruel, but still possesses a sense of self-preservation. If
  reduced to fewer than 60 hit points, she descends into the earth beneath the
  House of Reflections, patiently waiting out her enemies where they cannot
  reach her, emerging only after she has healed or when she knows the intruders
  to be gone.
Gear: ghost touch bracers of armor +5, headband of alluring charisma +6
