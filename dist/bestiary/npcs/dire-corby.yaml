    description: >-
      A dire corby can perform a special kind of pounce attack by jumping into
      combat. When a dire corby charges, it can make a DC 20 Acrobatics check to
      jump into the air and land next to its enemies. If it makes the Acrobatics
      check, it can make a full attack against foes in reach.
