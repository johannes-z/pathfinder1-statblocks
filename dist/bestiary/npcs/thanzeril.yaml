BeforeCombat: Thanzeril positions himself to charge if he suspects combat may be imminent.
DuringCombat: >-
  Thanzeril begins combat by charging and power attacking if possible, otherwise
  he power attacks as often as he can, using his Cleave and Combat Reflexes
  feats to attack as many foes a round as possible. If he fights with an ally,
  he attempts to flank as often as doing so doesn't conflict with his normal
  tactics.
Morale: >-
  If Thanzeril is guilty, he fights to the death. If innocent, he fights as well
  as he can against the provocateurs, but surrenders if brought below 10 hp.
