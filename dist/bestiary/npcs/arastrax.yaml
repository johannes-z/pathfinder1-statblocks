SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sprint (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per minute, a shadow demon increase its fly speed to 240 feet for 1
      round.
  - name: Shadow Blend (Su)
    description: >-
      During any conditions other than bright light, a shadow demon can
      disappear into the shadows as a move-equivalent action, effectively
      becoming invisible. Artificial illumination or light spells of 2nd level
      or lower do not negate this ability.
  - name: Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shadow demon is utterly powerless in bright light or natural sunlight
      and flees from it. A shadow demon caught in such light cannot attack and
      can take only a single move or standard action. A shadow demon that is
      possessing a creature using magic jar is not harmed by sunlight, but if it
      is struck by a sunbeam or sunburst spell while possessing a creature, the
      shadow demon is driven out of its host automatically.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Arastrax refrains from using his spell-like abilities while within his host to
  help maintain his ruse.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once his host is slain, Arastrax casts deeper darkness to protect himself from
  the sunlight, and then uses his shadow conjuration, shadow evocation, and
  telekinesis abilities against the PCs. On alternating rounds he uses fear in
  hopes of driving off some of his attackers.
Morale: Enraged and desperate, Arastrax fights until slain.
