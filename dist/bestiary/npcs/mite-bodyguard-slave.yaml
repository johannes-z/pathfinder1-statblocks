SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hatred (Ex)
    description: >-
      Mites receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the
      dwarf or gnome subtype due to special training against these hated foes.
  - name: Light Sensitivity (Ex)
    description: >-
      Mites are dazzled in bright sunlight or within the radius of a daylight
      spell.
  - name: Vermin Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy, save that a mite can
      only use this ability on vermin. A mite gains a +4 racial bonus on this
      check. Vermin are normally mindless, but this empathic communication
      imparts on them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing mites to
      train Medium vermin and use them as mounts. Vermin empathy treats swarms
      as if they were one creature possessing a single mind-a mite can thus use
      this ability to influence and direct the actions of swarms with relative
      ease.
