  - name: Death Frenzy (Su)
    description: >-
      When a reefclaw is killed, its body spasms horrifically. Immediately upon
      dying, the reefclaw makes a full attack against a creature it threatens.
      If more than one creature is within reach, roll randomly for each attack
      to determine the target (which may be another reefclaw).
  - name: Grab (Ex)
    description: >-
      A reefclaw can use its grab ability on a target of any size. Reefclaws
      have a +8 racial bonus on grapple checks; this bonus replaces the normal
      +4 bonus a creature with grab receives.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Claw-injury; save Fort DC 11; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2
      Str; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The reefclaws wait until the entire party has entered the chamber or one of
  their foes has its back turned before they attack, surrounding their enemies
  to block the exit.
DuringCombat: >-
  Silently drifting from the watery recesses of the southernmost chamber, they
  pounce from the water and grab their prey.
Morale: The reefclaws fight to the death.
