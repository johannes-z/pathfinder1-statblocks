SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Swarming (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ratfolk are used to living and fighting communally, and are adept at
      swarming foes for their own gain and their foes' detriment. Up to two
      ratfolk can share the same square at the same time. If two ratfolk in the
      same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that
      foe as if they were in two opposite squares.
Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: Necromancy, Transmutation
BeforeCombat: >-
  Shenru casts mage armor at the start of each shift of guard duty. If he has a
  chance before an unavoidable combat, he casts shield and heroism (neither of
  which is represented in his statistics).
DuringCombat: >-
  The enchanter opens combat with an area attack such as black tentacles,
  empowered lightning bolt, or fireball, then alternates between enchantments
  and damaging spells against soft targets. A favorite suggestion or command for
  a dominated opponent is "Grab that person and restrain him; he's been
  charmed." If Shenru is attacked by weapons, he casts mirror image to increase
  his chances of survival.
Morale: If reduced to 15 or fewer hit points, Shenru surrenders or flees.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure serious wounds, scroll of resist energy (CL 7th), scroll of
  scorching ray (CL 7th), wand of magic missile (CL 5th, 15 charges)
OtherGear: >-
