Bloodline: arcane
BeforeCombat: >-
  Somewhat paranoid, Amitrie rarely confronts anyone without added numbers in
  the form  of spiders, ettercaps, and especially her sisters. If she expects
  trouble or is dealing with strangers, she casts mage armor, see invisibility,
  and stoneskin beforehand.
DuringCombat: >-
  Amitrie casts dominate person, targeting her largest and strongest opponents.
  She uses sheets of webbing to ward off opponents and casts spectral hand to
  deliver touch spells at a safe distance, or lightning bolt if more immediately
  threatened. Amitrie combines her Empower Spell feat with her bloodline arcana
  bonus to increase her save DCs as much as possible.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, Amitrie casts greater invisibility and
  attempts to flee, or offers obscure knowledge on the arcane arts in exchange
  for her life and freedom.

  scrolls of dispel magic (2), eagle's splendor, haste, lesser restoration (2),
  lightning bolt (2), raise dead, remove blindness/deafness, restoration, slow,
