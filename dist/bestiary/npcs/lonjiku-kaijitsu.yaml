  - name: Searing Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      Lonjiku's touch is a searing variant of the typical ghost's corrupting
      touch ability, dealing 4d6 points of fire damage on a hit (Fortitude DC 17
      half) and an additional 1d6 points of burn damage. On a critical hit,
      ectoplasm from his attack manifests into molten glass that swiftly cools
      around the target's body, reducing the target's Dexterity by 2 points
      until the glass is removed. Doing so safely requires 1d6 rounds of
      uninterrupted work, but the glass can be broken off with a single
      attack-this method deals 1d6 points of slashing damage to the victim. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
