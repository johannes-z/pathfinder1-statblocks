SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Shrieking Frenzy (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a charau-ka can enter a state of shrieking frenzy as a free
      action. While in this state, the charau-ka automatically fails Stealth
      checks and cannot speak or cast spells that use verbal components (or use
      items that require command words to activate), but functions as if under
      the effects of a haste spell. A charau-ka can continue shrieking for up to
      3 rounds, after which it is staggered for 1 round.
  - name: Thrown Weapon Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Charau-ka are masters of thrown weapons. All charau-ka gain Throw Anything
      as a bonus feat. In addition, a charau-ka gains a +1 racial bonus on all
      thrown weapons, and the threat range for thrown weapons is doubled, as if
      the charau-ka possessed the Improved Critical feat for all thrown weapons.
      This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat
      range of a weapon.
DuringCombat: >-
  A charau-ka thug enters a shrieking frenzy on the first round of combat. If
  it's injured when the frenzy ends, it drinks its potion of cure moderate
  wounds before continuing the fight.
Morale: >-
  Unless it's in the presence of one of the tribe's leaders, a charau-ka thug
  flees combat or surrenders if reduced to fewer than 10 hit points.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork studded leather, masterwork darkwood light wooden shield,
  masterwork darkwood club, masterwork throwing axes (2)
