SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Lashing Tail (Su)
    description: >-
      A huldra's tail slap is a primary attack. In addition, each time a huldra
      damages a creature with her tail slap, she deals 1d4 points of Charisma
      damage, causing her target to grow progressively more deformed and ugly
      with each strike. A successful DC 15 Fortitude save negates the Charisma
      damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Manipulate Luck (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a huldra can manipulate another creature's luck by spending
      a full-round action, during which the huldra must remain in physical
      contact with the target creature. When the huldra uses this ability, she
      must choose whether she is imparting good luck or bad luck. A creature
      granted good luck gains a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws, attack
      rolls, and skill checks, while a creature afflicted with bad luck takes a
      -4 penalty on all saving throws, attack rolls, and skill checks. A
      successful DC 18 Will save negates the effect. Huldras cannot be the
      target of this ability. This effect lasts for 24 hours and is a curse
      effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
