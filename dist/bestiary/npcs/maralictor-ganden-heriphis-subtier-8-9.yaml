SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Law (Su)
    description: >-
      The power of a Hellknight's aura of law (see the detect law spell) is
      equal to his total character level.
  - name: Detect Chaos (Sp)
    description: >-
      This ability functions like a paladin's detect evil ability, save that it
      detects chaos.
  - name: Discipline (Su)
    description: >-
      Heriphis has access to the Hellknight discipline of onslaught. Once per
      day as a free action, he can increase his base speed by 10 feet and gain a
      +4 bonus to Strength for 1 round.
  - name: Force of Will (Ex)
    description: >-
      Heriphis gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells with the charm
      descriptor.

      Heriphis has earned the right to wear a special type of masterwork full
      plate called Hellknight plate armor (The Inner Sea World Guide 290).
      Wearing Hellknight plate, reduces Heriphis's armor check penalty by 1 and
      increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by 1, and he moves at full
      speed. Order Heriphis belongs to the Order of the Nail.
  - name: Smite Chaos (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as the paladin's smite evil ability, but against
      chaotic-aligned creatures. This ability is twice as effective against
      outsiders with the chaotic subtype, chaotic-aligned aberrations, and fey.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Heriphis initiates combat by using his smite chaos ability on the nearest PC
  he knows to be chaotic. If possible, he charges, using his onslaught
  discipline to increase both his speed and Strength to maximize his initial
  attack bonus and damage output. He attempts to flank with the cerberi and make
  full attacks whenever possible.
Morale: >-
  Knowing that he will face harsh punishment if his indiscretion in treating
  with an Infernal Duke becomes known, Heriphis fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  oil of align weapon (lawful), oil of bless weapon, potion of cure serious
  wounds
OtherGear: >-
  +1 Hellknight plate, +1 flaming longsword, +1 short sword, cloak of resistance
