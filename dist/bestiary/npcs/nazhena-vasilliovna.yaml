Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Nazhena casts false life and mage armor every day. Once enemies enter area
  M11, she drinks potions of barkskin and shield of faith and activates her
  flight hex.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nazhena casts summon monster IV on the first round of combat to summon an ice
  mephit. She then casts spectral hand, relying on her ice golem minion and
  summoned mephit to engage opponents on the ground while she uses her spectral
  hand to deliver touch spells from above, infusing them with her frozen caress
  hex. She casts wall of ice to isolate specific threats, and touch of idiocy to
  reduce the effectiveness of a rival spellcaster. If brought to ground, Nazhena
  casts ice storm or sleet storm to put difficult terrain (mitigated by her
  frostfoot hex) between herself and her enemies.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, Nazhena tries to flee, covering her
  escape with sleet storm while she flies away. If cornered and unable to
  escape, Nazhena fights to the death rather than surrender.
Gear: >-
  potions of barkskin (2), potions of cure moderate wounds (2), potions of
  shield of faith (2), wand of ice spears* (10 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  Emberchill (+1 frost sickle, currently storing wall of ice; see page 60),
  hyperboreal robe (see page 60), spell component pouch, blue quartz tiara worth
  500 gp, ice diamond necklace worth 100 gp
