BeforeCombat: >-
  If the monks are aware that the "thieves" approach, they drink their potions
  of owl's wisdom. The monks lie in wait on the first level above the entrance,
  preparing to ambush the PCs once they enter the room.
DuringCombat: >-
  The monks use their stunning fist and flurry of blows whenever possible,
  spending a point from their ki pool to make an additional attack. Against an
  all-flying party, they use high jump or drink their potions of fly. They deal
  only nonlethal damage.
Morale: The monks obey Pradnyara's orders to the death if necessary.
