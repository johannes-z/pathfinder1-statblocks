DuringCombat: >-
  Gatlynn always fights from a superior position, forcing opponents to climb
  walls, cross chasms, or brave other hazards to reach her sniping positions. If
  she lacks a secure perch, she instead opens fire to draw enemies back into a
  waiting ambush, where her allies engage the foes in melee, allowing her to
  pick off targets one by one. She readily changes up her ammunition to adapt to
  threats, or to deal nonlethal damage against foes to whom she wishes to show
  mercy.
Morale: >-
  Gatlynn is a practical fanatic, reasoning that she is of little use to her
  queen if she's dead, even if that death is glorious. She falls back if clearly
  outmatched or reduced below 15 hit points.
