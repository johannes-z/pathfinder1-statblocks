  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      A verdurous ooze secretes a digestive acid that dissolves flesh and metal
      quickly. Each time a creature takes damage from the ooze's acid, its metal
      equipment and armor take the same amount of damage from the acid. A
      successful DC 25 Reflex save prevents damage to such items. A metal or
      natural weapon that strikes a greater verdurous ooze takes 1d8 points of
      acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds at a DC 25 Reflex save.
      If a greater verdurous ooze remains in contact with a metal object for 1
      full round, it deals 25 points of acid damage (no save) to the object. The
      save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Enliven (Sp)
    description: >-
      The chemicals emitted by a verdurous ooze cause nearby plants to twitch
      into life. While the ooze is in areas covered in natural growth, all
      squares within 15 feet of the verdurous ooze are affected as if by the
      entangle spell. The verdurous ooze has no control over this effect, and if
      dispelled, the effect renews after 1d4 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Sleep Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      The chemicals emitted by a verdurous ooze have a stronger and opposite
      effect on living, non-plant creatures that come within a 30-foot radius.
      All living creatures within the area must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or
      fall asleep for 15 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that
      creature cannot be affected again by the same verdurous ooze's sleep aura
      for 24 hours. This is a nonmagical sleep and poison effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
