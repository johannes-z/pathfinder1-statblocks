BeforeCombat: >-
  Each kin-warden in this area casts cat's grace and resist energy (acid) and
  drinks one of its potions of heroism.
DuringCombat: >-
  The kin-wardens position themselves to make full attacks with their short
  swords, flanking with each other when possible. Against a favored enemy who
  appears close to death, a kin-warden makes nonlethal attacks instead, hoping
  to capture another prisoner. Foes who aren't favored enemies receive no such
  consideration.
Morale: The kin-wardens fight until they're destroyed.
Gear: potions of heroism (2)
