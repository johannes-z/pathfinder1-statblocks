DuringCombat: >-
  Whether he's being influenced by the Splatter Man or not, Gibs fights
  tenaciously, slashing at foes with his war razor or punching if unarmed.
  Somewhat of a misogynist, he focuses his attacks on women first, particularly
  those who seem to him to be attempting to "be men" (heavily armored women or
  those wielding two-handed weapons).
Morale: >-
  While under the Splatter Man's influence, Gibs fights to the death; otherwise
  he flees or surrenders if reduced to fewer than 12 hit points.
Gear: war razor, waterskin
