SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Affecting Effect Weakness (Ex)
    description: >-
      The weakened conviction of a soulbound doll's soul makes it susceptible to
      mind-affecting effects, despite its construct traits.
  - name: Soul Focus (Su)
    description: >-
      The soul bound to a doll lives within a focus integrated into the doll, a
      gem hidden in the doll's chest. As long as this soul focus remains intact,
      it can be built into another doll for the soul to animate, using the same
      cost as for creating a new construct. Once bound into the soul focus, the
      soul continues to learn, and so if later put into a new doll body, the
      soul retains its personality and memories. Regardless of its construction,
      a soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a Break DC of 20.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      The dolls' daggers are constantly poisoned with venom as long as the dolls
      exist and wield them (Medium spider venom-injury; save Fort DC 14;
      frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Str, cure 1 save).
