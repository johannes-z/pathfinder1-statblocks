BeforeCombat: >-
  If Ascalar knows combat is imminent, he casts mage armor and false life from
  his wands, and then casts illusion of calm so he can continue to act and cast
  spells without looking like a threat to the PCs. (These effects are already
  calculated into his statistics.) If the PCs seek to parlay first, he tries to
  cast suggestion and charm person to gain an advantage.
DuringCombat: >-
  When combat begins, Ascalar casts mirror image and then targets his foes with
  his offensive spells like fireball, spiked pit, hideous laughter, ear-piercing
  scream, acid arrow, and scorching ray. After he casts these spells, Ascalar
  targets foes with his wand of spontaneous immolation. He avoids melee at all
  costs.
Morale: >-
  Ascalar is a coward at heart with no true loyalty to his companions. If
  reduced to 15 hit points or less, Ascalar tries to flee to area C1 to drink
  his healing potions. If reduced to 5 hit points or less, Ascalar surrenders
  and promises to assist the PCs in any way possible if they spare his life and
  help him escape the vault, He will of course betray the PCs at the first
  opportunity.
Gear: >-

  life (6 charges), wand of mage armor (30 charges), wand of spontaneous
  immolationUC (15 charges)
