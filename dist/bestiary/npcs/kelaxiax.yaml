DuringCombat: >-
  Kelaxiax remains invisible and perched atop Tiarise's shoulder. He casts
  suggestion on the first PC to deal damage to Tiarise, suggesting that PC drop
  to his knees to beg forgiveness for the assault. He attempts to sting any foe
  that grapples Tiarise, but otherwise avoids combat for the most part, save for
  when he's ordered to deliver touch spells&#8211;something he prefers to do
  while invisible.
Morale: >-
  If Tiarise is slain, Kelaxiax flees and hides, hoping to avoid the PCs for the
  rest of his life.
