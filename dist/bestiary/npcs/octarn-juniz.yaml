BeforeCombat: >-
  Octarn has consumed enough ale before the contest to gain 5 additional drunken
  ki points.
DuringCombat: >-
  Octarn deals nonlethal damage with his unarmed strikes. He prefers to use
  flurry of blows, shifting around his opponent as a swift action using his
  drunken ki ability. Whenever he feels like he has the upper hand, he spends a
  move action to dramatically sip from his jug, to the crowd's amusement, and
  makes only a single attack.
Morale: >-
  Octarn yields if reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, making a comical show of
  passing out in a drunken daze.
