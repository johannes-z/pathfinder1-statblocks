DuringCombat: >-
  Tombus seeks to flank PCs at the edges of his troop, commanding the soldiers
  to shift and reconfigure in whatever shape is necessary so that he can make
  full attacks and take full advantage of his sneak attacks.
Morale: >-
  Tombus attempts to flee if reduced to 20 or fewer hit points&#8211;if he does
  so, he goes into hiding. He may show up later alongside another Thrune ally,
  but it's more likely that the next time the PCs encounter him, he'll be in a
  semi-conscious state near death in the inquisitors' workshop (area E15) of the
  Temple of Asmodeus, being punished for his failure.
Gear: >-
  chain shirt, +1 flaming short swords (2), belt of incredible dexterity +2, 280
