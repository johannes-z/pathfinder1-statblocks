SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Incombustible Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures within 30 feet of a Tik Taan idol gain fire resistance 10.
      This effect lasts as long as a creature remains within the idol's aura.
      Any time a being makes active use of this resistance to any degree, the
      wood idol takes 1 point of normal damage, appearing more and more charred
      as it takes damage. This ability ceases to function should a Tik Taan idol
      have only 1 hit point and does not reactivate until it regains hit points.
  - name: Primeval Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a Tik Taan idol can force a creature within 15 feet to make
      a DC 12 Will save or be cursed. This curse functions similarly to the
      spell bestow curse, except that it can only either decrease an ability
      score by -4 or cause a &#8211;2 penalty to attack rolls, saves, ability
      checks, and skill checks. In addition, while affected, the skin of the
      target takes on a rough, wooden appearance. A Tik Taan idol's curse can
      only affect one creature at a time, and should it curse another creature,
      the first target is no longer affected. This effect can be removed by
      remove curse or by eating a goodberry. The save DC is Charisma based.
  - name: Regeneration (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Tik Taan idol's regeneration only functions while it is standing on
      wood, grass, or earth. Fire deals normal damage to a wood idol.
  - name: Inanimate (Ex)
    description: >-
      An idol is effectively a statuette and does little to suggest otherwise.
      Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is
      indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. Unless noted in its
      description, an idol can make use of the majority of its special abilities
      without moving, though the round after it does so observers can make a DC
      25 Perception check to notice minute hints&#8211;magical glimmers, minute
      contortions, etc.&#8211;suggesting that the idol is actually animate.
      Overt actions, such as an idol moving or attacking, make its nature
      obvious to witnesses, and to others who make a Perception check (as
      previously noted) even 1 round after it moves.
  - name: Share Abilities (Su)
    description: >-
      An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect
      itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or
      allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them
      specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are
      marked with an asterisk (*).
BeforeCombat: >-
  If made aware of the PCs' presence before they enter Area 7, the Tik Taan idol
  casts barkskin on Da'Tunga, increasing his AC by +2; otherwise it does so on
  the first round of combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Tik Taan idol is intelligent enough to avoid melee combat if at all
  possible. Instead, it uses its spell-like and special abilities to support
  Da'Tunga. As the North Exhibit Hall has flagstone floors, the Tik Taan's
  regeneration ability does not work in this location.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 5 hp or less, the Tik Taan idol reverts to its inanimate state
  (see below), hoping that its attacker will lose interest. It continues using
  its spell-like and special abilities in this state. When the Tik Taan is
  destroyed all of the primates (including Da'Tunga) are stunned for 1 round,
  casting the room into a momentary, gloomy silence.
