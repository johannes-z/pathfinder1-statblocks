SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Feeding Tentacles (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action as part of maintaining a grapple, a yangethe can use
      its mouth tentacles to feed on a helpless or grappled creature by making a
      +14 melee touch attack. If it hits, the feeding tentacles siphon away the
      victim's emotions and deal 1d4 points of Charisma drain. The yangethe
      heals 5 points of damage for every point of Charisma it drains in this
      manner. As long as a creature continues to suffer this Charisma drain,
      each time it attempts to sleep it is affected by a nightmare spell (CL
      10th, DC 20), experiencing terrifying dreams in which it relives the
      feeling of being fed upon over and over. All effects from the feeding
      tentacles are mind-affecting effects.
  - name: Psychic Blast (Sp)
    description: >-
      This spell-like ability functions as confusion, and also deals 10d6 points
      of nonlethal damage when it first affects foes (Will DC 21 half). This
      ability is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.
BeforeCombat: The yangethe disguises itself with tree shape.
DuringCombat: >-
  A yangethe remains in hiding while new prey approaches, hoping that the lure
  of bodies is enough to draw victims within range of a psychic blast. Once the
  majority of foes come within range, the yangethe uses psychic blast and then
  follows that up by moving to attack. It uses quickened true strike whenever it
  only makes one attack in a round, and uses fear to try to scare off additional
  foes but tries to keep at least one victim close by to try to capture. If foes
  escape (or if they avoid the lure of treasure and move on), the yangethe uses
  demand shortly thereafter to suggest one of the visitors return to loot the
  body alone.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, a yangethe teleports away to a distant
  planet in another galaxy to recover&#8211;it may seek to return to the Scar of
  the Spider in a year, but harbors no need for revenge against the PCs.
