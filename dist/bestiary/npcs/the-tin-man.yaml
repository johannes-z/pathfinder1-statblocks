SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Reloading Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      The fine pincers on the Tin Man reload its three spike throwers each
      round. These claws can be sundered and have hardness 10 and 20 hp. For
      each pincer destroyed, the number of spikes the Tin Man can fire each
      round is reduced by one. The claws can make a melee attack and still
      perform its reloading function.
  - name: Orders (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Tin Man does not act unless ordered to in Cyclopean. If two people
      give opposing orders, they must make opposed Charisma checks. The creature
      who gave the order first receives a +4 circumstance bonus.
  - name: Anchored (Su)
    description: >-
      The Tin Man cannot be moved from where it rests with anything short of a
      teleport or plane shift spell, or by first immersing it in an anti-magic
      shell. Limited ammunition The Tin Man fires spikes the size of large
      crossbow bolts. It can be reloaded with any spike or bolt roughly the same
      size (including magical ammunition) and can fire them without fear of a
      jam. Reloading the Tin Man is a standard action that provokes an attack of
      opportunity.
