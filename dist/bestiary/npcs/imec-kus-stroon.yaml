BeforeCombat: >-
  Imeckus casts extended mage armor and extended false life every morning. Just
  before combat, he casts shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Imeckus prefers to prevent enemies from approaching him easily through
  tactical use of wall spells and effects. He then uses his spells to pick foes
  off one at a time.
Morale: >-
  Imeckus serves Drelev only as a courtesy to his sister, the baroness, not
  because he has a great deal of loyalty to the baron. If reduced below 20 hit
  points, he casts teleport in an effort to escape to his home in Pitax&#8211;if
  he escapes, he'll use sending to warn his sister. He won't return to Fort
  Drelev.
