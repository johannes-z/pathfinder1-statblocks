SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Exceptional Stats (Ex)
    description: >-
      Staunton is exceptional, and his ability scores were generated using 25
      points rather than the standard 15-point buy used to create most NPCs. In
      addition, he has the full support of the Worldwound behind him, and thus
      has gear equal to that of a PC rather than an NPC. These modifications
      increase his total CR by +2.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: Staunton casts bull's strength before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Staunton casts protection from good on the first round of combat. He prefers
  to charge into the thick of battle with Soulshear. He attacks with his spiked
  armor if he can't maintain proper reach with foes. He always invokes smite
  good on any virtuous priests or paladins, using his mythic power to make
  sudden attacks with his champion's strike ability. Whenever he attacks, he
  uses Mythic Power Attack to bolster his damage. He uses his clean blade power
  as often as he can against healers. Against heavily armored foes, he relies on
  his touch of corruption, inflicting a cruelty of fatigue first and then
  disease (bubonic plague). His glaive summons a babau to aid him on the first
  round of combat.
Morale: Staunton fights to the death.
Gear: wand of blindness/deafness (8 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +3 spiked full plate, +1 returning throwing axe, Soulshear, amulet of natural
  armor +2, belt of mighty constitution +4, headband of alluring charisma +2,
  skeleton key to Citadel Drezen (works on all doors within the citadel and on
  his footlocker in area F21, but not on doors in the dungeon), 68 gp
