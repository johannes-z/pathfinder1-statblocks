SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Charged Attacks (Su)
    description: >-
      The triceratops's gore attack inflicts an additional 1d6 points of
      negative energy on a hit. In addition, when it makes a full attack, it can
      make a second attack with its gore as if hastened.
  - name: Obscuring Energy (Su)
    description: >-
      The shadowy undead triceratops is surrounded by flickering shadows and
      wisps of black smoke, granting it partial concealment (20% miss chance).
      When it stands still, the shadows grow stronger and grant concealment (50%
      miss chance).
  - name: Resistant to Positive Energy (Ex)
    description: >-
      The undead dinosaur takes 10 fewer points of damage than normal from
      positive energy effects that deal damage.
  - name: Searing Darkness (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, the undead can release a beam of searing darkness;
      treat this as a searing light spell (CL 14th) that inflicts negative
      energy damage.
DuringCombat: >-
  The undead triceratops quickly moves to attack the first foe it notices. Note
  that the undead dinosaur is huge and thunderous; having it make a charge
  attack against a PC only to miss and hit the tank of fetid water could make
  for an exciting development.
