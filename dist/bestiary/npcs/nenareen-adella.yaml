  - name: Alchemical Undeath (Su)
    description: >-
      Nenareen uses vampire blood as a catalyst in her experiments. She does not
      have a vampire's weakness to reflections, holy symbols, or running water,
      and she can enter structures at will, but she lacks a true vampire's
      children of the night ability, and creating spawn requires her laboratory
      and several months of work. Her change shape ability allows Nenareen to
      take only the form of elves, and she cannot assume a gaseous form.
      Instead, she can assume a liquid form as a standard action or when reduced
      to 0 hit points, as per the spell fluid formAPG.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Before combat, Nenareen drinks her mutagen and extracts of eagle's splendor,
  freedom of movement, and stoneskin.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nenareen prefers to attack with her shock bombs, targeting clerics and other
  divine spellcasters first, but she isn't shy about entering melee with her
  claws or dominating imposing enemies.
Morale: Nenareen fights until slain, and then she retreats to her tank to regenerate.
Gear: grand mutagen
OtherGear: >-
  +4 shadow chain shirt, amulet of mighty fists +2, belt of incredible dexterity
  +4, cloak of resistance +4, formula book
