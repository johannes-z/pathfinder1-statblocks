    description: >-
      Attacks against a fetchling in dim light have a 50% miss chance instead of
      the normal 20% miss chance. This ability does not grant total concealment;
      it just increases the miss chance.
Gender: Male and Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If the guards are aware of the PCs' presence, they spread out throughout the
  room preparing to ambush the PCs as these intruders enter the laboratory.
DuringCombat: >-
  The guards charge the nearest PC at the onset of the combat, attempting to
  drive the intruders out of the room and away from the slaves in area 5.
Morale: >-
  While anything but good and certainly not cowardly, the guards are merely
  hired mercenaries of the Onyx Alliance and surrender if brought below 7 hit
  points.
Gear: alchemist's fire (2), liquid ice*
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork studded leather, masterwork light wooden shield, masterwork
  longsword, sling with 10 bullets, manacles, 42 gp
