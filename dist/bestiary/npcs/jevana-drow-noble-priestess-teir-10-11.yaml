SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      Drow are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally
      poisoning themselves. Jevana does not carry poison.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Jevana prepares for battle by casting freedom of movement and shield of faith
  on herself (giving her AC 36, touch 18, flat-footed 22). Her earlier casting
  of status includes both of her drider allies in this room.
DuringCombat: >-
  The priestess is brutal and decisive, having dealt with many betrayals and
  attempted coups within her noble house. She casts greater command (halt), then
  uses her feather token to attack an unarmored person (preferably a
  spellcaster), casts silence near a distant spellcaster, then casts unholy
  blight, bestow curse (&#8211;4 penalty) on a melee-oriented opponent, hold
  person on anyone who has broken free of her greater command, and uses flame
  strike or another greater command if appropriate. She otherwise stays out of
  melee range and uses hand of the acolyte (+10 attack bonus) or cures her
  allies. She channels negative energy if there are no allies in range who would
  be harmed by it, or uses Channel Smite with melee attacks.
Morale: >-
  If gravely injured, she casts cure critical wounds or heal on herself and
  tries to blanket the area in deeper darkness so she has a few rounds to heal
  herself or her other allies (her status spell allows her to pinpoint the
  locations of her allies in this room, allowing her to touch them with only the
  standard 50% miss chance rather than guessing what square they're in). If she
  thinks she will be killed, she casts word of recall to return to her temple
  sanctuary and plot her revenge against the PCs.
Gear: >-
  mwk rapier, unholy symbol/brooch of shielding (20 points), feather token
  (whip), wand of cure serious wounds (4 charges)
OtherGear: mwk breastplate, ring of protection +1, headband of inspired wisdom +2, 300 gp
