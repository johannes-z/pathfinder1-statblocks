BeforeCombat: >-
  Sluucoroth casts mage armor before combat, and if the alarm is raised,
  invisibility and mirror image as well.
DuringCombat: >-
  Sluucoroth prefers to fight with his spells, using black tentacles and web for
  battlefield control. Faced against arcane spellcasters, he opens with
  feeblemind, but otherwise defaults to charm monster and charm person against
  heavily armored foes. If joined by the skum and their sharks, he casts haste
  on them. Dispelling intruders' water-breathing effects is his other favorite
  tactic.
Morale: Arrogant and eager to succeed at his mission, Sluucoroth fights to the death.
Gear: amulet of mighty fists +2, ring of protection +3
