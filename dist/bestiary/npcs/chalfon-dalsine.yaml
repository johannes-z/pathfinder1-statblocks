SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Spell Combat (Ex)
    description: >-
      Chalfon can cast spells while wielding a weapon at the same time. This
      ability functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the off-hand weapon
      is a spell that is being cast. As a full-round action, he can make all of
      his attacks with his melee weapon at a -2 penalty and can also cast any of
      his prepared spells with a casting time of 1 standard action (any attack
      roll made as part of this spell also takes this penalty). If he casts this
      spell defensively, he can decide to take an additional penalty on his
      attack rolls, up to his Intelligence bonus, and add the same amount as a
      circumstance bonus on his concentration check. If the check fails, the
      spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. Chalfon can
      choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attack first.
  - name: Spellstrike (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever Chalfon casts a spell with a range of "touch", he can deliver the
      spell through any weapon he wields as part of a melee attack. Instead of
      the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, Chalfon
      can make one free melee attack with his weapon (at his full base attack
      bonus) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack
      deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If Chalfon
      makes this attack in concert with spell combat, this melee attack takes
      all the penalties accrued by his spell combat melee attacks. This attack
      uses the weapon's critical range, and the spell effect deals x2 damage on
      a successful critical hit.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Chalfon uses his scroll of minor image to make an image of himself laughing at
  the top of the stairs while he hides invisibly and watches his cousin and
  Pasha al-Jakri duel, concentrating on the spell until the PCs engage the
  illusion. During the subsequent 2 rounds of the spell's duration, he casts
  cat's grace and shield before engaging the PCs under the cover of
  invisibility, expending an arcane pool point as a swift action to grant a +1
  enhancement bonus to his rapier for 1 minute that stacks with its existing
  enhancement bonus. These effects are all included in Chalfon's stats.
DuringCombat: >-
  Chalfon attempts to use his spell combat and spellstrike abilities each round,
  making two melee attacks with his rapier, each at a &#8211;2 penalty, and
  channeling a touch attack through one of the two attacks. When he has a swift
  action available, he expends 1 arcane pool point to grant himself an insight
  bonus on all attack rolls until the end of his turn equal to his Intelligence
  bonus (+4). If he runs out of touch attack spells, he expends an arcane pool
  point to retrieve shocking grasp, using it the following round as if he had
  not cast it previously.
Morale: >-
  Chalfon fights to the death, knowing his plot to destroy the Pathfinder
  Society has already been put into motion.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, scroll of minor image
