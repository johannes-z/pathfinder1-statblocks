Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Tal expects combat, he casts jump on himself so that he can easily leap
  from his barge to shore or vice versa. If he thinks he's coming into dangerous
  territory, he uses his fast stealth rogue ability to sneak up on enemies so
  that he can fire arrows from concealment.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tal prefers to fight from his barge, forcing opponents to swim to him. He
  relies on his speed and mobility to stay out of reach of his enemies. If
  forced into melee combat, he uses his dog (named "Blue") to flank so he can
  make sneak attacks.
Morale: >-
  Tal knows when it is time to run and is not above stranding foes on his barge
  with his anchor feather token, leaping away under the effects of his jump
  spell, and using his swan boat feather token to create another craft to escape
  in. But when defending innocents or fighting evil, he gives no quarter and
  never quits.
Gear: elixir of swimming, feather tokens (anchor, fan, swan)

  +1 chain shirt, +1 longbow with 20 arrows, masterwork short sword, amulet of
