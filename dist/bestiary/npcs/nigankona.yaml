SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fiery Missile (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, Nigankona can launch a bolt of fire from his third eye.
      This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment.
  - name: Smoke Form (Sp)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Nigankona can turn into a cloud of smoke. This
      ability functions like gaseous form, except the cloud has the properties
      of the smoke cloud from a pyrotechnics spell (Fort DC 26 negates the
      effects of the smoke cloud). Nigankona can end this ability as a standard
      action.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Nigankona casts fire shield on the first round of combat, then casts
  incendiary cloud to drive defenders out of the fortress, readying his fiery
  missiles or scorching rays to cut down fleeing opponents. If no one comes out
  to face him, Nigankona focuses his attacks on the walls of the fortress,
  dealing triple damage to the walls with his tetsubo of the titans. Once he can
  attack in melee, he does so eagerly, casting wall of fire to cut off
  spellcasters or ranged combatants so he can focus on enemies in melee.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 100 hit points or fewer, Nigankona assumes his smoke form,
  hoping to hinder attackers while he regenerates. As soon as he is able, he
  resumes his normal form and renews his attacks. Nigankona fights to the death,
  knowing that failure is not an option.
Gear: +1 Large do-maru*, tetsubo of the titans (+3 tetsubo*, as maul of the titans)
