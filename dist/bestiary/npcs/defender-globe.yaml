    description: >-
      A defender globe adds its Charisma bonus to its AC and CMD as a deflection
      bonus.
  - name: Flight (Su)
    description: >-
      A defender globe can cease or resume flight as a free action. The ability
      is supernatural, so it becomes ineffective in an antimagic field, and the
      defender globe loses its ability to fly for as long as the antimagic
      effect persists.
