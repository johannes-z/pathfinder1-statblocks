BeforeCombat: A deathless researcher casts mage armor and false life.
DuringCombat: >-
  A deathless researcher takes cover and attacks from a distance with spells
  such as spectral hand, touch of idiocy, or magic missile. If pressed into
  melee, a researcher resorts to slam attacks. As the researchers are
  academically curious about the potency of the traps and undead experiments
  elsewhere within the Bastion of Light, a researcher attempts to injure or
  debilitate as many PCs as possible rather than eliminate the PCs one at a
  time.
Morale: >-
  A deathless researcher fights until destroyed. If the PCs flee into another
  part of the Bastion of Light, a researcher doesn't pursue, but waits to see
  whether the other dangers in the cathedral overwhelm the PCs.
Gear: brooch of shielding, potion of inflict serious wounds
OtherGear: deathwatch eyesUE
