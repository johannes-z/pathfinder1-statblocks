BeforeCombat: Zarmangarof casts mage armor, mirror image, and shield before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zarmangarof is under a geas to serve as Sabina's mount and is charmed to be an
  ally to Queen Ileosa and her minions. These magical effects ensure his
  cooperation, and he follows Sabina's commands via her Ride skill as demanded,
  but since he doesn't speak Common and Sabina doesn't speak Draconic, they have
  limited communication. While he would rather stay in the air and use magic and
  acid against foes on the ground, he lands as directed by his rider. Once melee
  begins, each  time Sabina attempts a Ride check to render Zarmangarof
  flat-footed, the dragon gets to attempt a free Sense Motive check opposed by
  the result of Sabina's Ride check to realize what she's up to. In any event,
  once the dragon is reduced to fewer than 100 hit points, his frustration gets
  the better of him anyway and he turns on Sabina in anger. Once the dragon
  lashes out at Sabina, he immediately takes a -3 penalty to each of his ability
  scores from the geas. If, at any time, the charm monster effect on the dragon
  is dispelled, he takes to the air and uses breath weapons and magic against
  the PCs and Sabina alike unless he feels confident that he can finish the
  party off without putting himself in danger.
Morale: Zarmangarof fights to the death.
