SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Conflagration (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a move action, a pyroclasm legion can join together to burn brighter
      and hotter, focusing their heat to create a powerful downdraft. This
      grants the troop a fly speed of 30 with average maneuverability for 1
      round. The fire elemental troop can maintain this flight by expending a
      swift action at the start of its turn each round. While this ability is
      active, the troop's fire aura damage increases to 6d6.
  - name: Fire Aura (Ex)
    description: >-
      Creatures ending their turn within 10 feet of a pyroclasm legion take 3d6
      points of fire damage and must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 22) or catch
      fire as the troop's burn ability. This save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Flame Jet (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a pyroclasm legion can launch a jet of flame as a
      ranged touch attack at one creature within 60 feet. This attack deals 6d6
      points of fire damage on a successful hit and creatures damaged by flame
      jet are affected by the pyroclasm legion's burn ability.
  - name: Hit and Run (Ex)
    description: >-
      A pyroclasm legion is trained to move and strike as a unit, allowing them
      to make a move or double move action and use their troop attack once
      against every creature in their space or in their reach at any point
      during their movement, rather than only at the end of movement.
DuringCombat: A pyroclasm legion makes hit-and-run attacks.
