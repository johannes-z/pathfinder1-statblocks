BeforeCombat: >-
  Before engaging opponents, Zahrah consumes her potion of bear's endurance. She
  has already cast alarm on two of the pit traps in the qanat (marked A2 on the
  map) and in the crawl shaft (area A4). This is factored into her number of
  remaining 1st-level spells for the day in her stat block.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zahrah starts combat from the shadows, using her repeating crossbow to attack
  opponents from afar. She uses her spells to subdue and weaken opponents before
  entering melee with her falchion.
Morale: Like many Lamashtans, Zahrah finds death a preferable fate to defeat.
Gear: >-
  potion of bear's endurance, potion of cure moderate wounds, foaming powder
  (3), smokesticks (2), tanglefoot bag
OtherGear: >-
  +1 living steel agile breastplate, +1 falchion, repeating light crossbow with
  20 bolts, 101 gp
