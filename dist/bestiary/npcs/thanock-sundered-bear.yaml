BeforeCombat: >-
  Wary of strangers, Thanock drinks his last potion of mage armor before meeting
  with the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  Thanock begins combat by entering Snapping Turtle Style. Thanock's rage does
  not manifest as a wild, nearly uncontrollable fury, but rather as a silent and
  menacing promise of violence. He attempts to grapple the strongest opponent,
  using Snapping Turtle Clutch and Stunning Pin whenever possible. Thanock
  focuses on one target at a time until it's incapacitated, relying on his
  allies to prevent others from interfering.
Morale: Thanock fights to the death, or until Velka calls him off (see her tactics).
