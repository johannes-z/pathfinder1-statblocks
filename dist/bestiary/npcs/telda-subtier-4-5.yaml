SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Armor of Bones (Su)
    description: >-
      Telda can conjure armor made of bones that grants her a +6 armor bonus for
      7 hours per day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it
      must be spent in 1-hour increments.
  - name: Bleeding Wounds (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a creature takes damage from one of Telda's spells or effects
      that causes negative energy damage, it begins to bleed, taking 2 points of
      damage each round. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or
      any effect that heals damage.
  - name: Near Death (Su)
    description: >-
      Telda gains a +2 insight bonus on saves against death effects, disease,
      mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep, and stunning. Skeleton Summoner
      Telda adds "human skeleton" to the list of creatures she can summon with
      summon monster I and "human skeletal champion" to the list of creatures
      she can summon with summon monster III. Once per day, when casting summon
      monster, she may summon a skeletal version of one of the creatures on that
      spell's summoning list (apply the skeleton template to that creature to
      create this monster).

  and only allowing her to communicate in Abyssal. Telda casts obscuring mist
  during the first round of combat. She hides within the mist while she casts
  summon monster III to summon a skeletal champion using her Skeleton Summoner
  feat. She makes use of blindness/deafness, cause fear, and hold person to
  separate and weaken her enemies. Telda casts animate dead on any available
  corpse or skeleton, including a slain PC if the opportunity presents itself.

  death.
