  Once Jubbek joins the fight, he focuses his anger on the creature that damaged
  him the most before he got to act. He rages as he fights, and works his way
  into area B8a. Once there, he takes a standard action to smash his morningstar
  against the floor, attempting a DC 20 Strength check to knock a
  5-foot-diameter hole into the floor. Once he makes a hole, he and the other
  giants try to move or bull rush PCs into the hole&#8211;it's a 30-foot drop
  onto rubble below, and the only exit from the area is the hole itself. Jubbek
  uses the fireball spell-like ability granted him if faced by a group of PCs
  clustering together for their own defense.
Morale: Chief Jubbek fights to the death.
