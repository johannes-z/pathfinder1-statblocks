SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2
      Str; cure 2 saves. Two-Headed (Ex) Uzar-Kus hatched with two heads. On any
      round in which he casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, he can make
      one bite attack as part of the action to cast the spell. If he casts a
      spell using Still Spell, he can make his dagger attack and one bite
      attack, but doing so is a full-round action, regardless of the time it
      would normally take to cast the spell. Uzar-Kus is immune to any effect
      focused on the head that would incapacitate him, such as blindness/
      deafness, unless that effect targets both heads.
Gender: Male
Bloodline: aberrant
BeforeCombat: Uzar-Kus casts mage armor on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Uzar-Kus casts mirror image and dominate person, then casts fireball as many
  times as he can before he's forced into melee. Once in melee, he continues
  casting spells while biting with his second head.
Morale: Uzar-Kus fights to the death to protect the temple.
Gear: >-
  +2 dagger, necklace of adaptation, jade holy symbol of Ydersius, key to area
  H11, 25 pp, topazes (5, worth 50 gp each)
