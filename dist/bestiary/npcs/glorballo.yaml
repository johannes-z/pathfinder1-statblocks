DuringCombat: >-
  Glorballo is a patient combatant, setting up devastating attacks over multiple
  rounds while commanding his foes to surrender. Glorballo's favorite tactic is
  to activate his destructive aura in the first round of combat, cast true
  strike in the second round, and then make a devastating smite using Power
  Attack with his trident against the most powerful enemy. He casts his other
  spells as the situation requires, such as dismissal on summoned creatures,
  invisibility purge if facing enemies he cannot see, or death knell on
  unconscious foes.
Morale: >-
  Glorballo refuses to surrender and is reluctant to retreat, as he knows that
  failing Dagon has dire consequences. However, if Glorballo is reduced below 30
  hit points, his sense of self-preservation prevails and he attempts to flee.
Gear: wand of cure moderate wounds (25 charges), unholy water (5)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 leather armor, Medium trident of warning, golden unholy symbol of Dagon,
  spell component pouch
