SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Resistance (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Ravager spawn possesses an innate resistance to effects that would kill
      or permanently incapacitate it, including petrification and imprisonment.
      Against such effects it is considered to automatically make any required
      saving throws.
  - name: Energy Resistance (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Ravager spawn possesses energy resistance against all forms of energy
      attack (fire, cold, electricity, acid, and sonic). Form-Shifting (Ex) A
      Ravager spawn can physically alter its physiology to take on one of the
      three listed forms: the crawler, the brawler, or the flier. Doing so takes
      one minute, and during this period it cannot take any other actions,
      though it is not considered helpless.
  - name: Magic Disruption (Su)
    description: >-
      Every time a Ravager spawn comes into contact with a spell or spell-like
      or supernatural effect, there is a chance as indicated above that the
      magic does not affect it. In the case of ongoing effects, a new check is
      made each round.
  - name: Regeneration (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Ravager spawn treats all damage as subdual, except damage from
      epic-level weapons and artifacts.
  - name: Vampiric Healing (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a Ravager spawn hits with a melee attack, it is healed hit points
      equal to half the damage it inflicts on its opponent. This ability cannot
      heal it above its natural maximum hit points. This ability extends to its
      trample special attack, where applicable.
