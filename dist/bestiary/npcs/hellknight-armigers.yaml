  Hellknight armigers compete not only with other groups, but with each other.
  An armiger does not team up with others to focus attacks on single foes as a
  result, and if one drops a PC, he takes the next round to gloat and crow over
  his triumph unless there are other foes immediately adjacent to attack. He
  drinks a healing potion if reduced to 3 or fewer hit points.
