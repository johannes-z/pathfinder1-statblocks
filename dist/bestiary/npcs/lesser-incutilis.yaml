    description: >-
      As a full-round action, an incutilis can drive its lesser tendrils into
      any helpless Small or Medium creature occupying the same square and pump
      the victim full of poison and chemicals. A victim who fails a DC 12
      Fortitude save becomes a zombie-like puppet under the incutilis's control.
      A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is unaffected. The incutilis
      is attached to this zombie-typically by the head&#8211;occupying the same
      square and moving along with it. The incutilis can make attacks with its
      tentacles independently of the zombie's slam. It can also retract its
      tendrils as a move action, but doing so causes the zombie to collapse and
      revert to a normal corpse. The incutilis must retract its tendrils before
      it can move away from a zombie it's attached to. Any attack that deals
      damage to the zombie also deals 1 point of damage to the incutilis,
      regardless of how much damage is dealt to the zombie. Area-affecting
      spells affect both the puppeteer and zombie. A character can attempt to
      attack just the incutilis, but takes a &#8211;4 penalty on the attack
      roll. Killing the incutilis destroys the zombie.
Morale: >-
  The incutilis wants to gather more bodies to turn in to zombie puppets, but it
  is not willing to risk its life to gain them. If the incutilis is reduced
  below 5 hit points, or if the PCs defeat its puppet and there are no helpless
  creatures around that it could turn in to new puppets, it attempts to flee the
  whale.
