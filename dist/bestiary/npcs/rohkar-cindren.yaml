BeforeCombat: >-
  If alerted to the PCs' presence in the lodge, Rohkar casts deathwatch,
  invisibility, and magic weapon. He also applies greenblood oil to his short
  sword.
DuringCombat: >-
  Rohkar invisibly exits the room when the PCs arrive, squeezing past anyone at
  the door while his frost skeletons occupy them. If he finds any bandits
  unconscious or dying, Rohkar slays them with death knell to further empower
  himself, then uses his scroll of animate dead to create zombies from their
  bodies. Upon returning, he directs the undead while channeling negative energy
  to heal them. If faced with a cleric channeling positive energy, he counters
  with cause fear and his poisoned blade, activating his copycat ability to
  confuse anyone striking back.
Morale: >-
  Rohkar lives to kill in the name of Norgorber, but has no desire to die
  himself. If reduced to 5 hit points or fewer, he throws down his weapon and
  feigns remorse, blaming everything on Izoze and Teb Knotten (see Development,
  below).
Gear: scroll of animate dead (10 HD), greenblood oil (1), oil of taggit (2)
