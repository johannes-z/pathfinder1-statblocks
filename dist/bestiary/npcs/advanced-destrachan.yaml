  - name: Destructive Harmonics (Su)
    description: >-
      A destrachan can project a blast of sonic energy in a cone up to 80 feet
      long or in a 30-foot-radius burst centered on itself as a standard action.
      It can adjust the harmonics of its sonic cry to generate one of two
      different effects on targets within the area of effect, but can only
      create one of these effects with each use of this ability. The save DCs
      are Constitution-based. Destruction: All creatures within the area of
      effect of the destructive harmonics take 8d6 points of sonic damage-a
      successful DC 19 Reflex save halves this damage. If the destrachan wishes,
      this ability can instead deal nonlethal damage rather than sonic damage.
      Alternatively, the destrachan can target a single crystal, metal, stone,
      or wooden object within 80 feet with this attack&#8211;that object takes
      8d6 points of damage. This damage is not halved when applied to the
      object's hit points, but is reduced by the object's hardness. A magical or
      attended object can attempt a DC 19 Reflex save to halve the damage. Pain:
      Rather than dealing damage to targets, the destrachan can instead cause
      intense pain and overwhelming sound to affect all creatures within the
      area. Targets in the area must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save to avoid
      being stunned for 1 round and deafened for 1d6 rounds.
  - name: Protection from Sonics (Ex)
    description: >-
      A destrachan gains a +4 racial bonus on all saves against sonic attacks.
      It is immune to the effects of its own destructive harmonics. A destrachan
      whose sense of hearing is impaired is effectively blinded, treating all
      targets as if they had total concealment.
