DuringCombat: >-
  If she is expecting combat, Sandara casts instant armor, which increases her
  AC to 17. Sandara takes every fight seriously, and once she gets started, she
  finishes things. She targets her opponent with doom and summons a small
  elemental or 1d3 dire rats to fight by her side.
Morale: >-
  Sandara is almost foolishly stubborn, a quality that might very well get her
  killed someday. She won't surrender and doesn't back down from a fight unless
  totally overwhelmed.
