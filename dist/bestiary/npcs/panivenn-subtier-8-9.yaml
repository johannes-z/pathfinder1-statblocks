  approach, he casts shield, protection from good, and haste, in that order,

  the doors.
DuringCombat: >-
  On Panivenn's first round of combat, he uses his hellfire spell-like ability,
  targeting as many PCs as he can get in its area of effect. He continues using
  ranged spells to damage foes, reserving melee combat to disarm opponents with
  his swordbreaker dagger.
