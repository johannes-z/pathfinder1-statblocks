BeforeCombat: >-
  The ratfolk sage casts mage armor on himself each morning. Because he avoids
  entering direct combat, if battle is imminent, the ratfolk sage casts spider
  climb on himself and climbs to a defensible position. If he is with several
  allies, he uses his wand of blur and scrolls of magic weapon on them and their
  weapons before he does so.
DuringCombat: >-
  The ratfolk sage casts wall of fire to divide up the battlefield and trap the
  ratfolk's enemies. He then casts offensive spells until he runs out, at which
  point he uses a scroll of magic weapon on his light crossbow before making
  attacks. If cornered, the sage uses dimension door to free himself.

  potion of cure light wounds, scroll of clairaudience/clairvoyance, scroll of
  locate object, scrolls of magic weapon (4), wand of blur (13 charges), wand of
