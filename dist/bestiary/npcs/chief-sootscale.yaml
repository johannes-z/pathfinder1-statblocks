DuringCombat: >-
  Chief Sootscale moves in quickly to attack obvious healers on the first round
  of combat, hoping to get in a sneak attack. He then uses Acrobatics to stay
  mobile and attack foes who are flanked.
Morale: >-
  Chief Sootscale surrenders if brought below 5 hit points, dropping his club
  and trying to blame Tartuk for "forcing" him to attack the PCs. Sootscale

  tactic.
