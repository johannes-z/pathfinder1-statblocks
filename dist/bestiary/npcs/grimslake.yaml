SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Marrow Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      A grimslake's tail is covered with suckers that extend long, thin,
      razor-sharp tendrils to drill into its victim's bones, draining the victim
      of marrow. The grimslake can drain marrow from any creature it is
      grappling or from any helpless creature as a swift action. The victim can
      resist this painful attack with a successful DC 18 Fortitude save;
      otherwise, it is staggered from the horrific agony for 1 round and takes 1
      point of Constitution drain. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Penetrating Jaws (Su)
    description: >-
      A grimslake's bite attack penetrates cold iron and silver damage
      reduction.
  - name: Slashing Scales (Ex)
    description: >-
      The scales running in a line down a grimslake's back have razor-sharp
      ridges and spines, and the creature is adept at lashing at attackers with
      these scales. Any creature that attacks a grimslake with a natural weapon,
      unarmed strike, or light weapon must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or
      take 1d4 points of slashing damage. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The grimslakes focus their attacks on the closest target, but if a target
  falls, these ravenous creatures descend on the body to feed unless they're
  threatened by adjacent foes.
Morale: The grimslakes fight to the death.
