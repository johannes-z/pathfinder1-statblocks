DuringCombat: >-
  The colour spends the first few rounds of combat attempting to feed on PCs. It
  switches to making attacks with its disintegrating touch once all available
  PCs have made their saving throws against its feed attack, or once it's been
  reduced to 100 or fewer hit points.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 20 hp it abandons Golarion entirely, exiting the
  caverns and fleeing into the dark depths of space, never to return.
