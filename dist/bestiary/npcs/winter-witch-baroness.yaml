    description: >-
      A winter witch gains endure elements as a constant, spell-like ability,
      but only against cold temperatures. At 4th level, she gains cold
      resistance 5, making her comfortable in near-freezing temperatures. This
      replaces the witch's 4th-level hex. Ice Magic When a winter witch casts a
      spell with the cold descriptor, the save DC of the spell increases by 1. A
      baroness cannot learn or cast spells with the fire descriptor.
