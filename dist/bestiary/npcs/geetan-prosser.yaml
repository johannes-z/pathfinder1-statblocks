BeforeCombat: Prosser casts barkskin and freedom of movement on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Despite his impressive physique, Prosser prefers to fight with his dart gun,
  hoping to poison foes from afar and then wait for them to fall unconscious
  from the toxin. If forced into melee, he pounces and rips into foes with
  relish-he never leaves a bitten foe alive if he can avoid it, seeking to keep
  his special gift of lycanthropy to himself.
Morale: >-
  Prosser believes himself the undisputed king of the jungle, and never backs
  down from a fight.
