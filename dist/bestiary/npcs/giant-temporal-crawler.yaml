SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A temporal crawler is immune to all time-related spells and effects
      (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like).
  - name: Slowing Webs (Su)
    description: >-
      A temporal crawler's web emanates a slowing effect (as the slow spell, CL
      16th) that affects all creatures within 10 feet of the web. An affected
      creature can attempt a DC 26 Fortitude save to negate this effect, but on
      a failure it is slowed as long as it stays within 10 feet of a web. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Temporal Foresight (Su)
    description: >-
      A temporal crawler can see a few seconds into the future. This ability
      prevents the creature from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or
      flanked. It also grants the creature an insight bonus to AC equal to its
      Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but it can be restarted as a
      free action on the creature's next turn.
DuringCombat: >-
  The temporal crawlers use their webs on the first round of combat, then move
  in to attack with their bites.
Morale: A temporal crawler fights to the death.
