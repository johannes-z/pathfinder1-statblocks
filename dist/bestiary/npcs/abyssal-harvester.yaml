SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Debilitating Constriction (Su)
    description: >-
      An Abyssal harvester has the constrict ability. It deals 2d6+15 points of
      damage and 1d4 points of Constitution damage when it constricts a foe.
  - name: Far Reaching (Su)
    description: >-
      An Abyssal harvester can reach its tentacles across planar distances to
      attack foes there, or in the case of this specimen, to the qlippoth
      runestone at area F, up to 12 times per day. All of its tentacles must
      emerge within 20 feet of each other. The monster uses its tentacles to see
      and hear and can attack normally, but cannot move while doing so. It can
      withdraw its tentacles back to its side as a move action. Dismissal,
      dispel chaos, or dispel evil causes one tentacle to be forced back to the
      creature if it fails a Will save, while banishment forces all tentacles
      back. While inserted into the other side of a portal, the Abyssal
      harvester's tentacles can be sundered as if they were weapons (each
      tentacle has 40 hit points and the harvester's AC and other defenses).
  - name: Harvest (Su)
    description: >-
      Normally, an Abyssal harvester has the ability to harvest creatures from
      other planes, but here on its native plane the harvester does not have
      access to this power, and instead merely attacks foes with its tentacles
      normally.
  - name: Tentacle Regeneration (Ex)
    description: >-
      An Abyssal harvester regrows any lost tentacles in 1 week. (Remember, this
      amounts to 11-1/2 days in the Midnight isles, where a "day" is 16 hours
      long).
DuringCombat: >-
  The Abyssal harvester slithers around its sinkhole and uses its reach and size
  to attack foes who stand at the edge above.
Morale: >-
  The monster plane shifts to the Astral Plane, then back to a different layer
  of the Abyss to seek a new lair if reduced to 40 hit points or fewer. It does
  not return to the Midnight Isles.
