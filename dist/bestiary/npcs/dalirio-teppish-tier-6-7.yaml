SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Ghoul Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 13; onset 1 day; frequency 1 day;
      effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC
      is Charisma-based. A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at
      the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none
      of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of any
      other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like
      a normal ghoul in all respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as
      a ghast.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Dalirio sits at his desk, looking over paperwork. Unless otherwise warned, he
  does not expect the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  Dalirio orders his skeletons to attack and uses confusion, cause fear, lesser
  confusion, and hold person to keep the PCs back. Once those spells are
  gone&#8211;or once the PCs reach him&#8211;he switches to melee and
  relentlessly attacks the nearest PC. Once this victim is unconscious, Dalirio
  then picks the next closest PC to attack, and so on. If given the chance, he
  uses his inflict spells on lightly-armored spellcasters, but otherwise he uses
  his bite and claws. Dalirio can only command up to 7 HD of undead&#8211;but
  there are 8 HD of skeletons present. Each round, randomly roll for the 8th
  skeleton to see whom it attacks (possibly even Dalirio).
Morale: Dalirio fights to the death.
