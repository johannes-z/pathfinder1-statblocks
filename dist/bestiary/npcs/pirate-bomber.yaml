  The pirate bombers drink their extracts of false life everyday. When they hear
  the sounds of combat in area F2, they drink their mutagens and extracts of
  barkskin, heroism, protection from energy, see invisibility, cat's grace, and
  keen senses.
DuringCombat: >-
  The pirate bombers drink their extracts of haste on the first round of combat,
  using Rapid Shot to throw additional bombs. They use force bombs to immobilize
  enemies or dispelling bombs against spellcasters. The bombers drink extracts
  of dragon's breath or vomit swarm to use against groups of enemies. If
  cornered in melee combat, the pirate bombers use their swift poisoning ability
  to apply giant wasp poison to their spiked gauntlets.
