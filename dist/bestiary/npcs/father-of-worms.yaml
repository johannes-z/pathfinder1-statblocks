SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a move action, the Father of Worms can breathe a
      90-foot cone of black energy. This deals 20d6 points of cold damage and
      imparts 1d4 negative levels to all creatures in that area. A successful DC
      31 Reflex save halves the cold damage and negates the negative levels. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Corrosive Blood (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that strikes the Father of Worms with a slashing or piercing
      melee attack must succeed at a DC 31 Reflex save or take 2d6 points of
      acid damage. This damage affects the weapon used to damage the monster as
      well-the damage is not halved against objects and ignores hardness. The
      acidic blood swiftly becomes inert unless captured in a vessel capable of
      storing it, in which case it retains its corrosive properties until poured
      out.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Father of Worms starts a fight by summoning its six greater shadows, using
  quickened cones  of cold on the first 3 rounds of combat to supplement its
  other ranged magical attacks. It casts haste on itself and any surviving
  shadows before entering melee.
Morale: The Father of Worms fights to the death.
