    description: >-
      Once per round, an ascomoid can fire deadly spores in a 30-foot line. Upon
      impacting a solid surface, the spores billow into a cloud that fills a
      20-foot radius. The cloud lasts 1 round before dispersing. Creatures
      caught within the cloud must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d6
      points of Constitution damage and become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. A
      successful save negates the Constitution damage but not the nauseated
      condition. Once a creature saves against this ability it is immune to the
      same ascomoid's spores for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution based.
