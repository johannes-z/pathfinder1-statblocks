SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Calcifying Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      An incorporeal ozimat's touch can partially petrify a living creature's
      body, dealing 1d8 points of Dexterity damage. When reduced to 0 Dexterity
      in this way, an affected creature is petrified for 24 hours. A petrified
      Medium creature can serve as a stone receptacle for the ozimat's earthen
      host ability; if used in this manner, it doubles the length of time the
      ozimat can remain in that form.
  - name: Earthen Host (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, an ozimat can merge with a body of inert earth or
      stone, shedding its incorporeality. The form must be roughly the size of a
      Medium creature. A merged ozimat loses its incorporeal subtype (plus all
      incorporeal special qualities, including its deflection bonus to AC) and
      its fly speed, but gains a Strength score of 24, a +8 natural armor bonus
      (AC 24, touch 16, flat-footed 18), DR 5/-, and Improved Bull Rush and
      Power Attack as bonus feats. In earthen form, an ozimat gains 2 slam
      attacks with a +23 bonus to hit, each dealing 3d6+7 points of damage, but
      cannot use its calcifying touch. Its hit points do not change. An ozimat
      can maintain its earthen form for a number of rounds per day equal to its
      Hit Dice (typically 16).
BeforeCombat: Korj does not attack unless its attitude is hostile or the PCs attack it.
DuringCombat: >-
  Korj uses Flyby Attack to move into and out of walls each turn. It uses Vital
  Strike with its calcific touch ability to eliminate the most dangerous threats
  first, focusing on the PCs that it knows to be most dangerous from its
  observations of them throughout Deep Sky.
Morale: >-
  When reduced below 40 hit points, or when it otherwise believes the fight is
  lost, Korj attempts to parley with the PCs. See Development below.
