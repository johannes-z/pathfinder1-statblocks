    description: >-
      This zombie's animation is provided not by necromancy but by the plant
      that grows throughout its body. Yellow musk zombies lack undead traits,
      but gain plant traits. They are treated as plants, not undead, for the
      resolution of magical effects and attacks. Channel energy cannot harm a
      yellow musk zombie, for example, nor does negative energy heal a yellow
      musk zombie.
DuringCombat: >-
  The zombie attempts to block anyone from reaching Imrizade or the Gate of
  Beyond.
Morale: The zombie fights until destroyed.
