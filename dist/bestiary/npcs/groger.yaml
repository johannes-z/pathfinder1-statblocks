SpecialAbilities:
  - name: New Growth (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a remacera can force any creature within 400 feet to
      attempt a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw. If the target fails, it takes 5d6
      points of damage and is sickened for 1d4 rounds as several tiny, larval
      remaceras suddenly burrow out of its skin. Once outside their host, the
      newborn remaceras are harmless, and attempt only to escape. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Reincarnation (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature that dies prior to fully recovering from wounds inflicted by
      a remacera is immediately subject to the effects of the spell reincarnate,
      except that it does not matter whether the soul is willing and the effect
      is instantaneous rather than taking 1 hour. A slain remacera is subject to
      the same effect, save that it reappears 1d20 miles from where it died.
