DuringCombat: >-
  Gustari uses her tactician ability to grant the daughters of Urgathoa the
  Shielded Caster feat before closing to battle. She targets the most obvious
  melee fighter with her challenge-gaining additional bonuses for her armor and
  weapon-and attacks that foe  single-mindedly, occasionally striking at other
  nearby enemies with a shield bash or by using Cleave.
Morale: >-
  Gustari's ego will not allow her to retreat from combat; she fights until
  destroyed.
