BeforeCombat: >-
  Azaersi benefits from daily castings of mind blank from Zanathura. If she
  hears intruders, she drinks a potion of heroism to gain a +2 bonus on all
  attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws (not included in these
  statistics).
DuringCombat: >-
  Azaersi activates her boots of speed (not included in these statistics), and
  early in combat she relies heavily on disarm and dirty trick maneuvers to
  blind and entangle others while her allies engage. Upon taking damage, she
  switches to deadly tactics, leaning on her opportune parry and riposte,
  perfect thrust, and deadly    stab deeds to whittle down opponents as quickly
  as possible. Her favorite tactic is to disarm her way through martial
  defenders and close with the spellcasters they protect-especially arcane
  casters.
Morale: >-
  Azaersi's life has lead to this pivotal moment. Once engaged, she fights to
  the death.
