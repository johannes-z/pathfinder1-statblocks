BeforeCombat: >-
  Illian avoids actual combat if at all possible, fleeing confrontations that do

  attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  Illian uses hold person, sleep, or her Catch Off-Guard feat to make sneak
  attacks. She uses silence to prevent her foes from calling for aid, and Bluff
  and Diplomacy skills if guards respond to the noise.

  she flees immediately.
