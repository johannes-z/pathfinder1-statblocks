BeforeCombat: >-
  Milena casts mage armor at the start of each day. If aware of an impending
  attack, she also casts shield and false life. Only mage armor has been
  calculated into her stats.
DuringCombat: >-
  Milena uses her spider climb ability to climb up the walls of the chamber,
  then casts web to trap the PCs. She uses ray of enfeeblement to make escape
  harder, alternating magic missile, lightning bolt, and scorching ray from then
  on as circumstances dictate. In melee, she prefers vampiric touch to her own
  slam attacks, knowing that a touch is easier to deliver against seasoned
  combatants than a regular attack.
Morale: >-
  If Milena sees no hope of her survival, she attempts to dominate the strongest
  PC and instructs him to defend her. She fights until destroyed, knowing the
  Pathfinders already have access to her coffin.
