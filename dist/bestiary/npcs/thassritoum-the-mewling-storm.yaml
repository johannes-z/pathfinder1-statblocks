SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Final Judgment (Su)
    description: >-
      Unlike most sahkils, Thassritoum retains some of the authority it once
      held as a psychopomp. It can use miracle as a spell-like ability, but only
      to restore a slain outsider to life or reproduce the following spell
      effects: banishment, dimensional anchor, greater restoration, plane shift,
      and true resurrection.
