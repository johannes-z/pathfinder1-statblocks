BeforeCombat: >-
  The quasits guard under the effect of their invisibility spell-like ability.
  If the PCs are using light, the quasits are aware of them as soon as their
  light source gets close to the eastern entrance of the room, otherwise the
  quasits on the eastern end of the bridge notice the PCs once they move to
  within 60 feet of the bridge (the quasits's darkvision allows them to easily
  spot visible intruders, even those trying to use Stealth). Once alerted by the
  PCs, five of the quasits change into wolf form and wait, invisibly, three
  flanking the east side of the bridge and two on the west. The last quasit
  remains in its normal form and flies near the ceiling, ready to dive down to
  aid any of its allies.
DuringCombat: >-
  One pair of wolf-quasits try to flank and trip a weak-looking character, then
  use invisibility on their next turn; the other pair then approaches and
  attacks, making it look like there is only one pair of wolves. They alternate
  this strategy for two rounds or until the PCs catch on to the ruse, at which
  point they assume their normal form and attack with claws and bite, turning
  invisible if wounded to give them time to retreat and heal with fast healing.
Morale: >-
  If the PCs are having an easy time killing the quasits, the last two or three
  try to retreat to the pyramid cavern and warn the drow of the PCs' impending
  arrival.
