SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Shadow Blending (Ex)
    description: >-
      Attacks against a fetchling in dim light have a 50% miss chance instead of
      the normal 20% miss chance. This ability does not grant total concealment;
      it just increases the miss chance.
  - name: Shadowstrike (Sp)
    description: >-
      Elenuta can make a melee touch attack as a standard action that deals
      1d4+2 points of nonlethal damage and dazzles the target for 1 minute.
      Creatures with low-light vision or darkvision are not dazzled by this
      ability.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: shadow*
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Elenuta has time before combat starts, she casts mage armor and uses her
  last remaining scroll of false life.
DuringCombat: >-
  Elenuta casts obscuring mist to grant herself concealment and uses targeted
  spells such as blindness/ deafness, cause fear, and ray of enfeeblement
  against foes at range. If approached in melee, she uses her shadowstrike
  bloodline power until she has expended all its daily uses, before attacking
  with her quarterstaff.
Morale: >-
  Elenuta believes the PCs to be the Heart's latest trick and fights to the
  death, knowing that the midnight mirror gives no quarter when its minions
  attack.
Gear: >-
  potions of cure light wounds (2), potion of invisibility, scroll of false
  life, wand of magic missile (CL 5th, 12 charges)
OtherGear: quarterstaff, ring of protection +1
