SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Foresight (Su)
    description: >-
      Srishrin can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents it
      from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also grants
      Srishrin an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus. This ability
      can be negated, but Srishrin can restart it as a free action on its next
      turn.
  - name: Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      Srishrin is immune to all time-related spells and effects (including time
      stop, temporal stasis, and the like).
  - name: Reality Bend (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, Srishrin can fold the dimensional space surrounding it
      so its true location is hard to discern. Srishrin can activate this
      ability after it is hit in battle to suddenly not be where it was the
      moment before, giving it a 50% miss chance it can apply to successful
      strikes after they occur (but before damage is rolled). This is similar to
      the miss chance granted by a displacement spell. Casting see invisibility
      does not reveal Srishrin's location, but casting true seeing does.
  - name: Temporal Displacement (Su)
    description: >-
      As a +12 melee touch attack up to three times per day, Srishrin can
      attempt to send a creature a few seconds into the future. The creature
      touched can resist being temporally displaced with a successful DC 21
      Fortitude save. On a failed save, the creature vanishes in a flash of
      white light, only to reappear in the same space 1d4 rounds later. If that
      space is occupied when the creature returns, it is shunted harmlessly
      aside to the closest unoccupied space. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Time Jaunt (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Srishrin can slip through the flow of time and
      appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by greater teleport.
      Srishrin can bring up to four other creatures within a 30-foot radius;
      unwilling creatures can resist being drawn along on the time jaunt with a
      successful DC 23 Will save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
BeforeCombat: >-
  From Srishrin's point of view, it has already been fighting the PCs for a few
  rounds. It's already taken damage (beginning this fight with only 200 hit
  points), and any spell listed above as prepared twice has already been cast
  once (don't worry if this variation doesn't match precisely to how things play
  out when the PCs meet the time flayer again, for the first time, in the
  Dimension of Time-it won't be noticeable in play to the players). Likewise,
  you can assume Srishrin has already used 7 of its 14 arcane pool points.
DuringCombat: >-
  Srishrin uses its arcane pool in the first round as a swift action to make its
  weapon a +5 flaming burst speed urumi and activates Arcane Strike each round
  thereafter until reduced to 100 or fewer hit points, at which point the time
  flayer instead activates reality bend as its swift action each round. It uses
  spell combat to fight with its urumi while also casting spells as full-round
  actions. In the first round, Srishrin casts greater invisibility on itself,
  then mirror image in the next round, and then offensive spells in rounds to
  follow. It attempts to use temporal displacement on any particularly
  troublesome opponents.
Morale: >-
  From Srishrin's perspective, it has already faced the PCs once and been
  defeated, and the time flayer will not stand for another such humiliation from
  these time-bound mortals. It attacks and fights until slain.
