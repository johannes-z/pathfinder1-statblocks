DuringCombat: >-
  A skum strangler's favorite tactic is to initiate a grapple and then pin the
  foe on the following round, all while squeezing the life out of the foe with
  his strangle ability. If a foe proves too difficult to grab, the skum makes
  full attacks against it instead. Whenever skum stranglers have move actions to
  spare, they use martial flexibility to gain the benefit of a feat that's
  useful to the situation at hand, their favorites being Blind-Fight, Deflect
  Arrows, Dodge, OutflankAPG, Power Attack, Precise StrikeAPG, Step Up, and
  Weapon Focus (claw or grapple).
Morale: >-
  The skum stranglers have no wish to die for another's cause. If reduced to 8
  hit points or fewer, a skum strangler flees.
