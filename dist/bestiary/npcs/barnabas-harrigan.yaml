BeforeCombat: >-
  Once Harrigan knows combat is near, he drinks a potion of barkskin +4, a
  potion of cat's grace, and a potion of invisibility. He also activates see
  invisibility from his eye patch.
DuringCombat: >-
  If he starts a battle invisible, Harrigan drinks his potion of haste on the
  first round of combat, then positions himself to block the most obvious escape
  route. On the next round, he activates his howling skull armor to attempt to
  frighten his foes. In succeeding rounds, he focuses his attacks on frightened
  targets, using Dazzling Display to shake more foes whenever necessary so he
  can make sneak attacks against such victims thanks to his Shatter Defenses
  feat.
Morale: >-
  Harrigan fights until reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, at which point he
  attempts to escape battle. He fights to the death only when cornered.
