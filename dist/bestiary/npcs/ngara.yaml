BeforeCombat: >-
  Ngara casts mage armor every day and uses shield of faith before battle
  (quickening it on the first round of combat if necessary).
DuringCombat: >-
  The naga prefers to stay 20 or so feet away from foes to minimize melee
  attacks and maximize her charming gaze; she casts her spells at range and uses
  dimension door to retreat out of melee when needed. When melee is unavoidable,
  she casts quickened divine favor and then uses Arcane Strike on all following
  rounds.
