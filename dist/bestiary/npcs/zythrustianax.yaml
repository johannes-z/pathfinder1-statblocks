DuringCombat: >-
  If the black dragon is able to attack the Tier 10&#8211;11 PCs, she flies into
  the largest concentration of PCs and uses her breath weapon. After that, she
  focuses on catching as many targets as she can with spells or attacks.
Morale: >-
  Zythrustianax does her best to prevent anyone from entering the Mausoleum.
  Both powerful and arrogant, she has little fear of humans, and thoroughly
  enjoys the destruction and slaughter she is causing. Still, Charvion has
  promised her quite a sizeable compensation in exchange for her aid, and once
  it becomes apparent that Eater-of-Bones won't be able to make good on her
  payments, the dragon wings away. Likewise, she has no interest in perishing
  for some human's cause, and if badly injured or seriously outnumbered, she
  flees.
