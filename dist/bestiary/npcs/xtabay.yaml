  - name: Devour (Ex)
    description: >-
      While a creature is under the effects of a xtabay's soporific pollen, the
      plant may, as a full-round action, occupy the same square as the sleeping
      creature and slowly sap the life from it. Each round the xtabay uses this
      ability, the affected creature must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or
      take 1d2 points of Str damage. This feeding is curiously painless, and
      normally isn't enough to waken a foe put to sleep by the plant. Each round
      this feeding continues, the sleeping victim can attempt a new DC 14 Will
      save to awaken. This save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Soporific Pollen (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a xtabay can release sleep-inducing pollen into the
      air around it. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius burst centered on the
      xtabay must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or fall asleep for 1d3 minutes. A
      creature that succeeds on the Fortitude save cannot be affected by the
      same xtabay's soporific pollen for 24 hours. A creature put to sleep by
      this pollen can be awakened by vigorously shaking the sleeper (a standard
      action) or by damaging it. This is a mind-affecting sleep effect. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
