  If they can, the barbtongued wyverns start combat by swooping in to attack the
  PCs before the party can fully deploy into this room, limiting melee combat
  options while still being able to take advantage of their reach to strike at
  foes farther up the stairs or down a hall.
Morale: The barbtongued wyverns fight to the death.
