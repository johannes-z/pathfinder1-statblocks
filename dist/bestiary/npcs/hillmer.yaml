DuringCombat: >-
  Hillmer is surprisingly soft-tempered, though  territorial. He won't chase
  creatures beyond his cave, and he simply drags injured and subdued enemies
  into his nest, unsure what else to do with them.
Morale: >-
  Though large, Hillmer and his siblings are tame and easily startled, and flee
  if reduced below 20 hit points.
