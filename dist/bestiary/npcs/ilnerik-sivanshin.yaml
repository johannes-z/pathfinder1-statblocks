SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mastermind (Su)
    description: >-
      Ilnerik does not possess the usual vampiric ability to change shape.
      Instead, he can have a number of enslaved spawn totaling four times his
      Hit Dice (up to 52 spawn at any one time). In addition, he may enter a
      trance to observe a single spawn's surroundings as if looking through that
      spawn's eyes, provided the spawn in question is on the same plane.
      Exercising or ending this ability is a standard action-he can maintain the
      clairvoyance link as long as he wishes, but while the link persists,
      Ilnerik is treated as helpless (although he is alerted to any jarring
      noises, the presence of any visible creature within 5 feet, or any damage
      that befalls his body). This ability (and many different alternate vampire
      powers) first appeared in Classic Horrors Revisited. Rod of Shadowy
      Splendor This magic rod functions identically to a standard rod of
      splendor, save that the garb it creates is always in the hues of red,
      white, and black, and the palatial tent it creates contains no food and is
      dimly lit. This gloom cannot be further darkened or illuminated by any
      effect less potent than a 5th-level spell.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: Ilnerik has an unseen servant active at all times.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ilnerik orders his unseen servant to trigger the lever to fill both sarcophagi
  with water, hoping that the peril this places the two women in forces the PCs
  to split their attention between fighting him and saving Faerlyn and Glynnis.
  Ilnerik's first act in combat is to cast invisibility on himself, followed by
  casting haste and inspiring courage before opening battle by making a sneak
  attack on a foe that can't see through his invisibility. Ilnerik trusts his
  high Armor Class once battles begin and deliberately lets his foes surround
  him so he can use Whirlwind Attacks, and uses Arcane Strike and Vital Strike
  with his slam attacks at all times. He saves his dominate ability and ranged
  spells to combat foes at range.
Morale: >-
  Ilnerik fights until destroyed, at which point he flees under the altar stone
  to recover, unless the PCs are present, in which case he flees to room F8 if
  he thinks he can get there without being observed. Unfortunately for Ilnerik,
  the running water in the numerous canals and sewage tunnels in the area make
  escaping to other locations more distant relatively impossible.
