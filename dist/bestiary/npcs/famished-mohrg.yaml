BeforeCombat: >-
  One of the mohrgs casts desecrate on the statue of Trelmarixian every day,
  which grants the mohrgs +2 hit points per HD and a +2 profane bonus on all
  attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws (already included in the stat
  block).
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, one of the mohrgs casts unholy aura on its
  companions. The mohrgs initially attack from the ledge, seeking to bull rush
  opponents or paralyze them so the mohrgs can topple them into the pit below.
  They especially target PCs wearing obvious religious symbols with their smite
  good attacks, assuming them to be clerics or paladins that should be put down
  first. If any creatures fall into the pit, two of the mohrgs fly down to
  devour them.
Morale: The mohrgs fight until destroyed.
