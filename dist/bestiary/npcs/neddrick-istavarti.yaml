SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Powerful Technology (Ex)
    description: >-
      Neddrick wields a powerful weapon called a monowhip, which allows him to
      perform devastating strikes for several rounds. This increases Neddrick's
      CR by 1, for even a timeworn monowhip is beyond the expected wealth of a
      12th-level NPC.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Neddrick Istavarti casts bear's endurance, blur, keen edge, shield, and
  stoneskin before launching his attack on the Silver Lining. At the first sign
  of trouble, he activates his monowhip.
DuringCombat: >-
  Neddrick uses his monowhip to deliver touch spells and trip approaching foes,
  using spell combat and spell strike to offset his weapon's low damage. He
  doesn't wish to kill Ingret, and he has instructed his associates to do the
  same.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 or fewer hit points, Neddrick casts vanish and attempts to
  escape. Failing that, he surrenders.
