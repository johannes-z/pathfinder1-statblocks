    description: >-
      Creatures within 10 feet of the animate hoard are subject to overwhelming
      feelings of greed. Such creatures must succeed at a DC 23 Will save each
      round while within the aura. Failure results in the affected creature
      taking no actions that round other than attempting to retrieve a
      glittering object from the animate hoard's mass (this action does not
      provoke an attack of opportunity). This is a mind-affecting effect. The DC
      is Wisdom-based. Guardian (Ex, 1 CP) The object is granted the ability to
      follow basic orders and watch for enemies, changing its Wisdom score to 10
      and granting it a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks.
