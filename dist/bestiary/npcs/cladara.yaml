BeforeCombat: >-
  Cladara drinks her mutagen, improving her Constitution at the expense of her
  Charisma. She applies her violet venom to her rapier, using her lasting poison
  trick to get two uses out of the dose. She drinks her elixir of hiding and
  hides behind the western table.
DuringCombat: >-
  Cladara uses a surprise round to throw a bomb at a group of PCs within 30
  feet. She then throws a stink bomb before using a smoke bomb to provide
  concealment for herself, hiding in the smoke to snipe with her bombs or strike
  adjacent enemies with her poisoned rapier. If she misses often, she hides in
  the smoke and drinks her bomber's eye or true strike extracts to hit ranged or
  melee combatants, respectively.
Morale: Cladara fights to the death.
