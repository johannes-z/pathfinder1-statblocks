    description: >-
      A giant ant lion can create a 60-foot-diameter trap in any sand or soft
      surface. Creating a sand trap takes 1 hour. A giant ant lion can make an
      attack of opportunity against any creature that falls to the bottom of its
      sand trap. These creatures can move across sand traps at their normal
      speed and are immune to these trap effects.
