DuringCombat: >-
  If the PCs attack the guards in the yard, Dovan watches for a round or two to
  judge how tough these intruders are. As soon as the PCs drop a bandit, Dovan
  releases the gate to the owlbear's cage and then flees into area Z1, luring
  the owlbear out into the open before he dodges into area Z9 to climb up to
  area Z2a, leaving the owlbear distracted by the easier-to-reach PCs. If forced
  into a fight, Dovan attempts to flank opponents, using Mobility to dance out
  of reach of immediate reprisals.
Morale: >-

  but if cornered, he fights to the death.
