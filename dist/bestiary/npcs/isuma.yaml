  Isuma uses Deadly Aim and Rapid Shot with her rifle on semi-automatic fire
  when making full attacks. If faced with multiple foes, she'll empty the
  rifle's entire capacity to make two burst attacks. She saves her grenades for
  foes who are immune to cold damage. She's holding on to the gravity grenade
  for a special emergency (see Morale, below).
Morale: >-
  Isuma wants to live long enough to avenge her fallen allies and to ensure that
  their bodies are no longer suitable as playthings and puppets for the Dominion
  of the Black. She flees if reduced to 40 hit points, hoping to rest and
  recover, but would rather use her gravity grenade on herself to destroy her
  own body if threatened with Dominion capture, rendering it useless for brain
  extraction or body theft. If Isuma stays with the party beyond the events in
  "Valley of the Brain Collectors," she proves a loyal ally and does not abandon
  her most precious resource: friends.
