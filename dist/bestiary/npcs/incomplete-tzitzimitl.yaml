SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Eclipse (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creatures in the area of an incomplete tzitzimitl's deeper darkness
      when it is created take 8d6 points of cold damage (Fortitude DC 27 half).
      A creature that takes damage from this effect becomes staggered for as
      long as it remains in the area of darkness and for 1d4 rounds after it
      leaves it. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Eye Beam (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, the incomplete tzitzimitl can fire a glowing beam of
      force from its eyes at a range of 100 feet as a ranged touch attack
      dealing 8d6 points of force damage and 8d6 points of electricity damage.
  - name: Light to Dark (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as an immediate action, the incomplete tzitzimitl can convert
      a positive energy effect that affects it into negative energy. Doing so
      transforms the entire effect, such that it affects other creatures in the
      effect as well. A tzitzimitl can transform channeled positive energy in
      this way even if the positive energy would not otherwise harm it.
DuringCombat: >-
  The tzitzimitl casts haste and moves closer to intruders on the first round of
  combat. It thereafter casts wail of the banshee, then attacks with its bites
  and eye beams.
Morale: >-
  The tzitzimitl fights until reduced to fewer than 100 hit points, at which
  point it retreats long enough for its fast healing to restore it before
  seeking  out the PCs again. When it renews its attack, the tzitzimitl fights
  until destroyed.
