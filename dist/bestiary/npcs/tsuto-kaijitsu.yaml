DuringCombat: >-
  Tsuto's main advantage in battle is his mobility. He uses Acrobatics to move
  around the battlefield and flanks foes with his goblins as he can. When facing
  spellcasters, he uses stunning fist to keep them occupied.
Morale: >-
  If brought below 8 hit points, or if all of his goblins are slain, Tsuto runs
  for his life down the smuggler's tunnel, abandoning all thought of returning
  to Nualia with his sister in tow and fleeing back to Thistletop.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds
