DuringCombat: >-
  Slingers target opponents at range with their sling staffs, preferring to
  strike at enemies not yet engaged by allies, or using tanglefoot bags against
  heavily armored opponents. If forced into melee combat, a slinger takes 5-foot
  steps backward to continue making missile attacks, switching to use a short
  sword (or using the sling staff as a club) only if he has no other choice.
Morale: A halfling slinger flees when reduced to 4 hit points or fewer.
Gear: tanglefoot bag
OtherGear: leather armor, halfling sling staff with 10 bullets, short sword
