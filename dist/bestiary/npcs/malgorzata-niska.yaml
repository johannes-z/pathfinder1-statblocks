BeforeCombat: >-
  If the PCs trigger the alarm on the barn doors, Malgorzata casts shield of
  faith, entropic shield, and divine favor on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Malgorzata casts prayer on the first round of combat, followed by casting rage
  on two of her cultists. She then activates her aura of madness, attacks with
  spiritual weapon, and uses silence or touch of idiocy against enemy
  spellcasters. If forced into melee combat, she attacks with destructive
  smites. If surrounded, Malgorzata channels negative energy, using Selective
  Channeling to exclude as many of her cultists as possible.
Morale: >-
  Malgorzata has no wish to die and flees if reduced to 10 or fewer hit points,
  abandoning her cult.
