  Katiyana casts bear's endurance, bull's strength, call lightning storm,
  eagle's splendor, entropic shield, protection from energy (fire), shield of
  faith, and spell immunity (to magic missile and spiritual weapon) before
  entering combat. She uses meld into stone to hide on the ledge above area S16
