SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Boiling Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      A demonic eidolon can scoop and hurl a handful of the fluid in the
      cauldron as a standard action. This attack is a ranged touch attack with a
      range increment of 10 feet.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sting-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4
      Str; cure 1 consecutive save.
  - name: Stitched Abomination (Ex)
    description: >-
      A demonic eidolon is affected by spells as though it were an eidolon. In
      addition, spells or effects that have a special effect against humanoids
      or demons can also affect it, albeit with a +4 resistance bonus on saving
      throws to resist the effect. For the purposes of the favored enemy class
      feature and similar abilities, the eidolon is only an outsider with the
      native subtype.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once alerted, the eidolons emerge from the cauldron and fling boiling blood at
  the interlopers. If approached, they prefer to fly to the ceiling and dive at
  vulnerable-looking targets using Spring Attack. If two or more enemies move to
  the room's lower level, the eidolons attempt to break the chains holding up
  the cauldron.
Morale: Having nowhere else to go, the eidolons fight to the death.
