SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Consumptive Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A meladaemon radiates an aura of hunger to a radius of 20 feet. Every
      round a creature begins its turn within this aura, it must succeed on a DC
      24 Fortitude save or take 1d6 nonlethal damage and become fatigued from
      extreme hunger. Creatures that do not need to eat are immune to this
      effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Daemonic wasting: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 24; onset 1 day; frequency
      1/day; effect 1d4 Con and 1d4 Cha damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Hunger (Su)
    description: >-
      A meladaemon's claw attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal
      damage as it causes sudden pangs of horrific hunger in its foe. Creatures
      that do not need to eat are immune to this effect.
Gender: Male
Bloodline: Aberrant
BeforeCombat: >-
  If alerted to combat with the urdefhan raiders in area A1 or the
  proto-shoggoth in area A2, the meladaemon shock trooper casts blur and shield
  before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The meladaemon opens battle by casting waves of fatigue on groups of PCs
  trying to storm the ramps, followed by rays of exhaustion from his wand. While
  the urdefhans fire on attackers from behind the barricades, the meladaemon
  takes to the air and targets foes with horrid wilting, lightning bolt, and
  quickened magic missile. If the PCs seem about to break through a barricade,
  the meladaemon attempts to repel them with fear. If forced into melee, he uses
  his long limbs to deliver touch spells, followed by attacks with his bite and
  claws.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 80 hit points, the meladaemon teleports to areas A7
  and A8 to sound the alarm before returning to the fight 3 rounds later, at
  which point he fights to the death.
Gear: wand of ray of exhaustion (20 charges)
