BeforeCombat: Sozothala casts false life before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Sozothala relies on his undead to enter melee and thus give him time to attack
  the PCs from afar; he casts quickened shield on the first round of combat,
  then uses spells like waves of fatigue or fear that won't harm his undead when
  they're mixed in among the PCs. In melee, he prefers to fight with his bite
  and claws, using vampiric touch as soon as he's reduced to fewer than 100 hit
  points.
Morale: Sozothala fights until destroyed.
Gear: scroll of create undead (CL 15th), wand of enervation (10 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  ring of protection +2, onyx gems worth 600 gp, spellbooks (containing all
  spells prepared, plus feeblemind, plus 5 more spells of each level from 1st to
  5th of your choice)
