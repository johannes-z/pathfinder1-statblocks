BeforeCombat: >-
  If Hyve hears the PCs coming before they spot him, he gathers up his violet
  venom and hides behind the central pillar in the pool of shallow water, hoping
  to ambush the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  Hyve opens combat with a ranged sneak attack, then resorts to throwing vials
  of violet venom as grenadelike missiles (affecting struck targets and all
  within 5 feet). If engaged in melee, he relies on Improved Feint to maximize
  his sneak attacks with his rapier.
Morale: >-
  Keeper Hyve fights until brought below 15 hit points, at which point he
  attempts to escape by leaping into the sluice (area C3) and sliding down to
  area C4. If he survives the journey, he hides in area C4 and prepares another
  sneak attack with his ranged weapon. If cornered here, he'll fight to the
  death.

  rapier, masterwork light crossbow, bolts (20), violet venom (4, see Pathfinder
  RPG Bestiary 274)
