  - name: Detect Chaos (Sp)
    description: >-
      This ability functions like a paladin's detect evil class feature, save
      that it detects chaos.

      against outsiders with the chaotic subtype, chaotic-aligned aberrations,
      and fey.
DuringCombat: >-
  Order of the Glyph Hellknights favor the use of Power Attack in combat; faced
  with foes who seem to be dependent on weapons, they won't hesitate to take
  advantage of Improved Sunder as well.
