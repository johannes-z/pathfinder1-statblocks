DuringCombat: >-
  The enforcers call out an alarm if a fight starts. Their goal in a fight is to
  chase trouble onto land or to force the miscreants into the waters below.
  Killing visitors brings too much paperwork and  investigation from the
  Korvosan Guard, so if they drop a foe, an enforcer typically ignores him and
  might even try to bandage him if she gets the chance.
Morale: >-
  The enforcers fear Devargo and his uncanny mastery over spiders almost as much
  as they value the money he pays them. As a result, they fight until reduced to
  2 hit points or fewer, only then attempting to flee to safety.
