DuringCombat: >-
  Abra is a front-line fighter. He wades into the fray with a flurry of melee
  attacks, hoping to shield allies with a wall of steel&#8211;and his body, if
  need be. He fights strategically, always helping allies to flank, using his
  hunter's bond, and calling out advice to those less used to fighting in his
  chosen terrain.
Morale: >-
  Though willing to retreat if overmatched, Abra insists on being the last one
  out of any combat, and never leaves a fallen comrade behind.

  +1 chain shirt, +1 longsword, +1 short sword, shortbow with 20 arrows, greater
  halflight charm
