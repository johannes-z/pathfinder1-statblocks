BeforeCombat: >-
  The drow hide behind the overturned tables and prepare to ambush their
  enemies. Once they hear the enemies arrive in the basement, the drow use their
  darkness spell-like abilities on the fletching of their loaded crossbow bolts
  and then drape their cloaks over their weapons to block the spell effect
DuringCombat: >-
  The drow use their stand up talent to stand as a free action, make a ranged
  attack, reload, then drop back to the ground behind cover if threatened by
  ranged attackers. After shooting any flat-footed PCs, they attempt to entangle
  their enemies with tanglefoot bags before continuing to fire their crossbows.
  When engaged in melee, the drow drop their crossbows and move to flank with
  their rapiers, hoping to allow Zolvato additional time to fire his bow at
  vulnerable targets.
Morale: Fearing punishment by Inexora, Solvox and Firanil fight to the death.
