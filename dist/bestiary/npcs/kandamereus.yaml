BeforeCombat: >-
  Kandamereus casts shield of faith, spell resistance, and invisibility purge
  before combat if he gets the chance.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kandamereus casts antilife shell at the start of combat&#8211;if he's fighting
  with the PCs, he makes sure to be in a position where this spell won't impede
  his living allies. He then focuses on casting summon monster V for the first
  few rounds, following up with his ranged damage spells or spells from his
  doomsday staff. If attacked in melee, he uses touch of darkness to cloud the
  vision of those attacking him before he attacks with slams and inflict wound
  spells.
Morale: Once combat begins, Kandamereus fights until destroyed.
Gear: doomsday staff
OtherGear: >-
  bracers of armor +5, cloak of resistance +3, ring of force shield, mithral and
  opal holy symbol of Groetus worth 800 gp
