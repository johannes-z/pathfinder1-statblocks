  - name: Bay (Su)
    description: >-
      When a shadow mastiff howls or barks, all creatures except evil outsiders
      within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or become
      panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. A
      creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same mastiff's
      bay for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial
      bonus.
  - name: Shadow Blend (Su)
    description: >-
      In any condition other than bright light, a shadow mastiff disappears into
      the shadows, giving it total concealment (50% miss chance). A shadow
      mastiff can suspend or resume this ability as a free action.
DuringCombat: >-
  A shadow mastiff uses its bay attack throughout combat, alerting most of the
  other denizens of Delvehaven that something has blundered into the lodge. They
  generally focus their attacks on any foe that carries a light source.
Morale: Shadow mastiffs fight to the death.
