BeforeCombat: >-
  The Red Raven's churlish bugbear guards wander near areas R2, keeping a keen
  ear out for any interlopers coming from the south end of the cavern.
DuringCombat: >-
  The bugbears hoot and holler in an attempt to warn their companions. They
  otherwise attempt to block the PCs from crossing the bridge at area R5. If a
  chance presents itself, they attempt to work with the human fighter Teko to
  set up effective flanking positions.
Morale: >-
  The bugbears are fanatically loyal to the Red Raven (the only human to ever
  show them kindness), and fight to the death.
