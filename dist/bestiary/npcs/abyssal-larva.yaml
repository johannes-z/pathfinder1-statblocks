SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Maggot Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, an abyssal larva can spew a stream of maggots at a single
      opponent within 20 feet. The larvae makes a +3 ranged touch attack-if it
      hits, the target is sickened for 1d4 rounds (Reflex DC 16 reduces the
      duration to 1 round). The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Tortured Mind (Ex)
    description: >-
      An abyssal larva's mind is pain and chaos. As a result, it is immune to
      mind-affecting effects. In addition, any creature that attempts to contact
      an abyssal larva with a mind-affecting effect or spell must succeed at a
      DC 18 Will save or be confused for 1 minute. The save DC is
      Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.
DuringCombat: >-
  The larva is barely intelligent, but knows that foes with large weapons hurt
  more&#8211;it focuses its attacks on the target with the biggest weapon as a
  result. It pursues foes relentlessly, but can't open doors. It also doesn't
  differentiate between PCs and the other denizens of this dungeon, and can be
  used to attack other creatures if the PCs lure it along.
Morale: The larva fights to the death.
