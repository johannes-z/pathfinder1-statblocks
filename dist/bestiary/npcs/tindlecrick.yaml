DuringCombat: >-
  Tindlecrick uses the shrubs and thickets around the house to use his bramble
  jump ability. He readies actions to attack when Faernip is flanking, so both
  of them can make sneak attacks.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, or if Faernip is slain, Tindlecrick
  flees, returning to the abandoned barn (area D2) to join Zzababa.
