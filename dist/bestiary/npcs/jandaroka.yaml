  the room's entrance. If she detects intruders, she pauses her summoning ritual
  and casts mage armor, shield, and fire shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jandaroka orders the bone devils to attack and slows down her foes with black
  tentacles before casting summon monster VI to summon 1d3+1 bearded devils.
  With these reinforcements in place, she casts offensive spells such as chain
  lightning and acid spray. She uses her dimensional steps ability to keep her
  conjured monsters between herself and any attackers.
Morale: >-
  Jandaroka fights until destroyed, confident that no one will disturb her
  phylactery hidden in area K5a.
Gear: staff of acidUE
OtherGear: >-

  with all prepared spells, silver necklace inscribed with leering devils worth
