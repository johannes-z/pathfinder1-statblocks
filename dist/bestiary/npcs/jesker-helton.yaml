BeforeCombat: >-
  Jesker casts endure elements and create food and water daily to survive while
  he waits for the PCs to arrive.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jesker's first action in combat (one he takes in the surprise round if none of
  the PCs succeeds at a Sense Motive check as detailed above) is to simply step
  forward and fall into the river of lava; as he does so, the demon abandons his
  host as an immediate action, appearing in the flesh on the lava's edge. If the
  PCs work to prevent Jesker's suicide, Jesker fights back with his spells for a
  few rounds&#8211; the demon would greatly prefer for Jesker's death to be at
  the hands of the PCs, if possible. If the PCs manage to separate Jesker from
  his demonic controller, he becomes an ex-cleric and drops to his knees in
  shame. See Development below for further implications.
Morale: While possessed, Jesker fights to the death.
