DuringCombat: >-
  Luthask prefers fighting with his axe, and particularly hates elves. He
  switches to his bow if an elven target is available, staying on the move to
  prevent attacks of opportunity and relying on his mummies to keep enemies from
  engaging him in melee in this case.
Morale: Luthask fights until destroyed.

  masterwork composite longbow with 10 +1 elf-bane arrows, headband of alluring
