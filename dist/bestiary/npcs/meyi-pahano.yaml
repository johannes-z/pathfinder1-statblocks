BeforeCombat: >-
  If she has enough time, Meyi casts defensive spells depending on what she has
  already observed about the PCs, weighing their strengths and weaknesses
  against her own. Since she is usually deep in the complex, she likely has
  ample warning to ready her defenses and lay a trap for any unwelcome visitors.
DuringCombat: >-
  She always tries to parley with or dominate her opponents before resorting to
  disintegrate or her wand of lightning bolt in combat. When fighting, Meyi
  tries to bring the combat to the Collection Chamber (area 3), knowing that the
  void crystal's energies can be used as a weapon.
Morale: >-
  Meyi is confident her phylactery can't be quickly destroyed by any invaders,
  so she fights recklessly, knowing that she will simply reform to continue her
  work if she is destroyed.
Gear: >-
  scroll of displacement, scrolls of fireball (2), scroll of mnemonic enhancer,
  wand of lightning bolt (50 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 dagger, cloak of resistance +2, control ring, headband of vast intelligence
