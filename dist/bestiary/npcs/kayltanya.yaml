SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fading (Su)
    description: >-
      Up to five times a day, Kayltanya can become ethereal for an instant as
      she is attacked by a weapon or is forced to attempt a Reflex saving throw.
      She must choose to activate this ability before the weapon's attack roll
      or the spell's effects are adjudicated. This grants her a 50% chance to
      avoid taking damage from the attack or effect.
  - name: Mantis Doom (Sp)
    description: >-
      Kayltanya can cast creeping doom as a spell-like ability three times per
      day. This version of the spell summons swarms of venomous praying
      mantises, but the effects are otherwise the same as the spell.
  - name: Mantis Form (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, Kayltanya can transform into a
      blood-red giant praying mantis, as if using vermin shape IIUM (CL 10th).
      In addition to the normal adjustments to Strength, Dexterity, and natural
      armor provided by this spell effect, she gains the giant mantis's 60 feet
      of darkvision, as well as its grab, lunge, mandibles, and sudden strike
      extraordinary abilities, but not its immunity to mind-affecting effects or
      its racial modifiers on Perception or Stealth checks. If she wields a
      magical sawtooth sabre in her hand when she transforms, the magical
      enhancements for that weapon apply to her corresponding claw attack-if she
      wields two of them, then the enhancements from each weapon apply to a
      different claw attack. She gains DR 10/ good in mantis form, and her
      mandibles impose 1 negative level on a hit (she gains 5 temporary hit
      points each time she inflicts a negative level in this way). A successful
      DC 25 Fortitude save removes this negative level.
  - name: Prayer Attack (Su)
    description: >-
      A successful DC 19 Will save resists the effects of Kayltanya's prayer
      attack. See page 145 for more details on this signature Red Mantis
      assassination style.
  - name: Red Shroud (Su)
    description: >-
      Kayltanya's red shroud persists for 10 rounds when she activates it-she
      can use this ability 5 times per day. See page 145 for more details on
      this Red Mantis defense.
  - name: Resurrection Sense (Su)
    description: >-
      Kayltanya senses if a creature she has slain within the last year has been
      restored to life, as long as they are both on the same plane.
  - name: Summon Mantis (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Kayltanya can summon an advanced fiendish giant mantis, 1d3
      fiendish giant mantises, or 1d4+1 giant mantises, as per summon monster V.
      She can mentally direct the actions of these summoned vermin as a free
      action. All mantises summoned by this spell-like ability are blood red,
      and gain no racial bonus on Stealth checks in forests.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  As soon as the castle alarm is raised, Kayltanya coats her two sabres with
  doses of oil of greater magic weapon +5. Before combat begins, she casts
  bear's endurance, cat's grace, and bull's strength, then drinks a potion of
  barkskin +5 and a potion of shield of faith +5.
DuringCombat: >-
  When combat begins, Kayltanya casts greater invisibility, then moves to a new
  location and casts haste on the second round, affecting herself and as many
  allies as possible. On the third round, she summons 1d3 fiendish giant praying
  mantises into the battle, placing them in flanking positions around intruders.
  She throws poisoned daggers if a PC is within 10 feet; otherwise, she moves to
  strike with her sabres. She assumes mantis  form before entering combat if
  there's room for her size increase. She holds off using mantis doom until she
  is sure she can use it to kill off a wounded PC.
Morale: Kayltanya fights to the death.
