  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When reduced to 0 hit points, a blood spawn's body can no longer contain
      the massive pressure of the blood it has been mutated to produce, causing
      it to explode in a spray of alchemical gore. All living creatures within
      10 feet must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or take 1 temporary
      negative level.
  - name: Sanguine Blessing (Ex)
    description: >-
      The duchess's infusions and mutagens imbue her blood spawn with
      overwhelming fury. They add their Charisma modifier as a natural armor
      bonus to AC and as a morale bonus on saving throws.
DuringCombat: >-
  The blood spawn are straightforward combatants, charging foes with their
  claws. They try to overwhelm the largest or most threatening opponents first
  with sheer numbers.
