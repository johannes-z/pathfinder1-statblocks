SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      Audbrey can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if he establishes or
      maintains a pin, he drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution
      damage. Audbrey heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for 1
      hour (up to a 145 temporary hit points) each round he drains blood.
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      Audbrey can use change shape to assume the form of a dire bat or wolf, as
      beast shape II.
  - name: Children of the Night (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Audbrey can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms,
      or 2d6 wolves. These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve him for up
      to 1 hour.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Audbrey can create spawn out of humanoids he slays with blood drain or
      energy drain. The victim rises from death as a vampire in 1d4 days. This
      vampire is under Audbrey's command and remains enslaved until its master's
      destruction. Audbrey may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than 26 Hit
      Dice; any spawn he creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed
      undead. Audbrey may free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new
      spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved
      again.
  - name: Dominate (Su)
    description: >-
      Audbrey can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action. Anyone

      ability has a range of 30 feet.
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    description: >-

      only triggers once per round, regardless of the number of attacks Audbrey

    description: >-
      As a standard action, Audbrey can assume gaseous form at will (caster
