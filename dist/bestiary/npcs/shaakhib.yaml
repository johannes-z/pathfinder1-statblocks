DuringCombat: >-
  Shaakhib's favorite tactic is to transform the ground beneath a group of
  opponents into mud via transmute rock to mud, then reverse the effect a round
  later to entomb them. Otherwise, he attacks gleefully with his scimitar, using
  his Bull Rush Strike feat and his stone curse ability to imprison enemies
  whenever possible.
Morale: >-
  If his golem is destroyed or he is reduced below half his hit points, Shaakhib
  uses his burrow speed to flee back to the Onyx Citadel, where the PCs may
  encounter him again (see area H16).
Gear: >-
  +4 breastplate, +2 adamantine scimitar, figurine of wondrous power (ivory
  goat), pearly white spindle ioun stone, 6,000 gp
