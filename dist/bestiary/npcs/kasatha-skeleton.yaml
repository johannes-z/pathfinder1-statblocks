    description: >-
      Even if completely destroyed, the undead kasatha rejuvenate after 26 hours
      pass, their bones reconstituting from nothing if need be to carry on their
      undead existence. This perpetual cycle of eternal unlife persists until
      the habitat module's sky is reactivated (see Development, below), or until
      the remains of a defeated kasatha are put in an area where the rays of the
      rising sun can strike them.
