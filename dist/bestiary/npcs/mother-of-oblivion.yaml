SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath of Madness (Su)
    description: >-
      When it is not underwater, a mother of oblivion can exhale a 60-foot cone
      of black smoke as a standard action once per minute. All creatures caught
      in this area take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage and become confused for 1d6
      rounds (a creature can attempt a DC 24 Will save to halve the Wisdom
      damage and negate the confusion effect). This is a mind-affecting poison
      effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The mother of oblivion immediately attacks anyone who swims more than 40 feet
  from the shore into the waters of the lake, and it pursues foes onto land as
  needed. If the PCs don't defeat the creature first, it will certainly attack
  them as they cross the bridge over the lake from area J to area K. Note that
  unlike most mothers of oblivion, this creature cannot make use of its
  transdimensional tentacles or warp dimensions special qualities in this
  adventure, due to the dimensional lock effect throughout the region.
Morale: The mother of oblivion fights to the death.
