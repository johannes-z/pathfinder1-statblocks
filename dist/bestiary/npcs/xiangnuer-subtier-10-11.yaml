SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adamantine Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      The claws of an underworld dragon are made of adamantine, and have the
      qualities of a weapon made form that material.
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      Xiangnuer can assume any humanoid form three times per day as if using
      polymorph.
  - name: Smoke Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      Xiangnuer can see perfectly in smoky conditions (such as those created by
      pyrotechnics).
  - name: Underworld Burrower (Ex)
    description: >-
      Xiangnuer gains a 20-foot bonus to her burrow speed. This is already
      reflected in her statistics.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Before burrowing up to the landing, Xiangnuer suppresses her frightful
  presence and casts detect magic and displacement.
DuringCombat: >-
  Should the PCs engage Xiangnuer, she no longer suppresses her frightful
  presence and immediately uses wall of stone to separate the party. She follows
  up with her breath weapon, and in later rounds she wades into melee using
  Power Attack liberally.
Morale: >-
  Xiangnuer's primary goal is to add new treasures to her hoard. If reduced
  below 60 hit points, she realizes the PCs are no easy score and attempts to
  flee by flying away at full speed, finding a spot in the shadows, and
  burrowing deep within Round Mountain.
