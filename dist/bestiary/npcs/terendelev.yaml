SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Scales (Ex)
    description: >-
      The scales shed by Terendelev at the start of this Adventure Path are
      anathema to the ravener. Any PC who carries one of these items (see "The
      Worldwound Incursion") gains a +5 bonus to his AC and on all saving throws
      against the ravener's attacks, and any damage the character deals to the
      ravener is deducted from her hit points and her soul ward simultaneously.
  - name: Vorpal Immunity (Ex)
    description: >-
      Terendelev has already been decapitated; she is now immune to further
      attacks that decapitate.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Terendelev casts greater invisibility on the first round of combat and takes
  to the air. She uses her breath weapon on the second round, then follows that
  by casting imprisonment and other spells, resorting to melee attacks only
  against foes who are capable of attacking her in melee. If reduced to 1 hit
  point so that she starts taking damage to her soul ward instead, she takes a
  round to cast sending, begging the Storm King for help, but Khorramzadeh
  ignores her cries for now, hoping to avoid a fight against the PCs before
  they've been sufficiently softened up; he intervenes only if they secure the
  Suture.
Morale: Terendelev fights to the death.
