BeforeCombat: >-
  So long as the guards have sufficient time to prepare for conflict, they drink
  their potions of shield of faith and bear's endurance, draw crossbows, and
  apply their oils of magic weapon to their crossbows and scimitars.
DuringCombat: >-
  The guards fight practically, taking cover behind nearby crates, firing at the
  PCs with their crossbows, and focusing fire against particularly vulnerable or
  threatening opponents. They don't hesitate to draw scimitars and join the
  melee if ranged attacks aren't working.
Morale: A guard flees or surrenders when reduced to 3 or fewer hit points.
Gear: >-
  oils of magic weapon (2), potion of bear's endurance, potion of shield of
  faith
