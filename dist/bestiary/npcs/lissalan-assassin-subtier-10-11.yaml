BeforeCombat: >-
  Prior to making her assault on the cathedral, the Lissalan Assassin used her
  scrolls of bear's endurance, bull's strength, and shield, drank her potion of
  protection from good, and had an ally on the other side of the portal cast
  freedom of movement and stoneskin on her (both at caster level 12th). She has
  already applied a dose of deathblade to her short sword. Additionally she paid
  to have a contingent dimension door placed on her, activated by the casting of
  any spell designed to negate an invisibility effect, upon which the assassin
  dimension doors away from the effect or possibly next to the effect's caster.
DuringCombat: >-
  The assassin attempts to use her scroll of power word stun on the first PC to
  catch her. She then moves in to coup de grace the PC as the rest of their
  party catches up. She uses greater invisibility and hide in plain sight to
  sneak attack using Spring Attack. Should the assassin identify a PC as an
  arcane caster, she uses her swift death ability to kill the PC.
Morale: >-
  Having never met a foe she couldn't best and driven by her zeal for Lissala,
  the Lissalan assassin fights until she is likely too close to death to escape.
  If reduced to 10 hit points or less, she attempts to flee.
Gear: >-
  potion of fly, potion of protection from good (CL 6th), scroll of bear's
  endurance, scroll of bull's strength, scroll of dispel magic, scroll of
  greater invisibility, scroll of mirror image (CL 9th), deathblade (2 doses)
OtherGear: >-
  +3 mithral shirt, +3 short sword, cloak of resistance +2, belt of incredible
  dexterity +2, handy haversack, 35 gp
