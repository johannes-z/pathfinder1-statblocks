SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Swarming (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ratfolk are used to living and fighting communally, and are adept at
      swarming foes for their own gain and their foes' detriment. Up to two
      ratfolk can share the same square at the same time. If two ratfolk in the
      same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that
      foe as if they were in two opposite squares.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The ratfolk guards attempt to identify anyone approaching their tower. Unless
  the PCs manage to convince the guards to engage in diplomacy, the guards open
  fire from behind the improved cover of their arrow slits. The arrow slits
  grant the ratfolk a +8 bonus to AC, a +4 bonus on Reflex saves, and the
  benefits of the improved evasion class feature.
DuringCombat: >-
  The ratfolk guards retreat deeper into the tower as needed to avoid melee for
  as long as possible. Should they be forced into melee, they use their swarming
  tactics to confuse their enemies. If one of their foes appears near death,
  they switch to nonlethal attacks (such as their blunt arrows) to drop their
  opponent, as their primary goal is simply to repel intruders.
Morale: >-
  If brought below 10 hit points, the ratfolk guards attempt to surrender with
  the hopes of escaping their capturers and retreating to their captain's
  office.
Gear: >-
  potions of cure moderate wounds (2), alchemist's fire, blunt arrows* (20),
  smokestick, tanglefoot bag
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork studded leather, buckler, masterwork composite longbow (+1 Str)
  with 20 arrows, short sword, cloak of resistance +1, 18 gp
