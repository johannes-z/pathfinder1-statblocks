BeforeCombat: >-
  Myre is paranoid and casts false life and mage armor if he doesn't already
  have them active. His current hit points include 12 points from false life.
DuringCombat: >-
  Myre lets his zombies do the work for him, hanging back to attack foes from
  range with his spells after pulling aside his leather curtain to allow him
  line of sight into area B2. All the while, he shrieks and yells phrases like,
  "Die, you filthy mercenaries!" or "You've no right to be in here!"
Morale: >-
  Myre realizes a death by mercenary is preferable to death by spawn of
  Yog-Sothoth, so he fights to the death. If captured alive, he shrieks and
  cries and babbles madly, saying things like, "It's all Crove's fault!" and "I
  can hear it coming! Kill me before it gets me!" See Part Five for advice on
  what the PCs might be able to extract from a captured Keeper.
