SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Drowning Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      A fossegrim can flood the lungs of a creature that is willing, is
      helpless, is affected by its enchanted music ability, touches it while
      it's in treasure form, or is touched by it (traditionally by kissing the
      creature on the lips). If the target cannot breathe water, it cannot hold
      its breath and immediately begins to drown slowly. On its turn, the target
      can attempt a DC 18 Fortitude save to cough up this water; if it fails, it
      falls unconscious at 0 hp. On the next round, a fallen target must attempt
      another DC 18 Fortitude save, dropping to -1 hit points and dying if it
      fails; on the next round it must attempt to save again or lose 1d6 hit
      points. On the first successful save, the water clears from the target's
      lungs and the target stabilizes. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Enchanting Music (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a fossegrim can play a musical stringed instrument
      (usually a harp or violin) and target a single creature within 45 feet
      that can hear and see the fossegrim with an effect identical to the
      unnatural lustUM spell (CL 9th; DC 20 Will save negates). This action
      provokes attacks of opportunity. If the target touches or kisses the
      fossegrim, the fey can affect the target with its drowning touch ability.
      This is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Transparency (Su)
    description: >-
      When underwater, a fossegrim's body becomes transparent, effectively
      rendering it invisible. It can become visible or transparent at will as a
      free action.
  - name: Treasure Form (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action when completely underwater, a fossegrim can create an
      illusion causing it to resemble a Medium pile of gold and silver coins,
      glittering jewels, and valuable art objects. If a fossegrim speaks, moves,
      attacks, or uses any of its special abilities or spell-like abilities
      while in treasure form, the illusion dissipates. A successful DC 20 Will
      save is required to disbelieve this illusion. If a living creature within
      the fossegrim's melee reach touches or physically interacts with the
      illusion, the fossegrim reaches out to kiss or otherwise touch that
      creature, automatically affecting the creature with its drowning touch
      ability. The fossegrim can maintain this illusion indefinitely and can
      revert to its normal natural form as a free action. This is a
      mind-affecting illusion (glamer) effect. The save DC to disbelieve is
      Charisma-based.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Brahlim detects the PCs before they detect him, he lies at the bottom of
  the pool using his treasure form ability and waits for them to approach. If
  the PCs leave without investigating the "treasure" at the bottom of the pool,
  he uses his enchanting music ability to bring them closer.
DuringCombat: >-
  Brahlim tries to separate the PCs, using aqueous orb and hydraulic torrent to
  push some PCs away, and using his slam attacks on creatures under the effects
  of his enchanting music to deliver his drowning touch. He uses his underwater
  invisibility to his advantage.
Morale: >-
  Brahlim agreed to guard the approach to the duergar settlement, but he does
  not have any particular loyalty to the draugr. He surrenders when reduced to
  17 hit points or fewer, offering the PCs the treasure at the bottom of the
  pool as well as the information he knows about the duergar in exchange for his
  life (see Development below).
