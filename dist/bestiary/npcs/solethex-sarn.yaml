DuringCombat: >-
  Solethex uses his temporal celerity oracle mystery to try to roll the highest
  initiative and to always act in any surprise round, during which he casts time
  stop. During any rounds he gains from this spell, he casts spell resistance,
  freedom of movement, magic vestment, and death ward in that order, drinking
  his potion of fly if there's time. As much as possible, he uses his oracle
  revelations and his time-affecting spells to gain an unfair advantage, such as
  using momentary glimpse to boost his spells that require attacks rolls and his
  AC and using rewind time to land blows that might turn the tide of battle. He
  is fond of keeping opponents on their heels, so he uses time hop and time
  flicker to confuse his enemies about his position. He casts damage-dealing
  spells, such as fire storm, disintegrate, and mass inflict moderate wounds to
  soften up his opponents. Once these options are exhausted, he wades into melee
  combat, focusing on dispelling his opponents' buffs and whittling away their
  defenses before dealing massive damage with his kukri.
Morale: High Master Solethex Sarn fights to the death even when severely overmatched.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of fly
