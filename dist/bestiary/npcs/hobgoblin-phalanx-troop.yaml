SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Close Ranks (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hobgoblin phalanx troop can adopt a defensive position as a move action.
      This doubles the troop's shield bonus to AC and grants it DR 5/- until the
      beginning of its next turn. While adopting this defensive posture, the
      hobgoblin phalanx troop's speed is reduced to 5 feet.
  - name: Tripping Spears (Ex)
    description: >-
      Hobgoblin phalanx troops are adept at using their spears to knock
      creatures off their feet. The troop's troop attack gains the trip weapon
      quality.
  - name: Volley (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hobgoblin phalanx troop can fire a volley of arrows as a standard
      action. This attack takes the form of up to four lines with a range of 100
      feet. These lines can start from the corner of any square in the troop's
      space. Each creature in any of these lines takes 4d6 points of piercing
      damage per line that hits it (Reflex DC 20 half). The save DC is
      Dexterity-based.
