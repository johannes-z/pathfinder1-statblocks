DuringCombat: >-
  Some of the Gardeners begin combat by making a suggestion to enemies in the
  area that they carefully remove and set aside their weapons, armor, and spell
  components so that their equipment won't be damaged. While any foes that
  remove their equipment are occupied, the Gardeners attack others in melee,
  flanking with allies when possible and using both Stunning Fist and flurry of
  blows.
Morale: Wholly dedicated to Mictena, the Gardeners fight to the death.
Gear: shuriken (5), wooden holy symbol of Pharasma, gardening tools
