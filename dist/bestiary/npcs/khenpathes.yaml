SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Coalesce (Su)
    description: >-
      Once a bonepowder ghoul has drained 5 or more points of Strength or has
      inflicted level drain via enervation, it can assume the form of a Small
      humanoid as a free action. It can maintain this form for no more than 10
      minutes before it collapses back into its dusty form. When coalesced, a
      bonepowder ghoul can manipulate objects and make physical attacks.
  - name: Dusty Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A bonepowder ghoul's normal form is a pile of powdered bone. In this form,
      it can't make bite attacks, nor can it manipulate objects, but it can cast
      spells and use spell-like abilities and its other special attacks. The
      damage it takes from physical attacks is reduced by 50% while it's in its
      dusty form.
  - name: Gravedust (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once every 3 rounds, a bonepowder ghoul can project a
      40-foot cone of grave dust. All creatures in the area must succeed at a DC
      24 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength damage and become
      infected with ghoul fever (see page 146 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary, except
      that this version of the disease has a DC 24 save to resist it). The
      bonepowder ghoul gains a temporary bonus to Strength equal to the total
      points of Strength damage dealt. This bonus lasts for 10 minutes per 5
      ability points drained or until the next time the ghoul projects a cone of
      gravedust. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Paralysis (Su)
    description: >-
      Those hit by a bonepowder ghoul's physical attacks must succeed at a DC 24
      Fortitude save or become paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Whirlwind of Bones (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a bonepowder ghoul in dusty form can
      create a small cyclone of whirling teeth and bone fragments. All living
      creatures within 20 feet of a bonepowder ghoul's whirlwind take 2d12
      points of slashing damage (no save) and 1d6 points of Strength drain
      (Fortitude DC 24 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Khenpathes starts his assault in dusty form by using his whirlwind of bones
  ability, then expels gravedust into area E17, followed by empowered enervation
  rays. He continues to target foes with his spell-like abilities, alternating
  his attacks with more gravedust and empowered enervation.
Morale: >-
  Zealously committed to serving Hakotep, Khenpathes fights until utterly
  destroyed.
