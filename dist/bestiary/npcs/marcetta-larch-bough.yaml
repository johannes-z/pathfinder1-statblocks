BeforeCombat: >-
  Marcetta hides in area F1 and awaits Beetle's signal or the sound of combat
  before attacking.
DuringCombat: >-
  Marcetta is swift and aggressive in combat, using Power Attack and her
  weapon's deadliness to neutralize targets as quickly as possible. She flanks
  with Beetle when possible but harangues the former halfling for his poor
  tactics, appearance, and other petty foibles. Marcetta dislikes spellcasters
  and tries to stay nearby to disrupt their concentration.
Morale: >-
  Marcetta fights until destroyed, and she does not permit her allies' retreat;
  if Beetle attempts to run, Marcetta targets him with an attack of opportunity.
