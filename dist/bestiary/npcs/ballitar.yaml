Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: conjuration, evocation
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ballitar keeps an extended endure elements spell going at all times and casts
  prying eyes every day to scout the area. This tactic does little to calm his
  nerves, since the dangerous creatures he's seen in the area frighten him.
DuringCombat: >-
  In combat, Ballitar's only goal is to escape and survive. He casts extended
  displacement on the first round of combat, then mirror image after that,
  moving at all times to escape a battle. He uses haste to speed his flight or
  slow to hamper pursuit as needed, and he casts shield as soon as it's apparent
  he won't be able to avoid battle.
Morale: >-
  Ballitar begs for his life if reduced to fewer than 20 hit points and no
  avenue of escape seems likely.
