SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Misfortune (Su)
    description: >-
      Every creature within 10 feet of a fortune-spurned creature gains the
      diminished criticals and unlucky strike special qualities of the
      fortune-spurned template as long as it remains within range. Furthermore,
      each such creature takes a - 4 penalty on all of its checks and saving
      throws.
  - name: Calamitous Mishap (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action once per encounter, a fortune-spurned creature can cause
      some calamity to befall itself and another creature within 5 feet of it.
      The mishap selected must be a possible result of normal circumstances, but
      it can be the worst possible result. For instance, lightning could strike
      both the fortune-spurned creature and its foe on a cloudy day, or it could
      strike a tree, causing a heavy limb to fall on both targets, but lightning
      could not strike out of a clear sky. Alternatively, ropes holding up some
      scaffolding might break, the lock on a portcullis might slip, or the floor
      of a ruined keep might give way. In some cases, the fortune-spurned
      creature might be unable to cause any calamity given its surroundings. A
      calamity cannot affect anyone other than the fortune-spurned creature and
      a single adjacent creature of its choice. Nearly any natural misfortune
      may be chosen, but it must be one that is as dangerous to the
      fortune-spurned creature as it is to the other creature. Both targets must
      be affected equally-that is, both must make the same saving throw and
      suffer the same result. Thus, if the fortune-spurned creature is immune or
      resistant to electricity, it could not choose to have lightning strike
      both it and its foe unless the foe is equally resistance to electricity.
  - name: Cursed (Ex)
    description: >-
      A fortune-spurned creature takes a - 2 luck penalty on all opposed checks
      and saves, and a -1 luck penalty on all attack rolls. These penalties are
      already figured into the creature's stats.
  - name: Diminished Criticals (Ex)
    description: A fortune-spurned creature must roll twice to confirm a critical hit.
  - name: Twist of Fate (Su)
    description: >-
      The first time in any given day that a fortune-spurned creature rolls a
      natural 20 on a saving throw, it fails the save. This twist of fate
      happens only once per day.
  - name: Unlucky Strike (Su)
    description: >-
      When a fortune-spurned creature attacks with a weapon and rolls a natural
      1, it drops the weapon unless it can make a successful Reflex save (DC 9).
      If it attacks with a natural weapon and rolls a natural 1, it provokes an
      attack of opportunity from its target, even if that creature would not
      otherwise be entitled to make one.
Gender: Male or Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  The cultists rest in the light of a single torch in the northeast corner of
  the tunnels. If they know the PCs are coming, they move back out of sight and
  wait to ambush the PCs either in the northeast corner or in the south where
  the two tunnels reconnect.
DuringCombat: >-
  The cultists are not strategic fighters-they pick the nearest target, get
  close, and attack furiously.
Morale: With no other options left to them, the cultists fight to the death.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds
