SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gout of Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a flayed angel is physically struck in battle, the impact causes
      a spray of its super-heated, sulfurous blood to fly off the creature at
      anyone within 5 feet. Anyone in the area of affect must succeed at a DC 24
      Reflex save or take 1d6 points of fire damage from this splatter. The save
      DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Profane Presence (Su)
    description: >-
      The existence of a flayed angel is such an anathema to the order of the
      multiverse that its very presence is a profanity of nature. This presence
      provides it with a +10 profane bonus to Armor Class and a +2 profane bonus
      on its saving throws.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Defiled One prefers to attack obvious paladins or worshipers of good
  deities who openly wear good holy symbols. The monster knows of the dangers
  surrounding the runestone, and while it might try to lure the PCs close, it
  avoids approaching within 20 feet of the stone itself.
