SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Consume Memory (Su)
    description: >-
      When Ogonthunn bites a creature, it consumes memories. The creature bitten
      must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or gain 1 negative level. Ogonthunn
      heals 5 points of damage each time it grants a negative level in this way,
      and also learns some of the target creature's memories (subject to the
      GM's discretion). This is a mind-affecting effect. Ogonthunn can suppress
      this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Delayed Suggestion (Sp)
    description: >-
      Whenever Ogonthunn successfully uses dominate person or dominate monster
      on a creature, it can implant a delayed suggestion that triggers when the
      dominate effect ends. This suggestion (which functions as a spell-like
      ability, CL 20th, Will DC 22 negates) is for the creature to put its gear
      somewhere safe and then spend the next 20 hours attempting to track down
      Ogonthunn and present itself to the veiled master to be re-dominated.
  - name: Mucus Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      While underwater, Ogonthunn exudes a cloud of transparent slime in a
      30-foot-radius spread. Every creature in this area must succeed at a DC 29
      Fortitude save each round or lose the ability to breathe air (but gain the
      ability to breathe water) for 24 hours. Renewed contact with this mucus
      cloud and failing another save extends the effect for another 24 hours.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Runemastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ogonthunn is particularly skilled at casting spells that create magical
      writing, such as explosive runes, secret page, or any spell with the word
      "symbol" in its name. It never requires material components or focus
      components when casting such spells, and the save DC of any of these
      spells increases by 1. Ogonthunn's symbol spells are difficult to
      disarm-the Disable Device DC for these symbols increases by 2.
  - name: Slime (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by Ogonthunn's bite or claw attacks must succeed at a DC 29
      Fortitude save or its skin and flesh transform into a clear, slimy
      membrane over the course of 1d4 rounds. The creature's new "flesh" is soft
      and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as the condition
      persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries quickly and
      the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. Remove disease
      and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but
      immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Spells Ogonthunn can cast spells as a 17th-level
      sorcerer.
  - name: Swift Transformation (Su)
    description: Ogonthunn can use its change shape ability as a swift action.
  - name: Thoughtlance (Su)
    description: >-
      Four of Ogonthunn's tentacles end in glowing spheres of light. These
      spheres deal 2d6 points of electricity damage on a successful touch
      attack, and also blast the targeted creature's mind with waves of mental
      energy&#8211;a creature touched by one of these tentacles (regardless of
      whether the touch deals electricity damage) must succeed at a DC 27 Will
      save or be staggered for 1 round. Additional touches increase the duration
      by 1 round. While a creature is staggered in this manner, it must attempt
      concentration checks to cast spells as if it were experiencing extremely
      violent motion while casting (DC = 20 + spell level). The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ogonthunn casts extended false life every day. If the veiled master suspects
  it will be confronting foes, it places symbols on the walls of its lair. If it
  wishes to capture victims alive to interrogate them (as is the case the first
  time it notices the PCs are drawing near), it uses a symbol of weakness, a
  symbol of persuasion, and a symbol of pain. If it wishes to destroy intruders
  (as is the case if the PCs return at a later point after fleeing a battle), it
  uses a symbol of death, a symbol of insanity, and a symbol of stunning.
DuringCombat: >-
  If possible, Ogonthunn begins combat from hiding, casting combat spells
  through a projected image. It casts mind fog first, followed in subsequent
  rounds by dominate monster and dominate person attacks. Foes that seem
  difficult to dominate are instead targeted with phantasmal killers, chain
  lightning, magic missiles, and rays of enfeeblement, often enhanced via
  metamagic. Since so many of its spells rely on sight, Ogonthunn prefers to
  save blindness/deafness for particularly frustrating foes who find ways to
  avoid being dominated or succumbing to symbols. When facing foes in melee,
  Ogonthunn uses Arcane Strike to gain a +4 bonus on attack damage rolls, unless
  it is brought below 120 hit points, in which case it augments its attacks with
  quickened vampiric touch.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, Ogonthunn uses teleport to flee (using
  mislead to escape in the short term if it must relocate physically to a
  location where teleportation works). After 24 hours, it returns to Xin, fully
  healed, to seek revenge.
Gear: >-
  spellguard bracersUE, ioun stones (dusty rose, orange prism, pale green prism,
  pale lavender ellipsoid, pink and green sphere), ring of evasion, ring of
  telekinesis, bejeweled armbands and rings worth 20,000 gp in all
