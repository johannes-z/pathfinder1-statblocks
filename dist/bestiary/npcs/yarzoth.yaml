  Yarzoth uses dominate person to attempt to dominate one of the PCs on the
  first round of combat while ordering her skeletons to attack. If she dominates
  a PC, she orders that character to come to her side and defend her from harm.
  While the dominated PC and skeletons keep the other PCs busy, Yarzoth casts
  blur and then mirror image. Next she uses summon monster II to summon 1d3
  fiendish vipers, then summon monster I to summon one more. When combat finally
  seems inevitable, she casts divine favor and then attacks. She uses inspiring
  word on herself or allies if they seem to be having a particularly hard time
  hitting the PCs, and touch of evil on PCs that seem to be hitting her or her
  allies easily.
Morale: >-
  If Yarzoth is reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, she touches the lips on the
  statue of Zura with a bloodied hand and gains the benefit of gaseous form. She
  then flees up through the hole in the ceiling to area Z9. Once there, she
  dismisses the effect, returning to solid form. The next round she casts
  disguise self to assume the form of one of the Jenivere's other castaways
  (preferably a woman, either Aerys or Sasha), and on the third round she uses
  major image to create an illusion of her dead body, throat cut, lying on the
  floor. Yarzoth hopes that if she can get these deceptions in place by the time
  the PCs arrive, they'll be confronted with the unexpected appearance of an old
  friend who seems to have just killed the evil serpentfolk. (If all of the
  castaways are actually with the PCs when Yarzoth fled, she of course disguises
  herself as someone else.) Yarzoth cries out for help if the PCs don't arrive
  soon&#8211;but also takes the chance to cast healing spells on herself as
  well. If the PCs fall for the deception, Yarzoth explains that they can exit
  the inner sanctum by smearing blood on the image of Zura there&#8211;she hopes
  that the PCs will unwittingly take her under their wing and help her escape to
  the mainland. Of course, by now she also realizes that she's underestimated
  the PCs, and she remains ready to attack the instant they see through her
  trickery. This time, if she's reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, she turns
  gaseous again and attempts to flee the complex altogether via the vents in the
  roof of area Z7&#8211;if she escapes in this manner, she goes into hiding in
  the jungle and stalks the PCs, hoping to strike at them again to get back her
  research if she can. In this case, you can use Yarzoth as a recurring villain
  as you see fit.
