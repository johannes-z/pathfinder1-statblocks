BeforeCombat: >-
  Atga casts false life, mage armor, and protection from energy (cold) on
  herself, and protection from energy (cold) on Formoch.
DuringCombat: >-
  Atga uses stinking cloud to disable as many enemies as possible, then uses
  wall of ice or web to separate the PCs and prevent them from attacking
  Formoch. Atga prefers disabling enemies and relies on Formoch's ability to
  deal damage, but uses fireball or scorching ray if doing so takes out a
  weakened enemy.
Morale: Atga fights to the death.
