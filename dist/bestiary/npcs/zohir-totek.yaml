BeforeCombat: >-
  Zohir uses her wand of alarm to mark the hallway above and alert her to
  intruders. If aware of interlopers, she activates her bone dance ability,
  becoming partially incorporeal.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zohir sends her wraiths forward, then uses her animate dead spell-like ability
  to turn the four corpses in her lab into zombies. After that, she relies on
  her necrotic ray and ray of enfeeblement, and uses her wand of vampiric touch
  if her enemies close in to melee.
Morale: Zohir is too close to her revenge to flee now. She fights until slain.
