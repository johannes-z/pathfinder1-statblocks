  Seoni is something of an enigma-quietly neutral on most matters, bound by
  codes and mandates she rarely feels compelled to explain, the beautiful
  sorcerer keeps her emotions tightly bottled. Extremely detail-oriented, Seoni
  is a careful and meticulous planner who frequently finds herself frustated by
  the improvised plans of her more impulsive companions.
