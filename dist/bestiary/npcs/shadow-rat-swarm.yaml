SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Incorporeal Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A shadow rat swarm can, as a standard action, assume an incorporeal form
      for up to 1 hour per day. In this form, the swarm loses its natural AC
      bonus but gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC. While in this form, the
      shadow rat swarm is AC 16 (+2 deflection, +2 Dex, +2 size), touch 15,
      flat-footed 13. The shadow rat swarm can still swarm attack corporeal
      opponents while in its incorporeal form, but its attack only inflicts
      Strength damage and cannot distract foes or cause physical damage. The
      shadow rat swarm gains the incorporeal subtype while using this ability.
  - name: Shadow Blend (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shadow rat swarm can disappear into the shadows as a move action,
      gaining total concealment in all levels of illumination save bright light.
  - name: Strength Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A shadow rat swarm deals Strength damage to living foes over which it
      swarms. A creature reduced to 0 Strength cannot move but does not die-at
      least, not until the swarm's physical damage takes its toll.
DuringCombat: >-
  The rats attack the closest target, preferring to attack foes that carry light
  sources.
Morale: The swarm fights until destroyed.
