Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Galdron is a force of rage, and he lashes out at the PC he sees as most
  responsible for the conflict with the Aspis Consortium that pushed him over
  the edge. He initiates combat with ranged attacks such as fire breath,
  fireball, searing light, sound burst, or telekinesis, then closes on his
  primary target to engage in melee with his corrupting touch or inflict serious
  wounds.
Morale: >-
  Galdron's judgment is clouded by his anger, and he fights until destroyed,
  healing himself with inflict moderate wounds to prolong the battle. See
  Development below for his actions when reduced to 0 hit points.
