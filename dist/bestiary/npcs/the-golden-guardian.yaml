    description: >-
      Whenever a sneak attack or critical hit is scored against a gold-clad
      creature, there is a 25% chance that the extra damage is negated and
      damage is rolled normally.
DuringCombat: >-
  Using Flyby Attack, the gargoyle swoops down, makes a gore attack, and
  retreats to a safe distance.
Morale: >-
  If the PCs do not use the dwarven talisman in the first  round of combat,
  remind them of its importance. Breaking open the talisman reveals a piece of
  metal with an ancient symbol engraved on it. Upon seeing it, the Golden
  Guardian immediately calms down and utters, "Welcome, friends of Ashkurhall."
  The Golden Guardian attacks the PCs until they either present the talisman or
  retreat. It does not pursue fleeing PCs.
