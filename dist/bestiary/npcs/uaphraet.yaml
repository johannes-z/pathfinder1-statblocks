  - name: Honor Bound (Ex)
    description: >-
      Uaphraet remains true to his word even millennia after he promised to
      protect the fort. As long as the Basin of Elemental Corruption remains an
      active threat, the archon loses his greater teleport spell-like ability
      and he cannot travel more than 1 mile from the site he swore to defend.
  - name: Mournful Howl (Sp)
    description: >-
      Because he is so distraught with his failure to protect his friends
      millennia ago, Uaphraet can unleash a great wail of despair so loud that
      it can stun his enemies. He gains sound burst as a spell-like ability he
      can cast three times per day.
