BeforeCombat: >-
  Yiddlepode casts invisibility from her scroll before the PCs enter and hides
  behind the curtain or the scant scene decorations during combat, maintaining
  the illusion of the dragon on her father's behalf.
DuringCombat: >-
  As long as the dragon is occupying the PCs' attention, Yiddlepode engages them
  with it as much as possible, even to the point of engaging in mock combat with
  one of them. As soon as it's clear that the PCs start recognizing the illusion
  for what it is, Yiddlepode drops the spell and starts her bardic performance
  to help boost the guards' attacks. She doesn't attack the PCs directly, and
  remains invisible or hidden throughout combat if possible. Anytime Kibizax
  turns invisible or hides, Yiddlepode uses silent image to create a fake double
  of her father to divert attacks.
Morale: >-
  When her father falls unconscious or dies, Yiddlepode tries to strike a truce
  with the PCs as indicated in the Development section below.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure light wounds, scroll of invisibility, scrolls of minor image
  (2), wand of disguise self
OtherGear: >-
  leather armor, rapier, light crossbow with 20 bolts, circlet of persuasion, 20
  opals worth 45 gp each
