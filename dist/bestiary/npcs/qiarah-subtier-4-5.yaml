  - name: Elemental Transformation (Ex)
    description: >-
      Qiarah's transformation rituals have begun to change her body to be more
      like that of an earth elemental, granting her a slam attack and a +2 bonus
      on saving throws against bleed, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and
      stunning. She takes a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls against
      creatures that are airborne or waterborne.

DuringCombat: >-

  uses glitterdust to blind PCs and spectral hand to deliver her corrosive touch
  spell.
Morale: >-

  the elemental, Qiarah fights to the death. If the PCs are allied with
  Elsharon, she surrenders if reduced to 5 hit points or fewer.
