SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Damned (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a demoniac is slain, its soul is claimed by Baphomet. Any attempt to
      resurrect a demoniac requires a successful DC 22 caster level check.
  - name: Demonic Mark (Ex)
    description: >-
      The sign of Baphomet is visible on the back of a demoniac's neck. Once per
      day as part of casting a spell, a demoniac can call upon this mark to
      infuse the spell with profane power. This causes the spell to gain the
      chaotic and evil descriptors, and causes the spell not to be expended as
      it is cast.
  - name: Energumen (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a demoniac can open its soul to demonic possession as a free
      action. This grants the demoniac a +4 profane bonus to an ability score of
      its choice, electricity resistance 10, and a +4 bonus on saving throws
      against poison. This lasts for 4 rounds, after which point the demoniac
      becomes confused for 4 rounds. As a free action, the demoniac can attempt
      a DC 25 Will save at the start of each round of confusion to try to end
      the effect. This is a possession effect.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Each day, the demoniacs enhance their glaives with greater magic weapon and
  their armor with magic vestment. The demoniacs cast bear's endurance and
  bull's strength once they realize conflict may soon arise (such as if they
  spot an approaching barge or hear the sounds of battle). They also use a wand
  of shield of faith +3 to enhance their AC.
DuringCombat: >-
  The demoniacs begin combat by casting their ranged spells, hoping to soften up
  their foes before engaging them in melee. They always start combat by using
  energumen to increase their Constitution by +4 (this bonus is included in the
  stats above) and then attempt to summon 1d3 babaus to aid them in the fight.
  On the following round, one demoniac casts sending to alert Hepzamirah that a
  battle has started and that intruders are approaching. They make frequent use
  of their ability to use their tails to retrieve items as swift actions to swap
  out wands in combat as needed.
Morale: Once combat begins, the demoniacs fight to the death.
Gear: >-
  wand of cure moderate wounds (1d10 charges), wand of dispel magic (1d4
  charges), wand of dismissal (1d4 charges), wand of shield of faith +3 (CL 6th,
  1d10 charges)
OtherGear: breastplate, +1 unholy glaive, amulet of natural armor +3
