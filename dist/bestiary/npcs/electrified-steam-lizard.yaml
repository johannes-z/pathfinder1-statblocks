SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Electricity Sense (Ex)
    description: >-
      Electrified steam lizards automatically detect any electrical discharges
      within 100 feet.
  - name: Shock (Su)
    description: >-
      Electrified steam lizards can deliver an electrical shock to a single
      opponent within 5 feet. This attack deals 1d8 points of nonlethal
      electricity damage to living opponents (Reflex DC 13 half). This save DC
      is Constitution-based. Additionally, if two or more lizards are within 20
      feet of each other, they can work together to create a lethal shock once
      every 1d4 rounds. This effect has a radius of 20 feet, centered on any one
      contributing lizard. All creatures within that radius take 2d8 points of
      lethal electricity damage for each lizard contributing to the shock, to a
      maximum of 12d8. A Reflex save (DC = 10 + the number of lizards
      contributing) halves the damage.
  - name: Steam Burst (Su)
    description: >-
      Electrified steam lizards can let forth a burst of superheated steam. This
      ability functions as the shock ability in all ways, except that it deals
      nonlethal fire damage. If a group of steam lizards works together to
      create a lethal blast, the steam persists in the area for a number of
      rounds equal to the number of participating lizards. The steam does not
      deal ongoing damage, but it obscures sight as per obscuring mist. The
      limitation of once every 1d4 rounds applies to both the cooperative shock
      ability and the steam burst; the lizards may use one of these two
      abilities once every 1d4 rounds.
DuringCombat: >-
  The lizard flies through the air, attacking the PCs with its shock or steam
  burst abilities. If a PC closes to melee with the lizard, it switches to its
  bite attack.
Morale: >-
  If the lizard is reduced to 5 hit points or fewer, it attempts to flee to
  report back to the Concordance.
