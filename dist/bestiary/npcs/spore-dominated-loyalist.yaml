    description: >-
      The loyalists are afflicted with the myceloids' purple pox disease and
      have taken 8 points of ability damage to their Constitution and Wisdom
      scores. This adjustment reduces their CR by 1. Spore-Dominated (Sp) The
      loyalists are currently under the effects of charm monster (CL 6th)
      because of the myceloids' spore domination ability.
DuringCombat: >-
  The loyalists immediately cast gravity bow and fire their longbows at lightly
  armored targets. Against heavily armored halflings or humans, the loyalists
  switch to their bane arrows.
Morale: >-
  The two loyalists at the top of the slope each take a single shot with their
  bows before pulling back to take advantage of the traps in area G2. The
  remaining loyalists attempt to shoot down enemies as best they can, but pull
  back to area G2 after 3 rounds. The loyalists make their final stand in that
  area, fighting to the death under the effects of spore domination.
