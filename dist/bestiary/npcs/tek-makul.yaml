BeforeCombat: Tek Makul drinks a potion of barkskin before entering combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tek Makul rages at the start of a fight, and usually uses his intimidating
  glare on the first round in an attempt to end a combat before it even begins.
  If this doesn't work, the man is only too willing to follow the attempt by
  leaping into combat. He focuses his attacks on humans if he can, but he won't
  continue the fight once his foes drop. Living prisoners serve him better than
  dead ones, as he can turn them over to the Technic League for rewards.
Morale: >-
  Tek Makul fights to the death while raging, but otherwise flees Starfall if
  reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, abandoning his cousin to his fate.
Gear: potions of barkskin +4 (2)
OtherGear: >-
  +2 chainmail, +2 shock greataxe, amulet of natural armor +1, belt of
  incredible dexterity +2, ring of protection +1, gravity clipTG
