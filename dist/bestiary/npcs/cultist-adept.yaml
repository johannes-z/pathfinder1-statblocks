  The cultists cast mage armor and shield and drink their potions of
  displacement immediately before their attack on the Cathedral of Abadar.
DuringCombat: >-
  The cultists' goal is to slow down the PCs and prevent them from catching the
  assassin. Half of the cultists use their scrolls of summon monster V to summon
  bearded devils. The other half use spells like stinking cloud, sleet storm,
  and web to slow the party's advancement.
Morale: Driven by their loyalty to Lissala herself, the cultists fight to the death.
