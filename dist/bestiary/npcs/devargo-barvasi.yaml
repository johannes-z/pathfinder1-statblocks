BeforeCombat: >-
  Devargo coats the blades of both of his spiked gauntlets with medium spider
  venom.
DuringCombat: >-
  Confident and brave, Devargo begins combat by opening the trap door and
  dumping anyone standing on it into area C15. Once the trap door is triggered,
  Devargo leaps into the battle with his gauntlets, grinning sadistically as he
  fights. His enforcers are used to the sounds of battle and fights in the
  throne room and they don't respond until Devargo raises the alarm or until the
  first hopeful thug flees into area C2. Once this occurs, enforcers arrive in
  this area at the rate of one every round until all 10 enforcers on duty in
  Eel's End have arrived.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, Devargo calls out for help from his
  enforcers, drinks his potion of invisibility, and then flees downstairs. He
  drinks his potion of  cure moderate wounds as soon as possible and barricades
  himself in his quarters in area C14, hoping his enforcers can finish off the
  fight for him.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of invisibility, medium spider venom
