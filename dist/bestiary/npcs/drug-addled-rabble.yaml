    description: >-
      The rabble can unleash a fusillade of broken bottles and improvised
      projectiles as a standard action. This attack takes the form of up to two
      lines with a range increment of 20 feet. These lines can start from the
      corner of any square in the troop's space. All creatures in each of these
      lines' areas of effect are hit for 4d4+4 points of bludgeoning damage each
      (Reflex DC 20 half). The save DC is Dexterity-based, and includes the
      bonus from the troop's Ability Focus feat.
