BeforeCombat: The Brinebrood Queen casts barkskin and speak with animals before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Queen uses her wand of summon nature's ally II to summon an octopus (she
  never summons a squid) to attack foes, then casts entangle against groups and
  chill metal against any armor-wearing opponents. The Queen stalks prey through
  the rot-infested soup of her lair, flanking with the Whale and attacking with
  her vindictive harpoon.
Morale: >-
  The Brinebrood Queen fights to the death so long as her beloved child
  survives. If the Whale is slain, however, she uses her jet ability to flee
  Riptide Cove for the deep waters of the sea.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, wand of summon nature's ally II (12 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  vindictive harpoon (+1 returning harpoon; see page 59), lobster pot containing

  silver dagger, a rusting masterwork cold iron sickle, a scrimshaw blade of
  great workmanship depicting an octopus worth 125 gp, and 12 other blades of
  varying shape and quality
