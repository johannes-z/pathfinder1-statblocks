BeforeCombat: >-
  Maga Szuul consumes his mutagen before combat begins, taking on a troll-like
  appearance.
DuringCombat: >-
  Maga Szuul starts combat by drinking an extract of invisibility, then follows
  that in the succeeding rounds by drinking extracts of barkskin, resist energy,
  enlarge person, and haste. He prefers to fight at range with bombs, his wasp
  nest of swarming, or vomit swarm, using them as breath weapons when he would
  otherwise trigger attacks of opportunity. He uses his healing extracts
  whenever he's reduced below 25 hp, but drinks a second extract of invisibility
  if possible before then so he can heal in relative safety.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, Maga Szuul does his best to flee to
  safety.
