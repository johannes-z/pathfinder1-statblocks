DuringCombat: >-
  Once battle begins, Sevestra uses her challenge ability on the most
  capable-looking melee fighter. After 3 rounds or once she's reduced to fewer
  than 80 hit points, a shield archon (if one still lives) uses its transpose
  ally ability to swap places with her, at which point she calls her mount
  Silvermane to her side to mount up. She prefers to fight with her glaive,
  maintaining reach as she can.
Morale: >-
  Sevestra fights until she is reduced below 20 hit points, at which time she
  casts dimension door, teleporting to area B7 with Silvermane, where she
  defends the fountain to her death.
Gear: >-
  +3 full plate, +1 holy glaive, mwk composite  longbow (+3 Str) with 20 arrows,
  mwk longsword, belt of mighty constitution +2
