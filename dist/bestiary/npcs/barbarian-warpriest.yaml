BeforeCombat: >-
  If Aran Thokskaw warns the barbarians that the PCs approach, the warpriests
  cast barkskin on themselves. As the PCs approach, they cast shillelagh on
  their quarterstaves.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once all his buffs are in place, each warpriest enters a rage and charges into
  combat, using his sure-footed ability to move at full speed and tumble on the
  otherwise difficult mountain terrain. The warpriests prefer melee combat, but
  don't hesitate to use ranged attacks, including lightning arc, if PCs are too
  far out of reach.
Morale: >-
  Fanatical and fully dedicated to Cailleach, barbarian warpriests fight to the
  death.
