BeforeCombat: >-
  Tup prefers avoiding fights, instead setting his fires and running to watch
  their beauty from a safe distance. If confronted, he tries to intimidate
  opponents into backing down first.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tup loves to burn things, friends and foes alike. If feeling playful, he uses
  beguiling gift to offer a potion of hideous laughter or a lit fuse grenade,
  but more often he simply turns to his favorite spell: burning hands. When
  spells run out, he instead lobs alchemist's fire.
Morale: >-
  Despite his bluster, the Terrible Tup is an unmitigated coward and flees if no
  one seems impressed or awed by his pyrotechnics.
