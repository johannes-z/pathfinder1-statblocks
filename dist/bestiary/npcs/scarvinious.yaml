BeforeCombat: >-
  If Scarvinious expects combat, he takes 2 rounds to apply a dose of greenblood
  oil to each of his swords (if being attacked), or to two arrows (if stalking
  prey), then drinks his potion of bear's endurance.
DuringCombat: >-
  Scarvinious begins combat by firing arrows, targeting obvious arcane
  spellcasters (having inherited the hobgoblin disdain for "elf magic"), but he
  ultimately looks to close to melee and confront the biggest and
  toughest-looking opponent. He expects defeating any obvious group leader will
  break his enemies' spirits, and pauses to intimidate any nearby creatures
  after his first kill.
Morale: Scarvinious fights to the death.
