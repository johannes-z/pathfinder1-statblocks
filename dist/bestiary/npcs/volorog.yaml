DuringCombat: >-
  Volorog attacks flat-footed foes in the first round of combat in order to
  maximize his sneak attack damage. After combat is fully under way, the
  faceless stalker moves to fight adjacent to walls to prevent foes from
  flanking him.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 6 hit points, Volorog attempts to flee into the
  swamp. He won't pursue foes into area G5, and if faced with a foe who uses
  poison or snakes, he attempts to flee immediately, regardless of how many hit
  points he has.
