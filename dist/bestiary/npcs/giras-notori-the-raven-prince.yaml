SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Permanent Spells (Sp)
    description: >-
      Notori has made darkvision and see invisibility permanent on himself by
      casting the spells from scrolls with his Use Magic Device spell.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Notori prepares his sai, Tsuruhashi, with dragon bile and drinks his potion of
  heroism before any anticipated fight.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Notori drinks his potion of haste and uses his
  invisible blade ninja trick to disappear from sight. He then studies a single
  opponent in preparation for an assassinate attack. Once in position to execute
  a sneak attack, Notori deals a deadly blow while activating Tsuruhashi's
  silence effect on his victim. He feints to make repeated sneak attacks coupled
  with bleeding attack. Against grouped attackers, Notori uses his poisoned sand
  tube to disperse nightmare vapor in their midst. If seriously injured, he uses
  his cape of the mountebank to escape, preferably to seek healing from one of
  his allies. Thereafter, he relies on Combat Expertise and Spring Attacks to
  limit his opponents' opportunities to strike back at him.
Morale: >-
  A paid assassin, Giras Notori feels little loyalty to Anamurumon and the Jade
  Regent. Because of this, he always holds 1 ki point in reserve to turn
  invisible or hurl a smoke bomb and slip away undetected if things go bad. He
  implements this strategy as soon as the PCs succeed in slaying both the Jade
  Regent and Anamurumon.
Gear: >-
  potion of haste, potion of heroism, dragon bile (3 doses), nightmare vapor (3
  doses)
