SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Shadow Clone (Su)
    description: >-
      The ninja can create 1d4 shadowy duplicates of herself that conceal her
      true location. This ability functions as mirror image, using the ninja's
      level as her caster level. Using this ability is a standard action that
      uses up 1 ki point.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: Omoyani drinks her potion of shield of faith before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Omoyani makes sneak attacks with earthfire shuriken, using a flurry of blows
  if possible. She then targets an archer or spellcaster with a blowgun dart
  poisoned with black lotus extract, continuing to attack with poisoned darts or
  shuriken until engaged in melee, at which point she activates her shadow clone
  ability and attacks with unarmed strike flurries of blows and stunning fist
  attacks.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, Omoyani uses her vanishing trick to
  disappear and escape, later returning to follow the PCs and ambush them at an
  opportune moment. If captured, Omoyani dies soon after, a result of the blood
  geas she has sworn to Kimandatsu (see page 10).
Gear: >-
  potion of shield of faith (+2), black lotus extract (1 dose), deathblade (2
  doses)
OtherGear: >-
  Deadly Kiss (+1 dagger; see page 60), earthfire shuriken (3; +1 flaming burst
  shuriken; see page 60), blowgun and 10 darts, shuriken (5), shozoku of the
  night wind (see page 60), masterwork thieves' tools
