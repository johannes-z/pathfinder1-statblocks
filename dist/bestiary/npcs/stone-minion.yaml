SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Earth Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone minion gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both she and
      her foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne,
      the stone minion takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls.
  - name: Immunity to Earth Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone minion is immune to all spells and spell-like abilities with the
      earth descriptor, including spells of the Earth domain. She is also immune
      to the supernatural abilities of creatures with the Earth subtype.
  - name: One with the Earth (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone minion is so closely tied to the earth that any damage she takes
      from the natural attacks of a creature with the Earth subtype or a
      creature made primarily from stone or earth (such as a stone golem or clay
      golem) is treated as nonlethal damage.
DuringCombat: >-
  Both of these animated minions move to attack anyone they believe is
  attempting to enter the foyer, but make no hostile moves until then or until
  they are attacked. They always fight with Power Attacks unless they
  consistently miss with their weapons.
Morale: The stone minions fight until slain.
