    description: >-
      Nemgedder's pistols are those he used in life, and as sonic pistols, they
      function slightly differently in his hands than those normally carried by
      a pale stranger. While these pistols are timeworn, while carried by
      Nemgedder they function normally and do not glitch. The pistols
      supernaturally recharge the instant they are used, and both function as +1
      sonic pistols. He doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity when he fires a
      pistol in melee, and treats pistols as light weapons for the purposes of
      determining penalties from two-weapon fighting. If Nemgedder is destroyed
      or disarmed, the sonic pistol reverts to its normal timeworn nonmagical
      (but fully charged) condition.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  In his tormented state, he sees the first PC he lays his eye sockets on as his
  old nemesis and does his best to gun that PC down. He uses Deadly Aim with his
  attacks at all times&#8211;the effects of this are calculated in his stats
  above.
Morale: >-
  Nemgedder fights until he's destroyed but does not pursue foes out of area J2.
  If confronted with Maura's wayfinder from area E6 (even if he sees the item
  being openly worn), though, Nemgedder is overcome with guilt and drops to his
  knees, begging "Maura" (the PC wearing or brandishing the wayfinder) for
  forgiveness for abandoning her. If that PC forgives Nemgedder, the pale
  stranger sighs in relief, then collapses to the ground, destroyed. If the PC
  does not forgive Nemgedder, he becomes obsessed with rage and attacks "Maura,"
  gaining a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against that character. In this
  event, he pursues that character beyond area J2.
