Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If aware of imminent combat, Hyrokkin casts unholy aura on herself and the
  temple priest, and then activates her ring of invisibility so she can surprise
  intruders.
DuringCombat: >-
  Hyrokkin begins combat by casting horrid wilting before switching to melee
  attacks. She prefers tearing apart a weak opponent as a show of strength
  before moving on to a strong one. She saves her smite good ability to use on
  the opponent that shows her the most resilience. She casts blasphemy if she
  thinks her opponents are much weaker than she, and unholy blight if she thinks
  at least two opponents are weak enough to be killed by it.
Morale: >-
  If Hyrokkin brought to 40 hp or below, she flees to her mother's room (area
  F4) for help.
