SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Around Vision (Ex)
    description: A blood orchid sees in all directions at once. It cannot be flanked.
  - name: Blood Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      On a successful grapple check with two or more tentacles against a single
      foe a blood orchid can pull the grappled creature to the mouth on its
      underside as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
      The mouth latches on and drains blood from the victim. Each round it
      maintains its grapple, the blood orchid automatically deals 1d4 points of
      bite damage and 1 point of Constitution damage as it drains its victim's
      blood.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Tentacle-injury; save DC 21 Fort; frequency 1/ round for 4 rounds; effect
      unconsciousness; cure 1 save. Spells: The blood orchid savant replaces its
      bloodline bonus spells with the following: cure light wounds (3rd), cure
      moderate wounds (5th), cure serious wounds (7th). Also, blood orchid
      savants do not cast spells in the same way most creatures do. Their spells
      require no verbal or material components to be cast, though somatic
      components (tentacle writhing) is still required.
  - name: Telepathic Bond (Ex)
    description: >-
      Blood orchids communicate through a non-magical telepathic bond. They can
      sense emotions in other blood orchids at a distance of 100 ft. or less,
      and emotions in other creatures at a range of five feet. They can
      communicate mentally with each other through full telepathy at a distance
      of 20 ft. or less, and can share knowledge very rapidly when touching each
      other.
