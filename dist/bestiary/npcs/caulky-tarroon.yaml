DuringCombat: >-
  Caulky does her best to avoid combat with the PCs and escape out the window.
  If cornered and unable to flee, she uses her Improved Feint feat to feint as a
  move action, and makes a sneak attack against the flat-footed opponent with
  her dagger.
Morale: >-
  Caulky fights like a cornered rat, but if the opportunity to escape presents
  itself, she takes it and flees.
