    description: >-
      Jathyl was once the ruler and protector of her forest, and she maintains a
      commanding air. Once per round, as a standard action, she may control one
      living creature as per the spell dominate monster, with a range of 30
      feet. She may only dominate one creature at a time, and any creature that
      successfully saves is immune to her influence for 24 hours. Variant Dryad
      Because of her dedication to the protection of her forest, Jathyl's
      spell-like abilities are different from those of a standard dryad, and she
      considers druid spells as being on her spell list for purposes of using
      spell completion and command word magic items. Additionally, she may sense
      any part of here tree at any range, as long as it is on the same plane, or
      unless a protection from evil spell wards it.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: Verdant*
BeforeCombat: Jathyl prepares for battle by casting invisibility.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jathyl is driven by passions, not tactical calculations. Using feathers (e.g.,
  arrows, summoned angels, or birds), disfiguring any part of her tree, or
  channeling positive energy enrages Jathyl. She focuses her wrath on such
  transgressors, taking unnecessary risks to punish them. Jathyl opens with
  plant growth and entangle if necessary to drive the PCs away from her tree.
  Otherwise, she begins combat with a lightning bolt, then fights in melee with
  her corrupting touch attack. She employs telekinesis (violent thrust) to hurl
  away any annoying weapons. She starts the battle supremely confident of her
  mastery over the situation, not hesitating to stand toe-to-toe with the
  party's warriors. However, if any PC successfully casts ghostbane dirge, uses
  a ghost touch weapon, or reduces her to half her normal hit points before she
  drops any PC, she attempts to dominate that PC with influence, turning him
  against his allies.
Morale: >-
  Jathyl fights until destroyed. As she dies, she whispers, "Your corpses will
  burn when I return from death." Her body dissolves into a pinpoint of ghostly
  light that drifts toward the temple and into the roots of her tree.
Gear: wand of stone shape (42 charges)
