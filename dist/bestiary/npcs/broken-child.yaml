  - name: Wraith Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      The broken children are spawn of the wraith Brother Swarm and are under
      his control. As such, they are smaller and weaker than normal wraiths. If
      Brother Swarm is destroyed, they become full-sized, free-willed wraiths
      with no penalties.
DuringCombat: >-
  A wraith spawn concentrates attacks upon individual PCs, such as those caught
  in traps or at the edges of the group. If attacked, a wraith spawn flees and
  returns again to attack the same foe when it is safe.
Morale: >-
  A wraith spawn flees if reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, but if encountered
  in its home, it attacks until destroyed.
