Source: NPC Guide
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Fadil prefers to avoid combat whenever possible. If he cannot escape in
  disguise, he attempts to use his slow reactions ability and flee. He tries
  diplomacy first if he has even a few seconds to try to talk his opponents out
  of killing him.
DuringCombat: >-
  If forced to fight, Fadil tries to feint the opponent who looks physically
  strongest and then disable him with a sneak attack. Fadil knows he cannot take
  many direct hits, so he fights defensively whenever attacking.
Morale: >-
  Fadil runs at the first opportunity unless it means abandoning his product. He
  tries his best to negotiate if his pesh is on the line, fleeing only if it
  becomes apparent that to stay would mean death. He is willing to offer some of
  his product, information, or services in exchange for his hide.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds
OtherGear: >-
  +1 leather armor, masterwork light crossbow with 20 bolts, masterwork dagger,
  pieces of various disguises, 560 gp (mostly in the form of pesh, if it is
  legal to carry)
