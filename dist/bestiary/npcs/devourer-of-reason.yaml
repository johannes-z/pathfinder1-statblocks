SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Black Motes (Sp)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, the Devourer of Reason can summon a rain of tiny
      meteorites that fall in a 5-foot column, 30 feet high, with a range of 30
      feet. The meteors deal 1d4+1 points of cold damage (DC 15 Reflex negates).
  - name: Bloodline Arcana (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever the Devourer of Reason casts an evocation spell, it may select
      one affected target that fails its save to suffer the choking airlessness
      of the void, silencing it (as silence, but affecting only the target) for
      1 round.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Ghoul Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 15; onset 1 day; frequency 1 day;
      effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC
      is Charisma-based. A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at

BeforeCombat: >-
  When it realizes that the adventurers are making their way up to the vault,
  the Devourer of Reason uses its web scroll on the floor just inside the
  vault's entrance (it must make a DC 4 caster level check to successfully use
  the scroll because its caster level is lower than the scroll's), drinks its
  potion of invisibility, and hides in the corner, waiting to attack the first
  creature with its back turned.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Devourer of Reason targets clustered opponents with burning hands, and
  tries to take out divine casters first, silencing them with its bloodline
  arcana power.
Morale: The Devourer of Reason fights until destroyed.
