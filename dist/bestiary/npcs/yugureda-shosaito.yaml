BeforeCombat: >-
  Yugureda casts alarm on the secret door in area G4 and false life and mage
  armor on himself every morning. Once this alarm is triggered, he drinks his
  potion of cat's grace and casts shield and stoneskin. Finally, he readies a
  swift action to topple the vase full of pearls on the table.
DuringCombat: >-
  Yugureda casts displacement on the first round of combat, followed by summon
  monster VI to summon a shadow demon. Thereafter, he attacks enemies with his
  spells while the shadow sentinels engage them in melee. If necessary, Yugureda
  uses his arcane bond to cast finger of death against a particularly dangerous
  foe. If cornered, Yugureda uses his shadow step ability to escape from danger
  and reposition himself to renew his attacks.
Morale: >-
  After almost 3 decades as a merchant and spellcaster, and after the tragic
  outcome of his latest experiment, Yugureda has lost interest in both the
  mundane world and the Shadow Plane. He shrugs wearily and fights to the death.
