  - name: Spit Supplies (Ex)
    description: >-
      The supply sack has two main pouches; one filled with weapons and the
      other with alchemical items. Each time the sack uses spit supplies, it
      makes each of the following attacks against a random target within 30
      feet. The alchemical items do not deal the typical splash or ongoing
      damage, and instead function as listed below. It also spits a variety of
      vials of liquid that have no effect on their targets. 1: longsword +3
      (1d8+6/19-20) 2: club +3 (1d6+6) 3: alchemist's fire +3 touch (1d6+6 fire)

      penalty on any attempt to escape its grapple.
