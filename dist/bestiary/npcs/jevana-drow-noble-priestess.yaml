SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      Drow are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally
      poisoning themselves. Jevana does not carry poison.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Jevana prepares for battle by casting freedom of movement and shield of faith
  on herself (giving her AC 25, touch 17, flat-footed 21). Her earlier casting
  of status includes her drider ally in this room.
DuringCombat: >-
  The priestess is brutal and decisive, having dealt with many betrayals and
  attempted coups within her noble house. She casts greater command (halt), then
  uses her feather token to attack an unarmored person (preferably a
  spellcaster), then casts unholy blight, bestow curse (&#8211;4 penalty) on a
  meleeoriented opponent, hold person on anyone who has broken free of her
  greater command, and otherwise stays out of melee range and uses hand of the
  acolyte (+10 attack bonus) or cures her allies with her wand. She channels
  negative energy if there are no allies in range who would be harmed by it, or
  uses Channel Smite with melee attacks.
Morale: >-
  If gravely injured, she casts cure critical wounds on herself and tries to
  blanket the area in deeper darkness so she has a few rounds to heal herself
  with cure serious wounds or her wand. If she thinks she will be killed, she
  uses her scroll of word of recall to return to her temple sanctuary and plot
  her revenge against the PCs.
Gear: >-
  mwk rapier, unholy symbol/brooch of shielding, 20 points), feather token
  (whip), scroll of word of recall, wand of cure moderate wounds (4 charges)
OtherGear: mwk breastplate, 300 gp
