DuringCombat: >-
  Garmen's first attack is against a flat-footed foe if possible. He drinks his
  potion of invisibility on the next round, repositions himself, and then sneak
  attacks the most wounded enemy he can reach. After this, he uses Improved
  Feint or flanking to maximize further sneak attacks.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 10 or fewer hit points, Garmen drinks another potion of
  invisibility and then flees. He returns to Silverdisk Hall and plots revenge
  against the PCs, but if they show up looking for him before he can recover
  from his fight, he tries to avoid them. If cornered, Garmen surrenders and
  begs for mercy if reduced to 5 or fewer hit points.
Gear: potions of invisibility (2)
