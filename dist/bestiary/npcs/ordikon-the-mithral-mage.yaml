BeforeCombat: >-
  Ordikon starts every day by casting extended false life, mage armor, and
  unseen servant. In the event that he hears combat nearby (or if he hears any
  of the golems in area G4 activate), he takes the time to cast the following
  spells before investigating: shield, stoneskin, fly, protection from energy
  (electricity), cat's grace, and expeditious retreat.
DuringCombat: >-
  If caught off guard, Ordikon uses dimension door to travel to area G8, casts
  his short-term defensive spells as outlined above, then returns to G6 to
  confront the PCs. He always opens by casting disintegrate on any obvious
  clerics, along with a quickened mirror image.

  Ordikon fights until reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, whereupon he uses
  dimension door to travel to area G8. If confronted there, he fights to the
  death.
