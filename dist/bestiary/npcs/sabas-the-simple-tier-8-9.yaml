  If he hears the PCs approaching the citadel, Sabas moves down from his lair on
  the top floor, casting ventriloquism and then invisibility.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once the PCs are in the citadel, Sabas uses rude comedy to inspire courage in
  his allies. He follows that with confusion, then casts web (with his wand) to
  separate casters from their confused allies and trap them in melee. He
  inspires greatness if an ally is attacked by multiple PCs.
Morale: Sabas flees if he's reduced to 15 hit points.
