    description: >-
      Before Grasping Storm fell out of Hshurha's favor, the elemental lord
      granted the belker a measure of air blast as a ranged attack with a range
      of 120 feet. It gains a daily pool of 10 points, which it can spend as a
      free action for any of the following effects. It must choose how many
      points it wants to spend before rolling its attack roll. Grasping Storm
      gains a +2 bonus on combat maneuvers that it makes as a part of using this
      ability. &#8226; Grasping Storm can spend 1 or more points to enhance its
      air blast with the ability to push its target back. This functions as a
      bull rush combat maneuver, except that it can push the target back a
      maximum distance of 5 feet for every point that the belker spends. &#8226;
      Grasping storm can spend 3 or more points to drag its target closer. If it
      succeeds at a combat maneuver check against a creature of size Large or
      smaller, that creature is pulled 15 feet closer to it, plus an additional
      10 feet for every point that the belker spends.
  - name: Smoke Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      A belker using its smoke form ability can enter a target's square as a
      standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target
      must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or inhale part of the creature. Smoke
      inside the victim solidifies into a claw and attacks the target from
      within, dealing 3d4 points of damage per round as a swift action. If the
      target moves, the belker may automatically move with the target (this
      movement does not count toward the belker's movement and does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity against the belker). Each round, the target can
      attempt another DC 17 Fortitude to cough out the belker's smoke, which
      ends the smoke claws attack and forces the belker into an adjacent square.
      Creatures that do not need to breathe are immune to this attack. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Smoke Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A belker can switch from its normal form to one of pure smoke or back
      again a swift action. It can spend up to 20 rounds per day in smoke form.
      In smoke form, the belker acts as if under the effects of a gaseous form
      spell, except that it retains its natural fly speed of 50 feet (perfect).
DuringCombat: >-
  Grasping Storm stays at a distance, using its mobility and air blasts to keep
  opponents away. It pulls weak-looking foes to itself, then either savages them
  in melee or uses smoke form and claws to tear them apart from within. It
  pushes stronger foes into the hurricane, or orders a sylph to physically
  impede.
Morale: >-
  Grasping Storm would rather die than submit to physical beings, and fights to
  the death.
