BeforeCombat: Before combat starts, Lyrie casts mage armor.
DuringCombat: >-
  Lyrie knows she's outclassed in most fights, and prefers to avoid combat when
  alone if possible. If forced into combat, she first casts mirror image, then
  focuses most of her spells on heavily armored characters, casting shatter on a
  weapon and ray of enfeeblement in an attempt to get them to suffer for wearing
  such heavy armor. She relies heavily on her wand of magic missile in combat.
Morale: >-
  Lyrie is a coward at heart, and as soon as she's hit for damage, she attempts
  to flee to the closest ally for help. If she believes the PCs have harmed
  Tsuto, though, her anger takes over and she fights to the death in an attempt
  to avenge him.

  image, scroll of see invisibility, scroll of sleep, scroll of whispering wind,
  wand of magic missile (38 charges)
