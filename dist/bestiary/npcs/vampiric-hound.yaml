DuringCombat: >-
  The vampiric hound begins combat by baying. The walls of this room block the
  bay's effects from affecting creatures in nearby rooms, but don't block the
  sound entirely. If she hasn't already been defeated, Aluceda comes to
  investigate this room in 1d4+2 rounds. After it bays, the vampiric hound moves
  to attack the creature closest to its mistress's coffin, making slam attacks
  on rounds during which it can't make full attacks.
Morale: >-
  The vampiric hound fights to the death. If defeated, it becomes gaseous and
  retreats to its coffin in area E12.
