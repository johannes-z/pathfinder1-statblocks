SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Size Alteration (Su)
    description: >-
      At will, as a standard action, a spriggan can change its size between
      Small and Large. Weapons, armor, and other objects on the spriggan's
      person grow proportionally when it changes size (objects revert to normal
      size 1 round after a spriggan releases them). When a spriggan becomes
      Large, its speed increases to 30 feet, and it gains +12 Strength, -2
      Dexterity, +6 Constitution, and a -2 size penalty to its AC. While Large,
      a spriggan cannot use its sneak attack or its racial spell-like abilities
      (although if it possesses either from class levels or templates, it
      retains their use in both sizes).
  - name: Spriggan Magic (Ex)
    description: >-

      for all of its racial spell-like abilities.
