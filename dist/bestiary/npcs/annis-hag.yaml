BeforeCombat: >-
  One of the hags cast alter self to assume the guise of an injured guard. She
  bangs away on the door and cries to be let in. If she makes it inside, she
  approaches a healer for help. The other hag waits until the first has been let
  in, and then crashes through a nearby outside wall (DC 18 Strength check) and
  attacks.
DuringCombat: >-
  If the hags see obvious spellcasters or archers among the PCs, one of them
  drops fog cloud on the first round of combat. The hags stick together and try
  to flank one PC at a time if possible.
Morale: Summoned and enchanted by the alabaster urn, the hags fight to the death.
