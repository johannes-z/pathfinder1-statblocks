SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Never Far Behind (Su)
    description: >-
      A number of times per day equal to its Charisma modifier, a feargaunt can
      teleport to a square adjacent to a creature that is still shaken from the
      feargaunt's nightmare aura or damaged by its tormenting touch. This
      ability functions as greater teleport. This ability functions only if the
      feargaunt and the creature are both in the Dimension of Dreams.
  - name: Nightmare Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A feargaunt is cloaked in a 60-foot-radius aura of fear, which manifests
      as darkened shadows, subtle rot, and skewed perspective. The first time a
      creature ends its turn within the aura, it must succeed at a DC 20 Will
      save or be shaken for as long as it stays within the aura and for 1d4
      rounds thereafter. Creatures within the aura suffering from any fear
      effects automatically fail Charisma checks to attempt impossible feats.
      The feargaunt can suppress or reactivate this aura as a swift action. If a
      target succeeds at its saving throw, it cannot be affected again by the
      aura for another 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Prideful Defense (Su)
    description: >-
      A feargaunt gains a deflection bonus to its Armor Class equal to its
      Wisdom modifier, in addition to the deflection bonus an incorporeal
      creature normally receives based on its Charisma modifier.
  - name: Tormenting Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      A feargaunt's touch is an incorporeal touch attack that deals 6d6 points
      of damage and bypasses damage reduction. A creature that is suffering from
      a fear effect and is struck by the feargaunt's tormenting touch also takes
      1d2 points of Charisma bleed damage. This bleed damage can be stopped as
      normal, but also stops when the subject is no longer suffering from a fear
      effect.
