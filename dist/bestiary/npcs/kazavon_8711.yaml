SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability, granted to Kazavon by Zon- Kuthon, allows the blue dragon to
      assume the form of a human man at will. He always assumes the same form-
      stats for Kazavon in this guise appear on page 449.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Ex)
    description: >-
      If Kazavon is killed, his body crumbles swiftly, and is soon reduced to
      little more than dust. Any of the relics absorbed into his body remain
      behind amid the dust. As long as Kazavon's relics continue to exist, there
      is always a chance the great blue wyrm can manifest again. If Kazavon was
      restored to life via the Everdawn Pool (as described in Rise of the Dragon
      on page 390), all that remains are his fangs.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Normally, Kazavon casts mage armor and shield well before combat begins, but
  the way he is likely  to be encountered in the final adventure's climax gives
  him little time to do this. Those effects are not calculated into the stats
  above.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kazavon opens a fight in draconic form with time stop, then places walls of
  force to control the battlefield. He casts greater invisibility on the last
  round of the time stop spell's effect. Kazavon saves his melee attacks for
  when he's surrounded, and tries to remain mobile, using flight to stay far
  from foes and hitting them with spells from a distance each round between uses
  of his breath weapon. Every few rounds, he casts time stop again to recover,
  reposition, and take control of the battlefield. Kazavon does not assume his
  human form until he has access to new equipment to use in that form.
Morale: >-
  Kazavon knows now that he cannot be killed, but is not eager to return to the
  limbo he endured after his previous defeat. If reduced to fewer than 50 hit
  points, he casts greater teleport to relocate or gate to flee to the Shadow
  Plane, where he spends a few days recovering and plotting his revenge before
  returning.
