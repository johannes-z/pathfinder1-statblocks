BeforeCombat: >-
  Woaerym casts alarm on the door to area D1 every day, and she casts mage armor
  on herself as soon as she hears anyone at the door or if the alarm there is
  triggered in her head.
DuringCombat: >-
  Woaerym's first act in combat is to cast mirror image, followed by fly the
  next round. After that, she takes to the air to avoid melee attacks and use
  her ranged spells. If reduced to fewer than 75 hit points, she flies down to
  the secret door to area D3a and opens it, releasing the clay golem there to
  attack the intruders (she knows that if the PCs destroy the golem, they'll
  have a harder time navigating area D4, after all).
Morale: >-
  Woaerym casts dimension door to escape to area D12 if reduced to fewer than 30
  hit points, whereupon she warns Erigantus of the PCs' attack. If encountered
  deeper in the dungeon, she instead casts dimension door to escape to area D1
  and abandons the Shrine of the Seal entirely (although, at your discretion,
  she may come back at a later date to seek vengeance on the PCs).
Gear: potions of cure serious wounds (2)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 vampiricHA dagger, circlet of persuasion, ring of protection +1, detailed
  sketch of Brother Javrin made while he lived
