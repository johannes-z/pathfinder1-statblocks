BeforeCombat: >-
  Vendra casts mage armor on herself; her dagger is already envenomed with a
  dose of giant wasp poison.
DuringCombat: >-
  The perfumer does her best to make herself look like a harmless merchant,
  shrieking and sobbing dramatically, rushing back and forth, and harmlessly
  slapping, but in actuality is looking for an opportunity to sneak attack a PC
  with her poisoned dagger. At range, she relies on her wand of charm person to
  turn enemies to her favor.

  anything to escape the city without being killed or imprisoned.

  wand of charm person (14 charges), wand of remove disease (3 charges), giant
  wasp poison (2)
OtherGear: >-
  dagger, circlet of persuasion, silver and violet earrings and bracelets (worth
