SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Challenge (Ex)
    description: >-
      This functions as the cavalier ability of the same name (Advanced Player's
      Guide 32).
  - name: Order (Ex)
    description: >-
      Fujai belongs to the order of the warrior. Whenever Fujai declares a
      challenge, he receives damage reduction 1/- against attacks made by the
      target of his challenge.
  - name: Resolve (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Fujai can call upon his resolve to endure wounds and
      afflictions in a number of ways. Determined: As a standard action, Fujai
      can use his resolve to remove the fatigued, shaken, or sickened condition.
      Resolute: Whenever Fujai is required to make a Fortitude or Will save, he
      can use his resolve as an immediate action to roll twice and take the
      better result. He must decide to use this ability before he rolls the
      saving throw. Unstoppable: When Fujai is reduced to fewer than 0 hit
      points but not slain, he can use his resolve as an immediate action to
      instantly stabilize and remain conscious. He is staggered, but he does not
      fall unconscious and begin dying if he takes a standard action. He does
      fall unconscious if he takes additional damage from any source.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Fujai lets the Withered Blossom Warriors engage opponents first, while he
  assists with his spells before joining in melee combat himself.
Morale: >-
  Fujai does not allow dishonor among those under his command. If any hobgoblins
  attempt to flee combat, he ignores enemies to slay them for their cowardice.
  Fujai refuses to dishonor his living god and liege Munasukaru by failing her
  or surrendering. He fights to the death, even if he must commit seppuku with
  his wakizashi.
Gear: >-
  Large masterwork tatami-do*, Large masterwork katana*, Large masterwork
  composite longbow (+9 Str) with 20 arrows, Large masterwork silver wakizashi*,
