SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Viridian Escape (Sp)
    description: >-
      Viralane has been subjected to an ancient ritual called the viridian
      transcendence, granting her the ability to use word of recall once and
      once only as a swift action. When she activates this ability, she vanishes
      in a puff of bright blue-green smoke and reappears in a Peacock Spirit
      safe house in Magnimar.
  - name: Cursed (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever Viralane takes to a literal stage, such as those found in a
      theater, her Charisma-based checks are made at a -15 penalty. The curse
      doesn't apply to informal gatherings, such as singing a song beside a
      campfire. This curse is particularly difficult to remove-to successfully
      eliminate the affliction, remove curse (DC 25 curse effect) must follow
      atonement; however, Viralane must also truly repent her adultery, taking
      responsibility for the harm she has caused. That may be the most
      problematic component of her redemption.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Viralane uses her magic to avoid combat if possible. She hides behind her
  allies and uses her abilities to disrupt spellcasters, ranged attackers, or
  anyone who seems highly mobile in battle.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 6 hit points, Viralane uses the viridian escape to
  flee to Magnimar. If she's already used this ability, she throws herself at
  the PCs' mercy-see area C9 on page 38 for what the PCs can learn from her in
  return.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure light wounds (2), potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of
  eagle's splendor
OtherGear: >-
  +1 leather lamellar armorUC, mwk dagger, ring of feather falling, 1,500 gp in
  jewelry and fine clothing, 8 pp, 8 gp
