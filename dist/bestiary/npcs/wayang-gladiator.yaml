BeforeCombat: >-
  The wayang gladiators drink their potions of magic fang and portions of bear's
  endurance. They use their martial flexibility to gain the benefits of Power
  Attack in the round before combat commences.
DuringCombat: >-
  Two of the wayang gladiators move to flank the PCs and make attacks combining
  flurry of blows and Power Attack. The remaining two split up and attempt to
  grapple obvious spellcasters or those with large weapons. If Power Attack
  fails to hit consistently or the gladiators are being struck too often, they
  use martial flexibility to gain the benefit of Dodge.
Morale: >-
  While under the charm person effect, the wayang gladiators do not surrender.
  If the enchantment is somehow removed, the affected gladiator immediately
  stops fighting.
