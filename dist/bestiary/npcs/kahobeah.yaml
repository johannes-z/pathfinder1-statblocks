DuringCombat: >-
  Kahobeah maintains as much altitude as it can between attacks, striking foes
  using Flyby Attack.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, Kahobeah calls for a truce. Kahobeah
  tries to convince intruders to leave, even if it must surrender the treasure
  within the altar in the open chamber (see area K6) to persuade them to leave.
  However, if trespassers have attempted to desecrate the site or seem
  interested in restoring it, Kahobeah fights until destroyed.
