DuringCombat: >-
  Young and arrogant, Shardizhad believes her magic to be indomitable. She
  begins combat by casting color spray. If this fails to affect intruders, she
  declares them to be "cheating" and follows up with glitterdust and her breath
  weapon before leaping into combat.
Morale: >-
  Unable to conceive of humanoids as a serious threat, Shardizhad fights until
  reduced to 20 hit point or fewer, at which point self-preservation overcomes
  her pride and she flees.
