SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Abyssal Stare (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action a soulless creature can stare into the eyes of
      another living being within 30 ft. and force it to confront the infinite,
      empty void beyond death. Targets who fail a Will save (DC 10 +1/2 soulless
      HD + Charisma modifier) waver in their will to survive and take a -4
      penalty to all saves and skill and ability checks for 1d4 rounds. Divine
      casters are particularly disturbed. They must succeed on a caster level
      check (20 + spell level) to cast a divine spell while under the effect of
      abyssal stare or the spell is lost. Creatures affected by abyssal stare
      are immune to other uses of the stare for 24 hours. This is a
      mindaffecting, fear effect.
  - name: Bound Soul (Ex)
    description: >-
      The soul of a soulless creature resides in a special prison in the Abyss.
      This soul cannot return to the base creature without the permission of
      Orcus. A soulless creature cannot be raised or resurrected, nor do these
      spells have any effect on a soulless creature.
  - name: Divine Exclusion (Ex)
    description: >-
      The soulless creature has no connection to the divine. A soulless creature
      cannot take levels in any divine class, cast divine spells, or use magic
      items constructed with spells found only on a divine caster's spell list.
  - name: Vessel of Orcus (Su)
    description: >-
      By manipulating an imprisoned soul Orcus can possess a soulless creature,
      enabling the demon lord to see and hear through the soulless creature's
      body.
