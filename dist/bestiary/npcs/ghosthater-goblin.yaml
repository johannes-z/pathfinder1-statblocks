  - name: Prehensile Tail (Ex)
    description: >-
      All monkey goblins have long, flexible tails that they can use to carry
      objects. They cannot wield weapons with their tails, but the tails do
      allow them to retrieve small objects stowed on their persons as a swift
      action.
BeforeCombat: >-
  If the monkey goblins become aware of the PCs before the heroes become aware
  of them, they attempt to stage an ambush.
DuringCombat: >-
  The monkey goblins engage in melee with their shortspears and make ranged
  attacks with their daggers. They throw their shortspears as a last resort. If
  fighting conditions in the smithy become too crowded, some or all of them
  climb out the window and up onto the roof (to gain a height advantage), or
  circle around the building to attack from outside.
Morale: >-
  Normally, monkey goblins are too fierce and reckless to flee; however, if one
  or more of them are killed, and those that remain are reduced to 4 hit points
  or fewer, they retreat to fight again another day.
Gear: buckler, daggers (3), shortspear
