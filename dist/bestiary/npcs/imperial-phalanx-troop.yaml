      An imperial phalanx troop is made up of a mixture of soldiers with
      polearms and those with blades and spears. This grants it an additional 5
      feet of reach with its troop melee attack. The troop also gains a +5
      shield bonus to AC and a +4 bonus on saving throws against trample
      attacks, and its troop melee attack deals an additional 2d6 points of
      damage against mounted opponents. The troop gains 2 additional hit points
      per Hit Die. These effects are included in the troop's stat block.
