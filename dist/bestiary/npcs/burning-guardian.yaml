SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fire Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      The burning guardian gains fast healing 1 each round it remains in contact
      with fire. When struck by a magical fire effect, it heals 1 point of
      damage per 10 points of damage the fire effect would otherwise deal.
  - name: Firewalk (Su)
    description: >-
      The burning guardian can climb on an object on fire as though it had a
      climb speed of 20 feet. It can fly at a speed of 20 feet with perfect
      maneuverability so long as it remains in contact with fire, and can walk
      on flames at normal speed as though walking on air via the air walk spell.
  - name: Light Fortification (Ex)
    description: >-
      The burning guardian has a 25% chance to ignore additional damage caused
      by critical hits or sneak attacks.
  - name: Ring Link (Su)
    description: >-
      The burning guardian is linked to a magic ring (see area F27). The
      construct will never attack any creature that wears this ring, nor any
      creatures within 10 feet of the ringwearer, unless one of those creatures
      attacks the guardian first.
  - name: See Invisibility (Ex)
    description: >-
      The burning guardian constantly sees invisible creatures and objects, as
      per the spell see invisibility.
DuringCombat: >-
  The burning guardian makes sure to stand so that at least one square of its
  space is one of the shallow fire pits-these pits are difficult terrain for the
  guardian to walk through, but grant it fast healing as long as it remains
  within the area.
Morale: The burning guardian fights until destroyed.
