DuringCombat: >-
  Beirawash attacks intruders on sight, jetting up to engage them if necessary.
  He pursues foes throughout the Sunken Queen. Unlike most devilfish,
  Beirawash's body is particularly malleable and he can move through areas as
  narrow as 5 feet wide without squeezing, but he does not pursue foes out of
  the water or beyond 100 feet from the Sunken Queen itself.
Morale: >-
  Even after being subjected to countless charm monster spells, the immense
  devilfish secretly rankles at the change in his status; if the PCs can dispel
  Ileosa's current charm monster effect, the devilfish breaks off combat and
  attempts to escape. Barring that, he might try to bargain with the PCs,
  offering up his treasure in area B3 as a bribe to let him escape. Without
  being freed from the enchantment, he fights to the death.
