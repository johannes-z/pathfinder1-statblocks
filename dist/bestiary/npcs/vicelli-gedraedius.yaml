    description: >-
      Vicelli possesses fiendish luck, allowing her to reroll one die roll once
      per day. She must take the result of this second roll. This variant
      tiefling ability appears in Pathfinder Player Companion: Blood of Fiends
      and replaces the tiefling's spell-like ability racial trait.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: Vicelli has poisoned her punching dagger with black whinnis.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vicelli uses her chemical weapons and precise splash weapons abilities to make
  sneak attacks with her wide variety of alchemical weapons. She leaves most of
  the damage dealing to her Black Dagger allies, but if cornered in melee
  combat, Vicelli fights with her poisoned punching dagger (which remains for
  two attacks due to her lasting poison rogue talent).
Morale: >-
  If she has allies to fight alongside when reduced to fewer than 25 hit points,
  Vicelli drinks her potion of cure moderate wounds, but if outnumbered, she
  drinks her potion of invisibility and flees.
