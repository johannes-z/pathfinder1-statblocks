SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Constructed (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although a kolyarut is a living outsider, its body is constructed of
      physical components-in many ways, it functions as a construct rather than
      a living creature. For the purposes of a ranger's favored enemy and bane
      weapons, a kolyarut is treated as both an outsider and a construct. It is
      immune to death effects, disease, mindaffecting effects, necromancy
      effects, paralysis, poison, sleep, stun, and any effect that requires a
      Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects, or is harmless).
      It is not subject to nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain,
      fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain. It is not at risk of death from
      massive damage.
  - name: Truespeech (Su)
    description: >-
      A kolyarut can speak with any creature that has a language, as if using a
      tongues spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.
DuringCombat: >-
  The kolyarut doesn't necessarily want to slay intruders-merely drive them off.
  It relies on fear and quickened suggestions, switching to more deadly methods
  such as its slam or vampiric touch to destroy foes who prove resistant to
  mental effects.
