BeforeCombat: >-
  Azlowe gorges himself each day on a heroes' feast prepared by his witcheater
  cultists. Before combat, he casts aid, mass bull's strength, prayer, and
  shield of faith.
DuringCombat: >-
  Azlowe is lazy and relies on his witcheater cultists to engage foes in melee
  while he casts order's wrath and dispel magic from a distance. Once he closes,
  he activates his sacred armor (improving his AC by +2) and uses sacred weapon
  to grant his claws an additional +1 enhancement bonus and the flaming weapon
  special ability before tearing into enemies with his bare hands.
Morale: >-
  Azlowe is ultimately a coward, and he flees using dimension door if his
  cultists are slain and he is reduced below 75 hit points.
Gear: longarm bracersUE
OtherGear: >-
  +2 glamered slick breastplate, amulet of mighty fists +3, ring of
  regeneration, iron holy symbol of Hadregash
