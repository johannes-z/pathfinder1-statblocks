BeforeCombat: >-
  Once the pegasus spots the PCs, it takes to the skies. Any character who
  attempts to use a ranged attack against it becomes its first target.
DuringCombat: >-
  Because the zombie pegasus is staggered, once it lands it's unlikely it will
  be able to take off again. It fights mindlessly, using full-attack actions
  when able, and attempting to again take to the skies if no immediate threats
  are within range.
Morale: The pegasi fight until they are destroyed.
