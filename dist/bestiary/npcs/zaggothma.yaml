SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mind Thrust (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action up to three times a day, Zoggothma can deliver a
      massive blast of mental energy at any one target within 60 ft., inflicting
      13d10 points of damage. A successful DC 25 Will save negates the effect.
      This effect can only harm creatures with Intelligence scores. This is a
      mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charismabased.
  - name: Psychic Crush (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action up to three times a day, Zoggothma can attempt to
      crush the mind of a single creature within 60 ft. The target must make a
      DC 25 Will save or collapse, becoming unconscious and dying at -1 hit
      points. If the target succeeds on the save, it takes 6d6 points of damage
      and is sickened for 1 round. This is a mindaffecting effect. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
  - name: Trace Teleport (Ex)
    description: >-
      Zaggothma telepathically and reflexively learns the mental coordinates of
      the destination of all creatures that teleport within 60 ft. of it,
      gaining an awareness of the location equivalent to "seen casually." This
      knowledge fades and is lost after 1 minute. This power does not grant any
      environmental information about the conditions of the destination.
