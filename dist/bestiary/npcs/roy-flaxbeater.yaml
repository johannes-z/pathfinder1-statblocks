DuringCombat: >-
  If he's expecting trouble, Flaxbeater hides near the south stairs so he can
  sneak attack the last PC to enter the room once combat starts. He uses his
  minions as nothing more than flanking partners, and tries to avoid fighting in
  melee against foes that wield weapons capable of penetrating his damage
  reduction.
Morale: >-
  Flaxbeater panics if reduced to fewer than 20 hit points. He sacrifices any
  and all of his followers in order to escape death in this case&#8211;if he
  can't flee downstairs, he climbs out a window. His goal is to find somewhere
  to hide until he's healed back to full hit points, whereupon he stealthily
  tracks down the PCs and waits for them to get into another fight before
  leaping out to stab them again.
OtherGear: >-
  +2 leather armor, death bill (see page 60), garnet eye worth 5,000 gp, key
  ring
