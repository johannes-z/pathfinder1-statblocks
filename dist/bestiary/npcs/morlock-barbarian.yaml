SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Expert Climber (Ex)
    description: >-
      A morlock can cling to cave walls and even ceilings as long as the surface
      has hand-and footholds. In effect, a morlock is treated as constantly
      being under a nonmagical version of the spell spider climb, save that it
      cannot cling to smooth surfaces. This ability doubles the normal +8 racial
      bonus to Climb checks normally afforded creatures with a climb speed to a
      +16 racial bonus.
  - name: Leap Attack (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a morlock may use a single attack during a jump. It
      can make this attack at any point along the course of the leap-at the
      start, at the end, or while in mid-air. While jumping, a morlock does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity for leaving a threatened square.
  - name: Swarming (Ex)
    description: >-
      Morlocks dwell and fight in cramped quarters every day of their lives, and
      as such are quite adept at swarming foes. Up to two morlocks can share the
      same square at the same time. If two morlocks in the same square attack
      the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that foe as if they were
      in two opposite squares.
Gender: Male and Female
DuringCombat: >-
  As one morlock beats on a set of drums (drums of panic) the other five
  morlocks rush to attack the PCs.
Morale: >-
  The morlocks fight to the death while the stone golem lives; once the golem is
  destroyed any remaining morlocks flee.
