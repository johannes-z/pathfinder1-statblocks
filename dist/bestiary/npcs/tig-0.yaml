    description: >-
      Tig-0 was severely damaged in the fire that originally caused the Forge's
      portals to fail, reducing its maximum hit points by 30 and reducing its
      hardness to 8. It lost the all-around vision and electromagnetic pulse
      abilities of a normal director robot, and one of its tentacles was
      completely disabled. It has a permanent -4 penalty to Strength and
      Dexterity, and takes a &#8211;3 penalty on all attack rolls because of its
      damaged sensors. Finally, Tig-0's tendency to assume that other creatures
      are friendly robots imposes a &#8211;5 penalty on the robot's initiative
      checks and Sense Motive checks to recognize lies.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Tig-0 does not expect to be attacked by other "robots," and thus it is rarely
  prepared for a fight.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tig-0 makes full attacks in melee, trying to grab and forcibly dismantle one
  opponent at a time. Against ranged foes, it uses its integrated laser rifle.
  Tig-0 occasionally tries to use its override ability against attackers, likely
  to no effect.
Morale: >-
  Tig-0's mission is more important to it than anything else. If reduced to
  fewer than 30 hit points, Tig-0 flees toward area B2 to complete its mission
  before it is destroyed. In area B2, Tig-0 fights until destroyed. The robot
  does not pursue fleeing attackers.
