SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 22; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4
      Con; cure 1 save. Spells Liniratis's sorcerer levels stack with her innate
      spellcasting ability, and she can cast spells from the cleric list (which
      are considered arcane spells for her) as well as from the sorcerer list.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: Abyssal
BeforeCombat: >-
  Liniratis casts false life and mage armor every day, and bull's strength,
  shield of faith, and stoneskin before going into battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  Liniratis tries to avoid direct confrontation as much as possible, preferring
  to use her spells to harass opponents from a safe distance. She casts
  displacement on the first round of combat, then uses her scroll of summon
  monster VII to summon a vrock to assist her in combat. Liniratis attempts to
  use her charming gaze, mostly out of personal vanity, before casting her most
  destructive spells, using Maximize Spell and Quicken Spell as needed. During
  the fight, Liniratis uses her magical baskets to keep her enemies off their
  guard and to evade devastating magical attacks at the last moment.
Morale: >-
  Liniratis is afraid of death, so if reduced to fewer than 60 hit points, the
  naga attempts to flee, likely to hide elsewhere in the castle.
Gear: scroll of acid fog, scroll of cone of cold, scroll of summon monster VII
OtherGear: >-
  headband of mental prowess +4 (Int, Cha; Knowledge [planes], Use Magic
  Device), diamond dust (worth 500 gp)
