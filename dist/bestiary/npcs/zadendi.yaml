BeforeCombat: Zadendi casts magic vestment and shield of faith on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zadendi is expecting a single target, and does her best to quickly slay that
  target as long as she believes her victim to be alone.
Morale: >-
  As soon as Zadendi realizes that she's been ambushed, she backs out of the
  alley (and out of the area of the silence) as soon as she can in order to use
  her magic. She continues her fighting retreat until brought below 20 hit
  points, at which point she puts all of her energy into escaping. Clever PCs
  can let her "escape," and if they do, they can trail her all the way to the
  shrine if the Scarlet Son has fled already (thus forcing Zadendi to flee on
  foot).
Gear: >-
  masterwork studded leather, buckler, +1 dagger, cloak of elvenkind, brass key
  in the shape of a holy symbol of Sarenrae (key to the Old Shrine)
