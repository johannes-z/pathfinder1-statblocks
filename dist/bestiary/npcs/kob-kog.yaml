  Until seriously wounded (see Morale, below), Kob-Kog is a bastion of fury,
  barreling into the PCs to attack on sight. He is fond of using bull rush to
  knock down smaller foes, and always uses Power Attack to gain a +6 damage
  bonus at the cost of a &#8211;3 penalty to hit (these modifiers are included
  in the stats above).
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 25 hit points, Kob-Kog attempts to flee, pushing any
  other remaining ettins aside in an attempt to throw off pursuit.
Gear: >-
  breastplate, masterwork battleaxe, masterwork heavy pick, large burlap sack
  containing silverware, jewelry, and art objects looted from the abbey and
  worth 4,550 gp in total
