SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adamantine Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      The claws of an underworld dragon are made of adamantine, and have the
      qualities of a weapon made form that material.
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      Xiangnuer can assume any humanoid form three times per day as if using
      polymorph.
  - name: Smoke Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      Xiangnuer can see perfectly in smoky conditions (such as those created by
      pyrotechnics).
  - name: Underworld Burrower (Ex)
    description: >-
      Xiangnuer gains a 10-foot bonus to her burrow speed. This is already
      reflected in her statistics.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Before burrowing up to the landing, Xiangnuer casts detect magic and
  suppresses her frightful presence.
DuringCombat: >-
  Should the PCs engage Xiangnuer, she no longer suppresses her frightful
  presence and immediately uses her breath weapon. In later rounds she wades
  into melee, using Lunge to extend her reach whenever needed.
Morale: >-
  Xiangnuer's primary goal is to add new treasures to her hoard. If reduced
  below 40 hit points, she realizes the PCs are no easy score and attempts to
  flee by flying away at full speed, finding a spot in the shadows, and
  burrowing deep within Round Mountain.
