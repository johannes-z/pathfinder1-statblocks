    description: >-
      Kassen's golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. A magical attack that
      deals fire damage functions normally, dealing twice the normal amount of
      damage, regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful. A
      magical attack that specifically targets wooden objects (such as warp
      wood) causes Kassen's golem to become staggered for 3 rounds, with no
      saving throw allowed.
