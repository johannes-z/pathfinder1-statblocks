  Old Crackjaw is cantankerous and ill-tempered; wild empathy checks suffer a
  &#8211;4 penalty against him. He generally attacks the closest target, but he
  has developed a particular fondness for gnome flesh and attacks such targets
  first if possible.
Morale: Old Crackjaw fights to the death.
