SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gibber (Su)
    description: >-
      Vescavors yammer the endless chorus of the Abyss. Any creature within 15
      feet of a vescavor swarm or inside it must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or
      be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion insanity
      effect. A creature that saves cannot be affected by the same vescavor
      swarm's gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Ravenous (Ex)
    description: >-
      Vescavors can devour nearly anything, with the exception of adamantine. If
      the swarm attacks an object or structure, the vescavors ignore its
      hardness if it is made of any substance other than adamantine.
      Additionally, every round that a creature is in the same space as the
      swarm, the vescavors begin devouring one object on the creature. The
      object takes half its maximum hit points in damage and gains the broken
      condition. If the vescavors attack an object with the broken condition, it
      is destroyed. An attended or magic object must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex
      save to negate this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Traumatizing (Su)
    description: >-
      Vescavors embody the meanest depravities of the Outer Rifts, and walking
      among them is akin to being trapped in the Abyss itself. Any creature that
      spends more than 3 rounds inside a vescavor swarm must succeed at a DC 13
      Will save or become schizophrenic (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 250),
      which imparts a -4 penalty on all Wisdom and Charismabased skill checks.
      The creature is also unable to take 10 or take 20 on checks as it loses
      its ability to tell the difference between what is real and what is not.
      Each time the creature finds itself in a stressful situation (such as
      combat), it must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become confused for 1d6
      rounds. This condition lasts until it is removed by greater restoration,
      heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish. It is also possible to remove this
      condition after several weeks, though that is not an option in this
      scenario.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The vescavor swarms are spread throughout the camp, busily devouring
  everything they find- structures included.
DuringCombat: >-
  The swarms move in on the PCs attempting to satiate their ravenous appetite. A
  semi-intelligent vescavor swarm generally attacks the nearest PCs, but it also
  tries to catch as many PCs as possible in its chaotic chorus. Unless the
  derakni is present to direct them or the PCs continue to fight, the vescavors
  do not pursue fleeing enemies farther than 50 feet from the camp.
Morale: >-
  Driven by the derakni and the need to feed, the swarms fight until destroyed
  or allowed to consume more of the camp for at least 5 minutes, at which point
  they meander back to the Worldwound.
