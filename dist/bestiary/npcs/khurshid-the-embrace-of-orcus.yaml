SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Abyssal Stare (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action a soulless creature can stare into the eyes of
      another living being within 30 ft. and force it to confront the infinite,
      empty void beyond death. Targets who fail a Will save (DC 10 +1/2 soulless
      HD + Charisma modifier) waver in their will to survive and take a -4
      penalty to all saves and skill and ability checks for 1d4 rounds. Divine
      casters are particularly disturbed. They must succeed on a caster level
      check (20 + spell level) to cast a divine spell while under the effect of
      abyssal stare or the spell is lost. Creatures affected by abyssal stare
      are immune to other uses of the stare for 24 hours. This is a
      mind-affecting, fear effect.
  - name: Break Free (Ex)
    description: >-
      At 5th level, a tetori adds his monk level on combat maneuver or Escape
      Artist checks made to escape a grapple. If a tetori fails a save against
      an effect that causes him to become entangled, paralyzed, slowed, or
      staggered, he may spend 1 point from his ki pool as an immediate action to
      attempt a new save.
  - name: Bound Soul (Ex)
    description: >-
      The soul of a soulless creature resides in a special prison in the Abyss.
      This soul cannot return to the base creature without the permission of
      Orcus. A soulless creature cannot be raised or resurrected, nor do these
      spells have any effect on a soulless creature. Counter-Grapple (Ex) At 4th
      level, a tetori wrestler may make an attack of opportunity against a
      creature attempting to grapple him. This ability does not allow the tetori
      to make an attack of opportunity against a creature with the Greater
      Grapple feat. At 6th level, he may use counter-grapple even if his
      attacker has concealment or total concealment, at 8th level even if he is
      flat-footed, and at 10th level even if his attacker has exceptional reach.
  - name: Divine Exclusion (Ex)
    description: >-
      The soulless creature has no connection to the divine. A soulless creature
      cannot take levels in any divine class, cast divine spells, or use magic
      items constructed with spells found only on a divine caster's spell list.
  - name: Form Lock (Su)
    description: >-
      At 13th level, a tetori can negate a polymorph effect by touch with a
      Wisdom check, adding a bonus equal to his monk level, against a DC of 11 +
      the caster level of the effect (or HD of the creature, for supernatural
      polymorph effects). This is a standard action requiring 2 points from the
      tetori's ki pool, or an immediate action if a creature the tetori is
      grappling attempts to use a polymorph effect.
  - name: Graceful Grappler (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tetori uses his monk level in place of his base attack bonus to
      determine CMB and CMD for grappling. At 4th level, he suffers no penalties
      on attack rolls, can make attacks of opportunity while grappling, and
      retains his Dexterity bonus to AC when pinning an opponent or when
      grappled. At 8th level, a tetori gains the grab special attack when using
      unarmed strikes, and can use this ability against creatures his own size
      or smaller by spending 1 point from his ki pool, or against larger
      creatures by spending 2 points from his ki pool. At 15th level, a tetori
      gains the constrict special attack, inflicting his unarmed strike damage
      on any successful grapple check.
  - name: Inescapable Grasp (Su)
    description: >-
      At 9th level, a tetori can spend 1 point from his ki pool to suppress his
      opponents' freedom of movement and magical bonuses to Escape Artist or on
      checks to escape a grapple. At 13th level, this ability also duplicates
      the effect of dimensional anchor. At 17th level, the tetori's unarmed
      strike gains the ghost touch special ability, and an incorporeal creature
      that he strikes gains the grappled condition (Reflex negates, DC 10 + 1/2
      the tetori's level + his Wisdom modifier). Inescapable grasp is a swift
      action and lasts until the beginning of the tetori's next turn.
  - name: Vessel of Orcus (Su)
    description: >-
      By manipulating an imprisoned soul Orcus can possess a soulless creature,
      enabling the demon lord to see and hear through the soulless creature's
      body.
