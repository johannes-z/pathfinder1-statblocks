  Little more than a straightforward brute, the siege necrocraft lumbers toward
  the closest enemy and attempts to scoop it up in a huge fist and choke the
  life out of it. If it can't close into melee, it hurls rocks from a bag draped
  over its shoulder.
Morale: The siege necrocraft fights until destroyed.
