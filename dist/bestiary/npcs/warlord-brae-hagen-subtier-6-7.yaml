BeforeCombat: >-
  If he is alerted by noise above or by someone triggering the trap in area A2,
  Brae-Hagen immediately pulls the lever to open the mouth. As the mouth of the
  bunker opens, he casts mirror image, displacement, bull's strength, and shield
  (in that order) on himself. If given additional time, he casts darkness on his
  spear.
DuringCombat: >-
  Brae-Hagen initially moves to engage heavy melee opponents, using his arcane
  pool for pool strike bonuses and to empower his frigid touch. Putting his back
  to the northern wall, Brae-Hagen uses a spellstrike force punch to try knock
  an enemy out of the bunker mouth. If he flies outside the mouth of the
  bunker,  he uses glitterdust to blind his enemies and stinking cloud to
  disrupt them further before returning to the melee, either from the mouth or
  by breaking through the eyes in area A3.
Morale: >-
  When reduced below 50 hp, Brae-Hagen retreats outside the bunker, vowing, "I
  shall break you at the gates of Jormurdun!" Contrary to this, he flies out and
  casts vanish (PCs must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to hear the verbal
  components over the throng of battle below). He prefers to wait for a PC to
  step to the edge of the bunker's mouth, at which point he casts hydraulic push
  to knock them into the canyon (see the Falling Into War sidebar). However, if
  no PC takes his bait, he takes an opportunity to heal before rejoining the
  combat and fighting to the death.
