SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Eye Rays (Su)
    description: >-
      Six of the eyes can produce a magical ray per round, with each eye
      emulating a spell from among the list of spells below as if cast by a
      14th-level caster. The save DCs, where applicable, are 16 + spell level. A
      gibbering orb has no directional limitations on where it can point its eye
      rays, because the eyes orbiting around its body drift and float wherever
      needed. However, a gibbering orb can never aim more than three rays at any
      single target, due to limitations of aiming. All rays have a range of 80
      feet. Each of these effects functions as a ray, regardless of the normal
      parameters of the spell it resembles. That is, each is usable against a
      single target and requires a ranged touch attack. The eye rays are: daze
      monster, dispel magic, flaming sphere, inflict moderate wounds, magic
      missile, and ray of enfeeblement. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Flight (Sp)
    description: >-
      The gibbering orb's body is naturally buoyant. This buoyancy allows it to
      cast fly, as the spell, as a free action, at a speed of 30 ft. This
      buoyancy also grants it a permanent feather fall effect with personal
      range.
  - name: Gibbering (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, no more than once per 1d4 rounds, a gibbering orb can
      emit a cacophony of maddening sound. All creatures other than gibbering
      mouthers and gibbering orbs within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 23 Will
      save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting compulsion
      insanity effect. A creature that saves cannot be affected by the same
      orb's gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. Steal
      Spell/Steal Spell-Like
  - name: Ability (Su)
    description: >-
      When a creature dies by being swallowed whole (or when a creature killed
      by the gibbering orb in some other fashion is eaten by it), the gibbering
      orb absorbs the creature's known spells, prepared spells, and spell-like
      abilities. The orb can use any one of those abilities per round as a free
      action. Each originates from an eye that is not producing an eye ray (see
      above) that round. Stolen spells and spell-like abilities are lost after
      24 hours.
