BeforeCombat: Urathash casts see invisibility and stoneskin before battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  Urathash activates his judgment ability on the first round of combat, usually
  selecting healing, justice,  protection, or resistance as needed. He begins
  throwing rocks while his allies engage opponents, interspersing spells among
  his ranged attacks as needed. Once in melee combat, Urathash activates his
  bane ability, then casts flames of the faithful on his warhammer. At all
  times, Urathash tries to position himself next to allies to take advantage of
  his solo tactics ability.
Morale: >-
  While Urathash serves the Storm Tyrant, his primary goal is to return
  Minderhal's name to greatness, an obligation he cannot fulfill if he dies. If
  reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, the inquisitor does his best to flee, but
  if he cannot escape, he fights to the death, refusing to surrender.
