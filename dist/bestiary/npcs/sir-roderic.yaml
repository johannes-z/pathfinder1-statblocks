SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Last Gasp (Su)
    description: >-
      Roderic drowned in the Varisian Gulf. Using this special ability, Roderic
      can replicate his own demise in those he chooses, forcing them to
      experience his pain and loss. Roderic can target any creature within 30
      feet, but a creature already affected by this ability or one that succeeds
      at a DC 16 Fortitude save to resist it becomes immune to the effects of
      last gasp for 24 hours. A target that fails the save is staggered for 1
      round as its lungs fill with water. The following round, the target must
      attempt another Fortitude save at the same DC; on a failure, it can take
      only a single move action for 1 round. On the third round, the target must
      succeed at a third Fortitude save or fall unconscious and take 2d6 points
      of damage. This damage can never reduce the target below 0 hit points.
      This ability affects only living creatures that must breathe air, and it
      is impossible to hold one's breath to counter this effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  If the PCs attack Roderic, he uses his last gasp ability on the PC who appears
  the largest and strongest or who has exhibited the most aggressive behavior
  since being in the Wreck. After affecting the first PC with last gasp, Roderic
  targets other members of the party with this ability until at least one PC
  falls unconscious. If the PCs seem resistant to this attack or manage to hurt
  him significantly, he'll use his frightful moan to try to force them to flee.
  Once a PC is unconscious or they flee, Sir Roderic drains back through the
  floor into the mud beneath the house until he stirs once again, hoping that
  the intruders flee after his attack. Roderic has no urge to hurt anyone and
  doesn't use his corrupting touch ability against the PCs, even if they do
  damage him.
Morale: >-
  Roderic wants only to recruit the PCs' help in protecting the Cove, as
  detailed above.
