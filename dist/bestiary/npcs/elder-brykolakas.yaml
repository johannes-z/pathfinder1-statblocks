SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      A humanoid or monstrous humanoid killed by a brykolakas rises as a lacedon
      in 1d4 days under the control of the brykolakas that created it.
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, a brykolakas is destroyed and its
      body changes into a pool of deadly poison that quickly fills a
      10-foot-radius spread (if underwater) or a 10-foot-diameter puddle (if on
      land) in 1 round. All creatures in this area are exposed to this foul
      venom. The poison disperses in 1 round if underwater, or 1d2 rounds if on
      land. Brykolakas poison: Death throes-contact; save Fort DC 20; onset 1
      minute; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d6 Dex damage; cure 1
      save. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      A brykolakas's claw attacks deliver a virulent disease that breaks down
      the victim's internal organs, resulting in internal bleeding and a gradual
      darkening of the skin. This supernatural disease is called brykolakas
      fever. The save DC is Charisma-based. Brykolakas fever: Claw&#8211;injury;
      save Fortitude DC 20 negates; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4
      Con and 1d4 Dex damage; cure 1 save.
  - name: Water Dependency (Ex)
    description: >-
      A brykolakas can survive out of the water for 6 hours. After that, its
      body begins drying out, and within 1 hour, the brykolakas crumbles into
      dust (this does not activate its death throes ability) unless it can reach
      saltwater before the hour passes.
DuringCombat: >-
  The brykolakases let their lacedon minions engage opponents first, using them
  as sacrificial troops to distract enemies and perhaps use up some resources
  before they step in to focus their attacks on the same foes.
Morale: A brykolakas fights until destroyed.
