BeforeCombat: >-
  Once the alarm is raised, Biting Lash remains in her garden pavilion and
  awaits the PCs' arrival. To prepare, she casts barkskin and bear's endurance
  on herself, and casts greater magic fang on Kahree. If she is aware of any PCs
  previously using particular spells or weapons that deal energy damage, she
  also casts resist energy.
DuringCombat: >-
  If Biting Lash's personal guards still live, they keep themselves between her
  and the PCs. She fights from a distance with her +1 returning spear and
  commands Kahree to swoop down and attack any obvious spellcasters. After the
  first 2 rounds of combat, Biting Lash casts entangle to slow down and
  frustrate her attackers.
Morale: >-
  Biting Lash can't imagine a scenario where she falls to the hands of puny
  humans and loses the empire she has built in Okeno. Her arrogance drives her
  to fight to the death.
Gear: >-
  potions of cure serious wounds (3) in identical crystal bottles, a gourd
  containing a potion of blur
OtherGear: >-
  +3 chainmail, +1 returning spear, mwk spear wrapped in braids of human hair,
  belt of incredible dexterity +2 made of fine camel skin, cloak of resistance
  +1, ring of protection +1, leather sandals made from elephant hide, falconer's
  glove
