DuringCombat: >-
  Cucuy keeps to the shadows to hide and uses her death attack against obviously
  dangerous targets like well-armored foes. Once she is spotted, she uses
  phantasmal killer and Improved Feint to dispatch her foes as quickly as
  possible. Cucuy prefers to attack the youngest-looking target in any group
  last, muttering "I'm saving you for later, sweet one."
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 100 hit points, Cucuy retreats to find allies to join
  her in the fight, starting with the voidbones in area D12 but asking for aid
  from the nightshades if the voidbones have already been defeated. She then
  returns to attack the PCs, preferably by making a death attack while the PCs
  are occupied with fighting her allies. She thereafter fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  +2 padded armor, Hushing Blade (a mithral sword of subtlety that provides a +2
  enhancement bonus to the wielder's Dexterity)
