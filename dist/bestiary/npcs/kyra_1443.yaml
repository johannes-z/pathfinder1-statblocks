  Kyra was one of the few survivors of a brutal raid on her hometown, and on the
  smoking ruins of her village she swore her life and sword arm to Sarenrae.
  Possessed of a fierce will, pride in her faith, and skill with the scimitar,
  Kyra has traveled far since her trial by fire. She lost her family and home
  that fateful day, yet where another might be consumed by anger and a thirst
  for revenge, Kyra has found peace in the Dawnflower, and in the belief that,
  if she can prevent even one death at evil hands, her own losses will not have
  been in vain.
Gear: >-
  chain shirt, heavy wooden shield, scimitar, light crossbow with 20 bolts,
  backpack, silver holy symbol, rations (6), 12 gp
