  battle and use command, daze, lesser confusion, magic stone, and spiritual

  they are in trouble, and resorts to hurling her starknives only as a last
  resort.
Morale: >-

  fellow worshiper of Desna is still in danger, in which case she stays behind
  to help her ally at all costs.

  of remove disease
