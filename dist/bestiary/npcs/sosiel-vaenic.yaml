DuringCombat: >-
  Sosiel always seeks to protect and support his allies, granting them a bit of
  luck or a touch of good when appropriate. He generally prefers to cast shield
  other on Aron if Aron's in the fight as well, but casts the spell on a PC
  otherwise. He saves shield of faith for himself whenever he goes up against
  demons, antipaladins, or the like. Against evil outsiders, he casts align
  weapon on his +1 glaive. If several allies are already in combat, Sosiel
  prefers to hang back and heal, casting sanctuary at the start of the fight so
  he can move about the combat more easily.
Morale: >-
  Sosiel recognizes the need to retreat when necessary&#8211; provided friends
  aren't left behind. He fights to the death to protect Aron or any PC who has
  truly earned his friendship, sacrificing himself to give the companion a
  chance to live.
