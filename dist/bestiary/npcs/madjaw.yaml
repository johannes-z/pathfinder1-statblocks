DuringCombat: >-
  Madjaw's hatred of humanoids is particularly strong when it comes to gnomes-he
  attacks them in preference to any other target. He rages immediately upon
  starting combat, and unless he's missing foes with his attacks he uses Power
  Attack to make his blows particularly ruinous. He generally doesn't use his
  spell-like abilities except when hard-pressed against foes who avoid melee.
Morale: Madjaw fights to the death.
