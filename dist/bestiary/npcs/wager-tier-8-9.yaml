  Wager charges any PC who has mouthed off to him. He keeps opponents at reach
  whenever possible and uses Step Up to follow if they try to 5-foot-step away
  from him. He attempts to trip heavily armored opponents before he attacks
  them. With Mobility, Spring Attack, and heavy armor, Wager doesn't fear
  attacks of opportunity, and he moves about the battlefield wherever he likes.
