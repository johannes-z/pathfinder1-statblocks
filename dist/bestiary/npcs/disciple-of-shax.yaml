BeforeCombat: Before battle, a disciple of Shax casts magic vestment and shield of faith.
DuringCombat: >-
  These disciples start combat with unholy blight, then cast divine favor and
  move to attack in melee. They team up to flank foes, using spells like hold
  person or blindness/deafness to help maximize  sneak attacks. A disciple
  reduced to 50 hit points or fewer casts sanctuary and uses the protection to
  study a foe before moving in to make a death attack. They generally don't
  bother with healing in combat, saving those spells to recover from a battle.
  When surrounded, they channel negative energy. Disciples of Shax are always
  quick to send telepathic updates and alerts to Mangvhune in area E9 to keep
  him appraised of the PCs' most common tactics.
Morale: A disciple of Shax fights to the death.
Gear: potions of invisibility (3)
OtherGear: mwk breastplate, +1 buckler, dagger of venom
