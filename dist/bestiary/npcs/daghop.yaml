DuringCombat: >-
  Daghop rages, then charges in to attack in melee. He uses his terrifying croak
  on the first round of combat, trying to focus on characters who are already
  visibly shaken from previous croaks from his minions. He uses his powerful
  blow rage power on his first attack in the battle (increasing his damage if he
  hits by +1), then uses Power Attack for the rest of the fight (taking a
  &#8211;1 penalty on attacks in order to gain a +3 bonus on damage rolls when
  using his warhammer, which he wields two-handed).
Morale: Daghop fights to the death.
