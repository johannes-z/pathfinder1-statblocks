BeforeCombat: Ramoska casts mage armor on himself well before combat begins.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ramoska is honestly surprised if the PCs are foolish enough to attack him. He
  drinks his mutagen on the first round of combat to gain a +4 bonus to his
  Dexterity and take a -2 penalty to his Wisdom, then casts shield the next
  round. He doesn't start to attack the PCs until the third round unless they
  prove more than capable of hurting him. Ramoska prefers to end combats with
  slaves rather than bodies, and attempts to dominate PCs for several turns
  while chiding the heroes for being so reckless as to antagonize one so much
  more dangerous than they. If reduced to fewer than 90 hit points, Ramoska
  abandons this tactic and casts stinking cloud and ray  of enfeeblement to try
  to remove PCs from the battle without killing them.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 60 hit points, Ramoska sighs in frustration, saying,
  "Fine, take the lad if you wish. This plague has run its course, in any
  event." He then casts teleport to leave Korvosa and doesn't return in this
  adventure.
