SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Negative Energy Attacks (Su)
    description: >-
      A voidbones deals an additional 1d6 points of negative energy damage with
      its natural attacks. Its natural attacks are treated as evil-aligned
      weapons for the purpose of damage reduction.
  - name: Obscuring Energy (Su)
    description: >-
      Flickering shadows and wisps of black smoke surround a voidbones, granting
      it concealment (20% miss chance). When the voidbones stands still, the
      shadows grow stronger and it benefits from total concealment (50% miss
      chance).
  - name: Searing Darkness (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a standard action, a voidbones can blast a creature
      with a dark ray of negative energy as a ranged touch attack. This ability
      has a range of 240 feet and deals 7d8 points of negative energy damage.
      This ray instead restores double this amount to undead creatures.
  - name: Strong Resistance (Su)
    description: >-
      If a voidbones takes enough positive energy damage in a single attack to
      destroy it (such as from a cleric's channeled energy), it can attempt a
      Will save (the DC is equal to the damage dealt by that attack) to reduce
      the damage taken by half. Against other effects that can banish or destroy
      a voidbones outright, it can attempt a Will save, even if that effect
      normally wouldn't allow a save. If the effect normally allows a save, the
      voidbones rolls twice and uses the better result, and on a success, the
      voidbones is unaffected by the effect.
DuringCombat: >-
  The voidbones prefer to flank foes in melee, abandoning foes who are bleeding
  to move on to other enemies. They use their searing darkness ability against
  foes they can't reach in melee.
Morale: >-
  A voidbones reduced to fewer than 50 hit points uses its mirror jump ability
  to flee, then waits to ambush the PCs the next time a PC approaches a mirror
  anywhere in Tumbaja Mountain.
