    description: >-
      Ghoul Fever: Bite-Injury; save Fort DC 14; onset 1 day; frequency 1 day;
      effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC
      is Charisma-based. A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at
      the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none
      of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of any
      other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like
      a normal ghoul in all respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as
      a ghast.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Seer attempts to paralyze as many targets as possible, ignoring a PC once
  she has been rendered immobile.
Morale: Animated by the Tik Taan's hatred, the Seer fights until destroyed.
