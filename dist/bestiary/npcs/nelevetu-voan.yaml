DuringCombat: >-
  If attacked, Nelevetu shrieks and cries, but does his best to fight back to
  defend himself&#8211;although it's more likely he'll become confused due to
  his schizophrenia. The noise he makes, if outside of his cage, is enough to
  alert all of the inhabitants of the Iron Cages, who come to investigate at
  once. If cured of his madness, Nelevetu is grateful and agrees to aid those
  who saved him in fighting against his oppressors&#8211; particularly if they
  remove his negative levels and give him equipment he can use.
Morale: >-
  Nelevetu fights to the death, regardless of the state of his mind and
  soul&#8211;he's not suicidal, but after as long as he's lived, he certainly no
  longer fears death.
