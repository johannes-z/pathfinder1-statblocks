DuringCombat: >-
  Adril initiates combat by charging Shemis, attempting to bash in her skull. At
  least for the first few rounds, Adril focuses his attacks on her, leaving the
  PCs to his allies. He only focuses on the Pathfinders once they prove to be a
  threat. Still, he furiously attacks anyone obstructing his target. He wastes
  little time on blockers, hoping to drop them with a single full-attack. If the
  PCs take to the air, Adril activates his winged boots to combat them in
  flight. Moral Adril accepts that this event will be either his ultimate
  triumph or his swan song. He fights to the death.
