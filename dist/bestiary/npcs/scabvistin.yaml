BeforeCombat: >-
  Scabvistin uses his scroll of barkskin on himself once the PCs begin their
  assault, and he uses his scroll of bear's endurance and scroll of bull's
  strength before they arrive in his war room.
DuringCombat: >-
  Scabvistin flanks with minions whenever possible and relies on his Two-Weapon
  Feint feat to catch opponents flat-footed. Whenever he hits an opponent with a
  sneak attack, he gains a +7 dodge bonus to his AC, so his first concern is
  catching opponents unawares. He prefers targeting obvious warriors first and
  savors the spellcasters' growing fear as their defenders fall.
Morale: >-
  Scabvistin knows death awaits if he lets Fort Phaendar fall, and so he fights
  to the death.
Gear: >-
  scrolls of barkskin (2; CL 12), scrolls of bear's endurance (2), scroll of
  blur, scrolls of bull's strength (2), and scrolls of cure serious wounds (3)
OtherGear: >-
  +2 moderate fortification chain shirt, +2 keen daggers (2), duelist's
  vambracesUE, mwk daggers (3), belt of incredible dexterity +6, coat of
  resistance +4 (as a cloak of resistance), keys to all the fort's locks
