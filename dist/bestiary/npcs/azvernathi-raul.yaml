DuringCombat: >-
  Azvernathi casts invisibility on the first round of combat, then moves among
  the fight to cast healing spells on redactors. He activates copycat once
  invisibility is about to end. His first offensive action is to cast spiritual
  weapon; he follows up with hold person and command to control the flow of
  battle. Once he draws his weapons, though, Azvernathi focuses on fighting with
  his maces rather than keeping one hand free for spellcasting. He saves his
  channel negative energy attack for when it looks like a PC is wounded, or for
  when he's surrounded.
Morale: >-
  Azvernathi is a coward at heart, and surrenders if brought to 5 or fewer hit
  points. If any redactors still live, they immediately attempt to kill him
  rather than risk him betraying the church.
Gear: scroll of dispel magic, unholy water (2)
OtherGear: >-
  breastplate, +1 heavy mace, mwk light mace, golden unholy symbol worth 100 gp,
  four onyx gems worth 25 gp each, 8 gp
