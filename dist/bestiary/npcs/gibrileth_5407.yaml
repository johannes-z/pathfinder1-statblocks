SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Any weapon a gibrileth wields becomes a vector for spreading the
      demonplague. A creature bitten by a gibrileth or damaged by a weapon it
      wields is exposed to this virulent disease. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Demonplague: Disease-injury or ingested; save Fort DC
      22; onset 1 day; frequency 1 day; effect 1d3 Con damage and 1d6 Wis
      damage, and the victim is fatigued if it takes any ability damage from the
      disease (living corporeal creatures with an Int score of 1 or 2 are
      transformed into undead plagued beasts if slain by the
      demonplague&#8211;see page 56 of The Worldwound); cure 3 consecutive
      saves.
  - name: Tumors (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a gibrileth can rip a grapefruit-sized tumor from its
      body with one of its many arms and throw it as a splash weapon with a
      range increment of 20 feet. A direct hit deals 2d6 points of acid damage
      to the target, and deals 1d4 points of acid splash damage to all creatures
      within 5 feet of the target. A creature can avoid the splash damage with a
      successful DC 22 Reflex save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Whip Specialist (Ex)
    description: A gibrileth does not provoke attacks of opportunity when using a whip.
DuringCombat: >-
  The gibrileth tries to summon another gibrileth on the first round of combat,
  then uses stinking cloud to control the battlefield, knowing that it and
  Mutasafen are immune to the poisonous vapors. The gibrileth stays mobile as
  necessary to prevent others from engaging Mutasafen in melee.
Morale: Bound to the fane, the gibrileth has no choice but to fight to the death.
