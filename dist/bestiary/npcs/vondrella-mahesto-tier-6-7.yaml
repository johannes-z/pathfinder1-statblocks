BeforeCombat: >-
  If aware of the PCs' approach, Vondrella casts spell immunity (against
  fireball and magic missile) and magic circle against good and moves to the
  opposite side of the table from the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vondrella keeps her zombie minions and cultists between herself and the PCs,
  using her Channel Energy ability to heal the zombies (and herself, thanks to
  her death's embrace domain power) if needed. She begins combat by casting
  unholy blight on as many PCs as possible. Vondrella prefers using magic from
  range, but she uses her scythe of evil domain power if forced into melee,
  especially if faced with a good cleric or paladin.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, Vondrella attempts to flee into the
  woods.
