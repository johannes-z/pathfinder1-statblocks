SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ghost Fangs (Su)
    description: >-
      Since Parnoneryx's ghost maintains a powerful link to his increasingly
      befouled head, the ghost retains a bite attack. The attack roll is
      modified by the dragon's Charisma modifier, the fangs deal force damage,
      and the damage is modified by 1-1/2 times his Charisma modifier. An evil
      creature that takes damage from Parnoneryx's ghost fangs must succeed at a
      DC 28 Will save or be nauseated with guilt for 1 round. This is a
      mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Haunted Scales (Su)
    description: >-
      Parnoneryx's ghostly scales shimmer and shine with golden energy, granting
      the ghost a +10 sacred bonus to his Armor Class.
  - name: Instant Spellcasting (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Parnoneryx can cast up to 6 levels of spells he knows as a
      free action as he manifests, so long as Parnoneryx is the only target of
      these spells. Typically, Parnoneryx uses this ability to cast eagle's
      splendor, mage armor, mirror image, and shield on himself.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Ex)
    description: >-
      Parnoneryx's ghost can be put to rest in two ways. First, if the tathlum
      is successfully completed Parnoneryx's ghost cannot be rejuvenated and his
      soul becomes trapped within the weapon until it is used, at which point
      the dragon's corrupted soul helps to power the resulting devastation
      before being banished to its destiny in the Great Beyond. Alternatively,
      if the dragon's severed head is reunited with whatever remains of his body
      and a cleric of Iomedae casts hallow upon them, Parnoneryx's ghost is
      released to the afterlife and his head can no longer be used to create a
      tathlum.
  - name: Sacred Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Parnoneryx retains a fiery breath weapon, but it is infused with his
      righteous fury and bolstered by energies from Heaven itself. He can use
      this breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds. Damage caused by this breath
      weapon feels like scorching fire, but the damage is pure sacred energy and
      is not subject to energy resistance. An evil creature that takes damage
      from Parnoneryx's sacred breath weapon must also succeed at a DC 28 Will
      save to avoid being nauseated with guilt for 1 round; this nausea effect
      is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Parnoneryx uses instant spellcasting to gain the effects of eagle's splendor,
  mage armor, mirror image, and shield as he manifests.
DuringCombat: >-
  Parnoneryx's primary target is the PC who delivered the final death blow to
  his mortal form, but if this PC isn't present, the dragon ghost focuses his
  wrath  instead on those who it knows or suspects worship Asmodeus. The dragon
  uses his sacred breath weapon on the first round of combat and as often as
  possible thereafter, and is fond of using Vital Strike with his corrupting
  touch attack. As a ghost, Parnoneryx can't use some of his feats (Improved
  Critical [claw], Multiattack, and Power Attack), nor can he heal himself with
  his cure spells due to his undead state, but these limitations serve to focus
  his tactics rather than to cripple them.
Morale: Parnoneryx fights until destroyed.
