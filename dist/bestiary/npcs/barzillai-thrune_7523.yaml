SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Heartless (Su)
    description: >-
      Barzillai's heart is ensconced deep under Kintargo in the soul anchor. In
      its place he has stashed a magical puzzle box known as a Chelish Crux. See
      Concluding the Adventure for more information on this puzzle box and its
      contents. Barzillai's heartless condition renders him immune to bleed
      damage and grants him a +4 bonus on all saving throws versus death
      effects. It also grants him the benefits of the advanced creature simple
      template. If reduced to negative hit points, Barzillai becomes staggered
      but doesn't fall unconscious. If his hit-point total drops to a negative
      amount of hit points that equals or exceeds his Constitution score (-24 hp
      at his current Constitution score), he doesn't die&#8211;he merely becomes
      stunned. This stunned condition can't be removed by any effect as long as
      he remains at &#8211;24 hp or fewer, but is removed immediately if he is
      healed above this total. A destruction or disintegrate spell (or another
      effect that completely destroys the body) or a death effect can kill him
      if the damage caused by the attack reduces him to &#8211;24 hp or fewer.
      Effects like flesh to stone, imprisonment, or trap the soul that normally
      bypass damage reduction instead invoke a clause in his with
      Mephistopheles&#8211;rather than suffering the normal effect from the
      spell or item, he is struck dead on the spot. (In the case of the talisman
      of pure good from area E31, a spike of iron impales Barzillai before
      retracting into the pit created while leaving his gear, and more
      importantly, his Chelish Crux, behind in a smoking heap&#8211;this
      foreshadows his torment in the infernal realm of Caina in the final
      adventure.) Finally, reducing him to &#8211;191 hp via any damage source
      results in the utter destruction of his body and kills him. If Barzillai
      has fast healing active as a result of his judgment of healing, the fast
      healing effect continues to heal damage until he is actually killed. This
      healing can potentially restore him to full mobility if it brings him
      above &#8211;24 hp. This ability, plus his PC-equivalent wealth, increases
      his CR by 2.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Barzillai casts detect scrying and nondetection every day, and spell
  resistance, stoneskin (from a scroll), and weapon of awe before combat begins.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Barzillai activates his boots of speed as a free
  action, pronounces judgments of healing and justice as a swift action, and
  casts divine favor as a standard action. Barzillai uses ranged spells,
  preferring flame strike, greater command (to order foes to fall prone), hold
  monster, searing light, and spiritual weapon. In melee, he takes a swift
  action at the start of a round to imbue his mace with the bane weapon special
  ability. At fewer than 75 hit points, he casts sanctuary to recover before
  returning to battle. Barzillai uses his teamwork feats when he's adjacent to
  or flanking with allies, as summarized below. Coordinated Defense: He gains a
  +2 bonus to his CMD. Outflank: His flanking bonus on attack rolls increases to
  +4. Precise Strike: He deals +1d6 points of precision damage when he damages a
  foe he flanks. Shake It Off: He gains a +1 bonus on saves per adjacent ally
  (maximum +4). Shielded Caster: Barzillai gains a +4 bonus on concentration
  checks.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, Barzillai uses his ring of spell
  storing to teleport to an unoccupied family estate in Egorian, where he has
  stashed enough supplies to recover from his wounds. It takes him a few days to
  arrange for a second teleport spell to be placed in his ring, after which he
  returns to Kintargo with allies in disguise, hoping to get revenge on the PCs.
  See Concluding the Adventure on page 61 for more information. Barzillai is
  incredibly hard to kill (see his Heartless special ability below), but if he's
  stunned as a result of hit point loss, his allies try to take his body away to
  safety until he can be restored.
