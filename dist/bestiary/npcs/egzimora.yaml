    description: >-
      Egzimora can feed upon nature's raw essence. Her need to eat and sleep is

      As a standard action, Egzimora can create a 15-foot-long, animated vine
      that springs from her hand. This vine lasts for 1 round and can be used to
      make a single disarm, steal, or trip combat maneuver, using her sorcerer
      level plus her Charisma modifier in place of her normal CMB. Verdant
