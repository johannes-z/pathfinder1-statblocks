BeforeCombat: >-
  Kitten-like, the juvenile beast does not understand the crisis of the lost
  eggs. Instead, it just wants to roughhouse, although its form of play is
  potentially lethal for its targets.
DuringCombat: >-
  The hippogriff charges and bites the PC wearing the flashiest clothing. Then
  it delivers full attacks, switching targets if anyone else attacks it. A PC
  who succeeds at a DC 15 Sense Motive check discerns that the hippogriff is
  merely trying to play. It does not pursue PCs that leave the turret.
Morale: >-
  A PC who succeeds at a DC 20 Handle Animal check or a DC 18 wild empathy check
  as a standard action convinces the hippogriff to retreat to its perch. As a
  free action, any of its three pseudodragon parents can make it stand down with
  a telepathic command. Otherwise, the hippogriff flees if it is reduced to 6
  hit points or fewer.
