BeforeCombat: >-
  If she hears Herifax call the alarm, Kanya pulls the lever that transforms the
  catwalk in area A20 into a wobbly surface.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kanya knows her primary strength lies in sneak attacks. If she hears the alarm
  from Herifax, she enters combat on the second round, favoring her shortbow at
  first and firing on foes from the doorway. She won't hesitate to clamber onto
  the wobbly catwalk&#8211;her Acrobatics skill is high enough that she can move
  around on it at full speed and still never fail her check to avoid falling
  prone. She evades melee with those she suspects can make sneak attacks while
  on the catwalk, while simultaneously taking advantage of her enemies'
  flat-footed conditions while on the wobbly surface to make sneak attacks of
  her own. If she's confronted elsewhere (such as by stealthy PCs who make it to
  area A21 without raising an alarm), she drinks her potion of invisibility and
  seeks out an ally (either Herifax or Berkanin) to fight with rather than fight
  the PCs alone, although she certainly takes a moment to open the door to area
  A22 so the constructs within can swarm out to attack.
Morale: >-
  If she's reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, Kanya flees upstairs to area
  A23, where she fights to the death to protect Berkanin.
Gear: potion of invisibility
OtherGear: >-
  +1 leather armor, +1 short sword, shortbow with 20 arrows, amulet of natural
  armor +1, ring of protection +1, key to lockbox in A19
