SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sucking Maws (Su)
    description: >-
      A dark young of Shub-Niggurath that successfully pins a creature it is
      grappling automatically deals 1d4 points of Strength drain to that
      creature. A successful DC 22 Fortitude save reduces this effect to 1 point
      of Strength drain. A creature drained to a Strength score of 0 doesn't
      die, but must make a successful DC 24 Will save at that point to resist
      being driven mad by the experience, as the foul green waste exuded from
      the same sucking mouths that drink life implant in the emptied shells
      strange visions and horrifying certainties. This madness manifests as
      schizophrenia, but with a save DC equal to the dark young's Strength drain
      save DC listed above. If you don't use madnesses in your game, treat this
      madness instead as an insanity spell. The madness element of a dark
      young's sucking maws is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC for all the
      saving throws involved with this special ability is Constitution-based.
