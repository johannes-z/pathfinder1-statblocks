  - name: Alchemical Dependence (Su)
    description: >-
      Chymickal zombies are dependent on an alchemical elixir to keep their
      brains preserved and functioning. A chymickal zombie must inject itself
      with this elixir at least once per week. Failure to do so results in the
      loss of 1d4 points of Intelligence per week. This Intelligence loss is
      permanent and cannot be restored, but further Intelligence loss can be
      prevented with a new injection of the elixir. Once the chymickal zombie's
      Intelligence reaches 0, it loses all of its chymickal zombie abilities and
      becomes a normal zombie in all ways.
DuringCombat: >-
  The zombies use their Nimble Moves and Acrobatic Steps feats to move without
  hindrance through the room. They attack with flurries of blows, and use
  stunning fist to stun opponents and drag them beneath the water to drown.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 5 hit points or fewer, the zombies try to flee and warn Vorkstag
  and Grine.
