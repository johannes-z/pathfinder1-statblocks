SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Petrification (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature struck by the statue's slam attack must succeed at a DC 25
      Fortitude save or take 1d10 points of Dexterity drain. A creature drained
      to 0 Dexterity becomes petrified. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Shattering Blow (Su)
    description: >-
      If the Karzoug statue ever damages a petrified creature with its slam
      attack, that creature must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or be
      shattered into fragments. This essentially kills the PC, but also deals
      3d10 points of slashing damage to all creatures within a 5-foot radius of
      the shattered statue. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The stone golem uses its slow ability on the party every chance it gets,
  moving to place itself in an optimal position before activating this power. It
  focuses its physical attacks on the character who created the dominant weapon.
  Fortunately for that character, this newly enhanced weapon bypasses all damage
  reduction possessed by the stone golem.
Morale: >-
  Karzoug can maintain the golem's animation for only 4 rounds. If the PCs still
  live on the fifth round, the statue spends a round just speaking: "This… this
  is not the last… come then, heroes. Seek me atop Mhar Massif, if you value
  life so poorly. You should be honored to be the first fools executed under the
  banner of Shalast in ten thousand…" Karzoug is unable to finish his taunts,
  though, and the golem reverts to inanimate stone. It does not attack again.
