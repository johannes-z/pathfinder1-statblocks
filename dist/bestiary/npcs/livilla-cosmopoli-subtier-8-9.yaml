SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aurora Borealis (Sp)
    description: >-
      Livilla can create a sheet of cascading colors that acts as a wall of
      fire, but that deals cold damage and does not radiate heat. One side of
      the aurora designated by her fascinates creatures within 10 feet, up to a
      maximum of 20 HD of creatures. A DC 19 Will save negates this fascinate
      effect. She may use this ability for 10 rounds per day. These rounds do
      not need to be consecutive.
  - name: Bloodline Arcana (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever Livilla casts an evocation spell, targets that fail their saves
      are dazzled by tiny sparkling starlights for 1 round per level of the
      spell.
  - name: Minute Meteors (Sp)
    description: >-
      Livilla can summon a rain of tiny meteorites as a standard action to fall
      in a 5-foot column, 30 feet high, with a range of 30 feet. The meteors
      deal 1d4+6 points of fire damage. A DC 19 Reflex save negates this damage.
  - name: Voidwalker (Ex)
    description: >-

      included in her stats), and she does not need to breathe, as if wearing a
      necklace of adaptation.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: Starsoul*
BeforeCombat: >-
  Livilla has already cast mage armor on herself (included in her stats), and if
  she knows combat is coming, she prepares for battle by casting false life,
  blink, and mirror image.
DuringCombat: >-
  Livilla opens combat with haste, using her enhanced speed to avoid attackers
  and position herself to best assault her enemies with ranged evocation spells.
  If her foes position themselves such that she has no opportunity to use cone
  of cold against them, she uses her 5th-level slots to cast quickened magic
  missiles and rays of enfeeblement each round until she has expended all her
  5th-level spell slots.
Morale: >-
  As long as Livilla believes she has the true Mutani Manual, she fights to the
  death to defend it. If she suspects hers is a fake, she fights to the death to
  retrieve the true book from the PCs.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure serious wounds, potion of fly, potion of invisibility, wand of
  vampiric touch (7 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  light crossbow with 10 bolts, masterwork dagger, amulet of natural armor +1,
  cloak of resistance +2, ring of protection +1, false Mutani Manual of Martial
  Mastery, 3 violet garnets (500 gp each), 50 pp
