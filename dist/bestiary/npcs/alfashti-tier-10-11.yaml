SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Psychosis (Ex)
    description: >-
      Alfashti is filled with hatred for the world and plots to destroy
      everything and everyone around her. Her alignment shifts from lawful good
      to chaotic evil, and she gains a +10 competence bonus on Bluff checks made
      to hide her insanity.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury or spit&#8211;contact; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for
      6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Alfashti casts mage armor each day, ensuring that she's always protected from
  her many perceived enemies (already included in her stats). If the naga
  notices the PCs before they make engage her, she casts divine power,
  anticipating that she will need to kill them sooner rather than later.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once combat begins, Alfashti casts greater invisibility before launching an
  offensive. She favors lightning bolt and magic missile, knowing intelligent
  PCs will have protected themselves against fire attacks because of their
  proximity to so much magma. While she prefers magical attacks, the naga is not
  opposed to using her bite and spit attacks.
Morale: >-
  While suffering from psychosis, Alfashti fights to the death; if cured, she
  immediately surrenders.
