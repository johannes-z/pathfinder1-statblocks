SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ectoplasmic Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      After becoming a ghost, Maghara learned to use his iconic breath weapon,
      albeit with a slight difference. His breath weapon now produces a line of
      ectoplasm that deals force damage instead of acid damage.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Maghara prefers to observe invisibly to assess potential threats. He uses
  ghost sound, silent image, phantom trap, and telekinesis to scare off
  intruders. If he expects conflict, he casts shield to protect against magic
  missiles (which can harm even a ghost).
DuringCombat: >-
  Maghara relies on his incorporeal nature to protect him against most forms of
  harm. He initiates combat by using hideous laughter and telekinesis to deal
  with foes, using his corrupting touch only if needed, or against truly evil
  opponents.
Morale: >-
  Already a ghost, Maghara fears little, although he will use his incorporeal
  traits and invisibility to escape a losing battle, knowing that his work in
  the world is not yet done. Though he is careful to not be "destroyed," he
  knows his rejuvenation ability will bring him back after a time.
