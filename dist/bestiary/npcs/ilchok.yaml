  - name: Rapid Reversion (Su)
    description: >-
      Ilchok can revert to his true form as a swift action. However, doing so
      temporarily suppresses his ability to take alternate forms, preventing him
      from using his change shape ability for 10 minutes.

DuringCombat: >-
  Ilchok attacks humans first, using Power Attack to increase his damage. If his
  attacks consistently fail, he stops using Power Attack.
Morale: >-
  Ilchok drinks his potion of invisibility and attempts to flee if brought below
  15 hit points, cursing the PCs and warning them that the Ghostknives will
  destroy them and their allies. If he escapes, he returns to the Ghostknives'
  hideout and warns Cladara about the PCs-a warning that costs him his life (see
  page 18).
