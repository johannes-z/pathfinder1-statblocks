SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animate Webs (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Stilgrit can animate a 10-foot-square patch of
      natural webs within 50 feet to entrap creatures within that area. Any
      targets must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or become entangled. If a
      target is already entangled by webs, it must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude
      save or become helpless. A target made helpless by this ability is
      conscious but can take no physical actions (except attempting to break
      free) until the webs are removed. The target can use spells with only
      verbal components or spell-like abilities if it succeeds at a DC 20
      concentration check. A creature trapped in Stilgrit's animated webs can
      break free as a full-round action with a successful DC 16 Strength check
      (the DC for a helpless creature is increased by 5). Destroying the webs
      frees a trapped creature. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Extra Arms (Ex)
    description: >-
      Stilgrit has four extra spider-like arms growing from her sides. Although
      these arms lack hands, Stilgrit can make claw attacks with the arms. In
      addition, they aid her in climbing, allowing her to use her hands to cast
      spells with somatic components while climbing.
  - name: Favored of Mazmezz (Ex)
    description: >-
      Under the influence of Mazmezz, Stilgrit is a unique amalgamation of dwarf
      and ettercap. In addition to her animate webs ability and extra arms,
      Stilgrit retains the hearty and stability dwarf racial traits and gains a
      +2 bonus to Strength, a +2 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 bonus to
      natural armor.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 1d2
      Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Stilgrit hears intruders entering the tomb shaft, she casts barkskin, jump,
  and longstrider, and casts magic fang on her giant spider vermin companion.
Morale: Stilgrit fights to the death in defense of Lokmorr's shrine.
