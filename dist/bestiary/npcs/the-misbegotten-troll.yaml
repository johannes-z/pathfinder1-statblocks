  The Misbegotten Troll enjoys the wounds his ranseur causes his enemies almost
  as much as those it causes to his own body, and howls in delight with each
  successful hit. He also takes great delight in breaking the weapons of other
  foes, and often makes sunder attacks against those who wield particularly
  large weapons. If he faces a foe that seems capable of staying inside the
  reach of his ranseur, he casts the weapon aside with a frustrated roar and
  uses both claws in battle.
