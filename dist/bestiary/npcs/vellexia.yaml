BeforeCombat: Vellexia casts bull's strength, false life, and mage armor before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vellexia casts a quickened mirror image on the first round of combat, then
  attempts to use flesh to stone on the most attractive PC. She continues to
  move about in order to stay out of melee, casting greater invisibility on the
  second round and haste on the third round, and making sure to affect any
  allies as well. After this, she attacks the PCs each round with her ranged
  spells.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 50 or fewer hit points, Vellexia flees to her manor using
  greater teleport. She holds grudges, and if she escapes she can become a
  recurring villain throughout the rest of the campaign, sending groups of
  demons after the PCs and using her book of infinite spells to send nightmares
  now and then as you wish.
