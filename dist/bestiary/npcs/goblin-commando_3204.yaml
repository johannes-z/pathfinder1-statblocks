DuringCombat: >-
  The goblin commando makes sure to use his Mounted Combat feat as often as
  possible to try to negate an attack each round against his mount, and uses his
  superior mobility to remain out of melee so he can shoot at the PCs with his
  bow from dogback (taking the standard &#8211;4 penalty for using a ranged
  weapon while mounted). If all of his goblin warriors are defeated, he drops
  his bow and races in to fight the PCs in melee.
Morale: >-
  The commando fights to the death&#8211;yet does so more by accident than out
  of bravery.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds
OtherGear: studded leather, masterwork horsechopper, shortbow with 20 arrows
