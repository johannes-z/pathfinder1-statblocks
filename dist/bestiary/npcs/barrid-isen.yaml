BeforeCombat: Barrid casts mage armor and bull's strength before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Barrid starts combat by casting summon monster IV to summon 1d3 dretches. He
  then hangs back to attack the PCs with spells, casting rage on himself if they
  manage to engage him in melee. He fights defensively, backing toward the
  northern edge before he commands the aurochs to tug at the bridge supports to
  destroy the bridge.
Morale: >-
  Barrid flees to the citadel by using his wand if reduced to fewer than 20 hit
  points&#8211;the PCs should encounter him again in area F3, where he fights to
  the death. If he hasn't ordered the aurochs to destroy the bridge yet, he does
  so just before he flees.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, wand of dimension door (9 charges)
OtherGear: amulet of natural armor +1, cloak of resistance +2, 125 gp
