SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blizzard Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      A kokogiak's breath weapon is a polar gale so bitterly cold that it saps
      vigor from those it touches. Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a
      kokogiak can expel a 60-foot cone of blistering arctic winds, dealing 8d6
      points of cold damage to all creatures struck. A successful DC 23 Reflex
      save halves this damage. Any creature damaged by this attack must then
      succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or become fatigued (or exhausted if it
      was already fatigued). The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Forlorn Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a kokogiak can lock its black eyes on a target
      within 60 feet to fascinate the creature. A successful DC 20 Will save
      negates this effect. Creatures that fail the save are fascinated and they
      see the kokogiak as a lost loved one, trusted friend in danger, or ally in
      desperate need. Once a creature is fascinated, the kokogiak can compel the
      creature to move toward it. Once adjacent, the creature is flat-footed
      against the kokogiak's attacks, but the creature receives a new saving
      throw at the beginning of its turn to break the fascination. This is a
      mind-affecting effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Ice Walker (Ex)
    description: >-
      A kokogiak takes no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics, Climb, or Stealth
      checks in snowy or icy terrain or weather conditions. It can walk across
      snow crusts or thin ice without breaking through. In addition, a kokogiak
      can choose to not leave tracks when moving in this type of terrain.
  - name: Penetrating Sight (Ex)
    description: >-
      A kokogiak's sight is not affected by its own fog cloud or solid fog
      spell-like abilities. In addition, a kokogiak does not take any penalties
      on Perception checks while its snowing.
  - name: Sound Imitation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A kokogiak can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a
      successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check.
DuringCombat: >-
  The kokogiak casts solid fog on the first round of combat, then uses its
  breath weapon against anyone trapped in the fog. With its long neck, the
  kokogiak can reach opponents almost anywhere in the room without needing to
  move through the fog.
Morale: The kokogiak fights to the death.
