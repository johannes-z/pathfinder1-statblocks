SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blizzard Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Katiyana has become one with the morozko. Her gale aura functions
      continuously, and any creature beginning its turn inside the aura is
      buffeted with howling wind and driving snow, causing it to take a -2
      penalty on attack rolls for 1 round. Katiyana's blizzard aura does not
      function when she uses malevolence to possess another creature. Dispel
      magic or control winds suppresses the blizzard aura with a DC 20 caster
      level check for 1 round per level of the caster.
  - name: Icy Heart (Su)
    description: >-
      A heart of ice, pulsing with midnight blue radiance, beats within
      Katiyana's ghostly form, serving as her divine focus and granting her the
      cold subtype. In addition, whenever she deals cold damage to a creature
      with resistance to cold, half of the cold damage penetrates that
      resistance; the remaining damage is blocked normally. Creatures with
      immunity to cold are unaffected. Storm-Torn (Su) Katiyana became a ghost
      when the Storm Sphere scattered her spirit on the polar winds. As a
      result, Katiyana does not have a normal ghost's rejuvenation ability, and
      is permanently destroyed when her hit points reach 0.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Katiyana retains the spell effects she cast while possessing Bormurg. In
  addition, any other spells that she cast while possessing Bormurg are no
  longer prepared.
DuringCombat: >-
  Katiyana summons a Large air, ice, or lightning elemental or fiendish woolly
  rhinoceros on the first round of combat to attack her enemies. She uses Flyby
  Attack to move in and out of cover or concealment, using spells or called
  lightning against her enemies.
Morale: >-
  Although unable to rejuvenate, Katiyana's fury overwhelms her and she fights
  until destroyed.
