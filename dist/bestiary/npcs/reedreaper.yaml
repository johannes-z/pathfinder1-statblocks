DuringCombat: >-
  Reedreaper has largely sworn himself to nonviolence and fights only to protect
  and subdue whenever possible. He remains close to an ally (normally Mictena)
  to protect her with his Saving Shield feat, and he offers this protection to
  the PCs should they win his favor. Against cruel foes he is merciless, lashing
  out with Power Attack and Cleave.
Morale: >-
  Reedreaper surrenders in most fights if reduced below 20 hit points, but if
  fighting in Mictena's defense, he fights to the death.

  (+2 Str) with 20 arrows, cloak of resistance +1
