SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Brain Consumption (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a dread zombie cyclops deals damage with its bite attack against a
      helpless or pinned living foe, the bitten creature must make a DC 22
      Fortitude save or be reduced to a negative hit point total equal to 1
      lower than his current Constitution as the zombie begins to consume his
      brain. If the dread zombie bites a foe who is in negative hit points, he
      automatically kills the foe by eating his brain. The save DC is
      Strength-based.
  - name: Command Zombies (Su)
    description: >-
      A dread zombie cyclops can automatically command all normal zombies within
      30 feet as a free action. Normal zombies never attack a dread zombie
      unless compelled.
DuringCombat: >-
  Plagued by shattered, incomplete memories of an ancient cyclops empire and a
  constant, gnawing hunger for brains, the dread zombie cyclops lurches to
  roaring violence upon sighting any living intruder, attacking intruders on
  sight.
Morale: The undead cyclops fights until destroyed.
