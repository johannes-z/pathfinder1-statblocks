SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Drone (Su)
    description: >-
      The sound of a derakni in flight is a mesmerizing, unsettling drone that
      causes confusion in all non-demons who hear the sound. A derakni must fly
      at least 10 feet to activate this ability (which it can do as part of a
      move action). Any non-demon creature that begins its turn within 30 feet
      of a derakni that moved in this manner on its previous turn must succeed
      at a DC 18 Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. A creature that
      succeeds at this save is immune to the drone of that derakni for 24 hours.
      Demons are immune to this sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite or sting-injury; save Fort DC 21; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds;
      effect 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
BeforeCombat: The derakni attempts to summon another derakni before entering combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The derakni casts insect plague and quickened summon swarm on the first round
  of combat. It hopes to throw the PCs into chaos so it can swoop around the
  edges of the swarms to attack lone heroes who stagger out of the swarm,
  staying in flight and using Flyby attacks with its sting while keeping its
  drone effect going as long as possible.
Morale: >-
  The derakni teleports away and does not return if it's reduced to fewer than
  20 hit points.
