SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Pairakas carry two diseases: bubonic plague, which they inflict with their
      claws, and the shakes, which can infect any creature that comes into
      contact with them (via a grapple or willing contact). The save DCs of both
      diseases are Constitution-based. Bubonic Plague: Claws-injury; save Fort
      DC 17; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage and 1 Cha
      damage and target is fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves. Shakes:
      Touch&#8211;contact; save Fort DC 17; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect
      1d8 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Lustful Dreams (Su)
    description: >-
      Pairakas can torment sleeping creatures. While intelligent creatures
      sleep, pairakas can slip into their minds and twist their dreams to lusty
      nocturnal visions. The victim must be asleep for the pairaka to use this
      ability and the pairaka must be within 100 feet. If the victim fails a DC
      23 Will save, it experiences vivid hallucinations of a lurid nature that
      leave it breathless and fatigued upon waking. The victim, even a depraved
      soul, rarely considers the sexual nature of these dreams enjoyable and the
      images exploit any number of taboos the pairaka suspects he might harbor.
      The save is Charisma-based. Creatures that do not sleep or dream are
      immune to this effect.
  - name: Summon Swarm (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day a pairaka can summon a swarm of biting flies. This ability is
      identical to insect plague (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 301) except the
      swarm is composed of buzzing flies instead of locusts.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Shybbahla assumes the form of a lithe, young human woman, and attempts to
  charm or otherwise fool the PCs into joining the mercenaries in her mock
  sacrifice.
DuringCombat: >-
  If the PCs discover her ruse or otherwise initiate combat, Shybbahla flies out
  of their reach and attempts to summon dorus (see page 15) to aid her. If this
  tactic fails, she uses her summon swarm ability against the PCs. After
  weakening them in this manner, she makes hit-and-run attacks from the air,
  ever trying to stay out of reach.
Morale: >-
  Fearful of Ahriman's wrath, Shybbahla harasses and attacks the PCs as long as
  they remain in the ruins. She fights to the death.
