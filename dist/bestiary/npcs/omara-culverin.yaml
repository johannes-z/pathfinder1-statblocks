BeforeCombat: >-
  Omara drinks a potion of shield of faith before combat. In addition, her stat
  block includes the bonuses from Kerdak Bonefist's lord's banner of victory.
DuringCombat: >-
  At ranges beyond 80 feet, Omara makes single attacks using her far-reaching
  sight and Deadly Aim. Once foes are within range, she makes full attacks with
  her musket using Rapid Shot and Deadly Aim. Omara spends grit as needed, but
  tries to always save at least 1 grit point to take advantage of deeds such as
  gunslinger's initiative and quick clear.
Morale: >-
  Omara fights for the Hurricane King only so long as it seems prudent. If foes
  reach her crow's nest and engage her in melee combat, or if she is reduced to
  fewer than 60 hit points, Omara surrenders, offering the secrets of firearms
  in exchange for her life. Omara doesn't care who wears the Hurricane
  Crown&#8211;if spared, she offers her services to whoever is named the
  Hurricane King (see Concluding the Adventure).
