SQ: serpent companion (albino constrictor snake named Qestl)
Source: AP 42
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Exceptional Resources (Ex)
    description: >-
      Due to his position as Ydersius's high priest as well as his connections
      with the elder serpentfolk of Sverenagati, Vyr-Azul has the wealth of a PC
      rather than an NPC. This equipment increases his CR by 1.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 27; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2
      Str; cure 2 saves.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Vyr-Azul casts greater magic weapon on himself and greater magic fang on his
  serpent companion Qestl every day. If alerted to the PCs' presence in the
  Sacred Vaults, he uses greater scrying to observe their approach so he can
  cast freedom of movement, protection from energy (fire), true seeing, and
  divine power, and shield from his staff, before they enter the inner sanctum.
  He also casts animal growth and divine favor on Qestl. If he has time,
  Vyr-Azul also casts blur and mirror image on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vyr-Azul takes to the air using his winged boots and casts lesser globe of
  invulnerability from his staff on the first round of combat. He casts blade
  barrier or repulsion to prevent opponents from closing with him, then calls
  additional allies with summon monster VIII and summon monster VII, sending 1d3
  tyrannosauruses to occupy dangerous warriors and 1d3 invisible stalkers to
  grapple spellcasters. He targets groups with area-affecting spells, and
  channels negative energy using Selective Channeling to exclude his summoned
  allies. Vyr-Azul implies the PCs' efforts are wasted, using mass suggestion to
  convince them to flee before the snake-god consumes them as his first meal
  upon his return. Vyr-Azul saves potent spells like destruction and harm until
  his allies have fallen or someone finally reaches him. If forced into melee
  combat, Vyr-Azul uses dominate person to gain a protector from among his
  enemies, then attacks with his staff and poison bite while directing his
  serpent companion to flank and grapple foes.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 150 hit points, Vyr-Azul takes a parting shot with a
  spell like destruction or stormbolts, then uses quickened teleport to seek
  safety among the rubble on the far side of the Chasm of Retreat (area C9)  or
  in his private temple (area C11). There he casts heal or cleanse before
  renewing the fight. Thereafter, he battles to the death, even collapsing part
  of the cavern roof with earthquake to take as many of the PCs with him as
  possible.
Gear: scroll of gate, wand of cure serious wounds (30 charges)

  perfection +4, cloak of resistance +3, headband of inspired wisdom +4, pale
