BeforeCombat: >-
  The First Warden casts shield of faith before combat, uses her sacred weapon
  ability to bolster her mace to an enhancement bonus of +2, and uses her sacred
  armor ability to grant her full plate the light fortification special ability.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once driven to attack, the First Warden calls upon the phantom armors standing
  guard in area D11 to join her, then casts summon monster IV to summon 1d3
  fiendish constrictor snakes to fight for her. She also expends a use of fervor
  on that first round to cast divine power on herself as a swift action, then
  does so again on the second round to cast divine favor on herself. On
  following rounds, she continues to use fervor to heal herself each round with
  the most powerful inflict spells she can cast.
Morale: >-
  The First Warden fights until destroyed, trusting that her phylactery will
  reform a new body a few days after her defeat. She doesn't quite realize,
  though, that her phylactery is now stored in a long-forgotten vault deep under
  her family's old estate in Egorian&#8211;and the estate was claimed by a rival
  family after her kin died out. As a result, if she's defeated, she reforms in
  a forgotten crypt below a distant city, where she may well serve as a plot
  device for a future adventure of your design, but is unable to return to
  Kintargo anytime soon.
Gear: >-
  +2 full plate, +1 merciful heavy mace, headband of mental prowess +2 (Wis,
  Cha)
