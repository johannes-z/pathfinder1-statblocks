    description: >-
      Omast is currently drunk and suffering from moderate addiction to alcohol.
      While drunk, he is considered to be sickened. When not under the effects
      of alcohol, his addiction imparts a -2 penalty to his Strength and
      Constitution scores. Rules for drugs and addiction can be found on pages
      236&#8211;237 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  In combat, Omast repositions enemies around the battlefield, forcing them into
  positions where his allies can flank them or attack them from strategic
  locations. He sunders the weapons or armor of particularly tough enemies,
  though he is unafraid to attack and kill those he deems too great a threat to
  continue living.
Morale: >-
  Omast drinks his potion of cure moderate wounds if brought to fewer than 20
  hit points, but he's willing to share his potion with allies in need as well.
  If he's reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, Omast attempts to retreat, though
  he stays and fights to the death to defend the lives of native Trunauans.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, smokesticks (2), thunderstones (2)
