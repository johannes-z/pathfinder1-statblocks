BeforeCombat: The moon maidens each cast lead blades and longstrider before entering combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The moon maidens rage when combat begins, hurling their nonmagical starknives
  at their enemies for the first few rounds. Once they're down to only their
  magical starknives, they rush in to engage foes in melee. If they're fighting
  with allies, one moon maiden activates her hunter's bond to share her bonuses,
  with the others activating their bonds in turn when the previous one wears
  off.
Morale: >-
  A moon maiden fights until brought to fewer than 10 hit points, at which point
  she flees to recover and plan her second assault on the enemy. A moon maiden
  who is raging does not flee, but fights to the death.
