BeforeCombat: >-
  Somasia pretends to surrender as described above&#8211;she waits to be
  unmasked, and then unleashes her petrifying gaze.
DuringCombat: >-
  After scooping up her blade, she slashes away with sabre and bites with
  snakes. Somasia tries to draw the PCs' attention away from the disguised
  beheaders so her companions can position themselves for sneak attacks.
Morale: >-
  If reduced below 20 hit points, Somasia tries to negotiate her safe surrender,
  offering to reveal where she has hidden a stone salve (area 5). If her
  petrification has failed such that her offer is of limited value, she instead
  flees to area 6 and tries to escape with an air glissade, using her scroll of
  feather fall.
Gear: scroll of feather fall
OtherGear: >-
  mithral shirt, masterwork sawtooth sabres* (2), Red Mantis outfit with a
  nonmagical Red Mantis mask
