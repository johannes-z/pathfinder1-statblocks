SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Chain Bound (Ex)
    description: >-
      A chain slave is covered in the chains that it uses as weapons and armor.
      If the chain slave is disarmed or drops his chain, it can rearm itself
      using the chains on its body as a free action. If a chain slave makes a
      successful grapple check to pin a foe, it can make a second grapple check
      as a free action to entangle the creature. Once a creature is entangled
      the creature automatically moves whenever the chain salve moves. The
      entangled creature can escape with a successful CMB check. The chain slave
      can release an entangled creature as a free action.
  - name: Chain Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      The chains that adorn a chain slave grant it a +5 armor bonus, but are not
      treated as armor for the purpose of arcane spell failure, armor check
      penalties, maximum Dexterity, weight, or proficiency.
  - name: Chain Climber (Su)
    description: >-
      A chain slave has a climb speed equal to his normal move speed when moving
      on chains.
BeforeCombat: >-
  One of the chain slaves lurks in the center of the room and calls out to the
  party while trying to stay out  of sight amid the chains. It attempts to draw
  the party across the bridge in the center of the room before attacking. The
  other chain slaves use Stealth to circle the party and attack from the rear.
Morale: >-
  The chain slaves take pleasure in killing for the Cairn of Shadows' warden and
  don't have any fear of death.
