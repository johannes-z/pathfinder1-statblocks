  - name: Immortal (Su)
    description: >-
      While imprisoned aboard the Voracious, Hrethnar does not age, nor does he
      require food or water to sustain him. If removed from the Voracious, he
      begins to age normally. If taken more than 1 mile from the Gloomspires,
      his lost years catch up to him and he instantly dies.
  - name: Negative Levels (Su)
    description: >-
      Hrethnar's life force has slowly drained away during his long
      imprisonment. He currently has 7 negative levels that can't be removed
      until he is removed from the Voracious. The effects of these negative
      levels have already been calculated into his stat block.
  - name: Weakened (Ex)
    description: >-
      Hrethnar does not have access to his spellbook. Without his spellbook,
      Hrethnar can only recall and cast the spells associated with his Spell
      Mastery feat (detect magic, mage armor, and shocking grasp). He is also
      unarmed.
Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: Divination, Enchantment
BeforeCombat: Hrethnar casts mage armor on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Hrethnar casts his offensive spells and uses his force missile spell-like
  ability. After these abilities are exhausted, he dares his enemies to toss him
  an axe so he can take his foes with him into death.
Morale: Hrethnar is haughty and proud. He fights to the death.
