BeforeCombat: >-
  If the PCs give him time to prepare, Vuiper casts discern lies, freedom of
  movement, and protection from energy (fire) before he answers his door to talk
  to them.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vuiper tries to keep his distance in combat, using channeled negative energy
  or his spells to keep the PCs at range as long as possible while fighting a
  retreat to area T9 where he can yell downstairs for aid. Chammady won't reply,
  which forces Vuiper to use his cape of the mountebank to flee to her side,
  likely forcing her to join the fray. If Vuiper attacks first, this is the
  final straw on his teetering faith&#8211;Abadar does not approve and
  immediately strips the man of his spells and ability to channel negative
  energy. In this event, a panicked Vuiper falls back on his crossbow and makes
  haste to join Chammady for protection. If the PCs attack Vuiper first, though,
  his faith is not broken and he retains access to his spells and abilities, as
  he can convince himself he's only acting in self-defense.
Morale: >-
  If brought below 40 hit points, Vuiper drops his weapons and begs for mercy.
  He holds nothing back from the PCs, asking them only to be merciful to his
  lover when they confront her.
Gear: >-

  mountebank, headband of inspired wisdom +2, ring of protection +2, gold holy
