SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action once every 1d4 rounds, the Guardian of Coin can expel a
      cloud of smoke and cinders that fills a 20-foot cube. This functions as an
      incendiary cloud that persists for 1d6 rounds, dealing 6d6 points of fire
      damage (Reflex DC 20 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Coin Shot (Ex)
    description: >-
      A spinning wheel in the Guardian's chest can shred silver and gold coins
      from an internal hopper and project them at high speed. Once each round as
      a swift action, the guardian can either fire a single ranged attack at a
      creature within 60 feet or fire a spray of projectiles that strikes all
      creatures in a 15-foot cone. Resolve the ranged attack normally. All
      creatures in the cone take 2d6 points of damage and are blinded for 1d6
      rounds; a successful DC 21 Reflex saving throw halves the damage and
      eliminates the blinded condition.
  - name: Death Throes (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Guardian melts into a pool of molten slag when destroyed, dealing 15d6
      points of fire damage to all creatures within 30 feet of the golem (Reflex
      DC 20 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Guardian is a straightforward and brutal combatant, closing to melee with
  its claws while unleashing bursts of shredded coins.
Morale: The Guardian fights until destroyed.
