SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blessings (Su)
    description: >-
      Your deity (Gorum, god of strength and battle) grants you the following
      minor powers, which you can call upon four times per day in any
      combination. Strength Surge: As a swift action, you gain a +1 enhancement
      bonus on melee attacks, combat maneuver checks that rely on Strength,
      Strengthbased skills, and Strength checks for 1 round. War Mind: You can
      touch an ally to grant it a tactical advantage for 1 minute. Each round at
      the start of its turn, it can select one of the following bonuses: +10
      feet to base land speed, +1 dodge bonus to AC, +1 insight bonus on attack
      rolls, or a +1 luck bonus on saving throws.
  - name: Fervor (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, you can touch a creature to heal it of 1d6 points of
      damage as a standard action; targeting yourself is a swift action.
      Alternatively, you can deal 1d6 points of damage to an undead creature
      with a successful melee touch attack as a standard action that provokes an
      attack of opportunity. This attack counts as positive energy and undead do
      not receive a saving throw against it. As a swift action, you can expend
      one use of fervor to cast any one warpriest spell you have prepared. You
      can target only yourself with this spell, even if it could normally affect
      other or multiple targets. Spells cast in this way ignore somatic
      components and do not provoke attacks of opportunity. You do not need to
      have a free hand to cast a spell in this way. Focus Weapon You receive
      Weapon Focus as a bonus feat.
  - name: Sacred Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Your deity's favored weapon (greatsword) and any weapons designated by
      selecting them with the Weapon Focus feat are sacred weapons, and deal
      damage based on your level rather than the weapon type. At 3rd level, a
      sacred weapon deals 1d6 points of damage. If the weapon normally deals
      more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This does not affect any
      other aspect of the weapon. Spontaneous Casting You can expend any
      prepared spell that isn't an orison (0-level spell) in order to cast any
      spell with "cure" in its name that's of the same spell level or lower.
