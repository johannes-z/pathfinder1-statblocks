BeforeCombat: >-
  If the tieflings are aware of the PCs, they line up far from the door and load
  their crossbows. If it is night and they can see the intruders are bringing
  light, one of them uses darkness on the west end of the room (this means that
  if the PCs' light source would normally provide dim light in that area, it
  becomes darkness, which the tieflings can see through with their darkvision).
DuringCombat: >-
  The tieflings fight at range for as long as possible, then draw their maces
  and try to flank for the remainder of the battle. They try to make as much
  noise as possible, hoping to get the attention of the lookout in area B3c. If
  the PCs carry light, one of the tieflings uses darkness to lower the light
  level so they can make ranged attacks out of the darkness.
Morale: >-
  If two tieflings are killed, the other two try to head for the northwest
  stairs to warn the others in area G2. They specifically call out, "Get the
  mummies! We need help!"
Gear: >-
  studded leather armor, light mace, 20 bolts, dagger, simple thieves' tools (-2
  penalty on checks), 20 gp
