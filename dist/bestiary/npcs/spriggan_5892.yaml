  - name: Size Alteration (Su)
    description: >-
      At will as a standard action, a spriggan can change his size between Small
      and Large. Weapons, armor, and other objects on the spriggan's person grow
      proportionally when he changes size (objects revert to normal size 1 round
      after a spriggan releases them). When a spriggan becomes Large, his speed
      increases to 30 feet, he gains +12 Strength, -2 Dexterity, and +6
      Constitution, and he takes a &#8211;2 size penalty to his AC. While Large,
      a spriggan cannot use his sneak attack or his racial spell-like abilities.

      for all of its racial spell-like abilities.
