DuringCombat: >-
  If restored to life (likely via a dose of stone salve, perhaps along with a
  curse), Grugonoth roars and thrashes in delight and frustration for a round
  before immediately attacking all nearby targets&#8211;charau-ka and PCs alike.
  He begins battle with a blasphemy spell, but then relies on his melee attacks
  to destroy foes, resorting to spell-like abilities only against foes that seem
  resistant to physical damage.
Morale: >-
  Grugonoth's driving desire is to first seek out the Radiant Muse (see area J)
  and slay her. His next plan is to reclaim his old rule over Saventh-Yhi. He
  won't risk his life against the PCs if that means putting these plans at risk,
  and flees any combat if reduced to fewer than 40 hit points by flying up into
  the sky and seeking out an abandoned ruin elsewhere in the city where he can
  heal and plot his next move.
