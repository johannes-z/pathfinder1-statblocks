SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cleaver (Su)
    description: >-
      Each of these cinder ghouls wields a wicked-looking meat cleaver that
      functions as a +2 conductiveUE dagger. If a cinder ghoul is destroyed, or
      if a cinder ghoul is forced to drop its cleaver, the cleaver becomes a
      nonmagical improvised weapon. This unique ability, which grants the cinder
      ghoul additional opportunities to affect foes with burn and energy drain,
      increases its CR by 1.
  - name: Limited Gaseous Form (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because it has solid body parts that constantly float and swirl within it,
      a cinder ghoul has a limited version of gaseous form. Although other
      gaseous creatures can slip under the crack of a door, a cinder ghoul
      cannot. A cinder ghoul can, however, make slam attacks, retains its
      natural armor bonus, and can wield objects and weapons. Spells, spell-like
      abilities, and supernatural abilities affect them normally. A cinder ghoul
      cannot enter water or other liquid. It is not ethereal or incorporeal, and
      is affected by winds or other forms of moving air to the extent that the
      wind pushes them in the direction the wind is moving. However, even the
      strongest wind can't disperse or damage a cinder ghoul. Because it
      contains burning embers and small bits of perpetually smoldering flesh, a
      cinder ghoul cannot hide and gains no bonuses on Stealth checks in an area
      of mist, smoke, or other gas.
  - name: Smoke Inhalation (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a cinder ghoul can attempt to force some of its
      smoky form into the lungs of a living opponent. To initiate this attack,
      it must move into its target's space (this does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity). The target must then attempt a successful DC 18 Fortitude
      save or inhale part of the creature. Smoke inside the victim's lungs burns
      the surrounding tissue, dealing 1d2 points of Constitution damage each
      round. The affected creature can attempt another Fortitude save each round
      to cough out the burning residue and thus end the effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The cinder ghouls move to attack the closest targets. On the first round that
  a cinder ghoul is adjacent to a foe at the start of that round, the ghoul
  attempts its smoke inhalation attack while the other ghoul continues to fight.
  Although they will pursue foes into the nearby larder to the southwest, they
  do not pursue foes further into the castle.
Morale: The cinder ghouls fight until destroyed.
