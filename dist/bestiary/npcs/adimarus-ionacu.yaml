DuringCombat: >-
  Adimarus opens with his smite attacks, focusing his attacks on paladins or
  good clerics if possible. He uses his touch of corruption to sicken opponents
  who face him in combat, and tries to spread his curse of lycanthropy with his
  bite whenever possible.
Morale: >-
  Adimarus cannot lose a fight without losing authority and command over his
  pack, so he fights to the death.
Gear: +2 breastplate, +1 bastard sword, silver unholy symbol of Jezelda
