SQ: oversized weapon, witch's familiar (Small air elemental named Myralka)
Source: AP 96
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities: []
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: Nalbia casts mage armor on her familiar Myralka every day.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nalbia casts blink on the first round of combat. As much as possible, she
  tries to remain in a position that does not expose her to close combat,
  letting her familiar Myralka and the cloud giant veterans from area F42 keep
  melee opponents occupied while she uses her enchantment spells, hexes, and
  wand of lightning bolt to target foes at range. Once the cloud giants are in
  melee, Nalbia casts screech to give them an advantage. If cornered, the witch
  gives as good as she gets, wielding her oversized sickle with cruel glee.
Morale: >-
  Although faithful to Volstus, Nalbia's first and foremost loyalty is to
  herself. As a result, when reduced to 65 hit points or fewer, Nalbia attempts
  to flee, likely casting dimension door to join her brother Nalbur in area F49.
Gear: >-
  scrolls of cure serious wounds (2), scroll of ice storm, scroll of solid fog,
  wand of lightning bolt (24 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  Gargantuan +1 sickle, bracers of armor +4, ring of protection +3, spell
  component pouch, various jewelry and ornaments (worth 1,500 gp)
