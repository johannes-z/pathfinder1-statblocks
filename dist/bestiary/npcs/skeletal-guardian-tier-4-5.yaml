BeforeCombat: >-
  The skeletal guardian remains still as the PCs explore the room, waiting until
  the first PC steps into the hallway.
DuringCombat: >-
  The skeleton attacks the nearest target and only changes its target when its
  current victim is dead or unconscious. As an unintelligent undead, it employs
  no strategies in combat, and moves as needed to attack, even if doing so
  restricts it to a single attack per round.
Morale: >-
  Unintelligent and created for a singular purpose, the skeletal guardian fights
  until destroyed, but does not leave area 1 if the PCs flee.
