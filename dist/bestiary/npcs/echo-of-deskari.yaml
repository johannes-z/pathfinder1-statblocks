SQ: death throes, dual initiative
Source: AP 78
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Abyssal Scythe (Su)
    description: >-
      The Favored of Deskari can, as an immediate action, manifest a +4
      brilliant energy scythe in his hands. Unlike a normal brilliant energy
      weapon, this weapon can harm living and nonliving creatures equally well.
      This scythe vanishes if it ever leaves the Favored's grip.
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When the Favored of Deskari is slain, his body splits open to unleash a
      short-lived explosion of ravenous flesh-eating locusts that immediately
      fill a 30-foot-radius spread. All creatures in this area take 10d6 points
      of slashing damage and take 10 points of bleed damage from the wounds-a
      successful DC 30 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the bleed
      damage. This attack penetrates damage reduction as if it were an epic evil
      magic weapon. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Drone (Su)
    description: >-
      By buzzing its wings as a free action, whether in flight or not, the
      Favored of Deskari creates a 60-foot-radius aura of droning sound. Any
      non-demon that begins its turn in this area must succeed at a DC 25 Will
      save or become confused for 1d4 rounds, affected as if by mythic
      confusion. A mythic creature that succeeds at this save is immune to the
      drone for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect that demons are
      immune to. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Su)
    description: >-
      Bite or sting&#8211;injury; save Fort DC 30; frequency 1/round for 10
      rounds; effect 1d6 Con drain and staggered for 1 round; cure 3 consecutive
      saves. This poison can affect creatures that are normally immune to
      poison, although such creatures gain a +4 bonus on their saving throws
      against the effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Swarm-Infested (Su)
      The Echo of Deskari is immune to damage and effects caused by swarms. It
      can direct the actions of any mindless swarm within 90 feet as a free
      action. Any swarm it creates via its spell-like abilities deals triple the
      normal amount of swarm damage; this damage penetrates damage reduction as
      if it were an epic evil magic weapon.
  - name: Word of Deskari (Su)
    description: >-
      The Echo of Deskari can communicate with all vermin, and they follow his
      commands unerringly if they are nonintelligent.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Echo of Deskari begins combat by attempting to cast imprisonment on a PC
  who looks frail, then follows that up by attempting to summon mariliths. After
  that, it attacks foes in melee. It uses blasphemy if it is surrounded by foes
  and is being overwhelmed, hoping to banish some foes for a time back to the
  Material Plane.
