BeforeCombat: >-
  If Vermund knows the PCs are coming, he summons a dire rat and then hides
  behind the westernmost bookshelf.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vermund lets his agents fight in melee and tries to stay back, using his magic
  stones and sling to hit PCs who are out of melee combat and casting cure light
  wounds if one of his agents looks seriously hurt. If there are particularly
  tough PCs, he hits them with flare whenever it makes sense to do so. If
  reduced to fewer than 5 hit points, Vermund attempts to drink his potion of
  cure moderate wounds on his next action.
Morale: Vermund fights to the death.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds
OtherGear: masterwork hide armor, masterwork sickle, sling with 10 bullets, 700 gp
