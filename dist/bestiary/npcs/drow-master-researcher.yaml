SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      Drow are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally
      poisoning themselves. The master researchers do not carry any poison.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: arcane
BeforeCombat: >-
  The master researchers cast false life on themselves every day (this is
  already included in the above hit point totall). If expecting combat, they
  casts invisibility, followed by castings of summon monster IV every round to
  summon a hound archon (for the irony of using a lawful good archon against her
  enemies amuses them). Their first casting of summon monster IV is the bonus
  spell from their arcane bond daggers (which doesn't count toward the spells
  per day listed above).
DuringCombat: >-
  If the researchers are not invisible at the start of combat, they cast
  invisibility. One then casts haste on the drow captain, the other casts summon
  monster IV if she hasn't done so once or twice already, with the first
  researcher following up with a summoning of her own. If the captain is having
  a hard time defeating the PCs, the researchers cast greater invisibility and
  false life on the captain, slow on their enemies, then turn invisible again
  and continue to cast either false life on the captain or another summon
  monster every round, saving one 4th-level spell slot.
Morale: >-
  If the captain is defeated and it looks like the PCs are going to be able to
  kill the researchers, they cast dimension door to teleport out of the pyramid
  and onto the floor of the cavern directly underneath it, then cast
  invisibility and try to escape back into the Darklands. If prevented from
  using dimension door, they cast charm person to gain temporary allies and try
  to fly "down" the floor tunnel and team up with the demon in area 5.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, mwk dagger, hand crossbow, bolts (20)
OtherGear: >-
  headband of alluring charisma +2, bundle of scrolls with notes about the
  pyramid's warding magic (written in Undercommon), 200 gp
