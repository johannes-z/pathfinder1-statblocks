  - name: Sudden Charge (Ex)
    description: >-
      When making a charge attack, a diatryma makes a single bite attack. If
      successful, it may also attempt to trip its opponent as a free action
      without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the
      diatryma cannot be tripped in return.
DuringCombat: >-
  The diatrymas savagely charge and tear at nearby PCs. If a PC climbs on top of
  the hill to the north, a diatryma disengages to attack this creature.
Morale: >-
  The diatrymas fight to defend their eggs, but once one is slain, the other's
  instincts tell it to flee once reduced to half its hit points.
