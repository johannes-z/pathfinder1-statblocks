  Runa quickly drinks her potion of eagle's splendor once Hjort starts slinging
  insults.
DuringCombat: >-
  Runa starts combat by casting silence, trying to catch as many PC spellcasters
  in the area of spell's effect as possible. After that, she stays away from
  melee if possible, and instead channels negative energy into the PCs as often
  as she can, using Selective Channeling to exclude her compatriots. She casts
  hold person on the first PC to close with her in melee and then casts cause
  fear on the next.
Morale: Runa fights to the death.
