SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Chill (Su)
    description: >-
      Dargentu's claws inflict an additional 1d6 points of cold damage on a hit,
      and any creature that takes this additional cold damage must make a DC 20
      Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round by the numbing chill. The save
      DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When Dargentu is destroyed, he explodes into a burst of choking dust. All
      creatures within 10 feet must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 1d6
      points of Constitution damage from the violent choking and necromantic
      scouring of this supernaturally vile dust. Those who fail the save are
      also nauseated for 1d6 rounds, while those who succeed are merely sickened
      for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Spell Leech (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a spellcaster within 50 feet of Dargentu casts a spell, the
      spellcaster must make a DC 20 Will save or the spell is lost, as if it
      were counterspelled. The lost spell's energy is transferred to Dargentu,
      who can use the magical energy in one of the following three ways.
      Dargentu can only store the energy of one spell at a time. Cast: Dargentu
      can cast the spell on his turn at caster level 11th. When casting spells
      in this manner, he ignores the spell's material component requirements,
      but not its focus requirements. Eldritch Bolt: Dargentu can release the
      spell as an eldritch bolt of pure magic energy as a standard action (range
      50 ft., ranged touch +12, 1d6 damage per 2 levels of the spell used to
      create it). Healing: Dargentu can absorb the spell's energy to heal hit
      points equal to the spell's level x4. Hit points in excess of his maximum
      are instead gained as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points
      last for 1 hour before fading.
  - name: Spell Sense (Su)
    description: >-
      Dargentu can automatically pinpoint the location of any spellcaster within
      100 feet who has cast a spell within the previous round. He can also
      identify spells as they are being cast and all existing spell effects as
      if he were under the effects of greater arcane sight.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  As soon as Dargentu notices intruders (either with his spell sense, by someone
  shutting down the capacitor at area F14, or by sight), he moves at once to
  attack-moving to area F14 if no obvious foe can be pinpointed. He focuses his
  attacks on non-spellcasters, hoping to give spellcasters more opportunities to
  cast so he can use his spell leech powers and revel in the act of once again
  being able to cast spells. In most cases, Dargentu opts to cast spells he
  absorbs unless there's no use for them, in which case he heals (if he's
  damaged) or uses an eldritch bolt.
Morale: Dargentu fights until destroyed.
