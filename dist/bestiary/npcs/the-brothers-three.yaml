SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      A nosferatu can suck blood from a living victim with its fangs by making a
      successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4
      points of Constitution and Wisdom drain each round the pin is maintained.
      On each such successful attack, the nosferatu gains 5 temporary hit
      points.
  - name: Damage Reduction (Ex)
    description: >-
      A nosferatu has damage reduction 5/ wood and piercing (this includes all
      wood-shafted weapons like arrows, crossbow bolts, spears, and javelins,
      even if the weapon's head is made of another material).
  - name: Dominate (Su)
    description: >-
      This functions as the vampire ability of the same name (Pathfinder RPG
      Bestiary 271).
  - name: Spider Climb (Ex)
    description: >-
      This functions as the vampire ability of the same name (Pathfinder RPG
      Bestiary 271).
  - name: Swarm Form (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a nosferatu can change into a bat swarm, centipede
      swarm, rat swarm, or spider swarm. The swarm has the same number of hit
      points as the nosferatu. While in swarm form, a nosferatu cannot use its
      claw attacks or any of its special attacks. It retains its defensive
      abilities and special qualities, and counts as an undead creature. It
      gains the natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks of the swarm
      it transformed into and can use any of the swarm's abilities and defenses.
      It can remain in swarm form until it assumes another form or until the
      next sunrise.
  - name: Telekinesis (Su)
    description: As a standard action, a nosferatu can use telekinesis (caster level 12th).
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  The Brothers Three prepare themselves by casting bull's strength, eagle's
  splendor, defile armor, and protection from good, and use their fiendish boon
  ability to make their claws +1 unholy weapons. In addition, they are under the
  effects of the erodaemon Serafina's desecrate spell in this area.
DuringCombat: >-
  The nosferatu brothers flank opponents and use their smite good ability on the
  biggest apparent threat. They make liberal use of their touch of corruption
  ability to harm and nauseate opponents, and use it or channeled negative
  energy to heal one another as needed.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, the nosferatus retreat behind
  Rasputin's antilife shell in area H6 to allow their fast healing to take over.
  If reduced to 0 hit points, a nosferatu assumes bat swarm form and flees to
  its coffin in the eastern bell tower (area H4b).
