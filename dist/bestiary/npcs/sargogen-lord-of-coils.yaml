SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-Injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2
      Str; cure 2 saves.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Although these effects are not calculated into this stat block, Sargogen
  rarely enters combat without having one of his allied spellcasters cast
  numerous preparatory spells on him.
DuringCombat: >-
  Sargogen prefers to close to melee with foes as soon as possible, relying upon
  his spell-like abilities to force foes to approach if necessary. He always
  uses Power Attack unless he misses all of his attacks in any given round
  against a foe, in which case he abandons that tactic and focuses all of his
  attacks on that target. If reduced to fewer than 200 hit points by a single
  foe in melee combat, Sargogen attempts to minimize his foe's ability to make
  full attacks by making single attacks (using Greater Vital Strike) and then
  moving away from the foe so that enemies have difficulty remaining adjacent to
  him.
Morale: >-
  Sargogen generally saves his quickened teleport as an escape route&#8211;using
  it whenever he is reduced to fewer than 80 hit points to retreat to a safe
  area (his fortress in Sverenagati if he is within range) so he can recuperate
  and plan his revenge. Only when he feels that he is within reach of a
  significant goal does he fight to the death, entrusting that if he is killed,
  one of his subservient spellcasters will restore him to life via a
  resurrection or similar spell.

  with 10 greater arrows of human slaying and 40 adamantine arrows, amulet of
  natural armor +4, belt of physical perfection +6, manual of bodily health (+4,
