BeforeCombat: >-
  Leska draws her kukris and stands where the PCs will easily notice her as they
  attempt to leave the temple, waiting for Momota to get into position for the
  ambush. If the PCs were especially brutal in their handling of the other
  defeated Aspis Consortium agents in the temple, she drinks her potion of
  bull's strength as well.
DuringCombat: >-
  Leska targets any dwarves in the party first, after which she focuses her
  attention on the PC who seems to be dealing the most damage to her and her
  allies. If faced with a particularly adept ranged combatant, she drops one  
  kukri and throws a chakram at the target before moving in to engage the PC in
  melee.
Morale: >-
  Leska is enraged at the PCs' incursion and avenges deaths of the Aspis
  Consortium agents who fell at the party's hands, fighting to the death and
  using her orc ferocity to strike a last blow against the nearest PC.
Gear: >-
  potion of bull's strength, potion of cure light wounds, wand of snare (1
  charge)
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork studded leather, kukris (2), chakrams* (2), silver Aspis Consortium
  badge, 12 gp
