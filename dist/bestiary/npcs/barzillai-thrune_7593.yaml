SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Profane Might (Ex)
    description: >-
      Barzillai gains a +4 profane bonus to his Dexterity, Constitution, and AC,
      and his summon devil ability summons a pit fiend rather than a bone devil.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      Barzillai reforms at full hit points 1 hour after he is slain unless his
      heart is returned to his torso.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Barzillai uses his judgments of profane healing and profane justice (his
  statistics reflect that these are active). He summons a pit fiend on the first
  round of combat, then prefers to use his spells, but he won't hesitate to lash
  out with melee attacks if surrounded.
Morale: Barzillai fights to the death.
