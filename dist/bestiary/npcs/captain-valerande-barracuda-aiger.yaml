    description: >-
      Barracuda gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls with a cutlass,
      rapier, or short sword. He can hold his breath for 36 rounds before
      risking drowning. He does not lose his Dex bonus to AC when climbing. If
      he damages a foe with sneak attack, he can try to trip that foe as an
      immediate action. He gains a +2 bonus on Climb checks when using ropes,
      and when he does so, climbs twice as quickly as normal.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Barracuda uses his officers to set up flanking opportunities, barking orders
  to move them around the combat as needed. He uses his swinging reposition
  ability to try to bull rush players over the side of the ship, then moves
  closer to allies so he can make full attacks as soon as possible. He uses
  Combat Expertise if faced by particularly hard-hitting foes.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, Barracuda drops his weapons and
  surrenders, hoping to appeal to the PCs' sense of pity at this point to claim
  his birthright.
Gear: >-
  +4 studded leather, +2 rapier, +1 boarding axe, amulet of natural armor +1,
  ring of protection +1
