SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Swapped (Ex)
    description: >-
      Kaklatath used its innate yithian ability to swap bodies to transfer an
      elderly Kelishite woman's mind into its body, taking control of her body
      to more easily study the world. When the yithian body fell prey to
      Xhamen-Dor's infectious dreams, the woman's mind became permanently locked
      inside. This grants the undead creature the physical properties of the
      alien host and the mental faculties, Base Attack Bonus, skills, feats,
      saving throws, and languages of a 4th-level human expert.
