DuringCombat: >-
  Kossrani refuses to fight fair. He throws a tanglefoot bag at the most heavily
  armored foe on the first round of battle, then keeps his distance and picks
  away at one opponent at a time, favoring spellcasters. He uses Power Attack at
  every opportunity&#8211;his melee attack line above reflects this tactic.
Morale: Too proud to believe he can be defeated, Kossrani fights to the death.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds (2), tanglefoot bags (2)
