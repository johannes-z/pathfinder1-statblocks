DuringCombat: >-
  Typically an orphan spends the first round of combat in shock and surprise,
  although once a few battles have broken out in the fishery, feel free to have
  the orphans react more quickly. The orphans prefer to attack with the long
  pitchforks they use to load and unload fish (these pitchforks function as
  improvised weapons with reach), but they switch to daggers if anyone is able
  to get inside their reach.
Morale: >-
  An orphan who takes any damage attempts to flee to area A8, unless all of
  Gaedren's thugs are either dead or out of sight, in which case the orphan
  abandons the fishery entirely into the surrounding slums.
