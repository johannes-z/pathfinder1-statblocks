BeforeCombat: >-
  Skell is on watch duty and has his crossbow loaded with his screaming bolt and
  readied to fire at any foe he spots encroaching on the Aspis base from cover.
DuringCombat: >-
  Skell fights from cover against unprepared enemies, but is unafraid to step
  out onto the ice to engage invaders in melee, lessening the ice's effect on
  his movement with his cleats. If he has a chance, he drinks his potion of
  bull's strength before entering melee. Skell and Hildr are competitive and do
  not aid one another in battle, but if his sister falls in the course of the
  skirmish, Skell focuses his attention on the enemy who dealt the killing blow.
Morale: >-
  As long as Hildr fights alongside him, Skell fights to the death. If she falls
  and he is reduced to 10 or fewer hit points, he flees to area A5 to gather
  reinforcements.
Gear: potion of bull's strength, screaming bolt
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork chainmail, masterwork heavy wooden shield, masterwork heavy
  crossbow with 10 bolts, masterwork longsword, cleats*, cold weather outfit,
  bronze Aspis Consortium badge, 23 gp
