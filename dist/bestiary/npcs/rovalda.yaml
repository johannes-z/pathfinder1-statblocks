Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Rovalda casts magic vestment on her armor every day. She prepares for combat
  or strangers by casting heroism on her group and fly, shield, and true seeing
  on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Rovalda begins combat by casting mirror image. She lets her minions and mount
  fight directly while she hovers overhead controlling the battlefield,
  unleashing confusion and telekinesis on warriors and spellcasters
  (respectively), often paired with her dispelling pulse to rip apart magical
  protections. She loves using wall of ectoplasm to isolate healers from their
  allies.
Morale: >-
  Rovalda is no fool, and she sues for negotiation when four or more caravan
  guards are slain, her mount is slain, or she's reduced to 40 or fewer hit
  points. If a peaceful solution is not forthcoming, she does her best to
  retreat from the battlefield. If the PCs party contains any surface dwarves,
  Rovalda does not surrender or seek a peaceful solution-she fanatically fights
  to the death.

  wand of lesser confusion (20 charges), wand of shield (38 charges)
