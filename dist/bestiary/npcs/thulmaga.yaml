BeforeCombat: >-

  or the energy type the PCs favor) on herself. She is aware of this energy type
  only if Dornarnus witnessed them use it while under the effects of dominate
  person. She also casts magic weapon on her light hammer. The effects of these
  spells are included in her statistics.
DuringCombat: >-
  Thulmaga uses her staff's remaining charges to cast greater command (DC 19)
  twice, aiming to cause as many foes as possible to "halt." She then targets
  those who succeeded at their saving throws with more debilitating magic,
  starting with her most powerful spells. She finishes off a fallen foe with
  death knell (preferably Dornanus).

  fights to the death.
