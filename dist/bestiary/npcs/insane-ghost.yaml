SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bound to Pharasma (Ex)
    description: >-
      These insane ghosts will never attack anyone wearing a holy symbol or
      other obvious raiment of Pharasma. A cleric of Pharasma may attempt to
      command each of these ghosts once as if the cleric possessed the Command
      Undead feat (but see Morale). Paranoia The ghost suffers from paranoia, as
      does any creature affected by the ghost's shriek of madness. A paranoid
      character is convinced that the world and all who dwell within it are out
      to get him. She takes a -4 penalty on Will saves (already included in the
      ghost's stat block) and Charismabased skill checks, cannot receive benefit
      from or attempt the Aid Another action, and cannot willingly accept aid
      (including healing) from another creature unless she makes a DC 17 Will
      save (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 251).
  - name: Shriek of Madness (Su)
    description: >-
      The insane ghost can emit a mindshattering shriek as a standard action.
      All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must make a DC 17 Will save
      or go insane, suffering from paranoia. This is a sonic, mind-affecting
      effect. A creature that successfully saves against the shriek cannot be
      affected by the same ghost's shriek for 24 hours.
DuringCombat: >-
  The insane ghosts open combat with their shrieks of madness, then move up to
  attack with their corrupting touches. They do not pursue foes out of this
  area.
Morale: >-
  The ghosts fight until destroyed. In order to put these ghosts to rest, the
  ghosts must either be pardoned by a cleric (an atonement, raise dead,
  resurrection, or true resurrection spell cast on one of these ghosts
  immediately causes it to vanish with no save&#8211;using these spells in this
  manner does not consume any material components) or be commanded to do one
  final task by a cleric of Pharasma using Command Undead (see Bound to Pharasma
  below). After performing this final task, or after a time of service equal to
  1 hour (whichever comes first), a ghost commanded in this manner sighs,
  finally at peace with his or her fate, and fades away into nothingness.
