SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as a jackalwere's standard change shape ability,
      except in jackal form the Midwife functions as a dog with the fiendish
      template.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If she has time, the Midwife imbibes her potion of haste and applies her oil
  of keen edge to one of her kukris (factored into her statistics).
DuringCombat: >-
  The Midwife uses her sleep gaze to put as many enemies to sleep as possible,
  then concentrates on taking out the still-conscious PCs with her kukris. She
  flies to stay out of range, and uses her oracle spells to further hinder and
  destroy enemies, launching dread bolts and unleashing spiritual weapons to
  increase her firepower while trying to lure PCs into the birthing pool. She
  uses smite good against any particularly zealous foes, and only resorts to her
  natural weapons if disarmed.
Morale: The Midwife relishes combat and fights to the death.
