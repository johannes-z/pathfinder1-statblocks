SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mark Quarry (Su)
    description: >-
      A crawling hand is designed to seek out and destroy a predetermined
      quarry. Once attuned to a target, it becomes aware of the target's
      location as if under the effect of a continuous locate creature spell. The
      quarry is treated as the hand's favored enemy, and the hand gains a +1
      bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks made to seek out
      and destroy the marked quarry. The mark quarry ability lasts until the
      quarry or the hand is slain or the hand's master changes the quarry (a
      standard action).
  - name: Spider Climb (Ex)
    description: >-
      A crawling hand can climb sheer surfaces as though under the effects of a
      spider climb spell.
  - name: Strangle (Su)
    description: >-
      Upon completion of a successful grab attack, a crawling hand locks on to
      the victim's throat and doesn't let go until it is destroyed or it has
      choked its victim to death. While grappling, a crawling hand ignores its
      size modifier to CMB (-4) for being a Diminutive creature. As long as it
      maintains the grapple, the hand's target must hold his breath (Pathfinder
      RPG Core Rulebook 445). If the grapple ends, the target can breathe again.
DuringCombat: >-
  The crawling hands each pick a target and mark those victims as their quarry,
  trying to get a stranglehold. The hands pursue their quarry throughout the
  dungeon.
Morale: The crawling hands fight until destroyed.
