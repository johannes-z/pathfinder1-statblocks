SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Electric Fortitude (Ex)
    description: >-
      Borutas take no damage from electricity. Instead, any electricity attack
      used against a boruta temporarily increases its Constitution score by 1d4
      points. The boruta loses these temporary points at the rate of 1 per hour.
  - name: Grounding Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      Any living creature that takes damage from a boruta's claws must succeed
      at a DC 22 Fortitude save or have hundreds of tiny seed pods injected into
      its body. These seeds grow rapidly; they explode through the victim's skin
      on its next turn, dealing 1d6 points of damage and entangling it as
      runners and vines grow from its flesh and root themselves in the ground.
      The victim cannot move unless it succeeds at a DC 10 Strength check to
      tear the plants from the ground, but doing so also deals 1d4 points of
      damage to the victim. This effect lasts for 10 minutes. Remove curse,
      blight, diminish plants, and similar spells instantly end this effect. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Treespeech (Ex)
    description: >-
      A boruta has the ability to converse with plants as if subject to a
      continual speak with plants spell, and most plants greet them with an
      attitude of friendly or helpful.
  - name: Wild Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A boruta can use wild shape four times per day as a 11th-level druid. In
      any form a boruta takes, its appearance remains plantlike, with wooden
      features and leaves rather than fur or feathers.
