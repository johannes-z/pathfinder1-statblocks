SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Profane Gift (Su)
    description: >-
      Xaivanshee has a +2 profane bonus to her Constitution-a profane gift from
      the succubus Liluresha, who serves the demon lord Zura. Zura's
  - name: Favor (Su)
    description: >-
      Xaivanshee currently enjoys the favor of her patron demon lord, Zura. As a
      result, her cloak of chaos spell lasts for 24 hours when cast, and she
      gains fast healing 10. If she ever loses Zura's favor or fails to perform
      her Demonic Obedience, she loses these benefits forever, takes 2d6 points
      of Wisdom drain, and gains 2d4 permanent negative levels.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Xaivanshee uses her extend metamagic rod to cast an extended heroes' feast for
  herself and her allies every day. She also casts magic vestment on her armor
  and greater magic weapon on both rapiers, then casts cloak of chaos on herself
  (this lasts for 24 hours due to her favor with her deity). If she knows she's
  about to enter combat, she casts air walk and freedom of movement.
DuringCombat: >-
  Xaivanshee hangs back in combat, letting her allies occupy foes in melee as
  long as possible. Her first act in the battle is to cast rift of ruin to open
  a chasm under the feet of any enemies standing on the ground. On the second
  round, she causes the rift to close by summoning a bebilith through it to
  fight alongside her. (If you don't have access to rift of ruin, replace this
  spell with summon monster VIII.) Xaivanshee uses her ranged attack spells in
  following rounds. If she sees her allies have become wounded, she moves in to
  aid them with healing spells. She's well aware that the longer they live, the
  longer they can protect her. She enters melee combat if she has to, but tries
  to cast divine favor beforehand. She saves heal to cast on herself once she's
  reduced to 50 hit points or fewer.
Morale: >-
  Xaivanshee goes to any lengths to remain alive if faced with certain defeat,
  taking hostages to bargain for escape, fleeing in outright cowardice, offering
  bribes, or begging for mercy (in that order of preference).
Gear: extend metamagic rod
OtherGear: >-
  +1 elven chain shirt, +1 horacalcum rapier, +1 keen mithral rapier, belt of
  physical might +4 (Dex, Con), gloves of arrow snaring, instant fortress, slave
  collar keys (3, each attuned to her hunt mistress's slave collars), spell
  component pouch, unholy symbol of Zura, fine spidersilk robes worth 2,500 gp
