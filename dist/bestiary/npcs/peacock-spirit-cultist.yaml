SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Viridian Escape (Sp)
    description: >-
      Each cultist has been subjected to an ancient ritual called the viridian
      transcendence, granting her the ability to use word of recall as a swift
      action once. When a cultist activates this ability, she vanishes in a puff
      of bright blue-green smoke, reappearing in the Temple of the Peacock
      Spirit far to the north (this cultist has no further role to play in this
      adventure, but optionally, the PCs might recognize some of the cultists
      they encounter in the next adventure).
DuringCombat: >-
  A cultist's primary goal is to attack Sorshen and deliver the message that the
  Peacock Spirit knows she is awake. The cultists switch targets to the PCs only
  if a PC  manages to significantly harm a cultist or prevents them from
  reaching Sorshen.
Morale: >-
  A cultist reduced to fewer than 10 hit points (or at the first opportunity if
  captured), uses the viridian escape to flee.
Gear: >-
  belt of giant strength +2, bejeweled holy symbol of the Peacock Spirit worth
  250 gp
