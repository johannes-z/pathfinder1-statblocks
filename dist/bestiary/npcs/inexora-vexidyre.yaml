BeforeCombat: >-
  Inexora casts deathwatch, levitate, bear's endurance, shield of faith, and
  divine favor in that order once her babau reports that enemies are nearby. She
  then orders her demons to hide themselves in an effort to ambush the PCs. If
  she is surprised, she only has deathwatch and levitate active.
DuringCombat: >-
  Inexora first attempts to extinguish or suppress the PCs' light sources with
  her spell-like abilities as she levitates to the ceiling. She considers her
  familiar expendable and orders it to deliver harmful touch spells and harry
  enemy spellcasters. She drops back to the floor next to disabled, hindered, or
  threatened PCs to attack with her dagger or channel demonic energy, which
  grants her chaotic evil allies the benefits of the rage spell. When she sees a
  creature wounded, including herself, Inexora describes the injury out loud in
  medical terms as if she were conducting an autopsy, using her Bluff skill to
  downplay her own injuries and convince the PCs that theirs are more severe.
Morale: >-
  Inexora's shame at her defeat at the battle of Celwynvian has gnawed at her
  for years, and she refuses to consider retreat.
Gear: scroll of wind wall, wand of resist energy (CL 3rd, 10 charges)
OtherGear: >-
