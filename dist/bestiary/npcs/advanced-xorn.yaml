SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Around Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A xorn sees in all directions at the same time, giving it a +4 racial
      bonus on Perception checks. A xorn cannot be flanked.
  - name: Earth Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A xorn can glide through any sort of natural earth or stone as easily as a
      fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves no sign of its passage or
      hint of its presence to creatures that don't possess tremorsense. A move
      earth spell cast on an area containing a xorn moves the xorn back 30 feet,
      stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds at a DC 15 Fortitude
      save.
