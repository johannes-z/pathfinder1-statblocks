    description: >-
      When a savage lizard charges, it hisses ferociously, extends its neck
      frills, and darts forward on its hind legs, increasing its base speed to
      50 feet for that round. In addition to the normal effects of a charge, the
      creature charged must make a DC 15 Will save or be shaken for 1d6 rounds.
      This is a fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
