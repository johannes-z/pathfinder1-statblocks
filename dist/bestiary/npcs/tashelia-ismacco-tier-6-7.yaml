BeforeCombat: >-
  Tashelia watches intently as her thugs rough up Queck, the Hall of Wonders'
  head engineer. She suffers a &#8211;4 penalty on Perception checks because of
  the loud noise.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tashelia casts spells before entering melee, preferring to stay on the catwalk
  and target melee PCs with searing light, sound burst, and bane. She begins
  combat by summoning a medium earth elemental and prefers to avoid melee
  combat. If forced into melee, she casts true strike and shield of faith on
  herself (if possible).
Morale: Tashelia fights to the death.
