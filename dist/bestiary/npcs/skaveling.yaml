      effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC
      is Charisma-based. A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at

  - name: Screech (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a skaveling can produce an
      ear-splitting screech that stuns nonskavelings in a 20-foot-radius burst.
      All creatures within the area must make a DC 16 Fortitude save or be
      stunned for 1d3 rounds. Other skavelings and urdefhans are immune to this
      effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
