SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Air Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against an
      air elemental.
  - name: Arcane Reservoir (Su)
    description: >-
      Chalissier can use the arcane reservoir arcanist ability (Pathfinder RPG
      Advanced Class Guide 9) to augment his spell-like abilities. He counts as
      a 7th-level arcanist for the purposes of determining his number of uses
      per day.
  - name: Arcanist Exploits (Su)
    description: >-
      Chalissier can use the energy shield and lightning lance arcanist exploit
      (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 11) as if he were a 7th-level
      arcanist. Spells Chalissier casts spells as a 7th-level arcanist, except
      that he has a reduced number of spells prepared.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Chalissier capitalizes on his knowledge of the PCs if he's encountered them
  before. He uses his energy shield arcanist exploit to protect against an
  element he knows the PCs employ. Prior to the onset of combat, he casts
  invisibility.
DuringCombat: >-
  In combat, Chalissier remains mobile. He flies around the battlefield,
  unleashing his offensive spells, as well as using his lightning lance arcanist
  exploit. He makes use of Flyby Attack when all of his ranged attack options
  are expended. Against less armored foes, he makes full attacks with both his
  slams.
Morale: Failure is as good as death, so Chalissier fights until he is destroyed.
