SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Tumors (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a gibrileth can rip a grapefruitsized tumor from its
      body with one of its many arms and throw it as a splash weapon with a
      range increment of 20 feet. A direct hit deals 2d6 points of acid damage,
      and deals 1d4 points of acid splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet
      of the target. A creature can avoid the splash damage with a successful DC
      22 Reflex saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Whip Specialist (Ex)
    description: A gibrileth doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity when using a whip.
DuringCombat: >-
  The gibrileth uses stinking cloud to disorient the PCs and flies up to stay
  out of reach while picking off individual targets as they flee from the cloud.
  He uses unholy blight to strike foes who bunch together.
Morale: >-
  A coward at heart, the gibrileth begs for mercy when reduced to fewer than 20
  hit points, but it fights to the death if the PCs don't accept the surrender.
