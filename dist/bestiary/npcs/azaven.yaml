SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Contingency (Sp)
    description: >-
      If Azaven is grappled, a dimension door spell activates on him. Azaven
      uses this to merely reposition himself in combat if the battle is going
      well-if it is going poorly, he uses it to flee to area F11.
  - name: Telepathic Bond (Sp)
    description: >-
      Azaven has a permanent telepathic bond with his minion Xyoddin and with
      one of the Thassilonian mummies in areas F1 and F8.
Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: abjuration, enchantment
BeforeCombat: >-
  Once he knows interlopers have invaded the crypts, Azaven casts extended false
  life and tongues on himself. He then calls a devourer&#8211;a proud being
  named Vioidzhain, scarred with symbols only it knows the otherworldly source
  of&#8211;to guard him using his staff of hungry shadows. As soon as he can
  before combat, he casts quickened cat's grace.
DuringCombat: >-
  Azaven opens battles by casting finger of death at a spellcaster and quickened
  displacement on himself. He then casts wall of force to seal himself off from
  the PCs, giving him time to cast fly, mirror image, and spectral hand. During
  this time, he lets the conjured devourer keep the PCs busy. If the PCs haven't
  breached his wall by the time he's done casting preparatory spells, he uses
  dimension door to return back into their midst and begins casting offensive
  spells. If he needs more minions, Azaven casts stone shape on a nearby wall to
  release several wraiths, hoping they provide additional distractions.
Morale: >-
  Azaven values his own immortal existence too much to stick around in a fight
  he's losing. If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, he uses mislead to escape
  by casting gaseous form and retreating to area F11, where he gathers his
  phylactery before triggering the trap in the room to heal his damage. Given
  time, he recovers his spells and then seeks revenge on the PCs. If confronted
  there, Azaven has little choice but to fight until destroyed, but he makes
  sure to trigger the trap in the room before a fight begins.
Gear: staff of hungry shadows (10 charges)
