  - name: Death Roll (Ex)
    description: >-
      When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a giant crocodile can perform
      a death roll upon making a successful grapple check. As it clings to its
      foe, it tucks in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its
      victim. The giant crocodile inflicts its bite damage and knocks the
      creature prone. If successful, the giant crocodile maintains its grapple.
  - name: Hold Breath (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant crocodile can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4
      times its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
  - name: Sprint (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per minute a giant crocodile may sprint, increasing its land speed to
      40 feet for 1 round.
