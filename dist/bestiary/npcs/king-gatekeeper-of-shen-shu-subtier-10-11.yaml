SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Head Bowl (Su)
    description: >-
      The basin atop a kappa's head contains water from its home river or lake.
      The water is emptied only if the kappa willingly tips its head or a
      creature pinning the kappa forces it to do so (requiring a grapple check
      while pinned). If the water is emptied, the kappa becomes immobile and
      staggered. It can still take its own actions, but it can't move from the
      spot on its own. If the emptied head bowl is refilled with water, the
      kappa recovers from this condition immediately. This replacement water
      doesn't have to be from the kappa's home, but the kappa refills its head
      bowl from there at his first opportunity.
