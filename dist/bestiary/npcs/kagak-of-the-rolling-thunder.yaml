  Although he has been beating his drums for quite a while, Kagak waits to begin
  his raging song, which gives his allies the benefits of inspired rage, until
  enemies enter the tower below. While the orcs under his command engage foes,
  Kagak casts spells such as ear-piercing scream, hideous laughter, and sleep.
  He uses his scrolls as needed, summoning monsters, instilling fear in his
  enemies, or charming opponents.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, Kagak imbibes his potion of cure
  moderate wounds or uses his wand of cure light wounds to stay in the battle.
