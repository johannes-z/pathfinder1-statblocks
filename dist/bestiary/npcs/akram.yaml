SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Truthspeaker (Su)
    description: >-
      Akram has undertaken a lifelong quest of fasting, meditation, exploration,
      and prayer to achieve the status of truthspeaker. This has granted him
      immunity to all charm and compulsion effects. Furthermore, he is
      constantly under the effects of discern lies (CL 7th).
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: Akram casts magic vestment on his robes every day after breakfast.
DuringCombat: >-
  Akram prefers to save his spells for healing or support. He generally casts
  prayer on the first round of battle, followed by spiritual weapon and then
  sanctuary, so he can move about the fringe of combat to heal allies in
  relative safety.
Morale: >-
  Akram has little interest in combat, and if confronted while alone or if
  reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, he casts dimension door to escape
  immediate danger and then fly to flee to a place of safety.
Gear: >-
  wand of cure moderate wounds (32 charges), wand of lesser restoration (20
  charges)
OtherGear: padded armor, +1 returning starknife, cloak of resistance +1
