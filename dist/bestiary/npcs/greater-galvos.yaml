SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Eel Dart (Ex)
    description: >-
      A galvo can launch one of its component eels like a dart up to 30 feet as
      a ranged touch attack. An eel dart deals a number of points of damage
      equal to 1d6 + the galvo's Strength modifier plus 1d6 points of
      electricity damage.
  - name: Swarmlike (Ex)
    description: >-
      A galvo has no discernible anatomy and is not subject to critical hits or
      flanking. It is also immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a
      specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as
      disintegrate). Mind-affecting effects that target a single creature
      function normally against a galvo, since the creature's individual
      components share a hive mind. A galvo takes half again as much damage
      (+50%) from damaging area effects such as fireball and splash weapons.
  - name: Varied Attack (Ex)
    description: >-
      A galvo's slam attack deals both bludgeoning and slashing damage since the
      creature is formed completely of biting eels.
DuringCombat: >-
  The galvos attack lightly armored PCs first, switching to a new target if a PC
  proves resistant to electricity.
Morale: Filled with consuming hatred, the galvos fight to the death.
