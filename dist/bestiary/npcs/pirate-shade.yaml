SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Shades (Sp)
    description: >-
      The pirate shades are only quasi-real, and have only 80% their normal hit
      points (already included in their stat block). If an opponent makes a
      successful DC 23 Will save while interacting with a shade, the pirate
      shades' damage is 80% normal, special abilities that do not deal lethal
      damage are only 80% likely to work, and their AC bonuses are 80% normal.
      Likewise, the shades' equipment is not real, and disappears when the
      shades vanish at sunrise or when slain.
DuringCombat: >-
  The shades hurl throwing axes as they close for battle, quickly surrounding
  and flanking enemies to make sneak attacks and cut off their opponents'
  retreat.
Morale: The shades fight until destroyed.
Gear: studded leather, +1 short sword, masterwork throwing axes (2)
