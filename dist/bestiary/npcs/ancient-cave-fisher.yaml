SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Filament (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cave fisher can fire a thin filament of sticky silk as a standard
      action. This touch attack has a range of 60 feet and no range increment. A
      creature struck by a cave fisher's filament becomes attached to the sticky
      thread. As a standard action, a creature can rip the filament free with a
      successful DC 20 Strength check. A caught creature can also attempt to
      escape a filament by succeeding at a DC 25 Escape Artist check. A filament
      has AC 18 (touch 10), 20 hit points, and DR 15/slashing. An application of
      liquid with high alcohol content (or a dose of universal solvent)
      dissolves the adhesive and releases the creature caught by the filament. A
      cave fisher can have only one filament active at a time.
  - name: Pull (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cave fisher has a +4 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks made using
      its pull special attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  The creature uses its filament to attack the smallest or least-armored target
  and pull this victim up to its ledge 50 feet above the lower ledge and feast
  on its meal. It then targets enemies that significantly damage it with a
  filament attack designed to pull the opponent up over the chasm and then drop
  it.
Morale: If reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, the cave fisher flees.
