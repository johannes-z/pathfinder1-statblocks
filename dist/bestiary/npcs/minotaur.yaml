DuringCombat: >-
  The minotaur attempts to finish off Janira with a single strike. Once Janira
  is down, the minotaur turns its attention to the PCs if they have joined the
  fight. Otherwise, it inspects the fallen halfling and finishes her off.
  Outnumbered against the PCs, the minotaur tries to make its attacks count by
  forgoing the use of its Power Attack feat, and it spreads out its attacks
  against multiple targets if possible to fend off the many attackers.
Morale: >-
  Though not overly intelligent, the minotaur can clearly recognize when it's
  outnumbered and in a losing battle. It attempts to flee if reduced to 10 or
  fewer hit points.
