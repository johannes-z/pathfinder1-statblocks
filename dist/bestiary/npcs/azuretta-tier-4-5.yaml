  Azuretta prefers not to fight alone, knowing that her true strength is
  augmenting her allies' attacks. If alone, she uses spells such as animate
  rope, hold person, and suggestion to waylay PCs and attempts to flee. If
  fighting with an ally, she inspires courage, casting the same spells as needed
  to keep enemies away from her ally.
