SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ghostly Trappings (Su)
    description: >-
      As a ghost, Jazradan clings to the extravagant regalia of Azlanti
      rulership that he wore in life. Jazradan is always considered to be
      equipped with a headband of mental prowess +4 (Int, Cha), robes of the
      archmagi (black), a helm of governance, and a spellbook and spell
      component pouch, despite his current existence as a ghost. Inherent
      Bonuses While alive, Jazradan used wish spells to increase his ability
      scores. He has a +4 inherent bonus to his Charisma and Intelligence scores
      and a +3 inherent bonus to his Dexterity and Wisdom scores. This increases
      his Challenge Rating by 1.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      Jazradan's spirit refuses to accept the fall of Azlant. In order to put
      Jazradan to rest, the veiled master Ochymua must be slain, after which the
      shattered continent must be scoured of all projection pads still
      delivering Jazradan's final message to the people of dead Azlant. Only
      then can Jazradan's soul be put to rest, finally accepting the fate of
      lost Azlant.
Gender: Male
Bloodline: destined
BeforeCombat: >-
  Jazradan casts mirror image and shield if given advance warning of combat. If
  caught unprepared, he uses the time stop effect of his helm to prepare.
DuringCombat: >-
  In combat, Jazradan focuses on long-lasting debilitation. He attempts to use
  greater possession against weak-willed targets. He summons a mage's sword to
  deal damage while casting disintegration against nonspellcasters and greater
  possession against weak-willed targets. Jazradan takes special joy in
  outpacing enemy spellcasters, using his redirect spell arcanist exploit to
  show his mastery.
Morale: >-
  Jazradan has no fear of death and fights until defeated, using his
  rejuvenation ability to return.
