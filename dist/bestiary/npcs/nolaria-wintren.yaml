BeforeCombat: >-
  Nolaria casts detect evil if she cannot immediately identify the nature of her
  foe.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nolaria uses her scroll of protection from evil if she knows that her foe is
  evil. She knows that she lacks the physical prowess and skill to stand up to
  opponents in battle, so she keeps her foes at bay with her longbow as long as
  possible. If she has allies in the fight, she casts bless as soon as she can.
Morale: >-
  Nolaria flees to try and find help if she is injured. Once she is safe, she
  casts cure light wounds when she is out of harm's way, or if she is reduced to
  5 or fewer hit points.
