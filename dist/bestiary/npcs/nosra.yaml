SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A vampire can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the vampire
      establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of
      Constitution damage. The vampire heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary
      hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points
      equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood.
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A vampire can use change shape to assume the form of a dire bat or wolf,
      as beast shape II.
  - name: Children of the Night (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a vampire can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms,
      or 2d6 wolves as a standard action. (If the base creature is not
      terrestrial, this power might summon other creatures of similar power.)
      These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1
      hour.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      A vampire can create spawn out of those it slays with blood drain or
      energy drain, provided that the slain creature is of the same creature
      type as the vampire's base creature type. The victim rises from death as a
      vampire spawn in 1d4 days. This vampire is under the command of the
      vampire that created it, and remains enslaved until its master's
      destruction. A vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice
      its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become
      free-willed undead. A vampire may free an enslaved spawn in order to
      enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be
      enslaved again.
  - name: Dominate (Su)
    description: >-
      A vampire can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action.
      Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly
      under the vampire's influence, as though by a dominate person spell (CL
      12th). The ability has a range of 30 ft.
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by a vampire's slam (or other natural weapon) gains two
      negative levels. This ability only triggers once per round, regardless of
      the number of attacks a vampire makes.Gaseous
  - name: Form (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous form at will (caster
      level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of
      20 feet with perfect maneuverability.
  - name: Shadowless (Ex)
    description: A vampire casts no shadows and shows no reflection in a mirror.
  - name: Spider Climb (Ex)

      A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though under the effects of a spider
      climb spell.
