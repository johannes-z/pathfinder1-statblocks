BeforeCombat: >-
  Anera positions herself to attack any elves first, though if threatened alone,
  she tries to put distance between herself and her aggressors.
DuringCombat: >-
  Anera focuses her attacks on any elves present, even to her own tactical
  detriment. Anera prefers fighting with both her short sword and dagger in
  melee over ranged combat, as she likes to see the fear in her opponents' eyes.
  If she fights with an ally, she tries to provide flanks whenever possible,
  unless she has an elven target that takes her attention.
Morale: >-
  If Anera is the murderer, she fights to the death. If she fights alone, she
  surrenders if reduced to less than 8 hp, unless one of her foes is an elf or
  half-elf, in which case she fights relentlessly to the death.
Gear: oil of magic weapon, sleep arrow
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork chain shirt, masterwork short sword, dagger, shortbow with 20
  arrows, 10 gp
