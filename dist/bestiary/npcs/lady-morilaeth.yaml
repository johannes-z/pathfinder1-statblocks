SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Feign Death (Ex)
    description: >-
      With a successful Bluff check, a nightmare creature can make itself appear
      dead. Any creature wishing to ascertain whether the nightmare creature is
      really dead must make a Heal check opposed by the nightmare creature's
      Bluff check. The nightmare creature cannot move or take any actions
      pretending to be dead. In addition, whenever a nightmare creature falls
      unconscious, it appears dead. A DC 15 Heal check is required to ascertain
      if the nightmare creature is alive. Nightmare creatures use this ability
      to escape destruction, to gain revenge, or to trick foes into approaching
      them. The Heal check DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Night Terrors (Su)
    description: See sidebar on page 4.
  - name: Nightmare Spellcasting (Su)
    description: >-
      A nightmare creature's effective caster level for fear, phantasm, and
      shadow spells increases by +2 over that of the base creature.
  - name: Protection from Good (Su)
    description: >-
      A nightmare creature gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance
      bonus on saves against attacks by good creatures. Furthermore, it is
      immune to any attempt by a good creature to posses, charm, or influence
      it.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Lady Morilaeth detects the PCs she casts disguise self to change her
  appearance to that of a derro, albeit the tallest derro in the room.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once disguised, Morilaeth joins the revelers, hoping to get close to the PCs
  and surprise them with channeled negative energy. Morilaeth is aware of the
  effect her fear aura will have on the mites and derros-namely, when she uses
  it, most of them will run from the room-and she doesn't hesitate to use it.
  Nor does she hesitate to use her channel negative energy ability to injure
  both the PCs and the revelers. While fighting, Morilaeth repeatedly screams,
  "You will dream of me!"
Morale: >-
  If reduced to less than 5 hit points, Lady Morilaeth retreats to area 13 to
  regenerate. If she's unable to make it, she uses feign death and regenerates.
