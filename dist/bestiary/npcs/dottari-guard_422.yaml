DuringCombat: >-
  Dottari guards fight together, flanking foes and, unless lethal force is used
  against them, striking to subdue foes with nonlethal damage.
Morale: >-
  These guards are brave, but if reduced to less than 3 hit points, they panic
  and attempt to flee. Once a third guard flees, all remaining guards flee as
  well.
