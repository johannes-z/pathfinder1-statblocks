SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Faith Bound (Su)
    description: >-
      A graven guardian cannot attack any creature that openly wears or displays
      the holy or unholy symbol of the deity to which the graven guardian is
      dedicated unless that creature first attacks the graven guardian.
  - name: Familiarity (Su)
    description: >-
      The graven guardian gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls again any creature it
      attacked in the past round.
  - name: Magic Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A graven guardian that carries its deity's favored weapon treats that
      weapon as a +1 weapon as long as it is wielded by the guardian. If the
      weapon is a melee weapon, it gains the keen weapon special ability (even
      if the weapon is a bludgeoning weapon). If it is a thrown weapon, it gains
      the returning weapon special ability. If it is a ranged weapon, it gains
      the seeking weapon special ability, and generates new ammunition with each
      attack (this ammunition is destroyed whether or not it hits).
