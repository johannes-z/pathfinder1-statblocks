    description: >-
      Captain Kinkarian's ghost often appears to walk on water. He can leave the
      ocean's surface if he wishes, but each round he remains out of contact
      with the sea and takes more than a single move action, he takes 1d6 points
      of damage as his ghostly form drips and drains away, as if his very
      essence were being pulled back to the sea.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Captain Kinkarian attacks only in response to being attacked himself. In such
  a case, he sees his tormenters as his crew, and curses and froths at them for
  turning against him, issuing accusations of "Mutineer!" and "Traitor!" as he
  claws with his hook-handed corrupting touch. Faced with a woman who bears a
  passing resemblance to his lost love Aeshamara (any red-haired female human,
  elf, or half-elf ), the ghost becomes fascinated and tearfully reaches toward
  that PC, whispering, "Aeshamara... is that you? Have you come for me?" The
  ghost remains fascinated for 1 round, after which he can he make a DC 20 Will
  save as a full-round action to recover from the fascination. Presenting the
  golden locket to him can also fascinate him in this manner. If anything
  attacks him, the fascination immediately ends. When he recovers from the
  fascination, he focuses his wrath on the woman he mistook for his love,
  shrieking, "No... No! You are not her! Damnable harpy!" If his enemies flee,
  Captain Kinkarian pursues until he loses sight of the sea, at which point he
  shrieks and returns to the surf to brood.
Morale: >-
  Captain Kinkarian fights until he's destroyed, but even then he merely
  rejuvenates back on the Brine Demon in 2d4 days. If the PCs have taken his
  locket for their own, he seeks them out again, following the lure of the
  locket unerringly&#8211;even across the ocean. In order to put Captain
  Kinkarian to rest, someone must forcefully present the open locket containing
  Aeshamara's image to the ghost so that he can see the image of the woman
  inside. This action causes the ghost to break off his attacks and reach for
  the locket&#8211;as soon as he touches it, his incorporeal form fades with a
  melancholy sigh as he finally meets his true death.
