BeforeCombat: Quiet and loyal, Gyuri waits to be told to attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  Gyuri follows Hjort, attacking whomever the big Ulfen does. He prefers to use
  flurry when he can, but throws shuriken if no closer targets present
  themselves. He saves stunning fist for any spellcasters he may get close to.
  If it starts to look as though the tide is turning against him and his
  companions, Gyuri draws and drinks his potion of owl's wisdom to boost his AC.
Morale: Gyuri fights to the death.
Gear: potion of owl's wisdom
