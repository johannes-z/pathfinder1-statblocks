  Jilia Bainilus is under the control of Aluceda Zhol, the high priest of
  Zon-Kuthon in Kintargo. As the former lord-mayor's vampiric mistress, Aluceda
  has forbidden Jilia from certain actions. While she must follow Barzillai
  Thrune's orders, not even he can countermand Aluceda's directive never to
  create spawn of her own&#8211; Aluceda wants to deny Jilia any measure of
  power over anything below her. This extends to her dominate ability as well.
  Anyone Jilia successfully dominates can be used to attack others who
  immediately threaten her, but if there are no other threats, she's been
  ordered to send those she's dominated to the Shadowsquare to offer themselves
  to Aluceda and be placed under her control. Statistics for Aluceda are not
  presented until the next adventure: any PC who manages to follow these
  commands may well need to be removed from play until he or she can be rescued
  by surviving allies. Otherwise, Jilia's first action in combat is to call on
  several swarms of rats to join the battle. After that, she simply attacks with
  her slam attacks; once battle is joined, she doesn't bother making dominate
  attempts.
Morale: If reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, Jilia retreats to her coffin in area H2.
