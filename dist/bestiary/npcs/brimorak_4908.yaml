SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Boiling Blood (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature that damages a brimorak with a slashing or piercing melee
      weapon is sprayed by boiling blood, and takes 1d4 points of fire damage
      with each successful hit with such a weapon. Creatures using reach weapons
      are not subject to this damage.
  - name: Burning Hooves (Su)
    description: >-
      A brimorak's hooves burn with fire, leaving scorched hoofprints on wood,
      stone, and most every other solid surface, yet this supernatural fire does
      not set alight surfaces the demon treads upon. Survival checks made to
      track a brimorak gain a +8 circumstance bonus. Against a prone foe, a
      brimorak can make two hoof attacks rather than just one.
  - name: Flaming Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a brimorak can infuse a wielded melee weapon with fire
      so that it deals +1d6 points of fire damage. The weapon loses this ability
      if it leaves the demon's grasp.
  - name: Smoke Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      A brimorak's smoking breath fills a radius of 5 feet-while the smoke isn't
      thick enough to obscure vision or choke foes, it is enough to sicken
      breathing foes who are not immune to poison for as long as they remain in
      the area. A creature that succeeds at a successful 17 Fortitude save gains
      immunity to a particular brimorak's breath for 24 hours. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The brimoraks attempt to summon more brimoraks on the first round, then throw
  fireballs at the PCs on the second. They then all teleport in to attack in
  melee, using dispel magic now and then to combat enemy defenses.
Morale: The brimoraks fight to the death.
