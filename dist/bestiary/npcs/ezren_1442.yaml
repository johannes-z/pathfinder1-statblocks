  Born to a successful spice merchant in one of Absalom's more affluent
  districts, Ezren's childhood was pleasantly safe. This changed when his father
  was charged with heresy. Ezren spent much of his adult life attempting to
  prove his father's innocence, only to discover his father was guilty. The
  revelation shook to the core Ezren's faith in family and church and he
  abandoned both, setting out into the world to find a new life. Ezren fell
  naturally into the ways of wizardry, and swiftly became a gifted spellcaster.
