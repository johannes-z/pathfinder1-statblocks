SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Otherworldly Mind (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature attempting to contact a cerebric fungus's mind or read its
      thoughts with a divination spell or similar ability must make a DC 19 Will
      save or be overwhelmed by the alien thoughts in the creature's head. Those
      who fail take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and are confused for 1d6
      rounds, and their spell immediately ends. The save is Charisma-based and
      includes a +2 racial bonus. Star-Shriek (Ex) When distressed, a cerebric
      fungus can unleash a shrill scream of madness and despair that echoes the
      cold, dark void between the stars. All creatures (except other cerebric
      fungi) within 30 feet must make a DC 15 Will save or be nauseated for 1d4
      rounds. This ability can be used once per day as a full-round action. This
      is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Touch of Madness (Sp)
    description: >-
      A cerebric fungus may daze one living creature by making a successful
      touch attack. If the target creature does not make a successful DC 17 Will
      save, its mind is clouded and it takes no action for 1 round per caster
      level. The dazed subject is not stunned (so attackers get no special
      advantage against it). This is a mind-affecting enchantment, equivalent to
      a 2nd-level spell.
  - name: Unsettling Appearance (Su)
    description: >-
      A cerebric fungus constantly scans the minds of those nearby, projecting
      around itself a confusing collage of images gleaned from their thoughts.
      Creatures within 60 feet that can see the fungus must succeed on a DC 17
      Will save or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls while looking at the
      fungus. This is a mind-affecting phantasm. The save is Charisma-based.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ogg'gggol activates its cloak of darkness and casts bull's strength, entropic
  shield, and shield of faith before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  If attacked, Ogg'gggol looses its star-shriek before casting spiritual ally
  and black tentacles. It continues attacking with its spells and oracle
  revelations as long as it can. If forced into melee combat, Ogg'gggol casts
  divine favor and attacks with its tendrils, pulling opponents closer to bite
  or hit with touch attacks.
Morale: >-
  Ogg'gggol has never experienced death, so it fights until killed to savor the
  new experience.
