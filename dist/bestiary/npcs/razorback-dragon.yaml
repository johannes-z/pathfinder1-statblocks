SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, the razorback dragon can belch
      a 30-foot cone of sticky, caustic slop. All creatures in the area of
      effect take 3d6 points of acid damage and reduce all movement speeds by
      1d6x5 feet; creatures whose speed is reduced to 0 is glued in place,
      unable to move from its current location. A successful DC 19 Reflex save
      negates this speed penalty and reduces the acid damage by half. Speed
      penalties from the razorback dragon's breath weapon are cumulative. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Stench (Ex)
    description: The razorback dragon's stench has no effect on goblinoids.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once he decides to attack, Squealy Nord descends in a fuming cloud of mist,
  roaring and posturing for a full round before unleashing his stinking cloud
  ability and breath weapon. If enemies remain, he lashes out with natural
  weapons.
Morale: Nord flees if reduced below 30 hit points.
