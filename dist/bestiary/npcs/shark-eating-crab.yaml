  - name: Darting Claw (Ex)
    description: >-
      Evolved for snatching fast prey, a shark-eating crab is exceptionally
      quick with its claws. When making a full attack, if a shark-eating crab
      misses with both of its claw attacks, it gains an additional claw attack
      at a -2 penalty against any creature within its reach.
  - name: Water Dependency (Ex)
    description: >-
      Shark-eating crabs can survive out of the water for 1 hour per point of
      Constitution. Beyond this limit, a shark-eating crab runs the risk of
      suffocation, as if it were drowning.
