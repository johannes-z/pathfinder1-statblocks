DuringCombat: >-
  The Fishcamp Guards' favorite trick is to trip opponents with their ogre
  hooks, then attack enemies while they're down.
Morale: >-
  If a Fishcamp Guard is reduced to 5 hit points or fewer, or if half of the
  thugs have been defeated, the remaining guards throw down their hooks and
  surrender.
