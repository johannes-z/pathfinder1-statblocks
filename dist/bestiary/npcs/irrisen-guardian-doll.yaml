SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alignment Variation (Ex)
    description: >-
      Soulbound dolls have an alignment-dependent spell-like ability usable once
      per day; those with a neutral evil alignment can cast inflict serious
      wounds (DC 12). Susceptible to Mind-Affecting
  - name: Effects (Ex)
    description: >-
      The weakened conviction of a soulbound doll's soul makes it susceptible to
      mind-affecting effects, despite the fact that the doll is a construct.
  - name: Soul Focus (Su)
    description: >-
      The soul bound to the doll lives within a focus integrated into the
      doll-in this case, a gem embedded into its chest. As long as this soul
      focus remains intact, it can be used to animate another doll, using the
      same cost as creating a new construct. Once bound into the soul focus, the
      soul continues to learn, and so if later it is put into a new doll body,
      the soul retains its personality and memories from its previous body or
      bodies. A soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break DC of 20.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Irrisen Guardian Doll initiates combat by casting inflict serious wounds
  on the PC it sees as the largest threat, generally whichever PC attacks it or
  investigates it first. It then uses its levitate spell-like ability to move
  out of melee range, hoping its connection to the jadwiga will bring
  reinforcements.
Morale: >-
  The Irrisen Guardian Doll is tasked with a single duty&#8211;to watch and
  protect the nation's borders&#8211;and it fights until destroyed to uphold
  that order.
