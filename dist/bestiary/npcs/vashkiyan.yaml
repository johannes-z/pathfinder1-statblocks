SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cowering Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature shaken by the ravener's frightful presence is also cowering
      instead of shaken for the first round of the effect, and shaken for the
      rest of the duration. Any creature frightened by the frightful presence is
      instead cowering for the duration.
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      On a successful critical hit, a ravener's natural attacks inflict 1
      negative level. It's a DC 29 Fortitude save to recover from this negative
      level.
  - name: Soul Consumption (Su)
    description: >-
      When a living creature within 30 feet of a ravener dies, that creature's
      soul is torn from its body and pulled into the ravener's maw if the
      creature fails a Will save (DC equals the save DC of the ravener's breath
      weapon). This adds a number of hit points to the ravener's soul ward equal
      to the dead creature's Hit Dice. Creatures that have their souls consumed
      in this way can only be brought back to life through miracle, true
      resurrection, or wish.
  - name: Soul Magic (Sp)
    description: >-
      A ravener retains the spellcasting capability of the base creature, adding
      three levels to the dragon's caster level. This increases the number of
      spells known by the ravener, but the ravener loses all spell slots.
      Instead, whenever the ravener wishes to cast any one of her spells known,
      she consumes a number of hit points from her soul ward equal to the spell
      slot level necessary to cast the spell (including increased levels for
      metamagic feats and so on). If the soul ward has insufficient hit points,
      the ravener cannot cast that spell. Casting a spell that reduces her soul
      ward to exactly 0 hit points does not harm the ravener (though most are
      not comfortable without this buffer of soul-energy and try to replenish it
      quickly).
  - name: Soul Ward (Su)
    description: >-
      An intangible field of siphoned soul energy protects a ravener from
      destruction. This ward has a maximum number of hit points equal to twice
      the ravener's Hit Dice, but starts at half this amount. Whenever a ravener
      would fall below 1 hit point, all damage in excess of that which would
      reduce her to 1 hit point is instead dealt to her soul ward. If this
      damage reduces the soul ward to fewer than 0 hit points, the ravener is
      destroyed. Each time a ravener uses her breath weapon, she adds 1 hit
      point to her soul ward for each negative level bestowed. Each time a
      frightful ravener strikes a cowering, frightened, panicked, or shaken
      creature with a natural weapon, she adds 1 hit point to her soul ward.
