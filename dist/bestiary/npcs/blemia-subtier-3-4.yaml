    description: >-
      Umbral dragons have negative energy affinity and are therefore immune to
      energy drain and death effects.
DuringCombat: Blemia opens with her breath weapon before switching to full attacks.
Morale: >-
  Blemia is reluctant to abandon the hoard she has worked hard to acquire, but
  if she believes the PCs might actually be able to kill her-such as if they
  reduce her to 8 hit points or fewer-she snarls with rage and leaves, swearing
  vengeance on the Pathfinder Society.
