BeforeCombat: >-
  If the dark stalker detects the PCs' approach, it attempts to hide behind the
  statue of its dark goddess. While hidden, it coats each of its blades with a
  dose of black smear.
DuringCombat: >-
  When the PCs enter its unholy domain, the dark stalker touches the podium in
  front of it and casts deeper darkness, enveloping the entire room and some of
  the extending passages in impenetrable blackness. It relies on the cover of
  darkness to bring its enemies to their knees with its short swords. Should it
  find an opponent not susceptible to its sneak attack damage even under the
  cover of darkness, it moves on to more vulnerable targets.
Morale: The dark stalker defends its unholy shrine to the death.
