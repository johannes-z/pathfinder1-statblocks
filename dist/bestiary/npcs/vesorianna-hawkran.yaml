Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Vesorianna hopes the PCs will aid her, and only attacks in
  self-defense&#8211;if the PCs do attack her, she mistakenly sees them as the
  same guards who locked her in this room 50 years ago. Shrieking in rage and
  reverting back to the hours before her death, she claws and bites at the PCs,
  inadvertently assaulting them with her corrupting touch.
Morale: >-
  Vesorianna cannot pursue foes beyond the confines of this room, but fights
  until destroyed otherwise. If the PCs leave and return later, she has
  forgotten their previous attack and attempts again to establish peaceful
  contact with them.
