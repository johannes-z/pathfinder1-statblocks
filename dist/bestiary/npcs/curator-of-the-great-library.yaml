DuringCombat: >-
  The curators are here to help library patrons, not to fight, but they are
  capable of defending the library if necessary. If they have time to prepare,
  they cast barkskin, shield, and shield of faith, increasing their AC to 22. In
  combat, they cast hold person, searing light, and spiritual weapon, using
  their scrolls of order's wrath as a last resort.
Morale: >-
  The curators are not combative, and seek to escape or surrender if reduced to
  fewer than 20 hit points, casting sanctuary if necessary. If all of the
  library guards are overpowered or if any of the curators is killed, one of the
  surviving curators uses a scroll of sending to request aid from the Sanctuary
  of Nethys.
Gear: >-
  scroll of divine favor (CL 7th), scroll of magic weapon, scroll of order's
  wrath, scroll of sending
OtherGear: >-
  light mace, bracers of armor +2, cloak of resistance +1, unguent of
  timelessness, cleric's vestments, spell component pouch, silver holy symbol of
  Nethys (worth 25 gp), 10 gp
