BeforeCombat: >-
  Kane maintains his mage armor and protection from arrow spells while on duty.
  If he expects trouble, he casts haste on the honor guard and cat's grace and
  elemental body II on himself, transforming into a darkly roiling air
  elemental.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kane flies into the skies and activates his thunderstaff ability to grant his
  longbow the shocking burst special ability, then attempts to pick off enemies
  from the sky. Once this ability wears off in 2 rounds, he switches to

Morale: Kane attempts to flee if reduced below 20 hit points.
