SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Expert Climber (Ex)
    description: >-
      A morlock can cling to cave walls and even ceilings as long as the surface
      has hand and footholds. In effect, a morlock is treated as constantly
      being under a nonmagical version of the spell spider climb, save that she
      cannot cling to smooth surfaces. This ability doubles the normal +8 racial
      bonus to Climb checks normally afforded creatures with a climb speed to a
      +16 racial bonus.
  - name: Leap Attack (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a morlock may use a single attack during a jump. It
      can make this attack at any point along the course of the leap-the start,
      the end, or while in midair. While jumping, a morlock does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity for leaving a threatened square.
  - name: Swarming (Ex)
    description: >-
      Morlocks dwell and fight in cramped quarters every day of their lives, and
      as such are quite adept at swarming foes. Up to two morlocks can share the
      same square at the same time. If two morlocks in the same square attack
      the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that foe as if they were
      in two opposite squares.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Mo'al leaps from atop the obelisk to area 4e once she sees the PCs. She waits
  for them to climb the tower to the third level, buffing herself with aid,
  bull's strength, magic vestment, and enlarge person as the PCs face her
  caryatid column guardians below.
DuringCombat: >-
  After casting her buff spells, Mo'al attempts to use her bestow curse and
  cause fear spells on well-armored foes. If possible, Mo'al prefers to use her
  spells, spell-like abilities, and special attacks, but if she needs to, she
  uses her leap attack to harry her foes. The citadel's hollow interior should
  allow Mo'al plenty of opportunities to use these hitand- run tactics.
Morale: Mo'al fanatically fights to the death.
Gear: wand of cure moderate wounds (50 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +2 studded leather armor, club, golem manual (clay), ring of maniacal devices,
  ceremonial Jistkan head dress
