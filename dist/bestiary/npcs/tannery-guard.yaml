DuringCombat: >-
  The guards snatch up their falchions and engage the PCs as quickly as
  possible. If the tide of battle turns against them, one of them blows a signal
  whistle to alert the guards stationed outside in the tanning yard (area C6).
Morale: >-
  These guards are charmed and feel especially protective of the tannery and its
  workers. However, they are still just paid employees and value their lives
  more than the tannery. If reduced to fewer than 10 hp, they attempt to flee.
