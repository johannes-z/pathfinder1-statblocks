SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2
      Str; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitutionbased. Spells A drider casts
      spells as a 6th-level cleric, sorcerer, or wizard, but does not gain any
      other class abilities.
  - name: Undersized Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although a drider is Large, its upper torso is the same size as that of a
      Medium humanoid's upper torso. As a result, it wields weapons as if it
      were one size category smaller than its actual size (Medium for most
      driders).
  - name: Web (Ex)
    description: >-
      Driders can use webs to support themselves and up to one additional
      creature of the same size. In addition, such creatures can throw a web up
      to eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a
      maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is
      effective against targets up to one size category larger than the drider.
      An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check or
      burst it with a Strength check. Both are standardactions with a DC equal
      to 10 + 1/2 creature's HD + creature's Con modifier. Attempts to burst a
      web by those caught in it suffer a &#8211;4 penalty. Driders can create
      sheets of sticky webbing up to three times their size. They usually
      position these sheets to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap
      prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20
      Perception check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and
      become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or
      burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to
      walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot section of webs has a
      number of hit points equal to the Hit Dice of the creature that created
      it, and sheet webs have damage reduction 5/&#8211;. A drider can move
      across its own web at its climb speed and can pinpoint the location of any
      creature touching its web.
