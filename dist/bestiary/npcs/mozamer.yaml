DuringCombat: >-
  Mozamer doesn't care about the fleshdregs he fights with and uses them as a
  tactical advantage as much as he can, letting them distract the PCs so he can
  cast bull's strength, shield of faith, and magic circle against good in that
  order (he casts these three spells before combat begins if possible). Once
  this is done, he fights with his halberd and his bite, saving his spells for
  when they are tactically advantageous. If facing foes on his own, he uses his
  channel energy ability liberally against enemies.
Morale: Mozamer fights to the death.
