Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Sial casts endure elements on himself each morning. If he suspects combat is
  looming, he casts fly and shield on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Sial starts combat by casting greater invisibility on himself, and then uses
  his magic to create various pits and place swaths of grease to control the
  battlefield as long as he can do so without significantly inconveniencing his
  allies. If he fights with many allies, he instead switches to support tactics,
  starting with haste and then moving among his allies to augment them with
  barkskin, greater invisibility, and resist energy as appropriate. He avoids
  using his spiked chain if possible, saving it to make attacks against foes who
  are already wounded and might be dropped by a single blow from the vicious
  weapon.
Morale: >-
  If Sial's hit points fall below 15, he uses his scroll of teleport to flee
  back to his home in Nidal. He spends a few days recovering, but then secures
  two new scrolls of teleport to return to the scene of the battle to track down
  those who defeated him, seeking revenge.
