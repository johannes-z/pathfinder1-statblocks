SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Absorb Body (Su)
    description: >-
      A corpse orgy can absorb the physical body of any creature that has been
      reduced to 0 hit points or fewer by moving over it and remaining in
      contact with it for at least 1 full round. A living opponent can attempt a
      DC 25 Fortitude save to resist absorption. A dead body gets no saving
      throw. When it absorbs a body, the corpse orgy gains 12 temporary hit
      points. A creature that was not yet dead dies immediately upon being
      absorbed. When a creature's body is absorbed, it can be raised or
      resurrected only if the corpse orgy that absorbed the body is slain. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Pain Shriek (Su)
    description: >-
      Twice per day as a standard action, a corpse orgy can unleash a piercing
      shriek from the various heads captured in its form. This shriek deals 10d6
      points of sonic damage to all living creatures within a 40-foot radius.
      Affected creatures can attempt a DC 22 Fortitude save for half damage.
      This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  Upon attacking, the corpse orgy immediately looses a pain shriek. It then
  relies on its undeadlike appearance to cause opponents to waste  channel
  energy attempts and other undead-affecting attacks against it.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, the corpse orgy attempts to flee deeper
  into Scarwall, but it fights to the death if cornered.
