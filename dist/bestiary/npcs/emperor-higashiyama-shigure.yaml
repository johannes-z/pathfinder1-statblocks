SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Vorpal Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      Shigure was beheaded by the Jade Regent, and his severed head now floats
      above his incorporeal body. If Shigure makes a successful critical hit
      with his corrupting touch, the target is decapitated and immediately slain
      (creatures without a head are immune to this effect).
  - name: Vulnerability to Ancestral Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      Shigure is vulnerable to ancestral weapons of the Higashiyama family, such
      as the daikyu of commanding presence (Pathfinder Adventure Path #53 60).
      Against Shigure, the daikyu of commanding presence functions as an undead
      bane ghost touch weapon.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  After making his presence known, Shigure initiates combat with a frightful
  moan. He attacks those who don't flee with his corrupting touch, using his
  Combat Expertise feat to increase his Armor Class if opponents are able to
  successfully hit him too easily. Against more powerful
  opponents&#8211;particularly those channeling positive energy against
  him&#8211;he uses his telekinesis ability to hurl them out of the Shrine of
  the Emperors and into the surrounding moat, where he holds them under until
  they drown, if necessary.
Morale: >-
  If confronted with positive energy damage or reduced to 50 hit points or
  fewer, Shigure flees into the relative safety of the walls or floor of the
  Tomb of the Past Emperors. If slain, he simply re-forms again 2d4 days later.
  Only the proper ceremony and cremation of his physical remains can grant him
  peace.
