SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Size Alteration (Su)
    description: >-
      At will, as a standard action, a spriggan can change its size between
      Small and Large. Weapons, armor, and other objects on the spriggan's
      person grow proportionally when it changes size (objects revert to normal
      size 1 round after a spriggan releases them). When a spriggan becomes
      Large, it gains +12 Strength, -2 Dexterity, +6 Constitution, and a
      &#8211;2 size penalty to its AC. While Large, a spriggan cannot use its
      sneak attack or the spell-like abilities granted by its race (although if
      it possesses either from class levels or templates, it retains their use
      in both sizes).
