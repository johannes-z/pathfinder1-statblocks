    description: >-
      Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against an
      air elemental.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Iyasset leads off combat by creating a whirlwind to target any Small
  opponents. If he is facing the PCs, he attacks oreads before other enemies. If
  he reduces a PC to 0 hit points or fewer, he takes a round to attempt to
  demoralize one of the remaining PCs with his Intimidate skill. If Iyasset is
  on the PCs' side, he targets the fire elementals first. He mocks Elsharon,
  using his flight and movement speed to stay out of the earth elemental's
  reach.
Morale: >-
  Iyasset fights to the death against the Goanron representatives. If the PCs
  surrender, he mocks them for siding with Elsharon, but allows them to leave
  with their lives.
