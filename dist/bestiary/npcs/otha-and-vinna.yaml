BeforeCombat: If aware of intruders, the twin maenads cast bull's strength.
DuringCombat: >-
  In combat, the twins attempt to stay out of melee range and use their
  spell-like abilities in tandem to achieve the best results. For example, one
  of them targets one of the PCs with mad hallucination just before the other
  targets the same PC via a spell-like ability that allows a Will save, like
  charm monster, murderous command, or suggestion. They use their infectious
  dance ability to turn the party members against each other. If pressed into
  melee combat, the maenads use vampiric touch and their poison bite and claws
  against the PCs.
Morale: Frenzied beyond self-preservation, the nightmare maenads fight to the death.
