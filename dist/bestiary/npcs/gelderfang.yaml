DuringCombat: >-
  Gelderfang has no interest in summoning allies, and prefers not to use his
  spell-like abilities (although he might use suggestion to get an enemy to wade
  into a pool of quicksand). He knows all of the effects of the three platforms,
  and moves to them as appropriate when he wants the bonuses. He throws his net
  on the first round of combat, and if he entangles a foe, he rushes up to make
  a full attack on the following round. Gelderfang is fond of expending uses of
  mythic power to use sudden attack. He certainly uses performance combat as
  appropriate to gain the crowd's favor.
Morale: Gelderfang fights to the death.
