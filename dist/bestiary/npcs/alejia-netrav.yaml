BeforeCombat: >-
  Alejia hides from the PCs when she hears them in either adjacent chamber,
  positioning herself next to her prisoner and readying her hand crossbow to
  fire in the surprise round.
DuringCombat: >-
  Alejia fires her hand crossbow at the first PC to step amid the stone columns,
  then draws her cutlass and threatens to execute her prisoner if not allowed to
  leave on the Topaz Titan without being followed. If not permitted to leave
  with her prisoner, she kills him with a coup de grace on the following round.
  Once injured, Alejia smears her sword along her open wound to apply her venom
  to the weapon before making her next attack, and uses spell combat and
  spellstrike in following rounds.
Morale: >-
  Alejia has come too far to see her plan crumble into ashes, and she fights to
  the death.
