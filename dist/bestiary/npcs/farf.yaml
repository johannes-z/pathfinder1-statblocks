SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cough (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a nucol can bellow out a contagious cough. This
      cough can take one of two forms: a ranged touch attack consisting of a wad
      of infectious phlegm with a range of 30 feet, or a spray of snot and spit
      that affects creatures in a 15-foot cone (Reflex DC 15 negates). All
      creatures affected by either form of the cough must succeed at a DC 15
      Fortitude save or contract nervous consumption. The save DCs are
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Look of Fear (Su)
    description: A creature affected by a nucol's gaze is shaken for 1d2 rounds.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Nervous Consumption: Gore or cough-injury or contact; save Fort DC 15;
      onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1 point of Wisdom damage. If a
      creature with this illness is suffering Wisdom damage from any source, it
      takes a -1 penalty to its Armor Class and on ability checks and skill
      checks. This is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  Farf coughs to inflict nervous consumption on its opponents, then gores at
  those approaching in melee, using Power Attack to maximize its damage.
Morale: >-
  Already resigned to the fact that its trip to the Boneyard was a suicide
  mission, Farf fights until destroyed.
