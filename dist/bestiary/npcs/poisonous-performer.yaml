BeforeCombat: >-
  The monk conceals her shuriken as the metal cymbals inside her tambourine,
  applying 2 doses of black adder venom or drow poison to the weapons before
  combat. She performs, bluffs, or connives her way to her target.
DuringCombat: >-
  If the monk finds herself outnumbered, she uses flurry of blows with her
  poisoned shuriken. She shifts and feints through a melee. If her feint is
  successful, she trips that foe. Once the foe is on the ground, she slams down
  with a Stunning Fist. A poisonous performer does not hesitate to abandon
  combat if outmatched or seriously injured, drinking her potion of invisibility
  and fleeing the field to a place where she can drink a potion of disguise
  self, blend in, and disappear.
