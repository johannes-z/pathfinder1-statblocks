SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Compel Plants (Su)
    description: >-
      A fungus queen's mind-affecting powers and spell-like abilities (and
      spells, should the fungus queen gain the ability to cast them) affect
      plant creatures (but not mindless plant creatures) as if they weren't
      immune to mind-affecting effects.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that would normally be slain by a fungus queen's energy drain
      attack is not killed- instead, it immediately loses all negative levels
      imparted by the fungus queen and transforms into a fungus-infested minion
      of the queen. Such creatures gain the fungoid simple template (granting it
      all of the plant traits, telepathy 100 ft. with other fungoid creatures,
      and the chaotic evil alignment), which must be removed using heal, limited
      wish, miracle, or wish before the end of the scenario, otherwise the
      character is removed from Pathfinder Society Organized Play. Fungoid
      creatures are under the control of the fungus creature that created them,
      and remain enslaved until their mistress is destroyed or until they are
      cured of the infestation. A fungus queen can communicate telepathically
      with her fungoid spawn at any range as long as they are on the same plane,
      and may have a number of Hit Dice worth of enslaved spawn totaling no more
      than twice her own Hit Dice; any spawn she creates that would exceed this
      limit become free-willed fungoid creatures. A fungus queen may free an
      enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a fungoid
      creature cannot be enslaved again (although it can still be influenced by
      the fungus queen's compel plants and plant empathy abilities).
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A fungus queen's energy drain functions identically to that of a succubus
      (Bestiary 68). Creatures killed by this attack do not die&#8211;they
      instead become infested with the fungus queen's spores (see Create Spawn).
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Plant Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as the druid's wild empathy, save that a fungus
      queen can use this ability only on plant creatures. A fungus queen gains a
      +4 racial bonus on this check. Mindless plant creatures are imparted a
      modicum of implanted intelligence when a fungus queen uses this ability,
      allowing her to train such creatures as guardians.
  - name: Sporepod (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a fungus queen can cause a Medium pod of fungal
      material to burst out of the ground at any point within 60 feet of her
      current location. Once created, a sporepod cannot move. If the fungus
      queen travels more than 120 feet from a sporepod, it is destroyed. A
      fungus queen can maintain a number of sporepods equal to her Charisma
      modifier (7 for the typical fungus queen). As a move action, she can
      instantaneously travel to one of her sporepods as if using transport via
      plants. She can also choose to spread out her tentacle attacks among her
      sporepods, attacking a creature within 5 feet of any sporepod with a
      tentacle&#8211; she is still limited to making only four tentacle attacks
      as part of a full-attack action, or one as a standard action. A sporepod
      is an object that has an AC of 15 and 20 hit points; damage dealt to a
      sporepod does not harm the fungus queen.
BeforeCombat: Eukalia hides in plain sight using veil.
DuringCombat: >-
  Eukalia strikes through her sporepods and with magic, only closing into melee
  range if necessary.
Morale: >-
  Eukalia attempts to flee with judicious use of her sporepod ability if reduced
  to 25 hp or less.
