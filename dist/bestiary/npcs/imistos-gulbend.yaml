BeforeCombat: >-
  Imistos prefers guile over combat, attacking opponents only when he has an
  obvious advantage. If he sees a chance, he'll try to slip his dose of arsenic
  into something the PCs eat or drink, especially anything provided by another
  NPC. He claims his masterwork rapier is part of his serving costume, using
  Bluff to disguise his considerable skill with the blade.
DuringCombat: >-
  Imistos flanks or strikes from hiding whenever possible. His rapier has
  already been coated with a dose of medium spider venom.
Morale: >-
  Imistos is a fanatic and knows the rest of his cult will hunt him if he fails,
  so he fights to the death.
Gear: potion of neutralize poison, arsenic, medium spider venom (2)
OtherGear: >-
  padded armor, dagger, mwk rapier, mwk thieves' tools, poison pill ringUE,
  silver unholy symbol of Thamir Gixx, wrist sheathUE, silk handkerchief (worth
