SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Shrieking Frenzy (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a charau-ka can enter a state of shrieking frenzy as a free
      action. While in this state, the charau-ka automatically fails Stealth
      checks and cannot speak or cast spells that use verbal components (or use
      items that require command words to activate), but functions as if under
      the effects of a haste spell. The charau-ka can continue shrieking for up
      to 3 rounds, after which it is staggered for 1 round. Thrown-Weapon
  - name: Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Charau-ka are masters of thrown weapons. All charau-ka gain Throw Anything
      as a bonus feat. In addition, charau-ka gain a +1 racial bonus on all
      thrown weapons, and their threat range for thrown weapons is doubled, as
      if they possessed the Improved Critical feat for all thrown weapons. This
      effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range
      of a weapon.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  When the alarm is sounded, Powderpot drinks his feral mutagen and extracts of
  aid, blur, bull's strength, and shield. In addition, his stat block includes
  the bonuses from the lord's banner of victory flying from the mainmast.
DuringCombat: >-
  Powderpot throws explosive bombs at attackers, using his precise bombs
  discovery to avoid hitting the boatswain's mates. If attackers engage him in
  melee combat, Powderpot uses his boarding pike in an attempt to fend them off,
  but if anyone gets past his reach, he goes into a shrieking frenzy and attacks
  with his bite and claws. If he runs out of bombs, Powderpot drinks his extract
  of fire breath or hurls alchemical items such as alchemist's fire or liquid
  ice at foes.
Morale: >-
  Powderpot happily serves as the Filthy Lucre's mascot, but he is intelligent
  enough to recognize a losing battle when he's in one. If reduced to 20 hit
  points or fewer, he drinks his extract of gaseous form and attempts to retreat
  to safety.
