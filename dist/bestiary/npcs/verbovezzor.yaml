SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Charisma Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      Verbovezzor drains fragments of personality and memories from those it
      feeds upon, dealing 1d4 points of Charisma drain whenever it deals swarm
      damage. A successful DC 22 Fortitude save reduces the Charisma drain to 1
      point of Charisma damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Gibber (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature within 15 feet of Verbovezzor must succeed at a DC 22 Will
      save or be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion
      insanity effect. A creature that saves successfully cannot be affected by
      Verbovezzor's gibber again for 24 hours. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Ravenous (Ex)
    description: >-
      Verbovezzor ignores hardness of less than 20 when it attacks an object.
      Each round a creature is in the same space as the swarm, Verbovezzor
      begins devouring one object on the creature. The object takes an amount of
      damage equal to half its maximum hit points and becomes broken; a broken
      object damaged in this way is destroyed. An attended magic item gets a DC
      15 Reflex save to negate this effect.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      If even one of the individual vescavors that makes up Verbovezzor survives
      the swarm's destruction (this is all but guaranteed, as the swarm always
      keeps a few dozen hidden in the surrounding area), Verbovezzor can rebuild
      itself through a fit of reproduction over the course of 24 hours.
      Permanently slaying Verbovezzor requires powerful magic or diligence. A
      miracle or wish used to ensure its death after its defeat could certainly
      do the trick.
  - name: Traumatizing (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature that spends more than 3 rounds within the swarm must succeed
      at a DC 19 Will save or become afflicted with a random insanity
      (GameMastery Guide 250). The save DC is Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  Verbovezzor moves to engulf as many foes as it can each round, but it
  particularly enjoys devouring animal companions, familiars, and other
  "tidbits," since emotional connections of these creatures to the masters serve
  as lovely appetizers.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, Verbovezzor attempts to surrender,
  promising to reveal many important secrets to the PCs in reward for its life.
