    description: >-
      The mutated manticore bears two weaknesses as a result of its condition-a
      vulnerability to electricity and a fractured mind that causes it to become
      confused for 1 round whenever it fails a Will saving throw. Other
      mutations are beneficial to the manticore. The creature is rugged and
      gains DR 5/&#8211;. Also, the radiation that affected it has become
      concentrated in its fangs. Any creature it bites is exposed to low
      radiation and must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or take 1 point of
      Constitution drain. A creature bitten by the manticore must also succeed
      at a DC 19 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage. This
      secondary effect continues to plague the character until he succeeds at
      two saving throws against this effect, at which point the radiation
      poisoning ends. This is a poison effect; the save DC is
      Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The mutant begins combat by launching its tail spikes, hovering over its foes
  while it does so. If it hovers over its nest, the downdraft whips coils of
  spiky wire and bits of sharp rubble into the air, causing any creature
  affected by this effect of its Hover feat to also take 1d4 points of piercing
  damage each round. The manticore lands to attack foes in melee once it uses up
  12 spikes, favoring its bite if it gets only one attack and saving its
  remaining 12 spikes for that day for emergencies.
Morale: >-
  The mutant manticore flees, abandoning its lair and Scrapwall forever, if
  reduced to fewer than 10 hit points.
