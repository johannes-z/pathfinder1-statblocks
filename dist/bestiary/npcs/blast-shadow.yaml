SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cloud of Smoke and Fire (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a blast shadow can surround itself with a cloud of
      smoke that burns living flesh. While this ability is active, the blast
      shadow gains concealment, and all living creatures within 5 feet take 1d6
      points of fire damage per round. If the blast shadow takes any cold
      damage, this cloud is dispelled and can't be activated again for 1d6
      rounds.
  - name: Death Burst (Su)
    description: >-
      When a blast shadow is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it explodes in a
      blast of flame. All creatures within 30 feet take 5d6 points of fire
      damage (Reflex DC 17 half). The save DC is Charisma-based.
