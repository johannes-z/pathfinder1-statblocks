BeforeCombat: >-
  Prior to confronting the PCs, Harvestmaster Quint casts lesser restoration to
  remove his altitude fatigue, bear's endurance, and divine power (all of which
  are included in his stats.)
DuringCombat: >-
  The Harvestmaster directs his ghoul thralls to attack PCs while he casts
  ranged attack spells from afar. If approached in melee, he uses Power Attack
  and his destructive smite and channel smite abilities to deal the most damage
  to his attacker. If he finds himself getting hit often, he sacrifices a round
  of attacking to cast shield of faith. The Harvestmaster alternates channeling
  to heal his undead minions and harm the PCs if his other methods of attack
  prove ineffective.
Morale: The last of his cult in Taldor, Harvestmaster Quint fights to the death.
