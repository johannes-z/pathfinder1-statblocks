SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Implant (Ex)
    description: >-
      Tsathar are sexless, reproducing by injecting eggs into living hosts. An
      egg can be implanted only into a helpless host creature. The host must be
      of Small size or larger. Giant frogs, bred for this very purpose, are the
      most common host. Implanting an egg requires one minute to perform.
      Accompanying the egg is an anaesthetizing poison that causes the host to
      fall unconscious for the two-week gestation period of the egg unless the
      host succeeds on a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw; this save DC includes a
      +8 racial bonus. If the save succeeds, the host remains conscious, but is
      violently ill (-10 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks,
      and skill checks) 24 hours before the eggs hatch. When the eggs mature,
      the young tsathar emerges from the host, killing it in the process. A
      remove disease spell rids the victim any implanted eggs. A DC 20 Heal
      check can be attempted to surgically extract an egg from a host. If the
      check fails, the healer can try again, but each attempt (successful or
      not) deals 1d6 points of damage to the patient.
  - name: Leap (Ex)
    description: >-
      Tsathar are incredible jumpers, able to leap up to 30 feet horizontally or
      10 feet vertically. They have a +14 racial bonus on horizontal jumps, or
      +24 on vertical jumps, and they do not need to make a 10-foot minimum
      running start before jumping to avoid doubling the jumping DCs. Tsathar
      can always take 10 when making an Acrobatics check to jump. When a tsathar
      begins its round by jumping next to an opponent it can make a full attack
      in the same round. A tsathar wearing medium or heavy armor or carrying a
      medium or heavy load cannot use this ability.
  - name: Summon Hydrodaemon (Sp)
    description: >-
      A tsathar with at least five levels of cleric can, once per day, attempt
      to summon a hydrodaemon (q.v.) with a 40% chance of success. This ability
      is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.
  - name: Slimy (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because tsathar continuously cover themselves with muck and slime, they
      are difficult to grapple. Webs, magic or otherwise, do not affect tsathar,
      and they usually can wriggle free from most other forms of confinement.
      This grants them a +12 racial bonus to their CMD to escape grapples, and
      to their Escape Artist checks.
