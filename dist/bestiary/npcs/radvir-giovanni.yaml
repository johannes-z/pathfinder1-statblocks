BeforeCombat: >-
  If alerted to the PCs' presence, Radvir drinks a draught of bloodbrew elixir
  and his potions of cat's grace, displacement, and haste.
DuringCombat: >-
  Radvir makes sneak attacks as often as possible, flanking with his enslaved
  spawn if needed. If surrounded by multiple opponents, he uses Whirlwind Attack
  to strike all of them. He channels his energy drain ability through his
  conductive bladed scarf, focusing his energy drain attacks on the same foe. If
  overwhelmed, Radvir assumes gaseous form and flees, only to return later to
  make hit-and-run sneak attacks.
Morale: >-
  Knowing his fate if taken back to Luvick for judgment, Radvir fights until
  destroyed. He uses his familiarity with his shop to his advantage, always
  retreating in gaseous form to another location so his fast healing can restore
  him to fighting shape. If forced to abandon his shop, Radvir makes for the
  Abbey of Sante-Lymirin to warn Aisa and Hetna Dublesse of the danger posed by
  the PCs. If reduced to 0 hit points, Radvir returns to his coffin in area E17.
Gear: >-
  bloodbrew elixir (4 doses; see page 35), potions of cat's grace (2), potions
  of displacement (2), potions of haste (2), wand of halt undead (12 charges)
