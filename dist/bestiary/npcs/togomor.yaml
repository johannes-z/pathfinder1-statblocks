SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bloat (Su)
    description: >-
      Togomor can exert himself up to three times per day as a free action to
      gain 1d12 blood points to use with his blood pool ability (see below).
      This can fill his blood pool to a point beyond his normal limit of 9 blood
      points, but as long as his blood pool contains more than 9 blood points
      (but fewer than 18 blood points), Togomor is sickened. If this ability
      fills his blood pool to 18 blood points or more, he flies into a homicidal
      range and attacks randomly with his most damaging attacks and abilities at
      friends and foes alike for 1d6 rounds or until his blood point total is
      reduced to 0 (whichever comes first); at the end of this rage, Togomor's
      hit points drop to -1 and he begins dying.
  - name: Blood Pool (Su)
    description: >-
      Togomor has a blood pool that represents an overload to his system of
      excess blood to extend his arcane abilities beyond their normal level.
      Togomor's blood pool consists of 9 blood points that can be spent at the
      time of casting to cast a spell without using that spell's spell slot,
      leaving it available for further use later in the day. When he does so,
      Togomor spends blood points equal to the spell slot being retained.
      Togomor's blood pool refills to its normal maximum of 9 when he rests to
      regain spells; if he has more than 9 points at this time (due to use of
      his bloat ability), he gains no additional points from rest. Some
      bloatmages conduct constant rituals involving leeches or exsanguination in
      an attempt to regulate their systems and to minimize the results from
      using the bloat ability (and to help prevent overbloating), but Togomor
      does not use these rituals. Instead, he simply avoids using his bloat
      ability until his blood pool is at 5 or lower. Contingency If Togomor
      snaps his fingers (a swift action as long as he has a hand free), a
      stoneskin spell activates on him.
  - name: Corpulence (Ex)
    description: >-
      Togomor is so massive that his rolls of fatty, blood-laden flesh grant him
      a +2 natural armor bonus but reduce his base speed by 10 feet-combined
      with the fact that his weight results in him carrying a medium load, this
      means his speed is effectively 10 feet.
  - name: Hemophilia (Ex)
    description: >-
      Togomor is particularly susceptible to bleed effects, and the DC of any
      Heal check to stop a bleed effect on him is 5 higher than normal. In
      addition, if Togomor takes bleed damage, he loses 1 blood point from his
      blood pool; this loss of blood points is cumulative for multiple bleed
      attacks, but not each time he takes damage from the same attack. Permanent
      Spells Togomor has made the following spells permanent on himself: arcane
      sight, darkvision, see invisibility, and tongues.
  - name: Possessed (Su)
    description: >-
      Togomor is possessed by the belier devil Sermignatto, who languishes on
      the Ethereal Plane as long as he controls the bloatmage (see area A59).
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Togomor casts extended false life, overland flight, mage armor, and
  nondetection on himself every morning. Once the castle's alarm is raised,
  Togomor takes the time to cast shield and bear's endurance before he responds
  to the alarm.
DuringCombat: >-
  It's unlikely for the PCs to actually encounter Togomor here, unless this room
  happens to be their first target on visiting the castle. If confronted here
  before he prepares a defense, Togomor uses dimension door to travel to area
  A59, casts his preparatory spells, and then either waits for the PCs to
  confront him there or waits for them to trigger an alarm elsewhere, whereupon
  he casts greater invisibility and then uses dimension door to that location to
  offer aid. See area A45 for sample tactics tailored to that location; you can
  use most of these tactics anywhere else in the castle with a little
  modification.
Morale: >-
  Togomor doesn't have control of his actions as long as he remains possessed,
  but Sermignatto doesn't take unnecessary risks with his puppet. If reduced to
  fewer than 30 hit points, Togomor flees via dimension door to area A59, where
  he makes his last stand.
