DuringCombat: >-
  Kronsieg prefers to use his arc pistol in a fight, making sneak attacks with
  it against a flat-footed foe in the first round and letting his bodyguards
  engage foes in melee. If it becomes obvious that his bodyguards are
  outmatched, Kronsieg uses vanish to position himself for a sneak attack with
  his sap, hoping to knock out a wounded foe.
Morale: >-
  Kronsieg surrenders if reduced to 20 or fewer hit points&#8211;he gives up all
  his gear in return for his life, but if let go by the PCs, he reports them to
  the Technic League at a later date (+5 Notoriety) unless the PCs secure his
  cooperation by successfully Intimidating him, succeeding at a DC 35 Diplomacy
  check, casting mind control magic, or simply treating him with respect and
  letting him retain his gear.

  lesser restoration (3), potions of cure serious wounds (2)
