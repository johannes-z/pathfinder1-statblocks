BeforeCombat: >-
  Zamir casts pass without trace on the bandits one hour before the attack. It
  will last another 4 hours. The bandits try to sneak up to within 30 feet of
  the camp before attacking.
DuringCombat: >-
  The number of bandits noted in the introduction attack the PCs, while the rest
  search the wagons and camp for the scepter and crates of magic items.
Morale: >-
  The bandits flee once they have the scepter and magic items. If more than two
  of their number have been killed, they'll retreat with just the scepter. If
  more than five have been killed, they'll retreat with or without the items.
