IsTemplate: '0'
DuringCombat: >-
  The nagaji use their ki powers whenever it is prudent. Fast and mobile, they
  move and attack each round, trying to end their movement behind cover or in a
  position that makes it difficult for the PCs to counterattack. After 4 rounds
  (or if cornered), a nagaji changes her tactics; she closes into melee range
  and makes full attacks with unarmed strikes, using any remaining ki to make
  additional attacks.
Morale: >-
  The last nagaji standing attempts to flee if reduced to 25 or fewer hit
  points.
