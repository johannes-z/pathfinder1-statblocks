    description: >-
      A fungal crawler can perform a special kind of pounce attack by jumping
      into combat. When a fungal crawler charges, it can make a DC 20 Acrobatics
      check to jump into the air and land next to its enemies. If it makes the
      Acrobatics check, it can follow up with four claw attacks against foes in
      reach, but it cannot make a bite attack.
