  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When a dark stalker is slain, its body implodes violently into
      nothingness, leaving its gear in a heap on the ground. All creatures
      within a 10-foot burst take 1d8 points of sonic damage and must succeed at
      a DC 14 Fortitude save or be deafened for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Soul Harvest (Su)
    description: >-
      When a dark slayer damages a flat-footed foe or a foe it is flanking with
      a melee touch spell or spell like ability that deals hit point damage, the
      spell does an additional 1d6 points of damage and the dark slayer gains an
      equal number of temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for
      a maximum of 1 hour.
Bloodline: undead
BeforeCombat: >-
  The dark slayer is in a deep, trancelike meditative state and most likely
  unaware of the PCs' approach. Should it manage to hear the PCs before the
  encounter begins, it casts mage armor from its scroll and draws its wand and
  kukri.
Morale: >-
  During Combat The dark slayer attempts to sneak attack PCs with ranged touch
  and melee touch spells, taking full advantage of its soul harvest ability.
  Should the PCs attempt to neutralize the deeper darkness effect in the shrine,
  the dark slayer uses its wand of dispel magic to negate the PCs' spells or
  effects.  The dark slayer defends its unholy shrine to the death.

  potion of cure serious wounds, potion of invisibility, scroll of deeper
  darkness, scroll of mage armor, wand of dispel magic (CL 14th, 6 charges),
