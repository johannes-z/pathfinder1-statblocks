BeforeCombat: The Xun stranglers drink their potion of fly.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Xun stranglers enter snapping turtle style, fly forward, and hide outside
  of the line of fire so that they can strike the following round. In the
  following rounds, they fly through any open window or door and grapple the
  smallest or weakest targets. After that they grapple to pin and deal damage,
  hog-tying their targets if there are other enemies nearby. If attacked in
  melee, the stranglers instead fly over the cliff with their targets and allow
  their victims to fall into the ocean below (such victims take 2d3 points of
  nonlethal damage and 4d6 points of lethal damage).
Morale: The Xun stranglers fight to the death.
Gear: potion of fly
OtherGear: +1 brawling leather lamellarUE, dagger, 100 feet of rope in 20-ft. sections
