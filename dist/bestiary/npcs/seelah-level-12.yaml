DuringCombat: >-
  Seelah is fearless, especially in the face of evil, and she faces fiends,
  undead, and those with malicious intent head-on. Against particularly powerful
  evil foes&#8211;especially fiends and evil dragons&#8211;she channels her
  goddess's power into her attacks with her smite evil ability. If she has
  already expended her daily uses of smite evil, she uses her divine bond to
  increase her weapon's power. When her allies are injured or in trouble, Seelah
  puts herself in harm's way in an effort to heal them.
