    description: >-
      Nupperibos are devils, yet they are essentially mindless shells of
      solidified torment. Like golems, they have no real minds of their own, but
      rather follow orders and programming instilled within them by more
      powerful devils. In the case of multiple orders, only the orders of the
      most powerful devil are followed. They can utilize simple weapons if
      commanded, attacking with proficiency, and can also manipulate simple
      objects like doors. Armor, more complex weapons, and complex tools are
      beyond their ability to comprehend.
DuringCombat: >-
  A nupperibo attacks the closest target. It reverts to attacking with its claws
  only if it is disarmed.
Morale: Nupperibos fight to the death.
