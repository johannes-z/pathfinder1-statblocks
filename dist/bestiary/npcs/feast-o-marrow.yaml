  Feast-o'-Marrow casts extended greater magic weapon and extended magic
  vestment on himself every day.
DuringCombat: >-
  Feast-o'-Marrow prefers to let his minions engage in melee combat at the start
  of a fight, giving him a chance to cast antilife shell and then the luxury of
  casting other spells to bolster his own strengths or to attack the PCs at
  range. Before entering melee combat, he takes the time to cast freedom of
  movement, prayer, bull's strength, divine favor, and shield of faith if he has
  the chance.
Morale: >-
  Feast-o'-Marrow fights until destroyed, confident until the last possible
  moment that Urgathoa will keep him safe.
