SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Awaken Totem Spirit (Su)
    description: >-
      The spirit dancers can perform a sacred ritual that awakens a creature's
      totem spirit, and allows that creature to call upon its spirit animal for
      aid (see Development below).
  - name: Profane Gift (Su)
    description: >-
      The spirit dancers have accepted Zakiyya's profane gifts, gaining a +2
      profane bonus to their Charisma scores. This allows Zakiyya to communicate
      telepathically with the girls across any distance (and use her suggestion
      spell-like ability through the link). Dispel evil or dispel chaos removes
      the profane gift. Zakiyya can remove it as a free action as well, causing
      2d6+2 points of Charisma drain (no save).
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Under Zakiyya's domination, the dancers try to avoid melee combat, using their
  spells and abilities to support the succubus and hinder their foes. If they
  have a clear shot, they use poisoned blowgun darts to knock opponents
  unconscious. If commanded to enter melee, however, they throw themselves into
  combat with no thoughts for personal safety.
Morale: >-
  While dominated, the dancers fight to the death. If freed from Zakiyya's
  control, they turn against their former captor, though they flee if reduced to
  below 6 hit points.
Gear: blue whinnis poison (5 doses, Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 558)
OtherGear: >-
  blowgun and 10 darts, masterwork dagger, whip, amulet of natural armor +1,
  bracers of armor +1, spell component pouch, masterwork ceremonial tattooing
  quills
