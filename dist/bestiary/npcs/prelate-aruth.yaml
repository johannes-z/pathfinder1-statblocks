BeforeCombat: >-
  Prelate Aruth casts air walk, freedom of movement, shield of faith, and spell
  resistance.
DuringCombat: >-
  Prelate Aruth prefers to cast spells in melee combat, favoring slay living and
  other touch spells, but does cast spiritual weapon on the first round of a
  fight,  targeting an enemy healer. If he kills a PC and feels he has the upper
  hand in combat, the prelate isn't above gloating and taking actions in combat
  that are more for cruelty's sake (such as animating a fallen PC into a zombie)
  than tactically sound, but when facing dangerous foes, he makes a fighting
  retreat toward area F11 so he can gain the support of the bishop therein.
Morale: The prelate fights until destroyed but does not pursue foes out of the donjon.
Gear: >-
  +4 chainmail, +2 keen spiked chain, cloak of resistance +2, headband of mental
  prowess +2 (Wis, Cha), pouch of two dozen onyx gems (worth 2,800 gp total),
  iron unholy symbol of Zon-Kuthon
