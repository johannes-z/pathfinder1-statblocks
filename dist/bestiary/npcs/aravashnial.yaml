SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blinded (Ex)
    description: >-
      Aravashnial's eyes have been destroyed, permanently blinding him.
      Restoring his sight requires a regenerate spell-remove blindness/deafness
      cannot help him. Counter-Summon (Su) Aravashnial can ready an action to
      use a summon monster spell as a counterspell, even though the casting time
      for summon monster is 1 full round. When used this way, summon monster is
      treated as though quickened to a swift action via Quicken Spell, though
      its spell level is not increased and it can be used only to counterspell.
      When used to counterspell, a summon monster spell can counter any
      conjuration (summoning) spell or spell-like ability of its level or lower,
      including an outsider's summon ability.
  - name: Planar Guide (Ex)
    description: >-
      Aravashnial's studies as a Riftwarden have granted him favored enemy +2
      against evil outsiders.
Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: illusion, necromancy
DuringCombat: >-
  Aravashnial is incredibly frustrated at his blindness, and is eager to get
  back to the surface so he can not only get his sight restored but also aid in
  the city's defense. His arrogance makes him underestimate the effect his
  blindness has on his spellcasting, but if made helpful to the party, he casts
  whatever spells he can on them as requested. He prefers to use summon monster
  in combat, commanding the creatures he summons to "attack the source of that
  roaring" or using other methods to single out foes without visual cues. He
  casts mage armor and shield if he fears that combat is too close, or after he
  first takes damage.
Morale: >-
  If brought below 10 hit points, the wizard drops to his knees and begs for
  mercy if he believes his foe is capable of granting it. Otherwise, he attempts
  to flee as best he can.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure light wounds, potions of cure moderate wounds (2), scroll of
  dispel magic, scrolls of grease (2), scroll of web, wand of false life (20
  charges)
OtherGear: mwk quarterstaff, cloak of elvenkind, spell component pouch, 13 gp
