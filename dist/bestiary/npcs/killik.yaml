BeforeCombat: >-
  If Killik suspects an impending combat, he casts sanctuary on himself and
  attempts to talk his way out of any conflict.
DuringCombat: >-
  Killik prefers fighting from range with his crossbow, but channels negative
  energy if surrounded. If he fights with an ally, Killik stays close enough to
  his companion to heal them should they need assistance. If forced into melee
  combat, Killik uses his battle rage and copycat domain powers to boost his
  defenses and damage output.
Morale: >-
  Killik fights to the death if he is Marzack's accomplice. If he is innocent of
  the crime, he attempts to buy his freedom as a term of surrender if brought
  below 6 hp.
