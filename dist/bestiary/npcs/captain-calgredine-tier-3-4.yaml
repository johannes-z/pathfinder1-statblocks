DuringCombat: >-
  Calgredine rides into combat and charges whichever PC he can see who is
  wearing the most armor. He then tries to ride by and circle around to charge
  again, repeating this tactic throughout the rest of the combat. If he is
  surrounded, Calgredine dismounts from his horse and fights with his
  shortsword.
Morale: >-
  Calgredine is a brute, but he's not stupid. If his men are slain and there's
  no escape for him, he surrenders.
