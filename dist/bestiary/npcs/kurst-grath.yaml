DuringCombat: >-
  Kurst uses his bow if fighting at range, though if his foes attempt to close
  the gap, he jumps on his mount, Hope, and charges into battle with sword and
  shield. If he encounters orcs, Kurst activates his hunter's bond ability, and
  uses his tactician ability to grant allies use of Swap Places in combat.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 or fewer hit points, Kurst drinks a potion of cure light
  wounds. If he has expended all of his healing options and the battle is
  clearly not favoring his side, he gathers up as many fallen allies as he can
  on his mount and calls for retreat. Few humanoids can keep up with Hope's
  speed, so Kurst directs the escape as best he can, regrouping his allies when
  they've reached safety and can plan their next course of action.
