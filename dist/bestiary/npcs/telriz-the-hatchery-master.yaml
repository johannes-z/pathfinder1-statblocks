BeforeCombat: Telriz mounts a nearby cytillipede and readies her crossbow.
DuringCombat: >-
  The derro fires her crossbow at the nearest PC and blows a shrill-sounding
  whistle, commanding the other cytillipedes to attack the intruders. She
  continues to make ranged attacks until one of the cytillipedes is killed, at
  which point she flies into a rage and makes ride-by attacks with her short
  sword (she makes Ride checks to avoid attacks of opportunity). In later
  rounds, she urges her mount to close for bite attacks while she attacks with
  her sword. She attempts to make sneak attacks on any opponents stunned by her
  mount's cytillesh flashes.
Morale: >-
  The hatchery master fights to the death to defend the cytillipedes and
  unhatched eggs in her charge.
Gear: cytillesh extract (5 doses)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 chain shirt, +1 repeating light crossbow with 20 bolts, masterwork short
  sword
