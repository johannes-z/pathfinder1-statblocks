BeforeCombat: >-
  Grodel prefers to frighten intruders away rather than engage in combat.
  However, if she expects combat, she flies up and positions herself so that she
  has a clear charge line to a PC.
DuringCombat: Grodel makes the best of her mobility, using flyby attack to lash out at PCs.
Morale: >-
  If the PCs reduce Grodel to fewer than half her hit points, she mourns the
  loss of her people through choking sobs. "Master was last dwarf. Just me left,
  alone. top fight." If the PCs do not accept her surrender, Grodel burrows into
  the ground and flees.
