SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bramble Jump (Su)
    description: >-
      A twigjack can travel short distances between brambles, shrubs, or
      thickets, as if via dimension door as part of a move action. The twigjack
      must begin and end this movement while in an area of at least light
      undergrowth. The twigjack can travel up to 60 feet per day in this manner.
      This movement must be used in 10-foot increments and does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity.
  - name: Splinterspray (Ex)
    description: >-
      A twigjack can eject a barrage of splinters and brambles from its body
      three times per day as a standard action. This effect creates a 15-foot
      conical burst of jagged splinters, dealing 4d6 points of piercing damage
      to all creatures in the area. A (DC 13) Reflex saving throw halves this
      damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
BeforeCombat: >-
  If the twigjack detects intruders in Briar Henge, it uses its bramble jump
  ability to investigate and attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  The brash young twigjack prefers to make sneak attacks against intruders. If a
  sneak attack is not possible, or if the PCs are clustered together in the
  close confines of Bramble Henge, it uses its splinterspray ability instead.
Morale: The twigjack fights to the death.
