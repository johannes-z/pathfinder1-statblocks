SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Herald of the Yellow King (Sp)
    description: >-
      The Pallid Mask can use his yellow sign spell-like ability to inscribe the
      Yellow Sign on his own body. He can conceal this symbol within the folds
      of his robe, and reveal it once again as a move action. Creatures under
      the effect of a charm or compulsion spell cast by the Pallid Mask take a
      -4 penalty on their saving throws to resist the effects of the yellow
      sign.
  - name: Horrific Revelation (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, the Pallid Mask can reveal a horrific truth to a single
      creature within 60 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or
      become confused and babble incoherently for 1 round as its mind reels at
      the terrible revelation. A creature that successfully saves against this
      ability is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting,
      language-dependent effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Phantom of Truth (Su)
    description: >-
      The Pallid Mask's deceptions transcend truth and reality. He is immune to
      alignment-based spells and any spell or effect that would force him to
      tell the truth. Additionally, the Pallid Mask gains Bluff, Diplomacy, and
      Sense Motive as class skills.
  - name: Reality Leech (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Pallid Mask's touch steals the very essence of reality from his
      victims. Creatures struck by the Pallid Mask's touch attack take 1d6
      points of Charisma drain and become less real, appearing faintly
      translucent and shadowy. Attacks from such creatures deal half their
      normal damage, and spells cast by an affected creature that do not deal
      damage have a 50% chance of affecting their targets. Creatures struck by
      the Pallid Mask remain unreal for 2d4 rounds. A successful DC 28 Will save
      negates the Charisma drain and reduces the duration of this effect to 1
      round. A creature whose Charisma score is reduced to 0 by this effect dies
      and becomes permanently and entirely unreal. The creature functions in all
      ways as a permanent image (CL 15), and cannot be raised or resurrected
      until a wish, limited wish, or miracle spell is used to return its
      physical form. The illusory creature can continue to move and speak, but
      has no memory of its former life, and cannot travel farther than 30 feet
      from the place it died.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      If killed in Carcosa, the Pallid Mask reforms in the parasitic city in 1d4
      days.
