SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A royal naga can use this ability to take one of five specific humanoid
      forms. Each of these forms has a unique appearance and the naga can only
      use this ability to assume these five forms. The naga can still use its
      dual gaze in humanoid form.
  - name: Dual Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      A royal naga has a piercing stare capable of crippling those that meet its
      gazes. The creature has two gaze attacks and can switch between them as a
      move action. One gaze causes those that succumb to it to become
      permanently blinded, while the other causes those that succumb to be
      permanently deafened. A DC 22 Fortitude save negates the effects of either
      gaze; otherwise, the effects are permanent until cured. Royal nagas
      generally prefer to keep their deafening gaze active, switching to the
      blinding gaze once combat begins and some of their foes have already been
      deafened, since those who are blinded can no longer be harmed by gaze
      attacks. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  If attacked, Avinash begins by casting invisibility. He then moves away from
  his attackers and casts mage armor and shield, after which he casts charm
  monster or suggestion on a fighter-type to divide the group, using his dual
  gaze ability on any obvious spellcasters.
Morale: >-
  Due to his healthy instinct for self-preservation, Avinash flees if reduced to
  fewer than 30 hit points.
