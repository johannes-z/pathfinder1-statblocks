BeforeCombat: >-
  Halli casts mage armor from her scroll before drawing the PCs into the alley.
  She triggers combat on Deandre's signal by casting her scroll of obscuring
  mist.
DuringCombat: >-
  Halli keeps her distance from the fight, preferring to use acidic ray from
  range. If she is threatened in melee, she uses color spray or her scroll of
  burning hands to eliminate any foes in range. If somehow depleted of spells or
  spell-like abilities, Halli resorts to her crossbow.
Morale: >-
  Distracted by her delight in the battle, Halli doesn't think to surrender or
  flee and gleefully laughs during combat, even up to the moment of her death.
Gear: >-
  potions of cure light wounds (2), scroll of burning hands, scroll of mage
  armor, scroll of obscuring mist, scroll of shield, scroll of unseen servant,
  wand of disguise self (5 charges)
