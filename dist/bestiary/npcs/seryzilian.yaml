BeforeCombat: >-
  If made aware of threats to her servants, Seryzilian moves into the depths of
  Adderpool and watches from the safety of the murky water. There she casts
  haste, displacement, and mage armor, then uses her acid pool ability to
  undetectably taint the surface of the water. Only if battle turns against
  Lesaul and her followers does Seryzilian emerge.
DuringCombat: >-
  Seryzilian prefers to keep foes off balance by using darkness or dimension
  door, disappearing beneath the water, or attempting to lure enemies onto
  marshy ground&#8211;or perhaps create it using transmute rock to mud.
Morale: >-
  The black dragon retreats to her lair, calling upon the aid of her green hag
  and reptilian allies, if reduced to fewer than half her hit points. If
  confronted there, she fights to the death.
