Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Sursha fights with a smirk, staying mobile in battle as she dances from foe to
  foe. Rather than remaining in one place for long, she eagerly provokes attacks
  of opportunity and makes use of her parry and riposte ability to gain
  additional attacks. Doing so also draws those attacks of opportunity away from
  allies, who can then move more freely through the battlefield to help set up
  flanking opportunities.
Morale: >-
  Sursha is loyal to her crew and fights to the death defending them. If her
  ship is in peril of sinking, she ensures her crew abandons ship before she
  does so herself.
