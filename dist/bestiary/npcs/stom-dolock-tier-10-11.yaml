SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Possession (Su)
    description: >-
      Nicoroux's fell influence grants Stom incredible powers, but leaves him
      susceptible to several magical effects. Protection from evil and
      protection from law affect Stom as if he were an evil creature, and he may
      not touch any creature benefiting from either spell. Additionally,
      Nicoroux's control is instantly ended with a successful dispel evil or
      dispel law spell delivered as a touch attack.
  - name: Weapon Familiarity (Ex)
    description: >-
      By virtue of his years using the tool, Stom may wield his mining pick in
      combat as a heavy pick without taking an improvised weapon penalty.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Stom has already cast bear's endurance, bull's strength, instant armor, and
  magic vestment for his earlier fight with the other survivors, and has also
  taken a small amount of damage, reducing him to 153 hit points. If the PCs are
  especially loud or noisy returning from the basement, he prepares by casting
  righteous might on himself and activates his iron skin revelation. (All of
  these spells and the revelation are included in his stats).
DuringCombat: >-
  Stom uses his war sight revelation to roll initiative three times and take the
  best result, then casts blade barrier to surround the PCs in a circle of
  steel. Afterward, he casts animate object to animate three Medium-sized
  statues of Aroden to harry any remaining PCs, using the free time it buys him
  to cast divine power. He then unleashes unholy blight and flame strike on
  clustered groups of PCs. If opponents close to melee, he switches to slay
  living. If reduced below half his normal hit points, he uses a swift action
  each round to cast a cure spell using his combat healer revelation.
Morale: >-
  If reduced below 20 hit points, Stom collapses as Nicoroux's hold over him
  slips. He returns to his former neutral alignment and begs for leniency.
Gear: miner's pick
