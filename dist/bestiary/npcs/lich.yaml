SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60 foot radius that look at a lich must
      succeed on a Will save or become frightened. Creatures with 5 HD or more
      must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for a number of rounds equal to
      the lich's Hit Dice. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected
      again by the same lich's fear aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting
      fear effect.
  - name: Paralyzing Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      Any living creature a lich hits with its touch attack must succeed on a
      Fortitude save or be permanently paralyzed. Remove paralysis or any spell
      that can remove a curse can free the victim (with a DC equal to the lich's
      save DC). The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a lich seems
      dead, though a DC 20 Perception check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals that
      the victim is still alive.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      When a lich is destroyed, its phylactery (which is generally hidden by the
      lich in a safe place far from where it chooses to dwell) immediately
      begins to rebuild the undead spellcaster's body nearby. This process takes
      1d10 days-if the body is destroyed before that time passes, the phylactery
      merely starts the process anew. After this time passes, the lich wakens
      fully healed (albeit without any gear it left behind on its old body),
      usually with a burning need for revenge against those who previously
      destroyed it. The most common form of phylactery is a sealed metal box
      containing strips of parchment on which magical phrases have been
      transcribed. The box is Tiny and has 40 hit points, hardness 20, and a
      break DC of 40. Other forms of phylacteries can exist, such as rings,
      amulets, or similar items.
