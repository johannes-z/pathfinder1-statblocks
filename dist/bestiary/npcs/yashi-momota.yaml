SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ki Pool (Su)
    description: >-
      By spending 1 point from his ki pool, Momota can make one additional
      attack at his highest attack bonus, but he can only do so when making a
      full attack. In addition, he can spend 1 point to increase his speed by 20
      feet for 1 round. Finally, Momota can spend 1 point from his ki pool to
      give himself a +4 insight bonus on Steath checks for 1 round. Each of
      these powers is activated as a swift action. As long as he has at least 1
      point in his ki pool, Momota treats any Acrobatics check made to jump as
      if he had a running start.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Momota climbs one of the temple's walls and prepares a shuriken with his dose
  of drow poison. Once positioned, he uses Stealth to hide himself from
  immediate notice.
DuringCombat: >-
  Momota begins by spending a ki point to make a second shuriken attack, hoping
  to get off two sneak attacks and deliver his dose of drow poison before the
  PCs know what hit them. After such an attack, he drinks his potion of vanish
  to become invisible for 1 round and drops to the ground, where he fights with
  his siangham.
Morale: >-
  Momota is loyal to the Aspis Consortium only so long as his superiors in the
  Golden League have a means of hearing of this disloyalty. He surrenders if
  Leska is killed, but otherwise fights to the death.
Gear: potion of blur, potion of vanish*, drow poison (1 dose), smokesticks (3)
