SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When a dark creeper is slain, its body combusts in a flash of bright white
      light, leaving its gear in a heap on the ground. All creatures within a
      10-foot burst must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d6
      rounds. Other dark creepers within 10 feet are automatically blinded for
      at least 1 round, due to their light blindness. The save is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      Dark creepers are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally
      poisoning themselves. Dark creepers favor a foul-smelling black paste
      distilled from certain deep-underground fungi, known as black
      smear-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2
      Str; cure 1 save.
  - name: Rag Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dark creeper's multiple layers of filthy rags function as leather armor
      when worn by one of their kind.
  - name: See in Darkness (Su)
    description: >-
      A dark creeper can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including that
      created by deeper darkness.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: The dark creepers initiate combat by casting darkness.
DuringCombat: >-
  The dark creepers use detect magic to determine which character is the
  greatest threat, attacking that character first. They concentrate attacks on
  single characters, trying to flank and assassinate them. Once they drop an
  opponent, they move to the next.
Morale: The creepers attempt to flee if reduced to 4 hit points or fewer.
Gear: rag armor, masterwork dagger, black poison (3 doses)
