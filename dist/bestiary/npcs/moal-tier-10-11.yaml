SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Expert Climber (Ex)
    description: >-
      A morlock can cling to cave walls and even ceilings as long as the surface
      has hand and footholds. In effect, a morlock is treated as constantly
      being under a nonmagical version of the spell spider climb, save that she
      cannot cling to smooth surfaces. This ability doubles the normal +8 racial
      bonus to Climb checks normally afforded creatures with a climb speed to a
      +16 racial bonus.
  - name: Leap Attack (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a morlock may use a single attack during a jump. It
      can make this attack at any point along the course of the leap-the start,
      the end, or while in midair. While jumping, a morlock does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity for leaving a threatened square.
  - name: Swarming (Ex)
    description: >-
      Morlocks dwell and fight in cramped quarters every day of their lives, and
      as such are quite adept at swarming foes. Up to two morlocks can share the
      same square at the same time. If two morlocks in the same square attack
      the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that foe as if they were
      in two opposite squares.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Mo'al leaps from atop the obelisk to area 4e once she sees the PCs. She waits
  for them to climb the tower to the third level, buffing herself with aid,
  bull's strength, magic vestment, enlarge person, and freedom of movement as
  the PCs face her caryatid column guardians below.
DuringCombat: >-
  After casting her buff spells, Mo'al attempts to use her flame strike, bestow
  curse and cause fear spells on well-armored foes. If possible, Mo'al prefers
  to use her spells, spell-like abilities, and special attacks, but if she needs
  to, she uses her leap attack to harry her foes. The citadel's hollow interior
  should allow Mo'al plenty of opportunities to use these hit-and- run tactics.
Morale: Mo'al fanatically fights to the death.
Gear: wand of cure moderate wounds (50 charges)
