BeforeCombat: >-
  Before confronting opponents, Meret-Hetef casts cat's grace and invisibility
  (from her wand) on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Meret-Hetef uses her bardic performance to inspire courage in her minions,
  then casts summon monster II to conjure 1d3 fiendish dogs. On subsequent
  rounds, she remains invisible and summons more allies, using her lesser book
  of extended summoning if necessary. Only if her location is discovered does
  Meret-Hetef reveal herself, casting offensive spells such as sound burst or
  hideous laughter.
Morale: >-
  Meret-Hetef is terribly sensible. If all of her minions are killed or captured
  or she is reduced below 20 hit points, she retreats, using her scroll of
  expeditious retreat if possible. If unable to flee, Meret-Hetef fights to the
  death.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds, scroll of expeditious retreat, wand of
  invisibility (11 charges)
