Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Jharnavar casts mage armor on his eidolon Righteousness every day. If he
  suspects combat is imminent (such as if he hears the sounds of combat
  elsewhere in the Ducotrion), Jharnavar casts barkskin, fly, stoneskin, and
  true seeing on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jharnavar stays behind Righteousness but remains within the eidolon's reach to
  grant Righteousness the benefits of his greater shield ally ability. Jharnavar
  casts greater heroism and haste at the beginning of combat, then supports his
  eidolon with spells like baleful polymorph, hold monster, and hungry pit. He
  uses Quicken Spell to swiftly cast tactically useful spells (such as blur,
  glitterdust, and warding weapon, as well as bull's strength cast on
  Righteousness). If Righteousness is slain, Jharnavar casts summon monster IX
  to summon an astral deva or trumpet archon to replace the eidolon.
Morale: >-
  If Jharnavar is badly wounded, he uses his merge forms ability. As the highest
  representative of the law in Westcrown, Duxotar Jharnavar does not flee or
  surrender to criminals, assassins, or agents of Thrune.
Gear: potions of cure serious wounds (3)
