DuringCombat: >-
  Happs is overconfident and enjoys boasting during battle, calling out attacks
  and hollow threats that he's ill-equipped to carry out. As a battle
  progresses, if his insults and threats continue to fail, he grows increasingly
  grim and quiet. He prefers to fight with his longbow, letting his men take the
  risks in melee. He uses his alchemist's fire against PCs in a tight group, or
  perhaps as a distraction against the stables to draw the PCs out of combat and
  into firefighting or controlling panicked horses.
Morale: >-
  Happs knows that his position as second-in-command is tenuous at best and
  won't back down from a fight in front of his men&#8211;as long as one other
  bandit can see him, he fights to the death. If all other bandits are slain,
  Happs flees or surrenders immediately if he's taken any damage (or immediately
  upon suffering any damage otherwise).

  leather armor, dagger, composite longbow (+2 Str) with 20 arrows, 2 days of
