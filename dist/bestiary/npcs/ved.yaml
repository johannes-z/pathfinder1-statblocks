      The veds are currently drunk and are considered to be sickened (this is
      already incorporated into the statistics above).
  - name: Gale Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Every 1d4 rounds as a full-round action, a ved can draw in a mighty breath
      and expel it outward in a 30-foot cone. Targets within 10 feet of the
      origin of this cone must succeed at a DC 18 Strength check or be knocked
      prone. Those who succeed at the check or are standing farther away from
      the ved treat the effects of the gale breath as a gust of wind spell.
