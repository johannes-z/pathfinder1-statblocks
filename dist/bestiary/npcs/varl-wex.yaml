BeforeCombat: >-
  Wex drinks a potion of shield of faith if he can before entering combat; if he
  doesn't have this chance, drinking the potion is his first action in battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  If a PC wields or holds Balgorrah at the start of a fight, the blade attempts
  to take control of the PC who holds it, and if successful, forces the PC to
  give the blade to Wex. Until he recovers the magical kukri, Wex attacks with
  his dagger, focusing his attacks on the PC who carries the knife (making
  disarm attempts if appropriate). When armed with Balgorrah, Wex focuses his
  attacks on the most wounded foe&#8211;if someone is dropped to negative hit
  points, the magic blade immediately uses death knell on the dying victim in an
  attempt to bolster Wex. Of course, Wex's blows are much  deadlier if he can
  make sneak attacks, but on his own against a group, he likely has very few
  opportunities to do so. If reduced to fewer than 45 hit points, he flees,
  hoping to move elsewhere in the complex or even out a window and up a wall so
  he can hide and then strike from hiding to gain a sneak attack opportunity.
  Otherwise, he uses feint every other round to attempt to set up a sneak attack
  opportunity with his next attack.
Morale: Varl Wex fights to the death.
