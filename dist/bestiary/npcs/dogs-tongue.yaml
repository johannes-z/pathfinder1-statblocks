SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Boot Stomp (Ex)
    description: >-
      A redcap wears heavy iron boots with spiked soles that it uses to deadly
      effect in combat. These boots give the redcap a kick attack that it can
      make as a secondary attack, either as part of a full attack action or as
      part of its movement just as if it had the Spring Attack feat.
  - name: Heavy Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      A redcap's powerful hands and arms allow it to wield Medium weapons
      without penalty.
  - name: Irreligious (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bitter and blasphemous, a redcap cannot stand the symbols of goodaligned
      religions. If a foe spends a standard action presenting such a holy
      symbol, any redcap that can see that character must make a DC 15 Will save
      or become frightened for 1 minute and attempt to flee. A redcap who
      successfully saves merely becomes shaken for 1 minute.
  - name: Red Cap (Su)
    description: >-
      A redcap wears a tiny, shapeless woolen hat, dyed over and over with the
      blood of its victims. While wearing this cap, a redcap gains a +4 bonus on
      damage rolls and fast healing 3. These benefits are lost if the cap is
      removed or destroyed, and caps are not transferable, even between redcaps.
      A redcap can create a new cap to replace a lost cap with 10 minutes of
      work, although until the redcap takes a standard action to dip the cap in
      the blood of a foe the redcap helped to kill, it does not grant its
      bonuses.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Dog's Tongue moves in to strike the closest thief in melee, shrieking
  obscenities and challenges in high-pitched Aklo and clomping loudly across
  rooftops with his iron boots until all the thieves are slain, taking time to
  dip his red cap in the blood of anyone he helps to murder.
Morale: >-
  Dog's Tongue flees back to the Mother of Flies if brought below 15 hit points
  or if the PCs attack him.
