BeforeCombat: >-
  If the grunts in the warehouse are given time to prepare for a fight against
  intruders, they get into tactical positions around the warehouse, hiding
  around corners and using their thunderstones and smokesticks to disorient
  opponents.
DuringCombat: >-
  In addition to flanking and making sneak attacks whenever possible, the guards
  use the boxes of cargo as weapons, pushing them onto unsuspecting PCs from the
  other side of the makeshift barriers (see above).
Morale: >-
  Being the lowliest of Alejia's crew members, the warehouse grunts have no wish
  to die for their cause, and each grunt surrenders when brought to 3 hit points
  or fewer, or when the last one standing is brought to fewer than 5 hit points.
Gear: smokestick, tanglefoot bag, thunderstone
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork studded leather, light crossbow with 10 bolts, cutlass, thieves'
  tools, 35 gp
