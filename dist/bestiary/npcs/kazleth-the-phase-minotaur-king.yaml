SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ethereal Ambush (Ex)
    description: >-
      A phase creature that attacks foes on the Material Plane in a surprise
      round can take a full round of actions if it begins the combat by phasing
      into the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane.
  - name: Ethereal Jaunt (Su)
    description: >-
      A phase creature can shift from the Ethereal to the Material Plane as a
      free action, and shift back again as a move action (or during a move
      action). The ability is otherwise identical with ethereal jaunt (caster
      level 15th).
  - name: Natural Cunning (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although minotaurs are not especially intelligent, they possess innate
      cunning and logical ability. This gives them immunity to maze spells and
      prevents them from ever becoming lost. Further, they are never caught
      flat-footed.
