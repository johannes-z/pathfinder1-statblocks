SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      If slain, Khorramzadeh explodes in a blast of black fire that deals 100
      points of damage (half fire, half unholy damage) to anything within 100
      feet (Reflex DC 26 half). A creature that fails its Reflex save against
      this effect also gains 1d4 negative levels. A successful DC 26 Fortitude
      save 24 hours later is needed to remove these negative levels. The save
      DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Deflective Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      Khorramzadeh's natural armor is infused with potent energies that allow it
      to apply its full bonus to his touch Armor Class.
  - name: Endure Light (Ex)
    description: >-
      Khorramzadeh does not possess the normal aversion to light shared by most
      nightshades.
  - name: Impaling Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      On a critical hit with his claw against a Large or smaller creature,
      Khorramzadeh impales the victim. This allows the mythic nightwalker to
      make a grapple check as a free action as if he possessed the grab special
      attack. If he establishes a grapple in this way, Khorramzadeh does not
      gain the grappled condition himself.
  - name: Penetrating Fear (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any fear effect generated by Khorramzadeh can affect creatures normally
      immune to fear effects, although such creatures do gain a +4 bonus on any
      saving throws made against such effects.
  - name: Powerful Blows (Ex)
    description: >-
      Damage from Khorramzadeh's claw attacks is always modified by 1-1/2 times
      his Strength modifier.
DuringCombat: >-
  Khorramzadeh remains near Areelu's side, using his spell-like abilities at
  range to attack the PCs. He moves to engage any PCs who approach too close to
  Areelu in melee, hoping to prevent them from engaging the witch in combat.
Morale: The former balor fights to the death.
