SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Silver Eye (Su)
    description: >-
      Bellinia's blessed silver eye gives her all-around vision, see in
      darkness, constant see invisibility, and immunity to blindness. The eye is
      a blessing from Iomedae herself, not a magic item, and if Bellinia dies or
      the eye is removed from her body, the eye immediately vanishes in a flash
      of silver light.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Bellinia casts greater magic weapon on her longsword and magic vestment on her
  armor and shield every day.
DuringCombat: >-
  Bellinia casts holy aura and quickened divine power on the first round of
  combat. On subsequent rounds, she activates her aura of heroism and attempts
  to efficiently overcome opponents one at  a time with destruction, holy word,
  and power word kill, supplemented with additional quickened spells.
Morale: >-
  As the Dorjanala is her ancestral home and the center of her faith in
  Westcrown, Bellinia refuses to flee or submit to evil foes. She thus fights to
  the death.
