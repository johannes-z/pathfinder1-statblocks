SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Elemental Body (Ex)
    description: >-
      Each time Cindermaw is exposed to a bleed, precision damage, poison,
      paralysis, seep, or stunning effect, it has a 25% chance to avoid that
      effect.
  - name: Fire Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Cindermaw can breathe out a 30-foot cone of fire once every 1d4 rounds,
      dealing 8d6 points of fire damage to all in the area of effect. A
      successful DC 26 Reflex saving throw halves this damage. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Fire Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      Cindermaw regains 1 hit point for each full round it remains in contact
      with a fire at least one size category smaller than itself. When struck by
      a magical fire effect, Cindermaw regains 1 hit point for every 10 points
      of damage that the fire effect would otherwise deal.
  - name: Firewalk (Su)
    description: >-
      Cindermaw can climb an object on fire as though it had a climb speed of 30
      feet. It can also fly at this speed with perfect maneuverability as long
      as it remains in contact with fire, and can walk on flames at its highest
      speed as per air walk.
  - name: Heat (Su)
    description: Each of Cindermaw's attacks deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage.
DuringCombat: >-
  When Cindermaw tires of toying with the PCs, it burrows up directly in their
  midst. Unfortunately, Cindermaw has recently fed. On the first round of
  combat, it breathes fire on the most densely packed group of PCs. It then
  attacks with its bite and sting on the second round of combat. It does not try
  to swallow foes whole immediately-instead, it bites and moves on. Once the PCs
  deal more than 100 points of damage to the worm (or once it has breathed fire
  twice), it abandons this tactic and begins attempting to swallow victims.
  Alternatively, a character can tempt the worm into swallowing her by
  attempting a Bluff check to appear particularly appetizing and worth the risk
  of a stomach ache; she takes a -10 penalty on the check due to the bluff's
  far-fetched believability. Cindermaw can oppose this check with a Sense Motive
  check.
Morale: >-
  Cindermaw retreats if it takes more than 80 points of damage in all from cold
  attacks, or as soon as it is reduced to fewer than 50 hit points.
