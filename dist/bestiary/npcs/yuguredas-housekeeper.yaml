  - name: Separate (Su)
    description: >-
      During the day, a manananggal looks like a living human woman. She does
      not detect as undead during the day, but is still an undead creature. At
      night, her upper torso rips away (this is a full-round action that occurs
      at sunset), leaving her lower torso behind. Her lower torso is helpless,
      but her upper torso gains its fly speed and natural attacks at this time.
      The upper and lower portions share the same pool of hit points (despite
      any intervening distance), and if the helpless lower portion is damaged,
      the manananggal is immediately aware of the attack. Since manananggals can
      be destroyed by damage to their lower bodies, they prefer to hide their
      lower torsos when separated. A manananggal must return to its lower torso
      and reattach to it (a full-round action) within the hour before
      sunrise-each round a manananggal remains separated after sunrise, it takes
      1d6 points of damage until it rejoins its lower torso or it crumbles into
      dust.
  - name: Vulnerable to Light Blades (Ex)
    description: >-
      Light blades (such as daggers, kamas, kukris, rapiers, short swords,
      sickles, and starknives) deal double the weapon's base damage on a
      successful hit against a manananggal.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  The manananggals use Stealth to take opponents by surprise, then coordinate
  flanking attacks with one another, using their Flyby Attack feat to avoid
  being pinned down in combat.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, a manananggal withdraws to rejoin the
  lower half of her body.
