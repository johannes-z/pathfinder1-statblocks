BeforeCombat: >-
  The Daughters extract Virml's remaining molars, or scour the taxidermy for
  choice bicuspids.
DuringCombat: >-
  The daughters rush into melee and gang up on the PC with the highest Charisma,
  biting and paralyzing her so they can extract more gifts for Gormandelle. If
  the fairies can't hit their targets in melee, they fly out of melee range and
  cast sleep instead, hoping to make the extractions easier.
Morale: The daughters flee if their "mother," Lady Gormandelle, surrenders or dies.
