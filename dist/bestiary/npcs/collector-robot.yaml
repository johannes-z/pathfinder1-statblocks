SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adaptive Tracker (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a collector robot can adapt itself to any
      environment in which it travels, granting it a +2 bonus on initiative
      checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks
      while in that kind of terrain.
  - name: Integrated Stun Gun (Ex)
    description: >-
      A collector robot has an integrated stun gun slung beneath its body. This
      weapon uses a powerful sonic amplifier to produce powerful low-frequency
      blasts of energy that pummel targets. This weapon has a range increment of
      20 feet, and it deals 1d8 points of nonlethal damage. On a critical hit,
      the robot can attempt a free trip combat maneuver (CMB +12) against the
      target, which does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
  - name: Integrated Tracking (Ex)
    description: >-
      A collector robot has integrated systems that allow it to tag and track
      creatures. As a full- round action, a collector robot can implant a
      tracker chipTG into the body of a target that it is grappling or a
      helpless target. Once implanted, the tracker chip is activated and the
      collector robot's chipfinder can detect the presence of the implanted
      tracker chip within 1 mile. It uses a signal to locate the tracker chips,
      and this signal can be blocked by 1 foot of metal, 5 feet of stone, or 20
      feet of organic matter. A tracker chip can be removed with a sharp tool.
      Doing so deals 1 point of damage. Once an implanted tracker chip is
      removed from the body (or remains in a body after it dies) it retains
      enough energy to continue to be detected by the collector robot's sensors
      for 1 week.
  - name: Reactive Gyros (Ex)
    description: >-
      The rotors that grant a collector robot flight also provide quick
      reactions to threats and external stimuli, granting it a +3 racial bonus
      on Reflex saves.
