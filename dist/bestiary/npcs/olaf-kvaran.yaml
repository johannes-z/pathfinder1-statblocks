Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Olaf is aware of the PCs' approach, he casts shield of faith and drinks his
  potion of fly (the former has already been included in his statistics).
DuringCombat: >-
  Olaf begins combat by casting cause fear on the closest PC, then enters rage
  as a free action. He fights recklessly to ensure the Pathfinders don't foil
  his plan, since that would usher in the end of the world. When reduced to
  fewer than half his total hit points, he uses his moment of clarity rage power
  to cast cure light wounds, relying on his Diehard feat to keep him up should
  the loss of his raging Constitution bonus reduce him to 0 or fewer hit points
  while casting the spell.
Morale: >-
  Olaf is insane with delusions of his own importance and the necessity of
  protecting Michellia, and he fights to the death to prevent her rescue.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of fly, potion of protection from
  arrows
OtherGear: mwk hide armor, +1 greataxe, wooden holy symbol of Groetus
