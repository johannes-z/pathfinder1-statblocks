DuringCombat: >-
  Idorii skillfully wields her khopesh and kukri simultaneously, focusing on one
  opponent at a time. If she can trip her adversary, she attempts to do so with
  her khopesh, following up with a strike from her kukri to take advantage of
  her prone opponent. Idorii seldom goes for the kill if an enemy is rendered
  unconscious.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 5 hit points or fewer, Idorii starts looking to make a deal if
  her enemy seems at all reasonable.
Gear: acid, alchemist's fire (2)

  +1 leather armor, chakramsUE (3), kukri, mwk khopeshUE, backpack, mwk thieves'
