BeforeCombat: >-
  When the PCs first arrive, Gossamere forces Devarre to protect himself with
  barkskin.
DuringCombat: >-
  The will-o'-wisp casts heat metal, then attacks with Devarre's +1 frost
  scimitar; it doesn't realize the cold of the weapon nullifies some of the fire
  damage from the heat metal spell. During each round of battle, Devarre fights
  against Gossamere's compulsions, but cannot break free unless the PCs drive it
  from his body. Because of this mental battle, the PCs can continue to make DC
  15 Sense Motive checks to determine something odd about his behavior. Any
  attack against Devarre deals half damage to Gossamere as well.
Morale: >-
  If Gossamere is reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, the will-o'-wisp abandons
  the druid's body and tries to flee.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of cure serious wounds, potion of
  lesser restoration (2)
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork ironwood splint mail, +1 heavy wooden shield, +1 frost scimitar,
  sling and 20 bullets, 93 gp.
