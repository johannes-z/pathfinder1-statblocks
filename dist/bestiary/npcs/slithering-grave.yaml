    description: >-
      This ability functions as a slithering pit's pit ability with the
      following exceptions. The pit created is 10 feet in diameter and is 40
      feet deep (dealing 4d6 falling damage), and the Reflex save to avoid
      falling into the pit increases to DC 23. The pit can hold one Large
      creature, four Medium creatures, or eight Small creatures. The Climb check
      to climb out of a slithering grave increases to DC 24. The slithering
      grave does not deal acid damage to trapped creatures; instead it deals
      1d6+7 bludgeoning and slashing damage to each trapped creature each round
      as undead bodies reach out of the walls to claw at any creatures inside
      the pit. The walls have an AC of 11 and hardness 10.
