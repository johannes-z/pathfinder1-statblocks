BeforeCombat: If it expects combat, the Saffron Prince casts displacement on itself.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Saffron Prince uses its hypnotic stare and spells to disable dangerous
  foes before turning its deadly natural attacks against vulnerable enemies.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 40 or fewer hit points, the Saffron Prince attempts to escape
