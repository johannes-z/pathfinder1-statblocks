SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures affected by the Nightmare Rook's fear aura become shaken the
      first time they fail their save and cower in fear each round they fail a
      save thereafter. Once a creature succeeds on a saving throw against this
      effect, it is immune to the effect for 24 hours.
  - name: Living Nightmares (Su)
    description: >-
      The Nightmare Rook has the ability to inflict living nightmares on any
      non-native of the First World who sleeps in Thousandbreaths, at the rate
      of one nightmare per person per night. A living nightmare functions as
      detailed on page 15-this ability cannot be used in combat.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  The Nightmare Rook uses Flyby Attack and Vital Strike bite attacks to
  devastating effect, relying on its fear aura and frightful presence to scatter
  its foes. If this tactic works, it uses Snatch to grab a PC and then flies off
  with its foe. If the Nightmare Rook makes it over the tree line, it is
  effectively out of reach of other players and free to travel to any other
  glade it wishes to drop its stolen PC-the bird has a particular fondness for
  dropping prey into the Mire (area G) or the Fruiting Orchard (area E). It
  can't drop a PC into the deep woods, as the nature of Thousandbreaths prevents
  such a stranding, and if a PC manages to wrestle out of the Rook's clutches
  while hanging over the vast green forest below, she falls a distance of well
  over 200 feet to land at the edge of the glade from which she most recently
  left. If the Rook isn't able to separate the PCs, it lands and makes full
  attacks until reduced to 100 hit points or less, at which point it flies back
  up to its spire to heal and glare malevolently at the PCs.
Morale: >-
  If confronted at the top of its perch (a circular area 90 feet in diameter),
  the Nightmare Rook fights to the death.
