SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoid creature that is slain by a vrykolakas's natural attacks
      becomes a vrykolakas itself in 1d4 days if not blessed and properly
      buried. A blessing might entail either the spell bless or a more mundane
      consecration. A vrykolakas's spawn are free-willed and wild, typically
      remembering nothing of their moment of death and caring nothing for the
      vrykolakas that killed them. They do not possess any of the abilities they
      had in life.
  - name: Feral Possession (Ex)
    description: >-
      Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, a vrykolakas's spirit attempts to
      possess any animal within 100 feet. This ability is similar to the spell
      magic jar, but does not require a receptacle and has a duration equal to 1
      hour for every Hit Die the vrykolakas possesses. The target must make a DC
      21 Will save or be possessed. If the possession fails, the vrykolakas
      immediately dies. If the possession succeeds, the animal immediately
      retreats to the vrykolakas's grave, where it attempts to bury itself in
      the earth. If left uninterrupted for 1d4 days, the animal transforms into
      a new vrykolakas with all the same statistics as the original. If
      discovered and slain during this time, both the animal and the vrykolakas
      spirit are destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Pestilent Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures that come within 5 feet of a vrykolakas must save to resist
      contracting bubonic plague. Any creature that successfully saves against a
      vrykolakas's pestilent aura cannot be affected by the aura of that same
      vrykolakas for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. Bubonic Plague:
      Aura-inhaled; save Fort DC 21; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4
      Str damage and 1 Cha damage and target is fatigued; cure 2 consecutive
      saves.
DuringCombat: >-
  The vrykolakas attempts to charm any animal companions the PCs might have with
  them, then uses fear to try to scatter foes so it can focus its attacks on a
  single target (preferably a divine spellcaster).
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 0 hit points, the vrykolakas attempts to possess a nearby frog
  (use stats for a toad&#8211;Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 133). The frog has a Will
  save of +1; if it fails to resist the possession attempt, the creature tries
  to stealthily return to the vrykolakas's den to recover&#8211;when it awakens,
  it emerges from its grave and attempts to seek out the PCs for revenge.
