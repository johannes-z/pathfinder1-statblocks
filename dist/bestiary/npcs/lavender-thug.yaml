DuringCombat: >-
  Lavender thugs don't hold back if a fight starts-they use lethal force and
  plan on pleading self-defense if it comes to it later. Fond of using their
  hand crossbows and Deadly Aim on foes already in melee combat, a Lavender thug
  is quick to switch to the rapier as needed. In Vendra's presence, they
  dutifully serve as bodyguards and work to keep themselves between the PCs and
  the woman who pays them.
Morale: >-
  A Lavender thug drops his weapon and flees into the city if reduced to 6 hit
  points or fewer. He doesn't return to Vendra's side.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds
OtherGear: >-
  +1 chain shirt, light steel shield, mwk hand crossbow (10 bolts), mwk rapier,
  12 gp
