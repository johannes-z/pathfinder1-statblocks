DuringCombat: >-
  Rexus avoids melee combat, using color spray to delay pursuit or to help
  control the tide of battle. In a battle, Rexus uses the aid another action to
  help an ally's AC or takes shots with acid splash. He saves his scroll of
  glitterdust for an emergency against a foe too powerful to affect with color
  spray, and prefers to administer his potions of cure light wounds to stronger
  allies.
Morale: >-
  Rexus flees combat at the first opportunity if he's alone, but bravely stands
  by the side of any ally in a fight, fighting to the death if needed to defend
  his friends.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds (3), scroll of glitterdust
