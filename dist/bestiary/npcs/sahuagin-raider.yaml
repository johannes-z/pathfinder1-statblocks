DuringCombat: >-
  The raiders swim directly at the PCs to engage them in combat, using their
  superior swim speeds to close the distance. Two concentrate their attacks on
  the PC who looks the brawniest, while the third watches for spellcasters and
  then targets those PCs.
Morale: If two of the raiders are killed, the third tries to swim away and escape.
