    description: >-
      Vortch is both blind and deaf, but his ability to use deathwatch helps to
      lessen the penalties he takes from this condition. These penalties are
      included as appropriate in the stats above, including a -4 penalty to
      initiative, a -4 penalty on opposed Perception checks, a -4 penalty on
      Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks, and his reduced speed (if he
      wants to move at 30 ft., he must make a DC 10 Acrobatics check or fall
      prone).
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Vortch always uses Power Attack-these modifiers are included in his stats
  above. Although he can pinpoint targets with his deathwatch ability, he still
  suffers a 50% miss chance for blindness (a disadvantage his Blind- Fight feat
  helps lessen).
Morale: >-
  Vortch fights to the death as long as he can sense living creatures in range
  of his deathwatch ability; otherwise, he staggers back to this room, relying
  upon his memories to retrace his route.
