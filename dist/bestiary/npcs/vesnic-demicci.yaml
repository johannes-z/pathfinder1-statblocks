SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mastermind (Su)
    description: >-
      Vesnic can control a number of spawn totaling four times his Hit Dice,
      while also maintaining telepathic contact with them. He may exercise or
      end his use of this ability as a standard action and may maintain his
      telepathic connection with his spawn for as long as he wishes. He may only
      use this ability with one spawn at a time. Vesnic and his vampire spawn
      must be on the same plane for this ability to function. While using this
      ability, he enters a catatonic state similar to his daily rest and is
      treated as helpless, though he is alerted to any jarring noises, the
      presence of any visible creature within 5 feet, or any damage that befalls
      his body.
