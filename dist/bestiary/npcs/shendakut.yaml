BeforeCombat: >-
  When the stone block in area A9 begins to descend, Shendakut casts bull's
  strength on himself in case the PCs fail to solve his riddle or decide to
  fight.
DuringCombat: >-
  Shendakut defends himself, or attacks first if he believes the PCs are
  stalling. He first uses greater command to make them flee or fall. If multiple
  PCs are in close proximity, he casts blade barrier in a ring shape around them
  so he can fly in from above, pluck them up, and drop them down the Windswept
  Shaft (area A4). Shendakut uses his most harmful spells on spellcasters and
  anyone capable of flight, so he can preserve his advantage against foes
  restricted to the ground.
Morale: >-
  Bound to service for eternity and ready to be destroyed to end his obligation
  to Hakotep, Shendakut fights to the death, as do the lightning elementals
  accompanying him.
Gear: scroll of storm of vengeance, flasks of unholy water (5)

  belt of giant strength +4, headband of alluring charisma +4, ring of
  protection +2, gold unholy symbol of Set (worth 50 gp), eye ointment (worth
