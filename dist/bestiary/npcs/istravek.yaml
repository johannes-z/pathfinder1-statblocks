SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Arcane Plates (Su)
    description: >-
      While wearing his golden plating, Istravek's natural attacks count as
      magic for the purpose of bypassing DR and striking incorporeal creatures.
      Istravek treats his sorcerer level as 2 higher for the purposes of
      determining spells per day, spells known, and effective level of
      spellcasting. Once per week, he can replace one of his spells known with
      any other spell on the sorcerer spell list of the same level. The plating
      also grants him Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration as bonus
      feats. It crumbles to dust if removed.
  - name: Permanent Spells (Sp)
    description: >-
      Istravek has used permanency to gain the effects of arcane sight and
      resistance.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: Istravek casts both protection from good and true seeing.
DuringCombat: >-
  Istravek keeps to higher ground as best as he can. He uses spells like acid
  fog and black tentacles to block the pyramid's exit, intent on keeping his
  foes inside, then casts baleful polymorph and horrid wilting on them. Istravek
  resorts to physical combat only if he has no other way to prevent a foe from
  slipping out of the pyramid.
Morale: Istravek fights until destroyed.
