BeforeCombat: Consumes potion of invisibility and hides in area L13.
DuringCombat: >-
  1: PCs make DC 20 Perception check to notice area L13 doors open. Invisible
  archers take position. Four take position on west balcony while the other four
  run to their position near the top of the stairs on the north side of the room
  to make a screen for the Raven's escape. 2: Four archers fire two flaming
  burst arrows and two regular arrows at PCs. All three attacks are made at
  &#8211;2. This first attack also benefits from the Vital Strike feat, which
  means its damage dice are rolled twice on a successful hit. The other four
  fire at Osprey or NPC servants. 3: Archers concentrate their fire on the PCs
  that are the most easy to hit. 4: Repeat. 5: Repeat, though in this round the
  archers run out of their flaming burst arrows.
Morale: >-
  The scallies flee when the fight clearly turns against them, but under no
  circumstances do they abandon the Red Raven to his fate.
Gear: >-
  +1 leather armor, +1 shortbow, masterwork short sword, potion of invisibility
  (consumed prior to battle), 8 +1 flaming burst arrows.
