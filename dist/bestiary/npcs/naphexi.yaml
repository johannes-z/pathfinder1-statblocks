DuringCombat: >-
  Naphexi is as cruel as she is lazy, and prefers to kill with as little effort
  as possible on her part. She loves holding victims helpless with hold monster
  or black tentacles, and then subjecting them to cloudkill or her breath
  weapon's acid pool. If forced to engage, she alternates between using Flyby
  Attack with her bite and crashing among her foes to deliver full attacks.
Morale: >-
  Naphexi is a fanatic, but not eager to sacrifice the body she has just
  finished transmuting into a beautiful reflection of her god. She attempts to
  flee to the Pestilent Palace if reduced below 50 hit points, and harries the
  PCs once they enter the Deeper Reaches. She does not retreat a second time,
  however.
