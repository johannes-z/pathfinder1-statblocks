BeforeCombat: >-
  As the druids see the keelboat approaching, they cast barkskin and water
  breathing.
DuringCombat: >-
  The druids first cast rain of frogs and then enter melee with their scimitars,
  using wild shape to cross over to the Sellen Starling if necessary. If
  possible, they cast warp wood on critical components of the keelboat to damage
  it or upon enemies' weapons to disable them. The druids attack ranged
  opponents with call lightning or produce flame. If they're close enough  to
  the PCs, the druids use hydraulic push to attempt to bull rush them into the
  water where they can be more easily drowned.
Morale: >-
  Desperate for sacrifices to Hanspur, these foes fight to the death. However,
  when only one druid remains, that druid casts fog cloud and attempts to flee.
