SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Arcane Reinforcement (Ex)
    description: >-
      A wyrwood soldier is made from magically grown material that grants it
      several benefits. The wyrwood gains fast healing 5 and fire resistance 10.
      It can see through all types of fog and smoke, and it is treated as two
      size categories larger when determining bonus hit points based on its
      size.
  - name: Armored Defender (Ex)
    description: >-
      An armored wyrwood soldier can use its armor to gain additional defensive
      abilities. A wyrwood soldier wearing medium or heavy armor gains DR 2/-
      and a +2 insight bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like
      abilities.
DuringCombat: >-
  A wyrwood soldier initially focuses on confronting melee combatants. It does
  its best to attack alongside another wyrwood soldier to take advantage of its
  Shield Wall feat. It uses its shield bash to push foes away before
  repositioning in combat to avoid attacks of opportunity. If a spellcaster
  targets a soldier with a spell that damages it or that it fails a saving throw
  against, the soldier changes its focus to attack the spellcaster instead.
Morale: A wyrwood soldier fights until destroyed.
