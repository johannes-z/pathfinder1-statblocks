    description: >-
      A dust digger can burrow into sand, loose soil, or dirt to lie in ambush
      just under the surface. When it feels (via tremorsense) prey walk into a
      square it threatens, it can deflate its body as an immediate action,
      causing the sand and other loose soil above to shift and slide. All
      creatures who were standing in the dust digger's reach must make a DC 19
      Reflex save or become entangled as long as they remain in the dust
      digger's reach. All creatures who were standing at least partially in the
      dust digger's actual space must make a DC 19 Reflex save or become
      entangled and fall prone-if such a creature makes this save, it
      immediately moves to the closest adjacent unoccupied square. If this
      results in more than a 5-foot move, the creature moves that distance and
      then falls prone. The save DC is Strength-based.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The dust diggers lie beneath the sand, waiting to ambush the first living
  thing to pass by.
DuringCombat: >-
  The dust diggers begin combat by activating their sinkhole ability. On all
  subsequent rounds, they attack any creature in reach, hoping to grab and
  swallow as many as they can. If all creatures move out of reach, the dust
  diggers burrow beneath the sand to pursue.
Morale: The dust diggers are hungry and fight to the death.
