  attacks, while maintaining cover if possible, hoping the setting sun and the
  terrain can both protect them from attack and give them the ability to
  surprise their foes.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Aspis agents are under strict orders from Desimire to guard the sphinx's
  entrance; however, when only one guard remains, she attempts to flee back into
  the temple and lure pursuing PCs into area B3, where the graven guardians
  won't attack the Aspis agent but will attack her pursuers.
