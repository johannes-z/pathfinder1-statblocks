SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alchemy (Su)
    description: >-
      You gain a +1 bonus when using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical
      item. You can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect
      magic; you must hold the potion for 1 round to make such a check.
  - name: Extract (Su)
    description: >-
      An extract is a stored alchemist spell. You prepare your spells by mixing
      ingredients into a number of extracts, and then "cast" them by drinking
      the extract, like a potion. You can only create a certain number of
      extracts of each level per day (two 1st-level extracts at character level
      1). When you mix an extract, you infuse the chemicals and reagents in the
      extract with magic siphoned from your own magical aura. An extract
      immediately becomes inert if it leaves your possession, reactivating as
      soon as it returns to your keeping; this means you cannot normally hand
      out your extracts for allies to use. An extract remains potent for 1 day
      before becoming inert, so you must re-prepare your extracts every day.
      Mixing an extract takes 1 minute of work-most alchemists prepare many
      extracts at the start of the day or just before going on an adventure, but
      you can keep some (or even all) of your daily extract slots open so you
      can prepare extracts in the field as needed. You "cast" an extract by
      drinking it, like drinking a potion. Your alchemist level is the caster
      level of the extract. The recipes for extracts you know are kept in your
      formula book.
  - name: Bomb (Su)
    description: >-
      A bomb is an explosive splash weapon created from raw ingredients and
      power from your innate magic. Creating and throwing a bomb is a standard
      action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Thrown bombs have a range
      of 20 feet and use the "Throw Splash Weapon" special attack (see page 202
      of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). Bombs are unstable, and if not used
      in the round they are created, they degrade and become inert. Splash
      damage from an alchemist bomb is always equal to the bomb's minimum damage
      (Reflex half ).
  - name: Mutagen (Su)
    description: >-
      Mutagens are transformative elixirs that you can drink to enhance your
      physical abilities at the cost of your personality. It takes 1 hour to
      brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. You
      can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time&#8211;if you brew a second
      dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. A mutagen that is not in your
      possession becomes inert until you pick it up again; non-alchemists cannot
      use mutagens. When you brew a mutagen, you select one physical ability
      score&#8211;either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. The mutagen gives
      you a +4 alchemical bonus to that ability score and a +2 natural armor
      bonus for 10 minutes, but you take a penalty to a mental ability score for
      that same amount of time (Strength mutagens give you an Intelligence
      penalty, Dexterity mutagens give you a Wisdom penalty, and Constitution
      mutagens give you a Charisma penalty). Drinking a mutagen is a standard
      action. Mutagens do not stack. Whenever you drink a mutagen, the effects
      of any previous mutagen immediately end.
