DuringCombat: >-
  Grimhorn prefers to snipe intruders with his repeating crossbow as quickly as
  possible, using his Deadly Aim and Rapid Shot feats and trusting the Ironfang
  shadows to keep opponents from closing in to melee range with him. He has
  inherited the hobgoblin mistrust of spellcasters and aims for arcane magic
  users first, targeting divine spellcasters second.
Morale: Grimhorn fights to the death to avenge the death of his mentor, Kosseruk.
