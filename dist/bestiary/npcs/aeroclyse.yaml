    description: >-
      In addition to the standard effects for blindness, Aeroclyse cannot use
      his flash of insight ability until his sight is fully restored.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  If enraged after being freed from his bonds, Aeroclyse tries punching and
  grabbing at his enemies, despite the risk of provoking attacks of opportunity.
  If he is friendly with the PCs and is provided a weapon, Aeroclyse trusts
  allies to guide him in combat and direct him to where enemies are. Otherwise,
  he holds his position and defends himself. If Aeroclyse's sight is restored,
  he gladly takes the lead in confronting enemies with or without proper
  weapons.
Morale: Aeroclyse fights to the death.
