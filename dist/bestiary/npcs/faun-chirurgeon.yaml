BeforeCombat: >-
  If the PCs fought the blightguards in area G3, the fauns here are already
  aware of the incoming danger via their blighted unity ability. They drink
  their bear's endurance and thorn body extracts, then prepare an ambush by
  hiding underneath the tables-leaving only the lone, newborn blightguard
  visible to tempt the PCs into the room.
DuringCombat: >-
  The chirurgeons begin by drinking extracts of amplify elixir while they have
  the element of surprise, to enhance their fire breath and curative extracts,
  then attack. They prefer fighting from range and fall back if approached.
Morale: The chirurgeons are fanatics and fight to the death.
