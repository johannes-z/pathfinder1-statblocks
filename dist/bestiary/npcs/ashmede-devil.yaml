DuringCombat: >-
  As the devils move to attack, they speak in unison: "Some secrets are not yet
  ready for the world. And thus, you must die!" They work together to defeat the
  PCs, focusing on one character at a time with two of their number flanking and
  the other two using their spell-like abilities against that target, using
  forcecage against other targets to help them focus on one foe at a time. These
  devils are themselves summoned, and thus cannot use their own summon power.
