  The druid prefers to be in or near a body of water to take advantage of her
  abilities. She opens with her ice storm or fog cloud spells in order to slow
  down her opponents. Afterward, she wild shapes into either a dire bear or a
  giant octopus (depending on the terrain), and alternates rounds of attacks
  with spells such as bear's endurance and barkskin.
