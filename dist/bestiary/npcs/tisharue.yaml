DuringCombat: >-
  Tisharue favors her sword in battle, resorting to her bow only when she can't
  close to melee. She prefers to make Power Attacks, but is otherwise a
  relatively straightforward combatant, stabbing her enemies until they're
  brought down.
Morale: Warden Tisharue fights to the death.
