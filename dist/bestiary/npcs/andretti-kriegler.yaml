BeforeCombat: >-
  When the ritual begins just after midnight, Kriegler casts magic vestment on
  his robes&#8211;at a duration of 5 hours, this effect lasts until just a few
  minutes after the sacrifice is completed.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kriegler casts sanctuary on himself on the first round of combat, then follows
  up by casting summon monster III to conjure 1d3 fiendish giant spiders and
  drinking his potion of shield of faith soon thereafter. He casts wind wall
  between himself and the PCs and then protection from good before he begins
  casting spells like spiritual weapon and hold person. If the PCs can engage
  him in melee before this point, he'll switch to his spells earlier. He resorts
  to his spear only as a last resort, since he's not strong enough for melee
  combat to be a viable tactic. Kriegler uses channeled negative energy whenever
  he's surrounded&#8211;he doesn't particularly care whether this catches some
  of his cultists in the area of effect, but does try to move to exclude them if
  given the chance.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, Kriegler casts gaseous form and flees
  into the surrounding maze to find a hiding spot where he can return to solid
  form and heal before returning to the fight, at which point he fights to the
  death&#8211;but the fight doesn't end with his death. As soon as he's reduced
  to negative hit points or otherwise defeated, the blightspawn growing inside
  of him bursts from his body&#8211;see The Blightspawn Birth below.
Gear: >-
  potions of cure light wounds (3), potions of shield of faith +2 (2), blue
  whinnis poison (3 doses), antitoxin (2)
OtherGear: +1 spear, manor keys, mosquito mask, white robes, silver unholy symbol
