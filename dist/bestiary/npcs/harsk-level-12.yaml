DuringCombat: >-
  Harsk prefers fighting with his crossbow over his battleaxe but isn't afraid
  to get dirty in melee if the situation calls for it. His hatred for giants
  often motivates him to target creatures of that subtype to the exclusion of
  others, and to choose one as his quarry. If tracking a giant, he casts resist
  energy against an energy type that giant uses before engaging.
