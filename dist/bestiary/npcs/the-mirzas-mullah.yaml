  The Mullah casts defensively for as long as he can safely do so, allowing his
  minions to fight melee, and healing them as needed with channeled negative

Morale: >-
  The Mullah can think of no greater honor than being destroyed serving his lord
  and the great div Ahriman. He fights until destroyed.
