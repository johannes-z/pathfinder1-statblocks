    description: >-
      When an alchemist with this discovery drinks his mutagen, he gains two
      claw attacks and a bite attack, as well as a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks
      in addition to the normal effects of the mutagen.
BeforeCombat: >-
  If alerted to the PCs' approach, the assistants drink their mutagens and then
  apply their poison to each claw and their first crossbow bolt (included in
  their stats). If they have additional time, they drink their potions of bear's
  endurance.
DuringCombat: >-
  The assistants try to guard the stairs as long as Yippitok is in the loft. If
  Tok leaves the loft using spider climb or exits through the bay windows, the
  assistants try to flank a single opponent to do as much poison damage on a
  single character as possible.

  drops or flees, the assistants surrender once they've been reduced below 10
