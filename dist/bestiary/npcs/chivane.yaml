SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Prayer Attack (Su)
    description: >-
      Chivane must be within 30 feet of and visible to her victim to use this
      specialized assassination attack. Beginning a prayer attack is a standard
      action, and causes her victim to be fascinated by her unless he makes a DC
      18 Will save. She can maintain the fascination effect by concentrating.
      The victim may attempt a new save to escape fascination each time a
      potential threat (other than the fascinating assassin) appears. At any
      point after 3 rounds, she may make a coup de grace attack against the
      target, provided that the target is still fascinated.
  - name: Red Shroud (Su)
    description: >-
      Chivane can create a veil of red mist once per day as a move-equivalent
      action. The red shroud persists for 4 rounds, granting a +1 dodge bonus to
      AC and fast healing 1. This mist cannot be dissipated by wind. If she is
      slain while this ability is active, she can choose to remain corporeal or
      disintegrate into a cloud of red mist that leaves behind only her gear.
  - name: Summon Mantis (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Chivane may summon an advanced fiendish giant mantis, 1d3
      fiendish giant mantises, or 1d4+1 giant mantises, as if using summon
      monster V. She can mentally direct the actions of these summoned vermin as
      a free action. All mantises summoned by this spell-like ability are
      blood-red, and gain no racial bonus on Stealth checks in forests.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Chivane uses her red shroud ability as combat begins. She picks a single
  target and attempts to use her prayer attack against that enemy. If hard
  pressed, Chivane summons fiendish giant mantises to aid her priests.
Morale: Chivane fights to the death.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds, potion of cure moderate wounds, antitoxin
OtherGear: >-
  +1 studded leather, +1 sawtooth sabre, masterwork hand crossbow with 10 shadow
  essence poisoned bolts, masterwork sawtooth sabre, boots of elvenkind, cloak
  of resistance +1, ring of protection +1, disguise kit, spell component pouch,
  masterwork thieves' tools
