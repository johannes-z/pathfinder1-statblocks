DuringCombat: >-
  Iantor stays in the air and uses the Hover feat to kick up dirt, sand, and
  dust to gain concealment from enemies. He tries to keep out of melee combat,
  pounding foes with his destructive harmonics. Iantor reserves his cold breath
  weapon until he can catch at least 3 opponents in its cone of effect.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, Iantor flees deeper into the palace,
  either to join his father in area D20 (50% chance) or to his own quarters in
  area D10 (50% chance) to lick his wounds.
