BeforeCombat: >-
  If Chatar believes she will get into a fight within the next few minutes, she
  casts keen edge and weapon of awe on her scythe and drinks her potion of blur.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Chatar pronounces a judgment of protection,
  gaining a +2 profane bonus to Armor Class, and casts castigate on the nearest
  foe. She waits for her enemies to come to her, activating her  bane ability to
  gain a bonus on damage rolls against that creature type. She resorts to using
  her claws only if she has to. If she starts taking damage, she pronounces a
  judgment of healing and casts inflict moderate wounds on herself.
Morale: A fanatic devotee to the cause, Chatar Esuri fights until she is destroyed.
