SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adamantine Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A forgefiend's bite attacks are treated as adamantine for the purposes of
      overcoming damage reduction.
  - name: Rend Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a forgefiend hits with a bite attack, it chews any armor worn by the
      target-this grants the forgefiend a free sunder attempt against armor worn
      by the target if the victim fails a DC 22 Reflex save. A forgefiend also
      gains Greater Sunder and Improved Sunder as bonus feats. The save DC is
      Strength-based.
  - name: Searing Spew (Ex)
    description: >-
      A forgefiend can belch forth a searing pile of slag from its body maw as a
      standard action once every 1d4 rounds. This blob of molten metal affects
      any 10-foot-square area adjacent to the forgefiend. Any creature in this
      area takes 14d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 22 half). The slag
      quickly cools, forming a rugged pile of worthless scrap and misshapen
      metal that is treated as difficult terrain and crumbles to powder in 1
      hour. The save DC is Constitution-based.
