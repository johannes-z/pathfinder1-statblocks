SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Smoke Armor (Su)
    description: >-
      The coils of smoke that surround Furkas Xoud are partially solid. They
      grant him a +4 natural armor bonus and 40 bonus hit points.
  - name: Spectral Miasma (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action once per hour, Furkas can summon a life-sapping mist that
      functions as obscuring mist, except that Furkas can see through this fog
      normally. Living creatures that enter or start their turns within the
      spectral miasma take 2d6 points of negative energy damage; Furkas heals
      for the same amount of damage. Once created, a spectral miasma persists
      for 1 minute or until dispersed by wind or fire, whichever happens first.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Furkas Xoud casts mage armor, see invisibility, and shield before entering
  combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Furkas's actions in combat vary depending on where he's encountered, but when
  he actually enters combat, he starts the battle by first casting fireball and
  follows that with his spectral miasma ability. He casts mirror image on the
  second round, then follows that up with cloudkill, solid fog, web, and
  stinking cloud. He uses wall of force to trap victims in these areas, saving
  his damaging spells to target healers first and combatants last, while using
  his rod of gripping smoke to interfere with characters who attempt to attack
  him with weapons.
Morale: >-
  Furkas's morale depends on where he's encountered&#8211; see Campaign Role on
  the next page. If he retreats to area G9, he uses his spectral miasma to heal
  at the first opportunity.
Gear: >-
  cloak of resistance +2, goggles of minute seeing, ring of minor fire
  resistance (bonded object), ring of forcefangs, rod of gripping smoke (see
  page 61)
