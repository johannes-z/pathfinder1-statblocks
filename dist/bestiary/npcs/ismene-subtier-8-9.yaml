SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, Ismene can issue forth a cone of fire,
      dealing 10d6 points of fire damage to all creatures in a 30-foot cone (DC
      20 Reflex half). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Flash of Insight (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as an immediate action, a cyclops can peer into an occluded
      visual spectrum of possible futures, gaining insight that allows it to
      select the exact result of one die roll before the roll is made. This
      effect can alter an action taken by the cyclops only and cannot be applied
      to the rolls of others.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If disturbed early from her meditation, Ismene casts entropic shield and then
  drinks her potion of bull's strength. The effects of bull's strength are
  included in her statistics.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ismene uses fireball and her breath weapon to weaken the PCs at range. After a
  seeress has enhanced her weapon, she goes into melee with her claws and heat
  aura. She does not use her flash of insight on an attack roll, instead 
  holding it in reserve for a saving throw against a particularly dangerous
  spell or effect that would disable her.
Morale: Ismene is fanatical in her beliefs and fights to the death.
Gear: potion of bull's strength
OtherGear: >-
  soothsayer's travel raiment [as soothsayer's raimentAPG but on a +1 chain
  shirt], cloak of resistance +1, headband of alluring charisma +2
