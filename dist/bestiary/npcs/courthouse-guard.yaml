DuringCombat: >-
  The guards are badly organized and have no grasp of tactics, simply attacking
  the closest opponent. Giving them instructions during combat requires a DC 12
  Intimidate check to get them to follow orders.
Morale: If reduced to 5 hit points or fewer, the guards seek cover or try to flee.
Gear: scale mail, heavy crossbow with 10 bolts, halberd
