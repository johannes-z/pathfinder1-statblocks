BeforeCombat: Lem casts heroism before the start of the encounter.
DuringCombat: >-
  Lem knows he is best in a supporting role, and tries to stay out of melee if
  possible. Instead, he uses his bardic performance ability to inspire courage
  in his companions. In cases where a single enemy presents a particularly large
  threat to Lem or his companions, the bard uses his offensive spells on that
  target. Against larger groups of foes, he bolsters his allies with the likes
  of haste and heroism.
