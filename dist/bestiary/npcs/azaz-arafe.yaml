BeforeCombat: Azaz casts mage armor before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Azaz uses grease and flaming sphere to control the battlefield while staying
  close to Khelru in case he needs healing. He makes liberal use of his wand of
  vanish, and uses it on his familiar, Zazu, as well, to help Zazu make poison
  sting attacks. If the situation looks dire, Azaz casts ear-piercing scream or
  shocking grasp.
Morale: >-
  Afraid to look weak, Azaz is not inclined to surrender, and he certainly won't
  abandon Khelru, but if he is reduced to fewer than 6 hit points and is
  suffering from a negative condition, Azaz gives in and admits defeat.
