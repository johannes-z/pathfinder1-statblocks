DuringCombat: >-
  The falconers adopt strategies to best support Norgrimm, favoring ranged
  combat with their bows, but they do enter melee to flank opponents with the
  winter wolf.
Morale: >-
  As long as Norgrimm lives, the falconers fight to the death. Once the winter
  wolf is defeated, however, the falconers surrender when reduced to fewer than
  10 hit points (see Development, below).
Gear: potions of cure light wounds (2)

  studded leather, composite longbow (+2 Str) with 20 arrows, longsword,
