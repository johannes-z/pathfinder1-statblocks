BeforeCombat: >-
  The Enumerator always casts the following spells every day (the effects of
  which are noted in his stat block): endure elements, mage armor, mage's
  magnificent mansion, overland flight, and protection from arrows. If he
  anticipates combat, he casts lesser globe of invulnerability, true seeing,
  mirror image, protection from energy (usually against fire), and expeditious
  retreat (in that order). If the opportunity presents, he casts invisibility on
  himself and haste on himself and his cultist minions.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Enumerator likes to lead off by targeting an enemy spellcaster with
  disintegrate, and uses dispel magic or greater dispel magic to counter enemy
  spellcasting (relying on his ring of counterspells to protect him against
  similar tactics). He uses baleful polymorph against dangerous foes, dismissal
  against conjured creatures, and fireball on weak groups.
Morale: >-
  The Enumerator does not see the percentage in valor. Where the odds of victory
  are poor, he flies or teleports away, using cultists or black tentacles as
  cover. Once back at the Principium, he uses nightmare the next night to weaken
  his opponents for their next meeting, and observes them using scrying to learn
  their weaknesses and strengths, using nondetection to prevent them from doing
  the same to him.
