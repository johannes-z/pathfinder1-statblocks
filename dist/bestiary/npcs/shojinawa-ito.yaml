SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Power Over Undead (Su)
    description: >-
      Ito gains Command Undead as a bonus feat, and can channel energy 12 times
      per day, but only to use that feat (DC 26).
  - name: Spectral Flame Strike (Sp)
    description: >-
      Ito can cast flame strike three times per day as a spell-like ability.
      Unlike normal flame strike, however, the spectral flames are infused with
      negative energy. Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half is
      negative energy damage and is therefore not subject to fire resistance.
Gender: Male
Bloodline: Destined
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ito casts blur, false life, mage armor, and shield before any fight, doing so
  from within the safety of the cavern walls or floor, if necessary.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ito uses his spectral flame strike and spells such as cone of cold, fireball,
  scorching ray, and waves of fatigue to target massed foes. Against
  individuals, he casts spells like bestow curse, disintegrate, enervation,
  finger of death, and phantasmal killer, or attacks with his corrupting touch.
  If his enemies seem able to hit him with any frequency, he casts mirror image
  and uses vampiric touch along with his corrupting touch to replenish his lost 
  hit points. If Ito seems too powerful for your PCs, reduce the speed with
  which he attacks them. Have him waste every other round, as necessary, to
  convey the emperor's arrogance and disdain for his opponents.
Morale: >-
  Ito fights until destroyed, knowing full well that he'll re-form in just a few
  days. Of more concern to him is the loss of Emperor Shigure's corpse, which he
  strives at all costs to protect as a bargaining chip. The only way to
  permanently destroy Ito's ghost is to destroy his second phylactery, a
  funerary urn that lies at the bottom of the Lake of Tears (area F).
