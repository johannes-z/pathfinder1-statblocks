SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Apprehend (Ex)
    description: >-
      Kordaitra gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat and can attempt a
      grapple combat maneuver check in place of the attack at the end of a
      charge. She receives a +2 bonus on Perception checks and combat maneuver
      checks to disarm, grapple, or trip opponents, and does not treat crowds as
      difficult terrain.
  - name: Badge (Ex)
    description: >-
      As long as Kordaitra wears her Gray Maiden armor (and thus displays her
      badge of authority in that organization), allies within 30 feet who can
      see her gain a +3 morale bonus on saving throws against charm, compulsion,
      and fear effects and a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls against targets the
      constable has challenged.
  - name: Instant Order (Ex)
    description: >-
      Kordaitra can bark an order to an ally within 30 feet as a standard
      action. That ally can instantly take a move action or standard action to
      comply with the order. Taking the action dazes the ally for 1 round
      afterward.
  - name: Quick Interrogator (Ex)
    description: >-
      Kordaitra can attempt a Diplomacy check to gather information in 1d6x5
      minutes and can attempt a Diplomacy or Intimidate check to change
      someone's attitude in 5 rounds.
  - name: Squad Commander (Ex)
    description: >-
      Kordaitra can spend 1 minute laying out a plan to activate the tactician
      ability without having it count against her number of uses per day. The
      ability must be triggered within 1 hour of the plan being made, and the
      benefits last for 11 minutes. She can have only one plan at a time, and if
      a new plan is made, any old plan is lost.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If the alarm is raised, Kordaitra moves to area E18 and activates her squad
  commander ability to prepare the occupants there to use the Shield Wall
  teamwork feat for 11 minutes.
DuringCombat: >-
  If Zenobia is nearby, Kordaitra starts combat using her instant order ability
  on the first round to allow Zenobia to cast two spells. She follows this up on
  the second round by moving over to be near Zenobia so she can receive a divine
  power spell on the third round. After this (or at the  start of any combat
  where Zenobia isn't involved), Kordaitra issues a challenge to the most
  dangerous martial PC, and then uses her for the faith ability to gain a +2
  bonus on attack rolls (and to grant a +1 bonus to all allies nearby). She
  prefers to attack creatures suffering from fear effects to make the most of
  strikes from her cruel longsword (a tactic that works well when Gray Maiden
  guards intimidate foes with their Dazzling Display feats, or the Mother of
  Thorns uses her gaze weapon), but otherwise focuses her attacks on the target
  of her challenge.
Morale: >-
  Kordaitra flees combat if reduced to fewer than 40 hit points and attempts to
  make her way back to the hidden  chamber in her quarters. Once there, she
  locks herself in, gathers the remaining gear there, and uses a dose of dust of
  disappearance and a potion of gaseous form to make her way to Castle Korvosa.
  In this event, the PCs can encounter her again in Chapter 6, fighting at
  Vavana Dhatri's side to defend the False Ileosa. Should this happen, reassign
  the loot she gathers from the secret room as you see fit among the defenders
  of Castle Korvosa's third floor.
