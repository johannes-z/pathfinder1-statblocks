    description: >-
      Unlike a traditional homunculus, Garlmak is not physically or
      telepathically bound to Gellion. If Garlmak is destroyed, Gellion takes no
      damage, and if Gellion dies, Garlmak doesn't lose its Intelligence score,
      feats, or skill ranks, or suffer any negative effects.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Garlmak hides under the table and waits for the PCs to turn their backs to it
  before hurling a dagger at the nearest PC in the ensuing surprise round.
DuringCombat: >-
  Garlmak continues to attack from range unless forced into melee combat, in
  which it tries to stab or bite the PCs and use Acrobatics to avoid provoking
  attacks of opportunity.
Morale: >-
  Garlmak hates itself as much as it hates Gellion and gladly fights to the
  death. It pursues fleeing PCs throughout the house, but doesn't leave the
  house to follow the PCs.
