BeforeCombat: >-
  Zaahku casts mage armor when scouts first warn her of visitors, and casts
  message on her warriors to help coordinate them in case of attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zaahku is conservative in combat, using mirror image to protect herself and
  hypnotism to distract enemies. If intruders slay one of her guards, she
  switches tactics, relying on her elemental ray and burning hands.
Morale: >-
  Zaahku hopes to delay dangerous opponents while her people flee, and retreats
  after 5 rounds. If the PCs kill two or more of her guards, she fights to the
  death.
