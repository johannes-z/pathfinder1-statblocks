SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      Akkuret can assume the form of a Medium humanoid at will but requires 10
      uninterrupted minutes to alter his body. Performing this transformation is
      somewhat painful, but the faceless stalker can maintain his new form
      indefinitely once he has achieved it. Akkuret can change back to his true
      form as a swift action and gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage
      rolls, skill checks, and saving throws for 1 round after he does so.
      Akkuret retains his own innate abilities when he assumes his new form and
      does not gain any of those belonging to the creature he mimics. He gains a
      +10 bonus on Disguise checks when they are used in conjunction with this
      ability.
  - name: Faceless (Su)
    description: >-
      In its natural form, a faceless stalker has no discernible facial
      features. It gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made to resist attacks or
      effects that target the senses. This includes gaze attacks, odor-based
      attacks, sonic attacks and similar attacks. This bonus does not apply to
      illusions.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Akkuret reverts to his true shape on the first round of combat, gaining the
  benefits described below in the process. Instead of engaging foes toe-to-toe,
  Akkuret prefers to stay 10 feet from all combatants in order to gain attacks
  of opportunity against them as they approach. To delay the PCs, Akkuret fights
  defensively and uses his Combat Expertise feat, sacrificing offensive
  potential for a greater chance at survival. Whenever possible, he feints as a
  move action to gain a sneak attack against a foes he isn't flanking.
Morale: Fanatically devoted to Chalfon, Akkuret fights to the death.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds
OtherGear: +1 scimitar, bracers of armor +1, 77 gp
