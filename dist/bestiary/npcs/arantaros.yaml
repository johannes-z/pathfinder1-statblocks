  - name: Alchemical Spellcasting (Su)
    description: >-
      Arantaros's extensive experience with alchemy and his bargain with
      Haagenti have altered his spellcasting ability. Arantaros can
      spontaneously cast spells as a 16th-level sorcerer, but uses the
      alchemist's extracts per day progression (adjusted by his Charisma
      modifier) to determine how many spells he knows, and he can learn only
      spells from the alchemist spell list.
