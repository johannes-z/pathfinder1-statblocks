BeforeCombat: >-
  Rhien does his best work from the shadows, and he casts darkness on himself
  before joining a fight.
DuringCombat: >-
  Rhien prefers to let his team attack while he uses his shadow power to target
  troublemakers with shadowy versions of resilient sphere or chain of
  perditionUC, after which he joins his minions in close combat. He avoids
  lighted areas at all costs to maintain the DR provided by his shadow master
  ability.
Morale: >-
  Rhien presses the attack until his cutthroats fall, then he uses shadow jump
  to escape to an adjoining room and assume a stealthier hit-and-run strategy,
  attacking suddenly from stealth before falling back. If reduced to below 25
  hit points, he instead uses plane shift to escape to the Shadow Plane, and may
  return to vex the PCs at your discretion.
