BeforeCombat: >-
  If Killik suspects an impending combat, he casts shield of faith and sanctuary
  on himself and attempts to talk his way out of any conflict.
DuringCombat: >-
  Killik prefers fighting from range with his crossbow and spiritual weapon, but
  channels negative energy if surrounded. If he fights with an ally, Killik
  stays close enough to his companion to heal him should his ally need
  assistance, and attempts to dispel the largest threat's magical effects to
  weaken him or her. If forced into melee combat, Killik uses his battle rage
  and copycat domain powers to boost his defenses and damage output.
Morale: >-
  Killik fights to the death if he is Marzack's accomplice. If he is innocent of
  the crime, he casts invisibility on himself and attempts to buy his freedom as
  a term of surrender if brought below 14 hp.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds, scroll of speak with dead
OtherGear: >-
  +1 studded leather, masterwork rapier, light crossbow, feather token (swan
  boat), healer's kit, silver holy symbol, 70 gp
