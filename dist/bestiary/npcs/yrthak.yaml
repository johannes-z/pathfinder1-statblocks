  - name: Blind (Ex)
    description: >-
      A yrthak sees and senses exclusively through its blindsight ability, which
      is based on sound and movement-beyond 120 feet, it is considered blind. A
      deaf yrthak is effectively blinded as well except against adjacent
      foes&#8211;its weak eyesight functions enough for it to attack targets
      this close, although in such cases these creatures still gain the benefit
      of concealment (20% miss chance) because of the yrthak's poor vision. It
      is invulnerable to all sight-based effects and attacks, including gaze
      attacks.
  - name: Explosion (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a yrthak can fire its sonic lance at the ground, a
      large rock, a stone wall, or a similar nonmagical object within 60 feet to
      create an explosion. This attack deals 2d6 points of piercing damage to
      all within 10 feet of the effect's center.
  - name: Sonic Lance (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per round, a yrthak can focus sonic energy in a 60-foot ray that
      deals 8d6 points of sonic damage to one target.
