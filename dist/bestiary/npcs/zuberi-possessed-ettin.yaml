Source: PFS S1-53
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Zuberi gives the ettin a potion of false life to drink before standing guard
  outside the ritual chamber.
DuringCombat: >-
  Under the influence of Zuberi's possessing spirit, the ettin holds back while
  the living monoliths engage PCs first, casting magic missile or throwing
  javelins instead. Zuberi then readies the ettin's flails and directs him into
  flanking situations where he can use his sneak attacks to maximum effect.
Morale: Zuberi forces the ettin to fight to the death.
Gear: potion of false life (already drank)
OtherGear: >-
  leather armor, masterwork flails (2), javelins (4) Special Abilitie s Superior
  Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex) Due to his partial possession of only one of the
  ettin's heads, Zuberi still gains access to its superior two-weapon fighting
  style. As such, the ettin can still fight with a flail or javelin in each hand
  and, because each head controls one arm, the ettin does not take a penalty on
  attack or damage rolls for attacking with two weapons. Zuberi can also apply
  his combat feats and sneak attack abilities to the attacks controlled by his
  head.
