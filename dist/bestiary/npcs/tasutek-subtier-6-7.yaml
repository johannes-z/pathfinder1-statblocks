BeforeCombat: >-
  In order to hide any signs of weakness before Rovagug's favored servant,
  Tasutek has already cast water walk and used his scrolls of delay poison and
  freedom of movement. If his homunculus Zivilpep (see area B1) has warned
  Tasutek that the PCs are approaching area C, the warpriest has also cast
  bless, bull's strength, and resist energy (against whichever energy type the
  PCs favor most, according to the homunculus) before granting his destructive
  attacks blessing to the thognorok just before the PCs arrive.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tasutek uses his enthrall ability to stop the PCs in their tracks, giving him
  a moment to cast spells that augment his combat abilities and move to a more
  advantageous position. When possible, he flanks a target with the thognorok.
  He uses his fervor ability each round to grant himself greater combat prowess.
Morale: >-
  Rovagug demands his greatest servants die on their feet, and Tasutek fights
  until dead.
Gear: >-
  scroll of delay poison, scroll of freedom of movement, wand of searing light
  (5 charges)
