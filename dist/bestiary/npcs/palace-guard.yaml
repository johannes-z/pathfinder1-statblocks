DuringCombat: >-
  A palace guard, raging as soon as combat begins, moves to attack with his
  Starfall spade in melee. The guards prefer to use their crossbows only when
  attacking from arrowslits or when there's no way for them to reach their foes
  in melee. Tek Makul has ordered all his guards to take foes alive when
  possible, and as such they only attempt to kill foes when they might be faced
  with death themselves.
Morale: >-
  Most palace guards flee if reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, but 25% of
  them will fight to the death.
Gear: >-
  banded mail, Starfall spade, mwk light crossbow with 10 bolts, 1d12
