DuringCombat: >-
  The hobgoblins on watch fire arrows at intruders until the intruders reach the
  wall, at which point they attempt to pour boiling oil on the attackers (see
  above). The warriors are well organized and fight as a unit once their
  defenses are breached, flanking with one another to make sneak attacks when
  possible. In combat, the hobgoblins attack araneas and elves in preference to
  other creatures.
Morale: >-
  The hobgoblins worship and fear Munasukaru, and they fight to the death,
  knowing that if they flee, their treatment at her hands will be unimaginably
  brutal.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds
