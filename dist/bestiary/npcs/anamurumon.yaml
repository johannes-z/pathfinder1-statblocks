  - name: Vulnerability to Royal Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      Anamurumon is vulnerable to weapons imbued with royal honor, such as the
      ancestral weapons of the five imperial families of Minkai-including the
      daikyu of commanding presence (Pathfinder Adventure Path #53 60), the
      sword Suishen (Pathfinder Adventure Path #50 61), and the thundering blade
      of the House of Sugimatu (Pathfinder Adventure Path #52 61). Against
      Anamurumon, these weapons function as outsider (oni) bane weapons. In
      addition, Suishen automatically confirms all critical hits made against
      Anamurumon.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: Anamurumon always shields himself with cloak of winds before a fight.
DuringCombat: >-
  Anamurumon reveals his true form to intimidate and demoralize opponents. He
  then unleashes a powerful spell like chain lightning or whirlwind, or his
  roaring gale ability, together with quickened shout. Thereafter, he wields his
  three-section staff, Ikarikurusai, in melee combat while firing shocking
  missiles from his third eye. He attempts to disarm anyone wielding a royal
  weapon. If surrounded, Anamurumon flies into the air and casts invisibility,
  then makes Flyby Attacks coupled with Awesome Blows, knocking foes into a
  whirlwind, if possible.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 100 hit points, Anamurumon casts invisibility or
  gaseous form until his regeneration restores his hit points. Anamurumon
  refuses to give up his plans for the Jade Throne and fights to the death.
OtherGear: >-
  +1 leather lamellar**, Ikarikurusai (+3 shock sansetsukon**; see page 60), key
  to secret door in area H16, gold-and-jade necklace worth 500 gp, 35 pp, 46 gp
