SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Discern Lies (Sp)
    description: >-
      When Gonville use his detect chaos ability on a target, he can determine
      if that creature is lying. This effect functions similarly to discern
      lies, but he can detect multiple lies from multiple creatures through one
      use of detect chaos. In addition, he must be able to hear and understand
      what a creature within the area of effect is saying to discern lies.
  - name: Hellknight Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      Gonville's armor is specially made full plate that displays his power and
      status in the Hellknight Order of the Rack. His armor check penalty in
      this armor is 1 less than normal and his maximum Dexterity bonus to AC is
      increased by 1.

  Gonville Chard fights with his longsword in both hands. When fighting those he
