    description: >-
      A crimson musk vampire can suck blood from a helpless, willing, or
      grappled living victim by succeeding at a grapple check. If it pins its
      foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. On each
      round it drains blood, the crimson musk vampire regains 5 hit points or
      gains 5 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour (up to a maximum number
      of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points).
