  - name: Chameleon Skin (Ex)
    description: >-
      A skulk's racial bonus on Stealth checks comes from his ability to change
      the color of his skin complex or regular patterns like bricks and mortar.
      A skulk loses this conditional bonus if he is wearing armor, or if he
      wears any clothing that covers more than one-quarter of his body, as
      skulks can only change the color of their own flesh, not that of the
      things they carry. A skulk normally conceals small items behind his body;
      by putting his back to a wall and changing the color of his front half, he
      can hide these items because observers don't have line of sight to the
      items.
Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: Divination, Conjuration
BeforeCombat: >-
  Fledzer hides in the darkness, blending in with the statue unless called out
  by the PCs or Tarka, in which case he reluctantly moves into the open to speak
  with the kobold or the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  No matter what the kobolds decide to do, Fledzer attempts to escape. A false
  prophet using the power of the Qadiran statue to manipulate the kobolds, he
  knows when it is time to abandon a con. The skulk uses his abilities to hide
  his treasure from both the PCs and the kobolds, and uses his spells and
  spell-like abilities to blind and stun the PCs to ease his escape. If a PC
  moves in front of the dragon statue, Fledzer activates the trap as a free
  action. If cornered and given the opportunity to surrender, he parleys for his
  life, willingly handing over the jade katana and his other treasures in
  exchange for his freedom.
Morale: >-
  Fledzer is more interested in saving his own chameleon hide than he is in
  maintaining control of the kobold tribe. If reduced to 8 or fewer hit points,
  he attempts to flee down the well in the northern portion of the room.
Gear: potion of blur, potion of cure light wounds
OtherGear: >-
  dagger, jade katana, spell component pouch, spellbook (contains all prepared
  spells as well as all 0-level spells, burning hands, magic aura, silent image,
  and ventriloquism)
