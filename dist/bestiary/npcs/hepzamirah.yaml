BeforeCombat: >-
  Before combat, Hepzamirah casts air walk, bull's strength, freedom of
  movement, shield of faith, and stoneskin on herself. If she thinks she has 10
  minutes to spare, she casts a mythic glyph of warding (sonic blast glyph)
  somewhere in the vicinity and attempts to lure enemies into stepping onto it
  during combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Hepzamirah begins by casting harm using faith's reach, following up in
  succeeding rounds with her other ranged spells as she uses air walk to stay
  out of melee as best she can. She is fond of using mythic blade barrier on her
  enemies' turns to create the barrier in ways that disrupt spellcasting or
  attempts to approach her. As long as she has at least four uses of mythic
  power left, she uses inspired spell on these mythic blade barriers (increasing
  the cost to cast the spell to two uses of mythic power) in order to cast them
  at CL 13th and retain the spells as they are cast. She uses her mortal
  challenge ability only if she knows the PCs are susceptible to fear
  effects&#8211;she's fought too many paladins to rely too heavily on this
  ability.  Apart from using mythic power to cast mythic spells and inspired
  blade barriers, she keeps a few uses of mythic power in reserve for the
  purpose of using force of will to reroll failed saving throws that would
  otherwise cripple her. If it becomes apparent that melee is a better option
  than spellcasting, she casts divine favor and then engages the most dangerous
  foe with a powerful charge&#8211;she only casts rage on herself if she feels
  that she won't need spells to finish a battle. She uses Power Attack as long
  as she's hitting more often than missing.  Hepzamirah is a mobile foe, and
  often uses blade barriers to slow pursuit as she retreats to other areas so
  she can heal herself of any damage she's taken before her enemies find her
  again. Favored places to fight include areas K1, K10, and L5 (she may even
  stand within the rot grubs, trusting to her damage reduction to keep her safe
  if she feels that doing so prevents foes from approaching her), but she
  retreats to any area where she suspects more of her minions might still be
  alive and able to provide combat aid.
Morale: >-
  Hepzamirah uses healing on herself if reduced to fewer than 150 hit points. If
  reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, Hepzamirah attempts to flee. Note that
  this attempt automatically fails, as her father uses her body to appear before
  the PCs (detailed in Concluding the Adventure on page 52).

  thunderous charging, Fasciculus Labyrinthum (see page 60), headband of
