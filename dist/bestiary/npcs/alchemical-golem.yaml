SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alchemy (Ex)
    description: >-
      When an alchemical golem strikes a foe, the attack has an additional
      random effect, chosen from the options below. The attack can either deal
      1d6 points of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, or cause the target
      to become sickened (Fortitude DC 16 negates) or entangled (Reflex DC 16
      negates) for 1d4 rounds. These save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Bombs (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an alchemical golem can throw a bomb as a ranged
      touch attack to a distance of 60 feet (no range increment). If the attack
      misses, treat it as a thrown splash weapon to determine where it lands.
      Anyone who is struck by an alchemical golem's bomb takes 8d6 points of
      acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage (determine type randomly). All
      creatures adjacent to the location where the bomb hits take 1d6 points of
      energy damage of the same type.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      An alchemical golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow
      spell resistance, save for spells with the sonic descriptor. Shatter
      damages an alchemical golem as if it were a crystalline creature.
  - name: Splash (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any strike on an alchemical golem with a nonreach melee weapon deals 1
      point of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage (determine type randomly)
      to the attacker. This amount increases to 1d6 points of damage if the
      attack is a critical hit.
DuringCombat: >-
  The golems throw bombs at opponents, then move forward to engage foes in melee
  combat. They use more bombs against anyone attempting to attack Ixolan in
  melee.
Morale: The golems fight until destroyed.
