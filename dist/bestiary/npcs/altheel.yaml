BeforeCombat: >-
  If Altheel is aware that the PCs are coming up to this room, he casts mirror
  image right before they enter the room.
DuringCombat: >-
  Altheel uses his mesmerist tricks to aid Twain in combat. He uses false
  flanker to help her set up sneak attacks, and psychosomatic surge to provide
  her with temporary hit points. He saves hold person for a PC who is an obvious
  combat threat, and targets spellcasters with mental block to hinder their
  casting.
Morale: >-
  Altheel refuses to show weakness in front of Twain, and fights to the death.
  If Twain is killed before him, he calls for a truce if he's reduced to fewer
  than 10 hit points.
