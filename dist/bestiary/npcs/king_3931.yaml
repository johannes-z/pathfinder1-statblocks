DuringCombat: >-
  No stranger to battle, the aristocrat fights with his longsword and orders all
  available guards and retainers to slay his attackers for the crime of
  attacking his royal person. He takes full tactical command of the battle,
  directing each subject, and avoids actions that put him at risk. If it looks
  like he would be killed or captured, he directs his guards to block pursuers
  and tries to flee.
