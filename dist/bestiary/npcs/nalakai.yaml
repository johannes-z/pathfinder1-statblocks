DuringCombat: >-
  Nalakai casts protection from good on the first round of battle, then follows
  that up with hold person, doom, sound burst, and command before he joins melee
  with his gauntlet. He casts healing spells on himself whenever he's reduced
  below 16 hit points.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 12 or fewer hit points, Nalakai flees to the closest functioning
  monitor or the holographic projector and begs Hellion to protect him. Hellion
  responds by casting moonstruck on Nalakai, forcing him to become feral and
  return to the fight until he is slain.
