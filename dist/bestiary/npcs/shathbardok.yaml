SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Vulnerability to Slashing Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      If an opponent rolls a natural 20 with a slashing weapon against an ice
      troll (followed by a successful roll to confirm the critical hit), the ice
      troll must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage taken) or lose a
      limb (50% arm or leg, 50% right or left). An ice troll who loses a leg
      falls prone but can continue moving at half speed. Severed limbs cannot
      attack but move at a speed of 30 feet toward the troll.
