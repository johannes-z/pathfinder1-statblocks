DuringCombat: >-
  The impalers fight as a cohesive unit,  usually staying adjacent to one
  another. When there is not enough space to continue attacking with the
  longspear, a skum impaler discards her weapon and makes full attacks with her
  natural weapons while her allies continue attacking with their longspears,
  using Phalanx Formation to avoid penalties for soft cover.
Morale: >-
  When reduced to 10 or fewer hit points, a skum impaler attempts to flee. If
  unable to flee, she fights to the death.
