SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hellstrider (Su)
    description: >-
      A warmonger devil is not impeded by rough terrain, and can move or charge
      through such squares as normal. It can also cross areas covered with
      deadly impediments (such as caltrops or thorns) without being damaged or
      hindered. In addition to being entirely immune to fire, the creature's
      legs are immune to acid and cold, allowing it to cross rivers of acid or
      lava as long as the material is less than 4 feet deep. This ability does
      not protect a warmonger devil against magical hindrances like black
      tentacles, web, or similar spells.
  - name: Merciless Blow (Su)
    description: >-
      Any trident attacks a warmonger devil makes against entangled creatures
      (including those entangled by its net) deal an extra 2d6 points of damage.
  - name: Phalanx (Ex)
    description: >-
      Devils gain a +1 morale bonus on attacks and to AC while adjacent to a
      warmonger devil.
  - name: Stability (Ex)
    description: >-
      Warmonger devils receive a +4 racial bonus to their CMD when resisting a
      bull rush or trip attempt while standing on the ground.
