SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Surgical Strikes (Ex)
    description: >-
      An interlocutor's claws threaten a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. On a
      successful critical hit, that claw deals 2d6 bleed damage rather than 1d6.
  - name: Unnerving Gaze (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature that succumbs to an interlocutor's unnerving gaze becomes
      staggered for 1 round as it becomes convinced that it recognizes some of
      its own body parts entangled in the interlocutor's body.
DuringCombat: >-
  The interlocutor heads directly into melee, delivering full attacks to the
  most vulnerable opponent within reach. If combat goes well and it successfully
  strikes down an opponent, it may spend an action casting stabilize on that PC,
  even going so far as to cast breath of life to restore the final PC to life
  should the kyton wipe out the entire party&#8211;all so it has a potential
  experimental subject in its debt.
Morale: >-
  The terms of the kyton's binding do not allow for anything but a fight until
  its destruction.
