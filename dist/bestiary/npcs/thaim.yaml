BeforeCombat: >-
  Thaim thinks like a hunter and tries to arrange the conditions of the battle
  as if he were hunting an animal, mainly by relying on surprise.
DuringCombat: >-
  Thaim prefers to fight while riding his mammoth. If he must fight on the
  ground, he uses his longspear, or shortspear and shield if his enemy is
  particularly dangerous (AC 17, touch 11, flat-footed 16 [+4 armor, +1 Dex, +2
  shield]).
Morale: >-
  Although Thaim is not terribly bright, he understands that his mission to save
  his tribe will fail if he dies. If brought to 10 hit points or fewer, he
  flees, directing his mammoth to clear a path if possible.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds (3)
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork hide armor, masterwork heavy wooden shield, javelins (3),
  masterwork longspear, masterwork shortspear, masterwork sling with 20 stones,
  medicine bag, pet mammoth (see below)
