DuringCombat: >-
  The id mutants have become quite protective of the galley, and think of it as
  their territory. They attack anyone who attempts to enter, but do not pursue
  foes beyond this room unless they are goaded to do so via ranged attacks. They
  focus their attacks on the same target (preferring to tackle more heavily
  armored foes first), working together to take down one foe at a time.
Morale: The id mutants fight to the death.
Gear: potions of cure moderate wounds (2)
OtherGear: +2 breastplate, +1 longsword, mwk daggers (2)
