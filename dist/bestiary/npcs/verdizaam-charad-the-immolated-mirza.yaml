SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoid slain by Verdizaam becomes a ghoul on the next moonrise.
      Likewise a slain janni becomes a ghul, and a slain genie becomes a great
      ghul. Blessing or destroying the body prevents this reanimation.
  - name: Cursed Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      Verdizaam's wickedly curved claws are as hard as steel and count as both
      cold iron and magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.
      Genie-Kin (Ex) For all effects related to race, Verdizaam is considered a
      genie even though he is no longer an outsider.
  - name: Heat (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a free action, Verdizaam can raise his body temperature to that of
      molten iron or lower it to that of cold, undead flesh. His red-hot body
      deals 1d6 points of fire damage whenever he hits in melee, or in each
      round he maintains a hold while grappling. Plague's
  - name: Caress (Sp)
    description: >-
      Seven times per day, Verdizaam may make a melee touch attack as a standard
      action that exposes the target to Night Plague. This disease was
      genetically engineered by the Usij to infect the nobility of the Jistka
      Imperium and functions differently than other diseases. See the Night
      Plague sidebar for more information.
Gender: Male
Bloodline: 'Pestilence (Pathfinder #29 29)'
BeforeCombat: >-
  Verdizaam begins the encounter under the effects of greater invisibility and
  positions himself in optimal striking position before initiating combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Verdizaam does not hesitate to use his hyenas as living shields, constantly
  moving to keep them between him and his foes, then leaping forward to slash
  with his claws. He raises his body temperature to inflict fire damage with his
  attacks. He becomes invisible if he begins taking significant damage, moving
  about the PCs and attempting to infect them with Night Plague with his
  plague's caress ability.
Morale: Verdizaam fights until destroyed.
Gear: >-
