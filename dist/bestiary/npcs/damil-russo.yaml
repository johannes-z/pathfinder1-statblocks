DuringCombat: >-
  Damil fights loudly and brashly, doing his best to prevent anyone from
  entering area C9. As the battle progresses, he calls out the tactics,
  strengths, and weaknesses of the PCs as he interprets them, letting the others
  in area C9 prepare more appropriately. If he drops below 30 hit points, he
  takes up a position in front of the door to area C9 and fights with total
  defense, drawing the battle out as long as possible so the others have more
  time to get ready.
Morale: >-
  Damil may not have the patience for magic his companions have, but he's
  devoted to defending them and fights to the death to protect their privacy.
Gear: >-
