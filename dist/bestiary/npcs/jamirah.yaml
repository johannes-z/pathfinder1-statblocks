DuringCombat: >-
  Jamirah casts haste on the first round of combat, and begins combat with
  ranged attacks targeting obvious spellcasters. Once in melee combat, she uses
  her Stand Still feat to prevent opponents from getting within her longspear's
  reach. She makes sneak attacks as often as possible, using vanish, hold
  person, sound burst, and her Stunning Assault feat, as necessary, to keep foes
  flat-footed and susceptible to her sneak attacks.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, or if attacked by ranged weapons or
  spells and unable to engage opponents in melee, Jamirah retreats into the
  pyramid (area N12) to wait for opponents there. Fanatically devoted to the Sky
  Pharaoh, Jamirah does not surrender, choosing instead to immolate herself with
  her Troth of the Forgotten Pharaoh feat while at the center of a group of
  opponents screaming Hakotep's name.
