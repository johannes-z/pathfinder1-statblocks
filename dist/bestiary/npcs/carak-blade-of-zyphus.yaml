  - name: Babble (Su)
    description: >-
      Carak constantly mutters and whines to himself, creating a hypnotic
      effect. All sane creatures within 60 feet of Carak must succeed at a DC 19
      Will save or be fascinated for 2d4 rounds. While a target is fascinated,
      the allip can approach without breaking the effect, but an attack by the
      allip breaks the effect. This is a sonic, mind-affecting compulsion
      effect. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by Carak's
      babble for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      If the Wisdom damage caused by Carak's touch of insanity ever meets or
      exceeds a creature's actual Wisdom score, that creature immediately drops
      dead-this is an exception to the normal rules for Wisdom damage. In 1d4
      rounds, a regular allip emerges from the victim's body&#8211;this allip
      spawn takes a &#8211;2 penalty on all d20 rolls and receives &#8211;2 hp
      per HD. It is under Carak's command and remains so enslaved until his
      destruction, at which point the allip spawn loses its spawn penalties and
      becomes a fully-fledged and free-willed allip.
  - name: Madness (Su)
    description: >-
      Anyone targeting Carak with thought detection, mind control, or telepathy
      immediately takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage resulting from contact with
      the insane undead's tortured mind.
  - name: Touch of Insanity (Su)
    description: >-
      Carak deals 1d4 Wisdom damage with a touch. A successful critical hit
      deals this damage and an additional 1 point of Wisdom drain (instead of
      merely dealing double Wisdom damage). On each successful attack, Carak
      gains 5 temporary hit points.
