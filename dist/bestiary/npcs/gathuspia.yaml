BeforeCombat: >-
  Gathuspia casts invisibility and mage armor before entering combat, and
  activates her flight hex to increase her combat mobility.
DuringCombat: >-
  Gathuspia spends the first few rounds of combat using her magic to soften up
  foes, with lightning bolt and confusion in particular to disrupt and damage,
  and stinking cloud and web to reduce their mobility. Once she's got the PCs
  relatively split up, she swoops in to make melee attacks, using Vital Strike
  with her bite on the first round of combat. She knows her Armor Class is good,
  but faced against foes who are able to hit her and penetrate her damage
  reduction, she retreats back to range and relies on magic missiles and other
  magic. She tries to capture the souls of any slain PCs as soon as possible
  using soul bind, and if she manages to capture three (and thus fills all three
  soul jars), she leaves the battle by returning to the ethereal plane, content
  with her prizes for now.
Morale: >-
  Gathuspia is unlike many of the other outsiders who serve Ardathanatus in that
  she hasn't been called here by his magic&#8211;her alliance with the elf is on
  her own terms. While she values his aid and hopes he succeeds at his mission
  since that will only increase the number of souls she can harvest, she's not
  so blindly devoted to his cause that she would lay down her life for him. If
  reduced to 40 or fewer hit points, she attempts to escape by using
  etherealness and does not return.
