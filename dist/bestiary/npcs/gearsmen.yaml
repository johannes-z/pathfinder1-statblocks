      This gearsman has used this ability to gain proficiency with firearms, and
      does not use it to reallocate skill ranks.
  - name: Charge Weapon (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any metal melee weapon wielded by a gearsman becomes charged with
      electricity and deals +1d6 points of electricity damage on a hit.

      hit points per hour. Up to once per day as a full-round action, the
      gearsman can heal any robot it touches of 4d6 points of damage-if a
      gearsman uses this ability on itself, it automatically heals 24 points of
      damage.
DuringCombat: >-

  semiautomatic fire, shifting to their spears only once they've depleted their
  weaponry's charges, or when forced into melee.
