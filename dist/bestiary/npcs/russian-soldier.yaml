  - name: Trench Warfare (Ex)
    description: >-
      Starting at 3rd level, a trench fighter can select one specific type of
      firearm (such as a machine gun, revolver, or rif le). He gains a bonus
      equal to his Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of
      firearm. Every 4 levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), the trench
      fighter picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those
      types as well. Furthermore, when behind partial, normal, or improved
      cover, a trench fighter gains an additional +2 AC bonus from the cover.
      This ability replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Gear: M1914 concussion grenades (2, see page 66)

  Mosin- Nagant M1891 rifle (see page 65) with 20 metal cartridges, socket
  bayonet (see page 67), gas mask (see page 67)
