BeforeCombat: >-
  The ringmaster never enters a fight alone, instead bringing along her criminal
  performers or else recruiting allies of convenience with her spells and
  mesmerism. She uses her linked reaction trick to tie herself to more
  perceptive minions and casts eagle's splendor and shield from her wand before
  engaging anyone.
DuringCombat: >-
  The ringmaster uses her hypnotic stare on nearby victims, sapping their will
  before targeting them with dominate person or oneiric horror. She reserves
  phantasmal killer for those unfortunate souls who ruin her carefully laid
  plans.

  potion of cure moderate wounds, wand of mirror image (8 charges), wand of
  shield (40 charges)

  +1 glamered mithral chain shirt, +1 light crossbow with 20 bolts, mwk whip,
