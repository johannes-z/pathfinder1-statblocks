SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Agile Grappler (Ex)
    description: Isitalba does not gain the grappled condition if she grapples a foe.
  - name: Tentacle Cage (Su)
    description: >-
      If Isitalba successfully grapples a creature, she transfers that creature
      into her lower body's nest of cage-like tentacles. This works like the
      swallow whole universal monster ability. Isitalba's tentacles have AC 18
      and 18 hp for the purpose of an entrapped creature cutting itself out.
      Isitalba's tendrils heal quickly, allowing her to use this ability 1 round
      after a creature cuts itself free.
