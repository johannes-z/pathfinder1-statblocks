BeforeCombat: >-
  At the first sign of possible trouble, a Servant of the Deep casts mage armor
  and heroism and activates the flight hex.
DuringCombat: >-
  Servants of the Deep prefer to use spells to weaken foes before casting any
  necessary spells to improve their own combat abilities, using their rage
  ability, and wading into melee. They often use the Power Attack and Arcane
  Strike feats for more damage, and they employ their evil eye hex against
  opponents who are particularly hard to hit.

  Servants of the Deep are fanatical in their beliefs and fight to the death in
  the name of their god-king, Zhanagorr.
Gear: potion of water walk
