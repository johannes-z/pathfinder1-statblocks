SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cloud the Mind (Su)
    description: >-
      When Kathann's opposed Disguise or Stealth check is exceeded by one or
      more observers' Perception checks, she can trick the observers into
      thinking they imagined noticing anything wrong as an immediate action. She
      attempts a Bluff check opposed by the targets' Sense Motive checks. Each
      target who fails this opposed check ignores the fact that he saw her.
  - name: Crowd Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      All crowd squares count as enemies threatening adjacent squares for the
      purpose of determining whether Kathann is flanking an opponent. She can
      use the Stealth skill to snipe even when making melee attacks as long as
      she attacks from a square containing at least one other creature within
      one size category of her.
  - name: Dirge of Misfortune (Su)
    description: >-
      While maintaining this performance, once per round as an immediate action
      Kathann can force a creature within 30 feet to reroll any d20 roll it just
      made. The opponent must use the result of the reroll, which takes a -2
      penalty. Dirge of misfortune is a mind-affecting ability that relies on
      audible and visual components.
  - name: Hide in the Crowd (Su)
    description: >-
      Kathann can use the Stealth skill even when the only cover she has is that
      provided by other creatures.
  - name: Inspiring Poise (Ex)
    description: >-
      Kathann gains a +4 competence bonus on checks with a skill of her choice
      for as long as she maintains this bardic performance. The performance is
      ended by any condition that imposes a penalty to her Dexterity score or
      immobilizes her.
  - name: Master of Disguise (Ex)
    description: >-
      Kathann takes no penalties on Disguise checks to change the appearance of
      her age, gender, or race.
  - name: Move with the Crowd (Ex)
    description: >-
      When moving through groups of intelligent Small, Medium, or Large
      creatures that would normally count as difficult terrain, Kathann instead
      moves normally. She gains a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks to
      avoid attacks of opportunity to move through an enemy's square when moving
      faster than half speed.
  - name: Perfect Surprise (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever Kathann hits a foe with a sneak attack at the end of a charge,
      she can make the blow a perfect surprise as an immediate action. The
      target must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw or fall unconscious
      for 7 rounds. Once targeted by this ability, a victim is immune to perfect
      surprise for 24 hours.
  - name: Secret Step (Ex)
    description: >-
      Kathann's movement through crowds that would normally be difficult terrain
      costs only half as many squares of movement as normal.
  - name: Slowing Strike (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round upon successfully hitting a target with a sneak attack,
      Kathann can choose to deal 1 fewer die of sneak attack damage and instead
      reduce one of the target's speeds by 5 feet. Once any of the target's
      speeds have been reduced to 0 feet, the target is immobilized (but not
      helpless). A target's fly speed can be reduced this way only if it uses
      wings to fly. The movement penalties imposed by slowing strike can be
      removed by healing the affected target to full hit points or by a lesser
      restoration spell.
  - name: Unexpected Suggestion (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a Lion Blade can use suggestion on a flat-footed target. Her
      caster level is equal to her Lion Blade level.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Kathann avoids combat at all cost, knowing that a fight means she has failed
  in her primary goals of stealth and subterfuge.
DuringCombat: >-
  When she must attack, Kathann aims to strike first, strike silently, and then
  immediately fall back.
Morale: >-
  Kathann is persistent in her goals, but she despises a fair fight. She adopts
  a hit-and-run strategy and isn't afraid to fall back and regroup if
  outmatched.
