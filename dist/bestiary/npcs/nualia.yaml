SpecialAbilities: []
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Nualia suspects combat is imminent, she casts bull's strength, cat's grace,
  and shield of faith on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nualia activates her Sihedron medallion as a free action at the start of
  combat to gain false life and casts divine favor  She prefers to fight with
  her bastard sword, her face an impassive mask save for her eyes, which blaze
  with anger. She uses fury of the Abyss on each of the first 6 rounds of combat
  (these bonuses are included in the stats above), and activates her ferocious
  strike on the first six successful hits. She saves shatter to use on any
  weapon that seems to be particularly dangerous in an enemy's hands. If
  possible, she moves into the hall to the south so that it's harder to surround
  her, and so she has an escape route handy, using channeled negative energy to
  clear a path if needed.
Morale: >-
  Nualia is loath to abandon her hard work, but if reduced to fewer than 15 hit
  points, she does just that, reasoning that escape and eventual revenge is
  better than death at the hands of the PCs. She uses obscuring mist and/or
  sanctuary to aid her escape, then does her best to flee Thistletop, ordering
  any surviving minions she encounters to guard her retreat. If she escapes, she
  makes her way to Magnimar to reunite with the Skinsaw Cult&#8211;see page 67
  for more details.
