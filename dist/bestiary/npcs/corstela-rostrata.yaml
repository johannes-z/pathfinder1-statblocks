Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Corstela casts mage armor the moment she suspects danger in Peacock Manor, and
  she casts shield and cat's grace just before confronting foes.
DuringCombat: >-
  Corstela surrounds herself with any able members of the Order of Resplendence
  (preferably students who can make good use of their sneak attacks) and casts
  invisibility sphere as combat begins. She casts mirror image on the following
  round, then attacks the PCs with color spray before using her wand of shocking
  grasp against anyone unaffected.
Morale: >-
  Corstela has no desire to die, but she is overcome with pride and feels like
  she is on the cusp of true greatness, so she fights with vigor and hopes that
  her order will defend both her and the manor. If reduced to fewer than 8 hit
  points, Corstela uses her dimensional slide arcanist exploit in an effort to
  escape.
Gear: wand of shocking grasp (43 charges)

  Baraket, horacalcum light mace, cloak of resistance +1, spellbook (contains
  all spells known plus 4 additional 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level spells of your
  choice), spell component pouch, 95 gp
