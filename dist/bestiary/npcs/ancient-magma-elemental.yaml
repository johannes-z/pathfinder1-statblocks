SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an ancient magma elemental can breathe a 60-foot
      cone of incandescent cinders. Every creature in the area takes 15d6 fire
      damage, and the cinders cling to and blind affected creatures as
      glitterdust for 2d6 rounds. With a successful DC 26 Reflex save, a target
      halves the damage, negates the blinding effect, and reduces the duration
      of the sparkling outline effect to 1 round. An ancient magma elemental can
      use this ability once every 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Burn (Ex)
    description: >-
      A magma elemental's burn DC includes a -2 racial penalty, as its fires
      don't burn quite as hot as true elemental flame.
  - name: Earth Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A burrowing magma elemental can pass through dirt, lava, stone, or almost
      any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through
      water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create
      any ripple, though the area it passes through feels warm for 1 round
      afterward and often retains a strangely smooth texture, as if the stone
      had been polished. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a
      burrowing magma elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the
      creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.
  - name: Lava Puddle (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a full-round action, a magma elemental can vomit forth a
      puddle of lava that fills its space to a depth of 2-3 inches and counts as
      difficult terrain. Any creature that moves through this puddle of lava
      takes 2d6 points of fire damage. This damage continues for 1d3 rounds
      after the creature leaves the lava pool, although then it only deals 1d6
      points of fire damage per round. The lava puddle solidifies and is safe to
      touch after 22 rounds.
