DuringCombat: >-
  While small for otyughs, these young specimens remain aggressive and dangerous
  in a group. They prefer to focus their attacks on one shared foe at a time.
Morale: >-
  If two otyughs are slain, the survivor scurries off to cower and sob in a
  corner&#8211;it fights to the death if the PCs press the advantage, but
  otherwise won't further contest their coming and going through the chamber.
