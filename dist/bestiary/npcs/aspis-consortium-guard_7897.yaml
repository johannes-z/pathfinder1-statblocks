BeforeCombat: >-
  If the guards have sufficient time to prepare for conflict, they drink their
  potions of shield of faith, draw crossbows, and apply oils of magic weapon to
  their crossbows.
DuringCombat: >-
  The guards fight practically, taking cover behind nearby crates, firing at the
  PCs with their crossbows, and focusing fire against particularly vulnerable or
  threatening opponents. They don't hesitate to draw scimitars and join the
  melee if ranged attacks aren't working.
Morale: A guard flees or surrenders when reduced to 3 or fewer hit points.
