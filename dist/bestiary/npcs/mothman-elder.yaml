    description: >-
      As a swift action, a mothman elder can fire a ray of devastating energy as
      a ranged touch attack that deals 8d6 points of damage (or 8d8 points of
      damage against an object, automatically bypassing hardness). This attack
      deals either acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, as chosen by the
      mothman elder at the start of its turn. This attack has a range of 180
      feet with no range increment.
  - name: Warp Elements (Su)
    description: >-
      A mothman elder's presence distorts the perceptions of those around it, to
      the point that they believe it is either suddenly swelteringly hot or
      numbingly cold. Any creature that starts its turn within 120 feet of a
      mothman elder must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or immediately succumb to
      the effects of extreme heat (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444) or extreme
      cold (Core Rulebook 442). A mothman elder can switch between emitting a
      hot or cold aura as a move action. This effect lasts as long as the target
      remains within the area of effect and for 1d6 minutes afterward. A target
      may attempt a new Will save every minute to prematurely end the effect.
      This is a mind-affecting effect-the heat and cold are not real, and thus
      energy resistance and spells like endure elements have no effect. The save
      DC is Charisma-based.
