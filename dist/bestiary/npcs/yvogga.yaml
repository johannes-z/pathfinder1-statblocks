BeforeCombat: Yvogga has already cast mage armor on herself and invisibility on her eidolon.
DuringCombat: >-
  Yvogga orders her orc minions to take the front line as she clambers up the
  slope in this room to evade the PCs. From there, she casts darkness in the
  center of the room if the PCs are relying on light to see; otherwise, she
  summons monsters and casts sleep on the strongest PCs. She resorts to bull's
  strength and her longspear only if cornered in melee.
Morale: >-
  If her orc comrades are slain and the wolf dispatched, or if her eidolon is
  defeated, Yvogga sees that the fight is clearly not going to end in her favor.
  She drops her weapon and surrenders.
Gear: scrolls of summon monster II (2), scrolls of summon monster III (2)
OtherGear: >-
  longspear, vest of escapeUE, courtier's outfit, amethyst necklace worth 50 gp,
  25 gp
