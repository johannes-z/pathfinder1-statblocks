BeforeCombat: >-
  If they hear the sounds of combat in area H1, Makko and Chiyo-hai turn
  invisible and fly, hovering near the ceiling to await intruders.
DuringCombat: >-
  If the intruders are bunched together, the ogre mages begin combat by casting
  cones of cold to catch as many foes as possible. They use invisibility and
  darkness to confuse opponents, striking with surprise and using Spring Attack
  to avoid counterattacks. They use flurry of blows against single foes to take
  them out of combat as soon as possible. If surrounded or cornered, they use
  Whirlwind Attack to strike as many opponents as possible.
Morale: >-
  The ogre mages' goal of personal aggrandizement is far more important to them
  than any loyalty to the Maka-Yika. If brought below 50 hit points, they cast
  gaseous form and flee into the ruins. But if one of them is slain, the
  surviving sibling howls in rage and fights to the death.
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork composite longbow (+8 Str) with 20 arrows, amulet of mighty fists
  +1, copper armband (worth 30 gp)
