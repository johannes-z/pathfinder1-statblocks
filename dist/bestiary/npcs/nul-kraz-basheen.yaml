BeforeCombat: >-
  Nul Kraz casts desecrate every day, covering a 40-foot-wide area encompassing
  the chamber's entrance. He and his ghuls attempt to remain with its comforting
  aura; if Princess Maldarga is present, she does likewise while keeping her
  distance from melee.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nul Kraz activates his fiendish boon, improving his falchion to a +2 unholy
  falchion, then lashes out with his touch of corruption against fellow warriors
  to fatigue and stagger them, and attempts to sunder any holy symbols wielded
  by spellcasters. He uses smite good against the first good creature that
  manages to hurt him.
Morale: Nul Kraz and his minions fight to the death.
