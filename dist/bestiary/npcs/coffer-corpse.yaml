  - name: Deceiving Death (Ex)
    description: >-
      In any round in which a coffer corpse is struck for 6 or more points of
      damage (whether or not the damage bypasses the coffer corpse's damage
      reduction), the creature slumps to the ground, seemingly destroyed. If the
      coffer corpse is strangling a victim, it releases its hold when it falls.
      On its next turn, the coffer corpse rises again as if reanimated,
      triggering its fear ability. Characters can see through this ruse with a
      successful DC 20 Sense Motive check (necromancers receive a +2
      circumstance bonus on this check).
  - name: Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that sees a coffer corpse rise after it uses its deceiving
      death ability must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be panicked for 2d4
      rounds. On a successful save, the creature is shaken for 1 round. This is
      a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Strangle (Ex)
    description: >-
      A coffer corpse grasps its victims by the throat in a crushing death grip.
      A creature that is grappled by a coffer corpse cannot speak or cast spells
      with verbal components.
