BeforeCombat: >-
  The guards approach the PCs with swords drawn and demand that they throw down
  their weapons. If they do so, the guards accept their surrender. Otherwise,
  the guards attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  The guards fight conservatively, trying to keep the PCs from escaping until
  reinforcements arrive.
Morale: >-
  The guards are playing for time and are highly confident. If a guard is
  reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, he retreats long enough to drink his
  potion of cure light wounds and rejoin the fight.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds
