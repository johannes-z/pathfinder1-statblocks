  Janks stands in the square marked X and attacks the PCs at range with his
  crossbow, preferring to target anyone wearing light or no armor first. He
  hopes to draw the PCs into the traps by making himself a target. Once the axe
  trap (T1) has been activated, Janks backs toward the staircase in the west
  wall, firing and moving each turn. Janks prefers not to fight in melee but
  will as a last resort.
