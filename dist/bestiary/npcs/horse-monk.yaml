BeforeCombat: >-
  The monk prefers to ambush foes, and uses his diamond body ability to poison
  either his spear or at least two javelins without risk to himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  The monk prefers to fight from horseback, and uses Ride-By Attack and Lunge to
  hit foes so he faces little risk of retaliation. He often uses Stunning Fist
  on the first pass, and if successful follows with a Spirited Charge. Against
  other mounted foes, he uses Improved Trip to unhorse his opponents if
  possible.
