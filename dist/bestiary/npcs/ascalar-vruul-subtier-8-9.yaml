BeforeCombat: >-
  If Ascalar knows combat is imminent, he casts mage armor and false life from
  his wands, drinks his potion of bear's endurance, and casts illusion of calm
  so he can continue to act and cast spells without looking like a threat to the
  PCs (these effects are already calculated into his statistics). He then tries
  to cast lesser globe of invulnerability, protection from arrows, and mirror
  image  if he has time. If the PCs seek to parlay first, he tries to cast
  suggestion and charm person to gain an advantage.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ascalar begins combat by targeting his foes with his hellfire infernal
  bloodline ability. He then targets the PC wearing the heaviest armor with icy
  prison. He follows that up with shout, fireball, spiked pit, force punch,
  hideous laughter, ear-piercing scream, acid arrow, and scorching ray. After he
  casts these spells, Ascalar targets foes with his wand of spontaneous
  immolation. He avoids melee at all costs.
Morale: >-
  Ascalar is a coward at heart with no true loyalty to his companions. If
  reduced to 15 hit points or less, Ascalar tries to flee to area C1 to drink
  his healing potion. If reduced to 5 hit points or less, Ascalar surrenders and
  promises to assist the PCs in any way possible if they spare his life and help
  him escape the vault. He will of course betray the PCs at the first
  opportunity.
