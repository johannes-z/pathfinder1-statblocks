SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Shrieking Frenzy (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a charau-ka can enter a state of shrieking frenzy as a free
      action. While in this state, the charauka automatically fails Stealth
      checks and cannot speak or cast spells that use verbal components (or use
      items that require command words to activate), but functions as if under
      the effects of a haste spell. The charau-ka can continue shrieking for up
      to 3 rounds, after which it is staggered for 1 round.
  - name: Thrown Weapon Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Charau-ka are masters of thrown weapons. All charau-ka gain Throw Anything
      as a bonus feat. In addition, a charau-ka gains a +1 racial bonus on all
      thrown weapons, and the threat range for thrown weapons is doubled, as if
      the charau-ka possessed the Improved Critical feat for all thrown weapons.
      This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat
      range of a weapon.
DuringCombat: >-
  The charau-ka immediately go into a frenzy, throwing themselves at the nearest
  PC with reckless abandon.
Morale: The charau-ka fight to the death. If their champion falls, they flee.
