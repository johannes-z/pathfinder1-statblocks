SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Coalesce (Su)
    description: >-
      Once a bonepowder ghoul has inflicted level drain via enervation or energy
      drain, it can assume the form of a Small humanoid as a free action. It can
      maintain this form for no more than 10 minutes before it collapses back
      into dusty form. When coalesced, a bonepowder ghoul can manipulate objects
      and make physical attacks.
  - name: Dusty Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A bonepowder ghoul's normal form is a pile of powdered bone. In this form,
      it cannot make bite or claw attacks, nor can it manipulate objects, but it
      can cast spells and use spell-like abilities and its other special
      attacks. The damage it takes from physical attacks is reduced by 50% while
      it's in dusty form.
  - name: Gravedust (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once every 3 rounds, an arcane bonepowder ghoul can
      project a 40-foot cone of grave dust. All creatures in the area must
      succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength damage
      and become infected with ghoul fever (see page 146 of Pathfinder RPG
      Bestiary, except that this version of the disease has a DC 28 save to
      resist it). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Paralysis (Su)
    description: >-
      Those hit by a bonepowder ghoul's physical attacks must succeed at a DC 28
      Fortitude save or become paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Whirlwind of Bones (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a bonepowder ghoul in dusty form can
      create a small cyclone of whirling teeth and bone fragments. All living
      creatures within 20 feet of a bonepowder ghoul's whirlwind take 2d12
      points of slashing damage (no save) and 1d6 points of Strength drain
      (Fortitude DC 28 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  A bonepowder ghoul's first act in combat is to cast time stop. It then casts
  mage armor and shield. If it has additional actions, it casts greater
  invisibility and then places areas of deeper darkness. Once it can attack
  foes, it spends the first few rounds using horrid wilting and finger of death,
  then uses energy drain on PCs so it can coalesce and then move to flank with
  others to sneak attack and paralyze victims.
Morale: >-
  Unless commanded to cease attacking by Alderpash, the arcane bonepowder ghouls
  fight to the death.
