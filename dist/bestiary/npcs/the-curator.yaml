SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      The Curator's remains are located in area C10. In order to lay him to
      rest, these remains must be brought to the surface and set before the one
      remaining spire of Guiltspur that protrudes aboveground. This causes the
      Curator's ghost to manifest amid a swirling vortex of dust over his
      remains-he glances around in anguish and despair as he realizes that the
      time of Thassilon has truly moved on. Within a few seconds, the vortex of
      air grinds his remains away to dust and his spirit is released to seek its
      reward or punishment in the afterlife. (Divination or other magical
      investigation is likely required to discover this method of putting the
      ghost to rest.)
  - name: Spell Stealing (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round as a free action whenever any of the Curator's spell
      effects affect a spellcaster, he can attempt to steal one of that
      spellcaster's prepared spells or unused spell slots. The target can resist
      this attack with a successful DC 24 Will save. If the save fails, one
      random prepared spell or unused spell slot of the highest spell level
      available to the caster is expended for the day as if it had been used,
      but without any other effect save for healing the Curator damage equal to
      twice the spell level stolen. The save DC is Charisma-based. Thassilonian
      Specialization The Curator is a Thassilonian specialist, which allows him
      to prepare the bonus transmutation spell granted by his school
      specialization twice rather than once. He treats enchantment and illusion
      spells as if they were not on the wizard spell list. Further details on
      this form of school specialization can be found on page 17 of Pathfinder
      Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic.
Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: enchantment, illusion
BeforeCombat: The Curator casts quickened shield and extended mage armor before attacking.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Curator casts extended haste and quickened glitterdust on the first round
  of combat, then follows up by favoring spells that cause lengthy or permanent
  problems to the PCs rather than attempting to simply hurt them&#8211;he wants
  to stop the PCs in their tracks with flesh to stone, baleful polymorph, or
  blindness/ deafness if possible. If a lower-level spell is particularly
  effective, he uses mnemonic enhancer to recall it. He's also fond of splitting
  up the party by using spells like hungry pit or wall of fire to control the
  battlefield, and of forcing the PCs to stumble into new rooms before they
  might be ready. The Curator knows how all of the dangers in the Silent Halls
  work, and does his best to try to lure the PCs into those dangers.
Morale: >-
  The Curator knows that if he dies, he merely returns in 2d4 days. He fights
  until destroyed without remorse, but if reduced to fewer than 75 hit points,
  he knows that he's running out of time in the short term, and at this point
  does his best to lure the PCs into peril to distract them, preferring to use
  malevolence in the attempt to possess a PC and then force that PC to go find
  an untriggered encounter or unsprung trap.
Gear: >-
  cloak of resistance +3, headband of mental prowess +2 (Int, Cha; grants ranks
  in Perception)&#8211;both ghostly objects can be found in their physical form
  in area C10
