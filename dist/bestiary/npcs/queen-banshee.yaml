SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Great Wail (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round, a queen banshee may wail as a full-round action. The wail
      lasts until the beginning of her next turn. All creatures within 40 feet
      of the banshee when she begins her wail, as well as all creatures that end
      their turn within that radius, must make a DC 32 Fortitude save. (This
      save is only required once per wail.) Creatures under the effects of a
      fear effect take a -4 penalty on this save. Creatures that make their save
      are sickened for 1d6 rounds. Those that fail take 200 points of damage (as
      if affected by a CL 20th wail of the banshee). If a wailing banshee is
      damaged during a wail, she must make a Will save (DC 5 + damage taken) to
      maintain the wail; otherwise it ends. This is a sonic death effect.
      Banshee wails are supernaturally powerful, and penetrate the effect of any
      spell of 3rd level or lower that creates silence. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Hear Heartbeat (Ex)
    description: >-
      A banshee can sense the beating hearts of living creatures within 60 feet,
      as if it had the blindsight ability.
  - name: Terror (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature damaged by the banshee's touch attack must make a DC 32 Will
      save. Failure means that the victim cowers in fear for 1d3 rounds. If a
      target is protected against fear by a dispellable effect (such as heroes'
      feast or mind blank), the banshee's touch attempts to dispel one such
      effect with greater dispel magic (CL 20th). Negative energy damage caused
      by a banshee's touch can only harm the living; it cannot heal undead. This
      is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
