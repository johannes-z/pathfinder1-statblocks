SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Chilling Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      A temple servitor's slam attack deals an additional 1d6 points of cold
      damage, and creatures struck by it are slowed for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC
      19 negates). This variant ability originally appeared on page 71 of
      Pathfinder Adventure Path #81: Shifting Sands and replaces the normal
      mummified creature's dust stroke ability.
  - name: Entangling Wrappings (Su)
    description: >-
      A temple servitor can unravel and detach some of its linen strips to
      attempt a grapple combat maneuver check against a creature up to 20 feet
      away. This attack doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. It can
      constrict for 2d6+11 points of damage with a successful grapple combat
      maneuver check. The linen strips remain wrapped around the victim and
      attempt a grapple combat maneuver check to pin each round on the mummy's
      turn. They continue to deal constrict damage on a successful check. The
      wrappings cannot be damaged by any attack or effect while detached, but
      turn to dust if their victim escapes or dies, or if the mummy is
      destroyed. If the mummy still lives, its wrappings reappear at the end of
      its next turn. The mummy is not inconvenienced in any way while its
      wrappings are detached and grappling, but it cannot use its wrappings to
      entangle again until they return. This variant ability originally appeared
      on page 71 of Pathfinder Adventure Path #81: Shifting Sands and replaces
      the normal mummified creature's burst of vengeance ability.
DuringCombat: >-
  If accompanying Dybellos, the temple servitors attempt to remain within the
  daughter of Urgathoa's desecrate aura, from which they gain an additional 14
  hit points and a +1 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving
  throws.
Morale: The temple servitors fight until destroyed.
Gear: hide armor, headband of alluring charisma +4
