SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ectoplasm Ball (Su)
    description: >-
      A wall warden can throw a ball of ectoplasm up to 30 feet at an opponent's
      face as a ranged touch attack. It if hits, the target takes damage as
      though from the wall warden's corrupting touch and is blinded. Each round
      on its turn, the target can attempt a DC 19 Reflex save as a free action;
      if successful, the target shakes off the ectoplasm and is no longer
      blinded. The target or an adjacent creature can wipe off the ectoplasm as
      a standard action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Vulnerable to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      Despite a wall warden's incorporeal nature, a transmute mud to rock spell
      deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to any wall warden in the area
      and automatically staggers it for 2d6 rounds.
DuringCombat: >-
  A wall warden prefers to take over a host body using its malevolence ability,
  keeping this puppet as a hostage and using telekinesis to hurl rocks at other
  foes. If unsuccessful at possessing a living enemy, it adopts a hit-and-run
  approach, using its Spring Attack feat to dive  between walls and attack with
  its ectoplasm ball and corrupting touch.
Morale: >-
  A wall warden reduced to fewer than 25 hit points flees, but it lurks nearby
  and lunges out again whenever its targets are injured or distracted. A wounded
  wall warden that attacks in this way fights until destroyed. After it
  rejuvenates, the wall warden resumes its patrols of the Catacombs once again.
