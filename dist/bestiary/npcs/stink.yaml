DuringCombat: >-
  Stink is a coward, and never begins combat. It prefers to whine and cry, even
  if attacked. That said, once it's reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, it
  suddenly flies into a furious rage&#8211;this replaces its cowardice and sends
  it into a rampage of unleashed anger. At this point, Stink attacks the nearest
  foe in sight. It reverts to its cowardly persona only once no obvious living
  targets remain.
Morale: Stink fights to the death.
