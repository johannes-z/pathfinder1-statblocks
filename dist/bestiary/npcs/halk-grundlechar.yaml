    description: >-
      Halk has been drunk for days, and currently has the sickened condition
      (already applied to his statistics above). If he escapes or the PCs
      retreat, he requires 1d4 days to sober up, at which point his attack
      rolls, damage rolls, skill bonuses, and saving throws all increase by 2
      and his Challenge Rating increases by 1.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Halk is a vicious practical joker when drunk, and after beginning his raging
  song to goad the spriggans into action, he targets enemies with grease to make
  them fall, then targets an ally with hideous laughter, all while letting his
  korrigan club fight on his behalf. Afterward, he casts mirror image on himself
  and wades in for a good brawl. He ultimately would rather take any intruders
  prisoner to keep for entertainment, and readily accepts any surrenders.
Morale: Halk is too drunk to consider his own mortality, and fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  potion of bear's endurance, scrolls of cure moderate wounds (3), scroll of
  invisibility
OtherGear: >-
  +1 chain shirt, korrigan club (see the sidebar), mwk dagger, mwk frame drum,
  red wool scarf (worth 15 gp), scroll case, silver tankard shaped like an old
  dwarven woman (worth 50 gp)
