SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Infested (Su)
    description: >-
      Diurgez is immune to damage and effects caused by swarms, and can elect to
      exclude swarms from taking any damage from his energy-based attacks. He
      can direct the actions of any mindless swarm within 90 feet as a free
      action. Three times per day as a swift action, he can expel a fiendish
      advanced tick swarm from his body; the swarm appears in any four
      contiguous 10-foot squares adjacent to him, has a fly speed of 50 ft.
      (perfect), and lasts until it is slain.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Diurgez releases a swarm of ticks each round during the first 3 rounds, and is
  fond of holding victims within these swarms' confines via telekinesis. He
  doesn't bother making attacks against foes unless they manage to actually
  damage him, at which point he stops playing around and uses his deadly weapons
  to their full effect.
Morale: Diurgez fights to the death.
Gear: +5 defending battleaxe, master's lash
