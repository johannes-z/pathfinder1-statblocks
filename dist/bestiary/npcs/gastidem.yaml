SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Flayleaf Addiction (Ex)
    description: >-
      Gastidem is addicted to the potent drug flayleaf, which he grows himself
      and chews throughout the day. The narcotic grants him a +2 alchemical
      bonus on saves against mind-affecting effects, gives him the fatigued
      condition, and deals 1 point of Wisdom damage. The fatigued condition is
      already calculated into his statistics, but the ability damage is not
      enough to lower his effective Wisdom modifier (though it stacks with other
      Wisdom-damaging effects). For more information on flayleaf, drugs, and
      addictions, see pages 236-237 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Gastidem knows he's outnumbered and not in any condition to fight. He does his
  best to defend himself, all the while trying to maintain the ruse of
  encouraging the PCs to attempt the Kiss of Korada.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 5 or fewer hit points, Gastidem surrenders and begs the PCs for
  forgiveness and mercy, hoping he can distract them by placing blame on Dakang.
Gear: leather armor, dagger, flayleaf (4 doses)
