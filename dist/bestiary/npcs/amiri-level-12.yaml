DuringCombat: >-
  Amiri rages whenever she's in combat, preferring to fight in her enemies'
  faces rather than attacking from range&#8211;a practice she often describes
  uncharitably as "the coward's way." She uses Power Attack and Cleave at every
  opportunity, though if she has difficulty hitting a target that particularly
  infuriates her, she either forgoes the extra damage and uses powerful blow to
  make up the shortfall, or combines her Power Attack with surprise accuracy to
  keep her chance to hit high. She bull rushes foes into positions where they
  can be flanked.
