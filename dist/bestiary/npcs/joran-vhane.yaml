BeforeCombat: >-
  Joran casts lesser restoration daily to fight his sleep deprivation. Before
  battle, he casts bear's endurance.
DuringCombat: >-
  Joran doesn't immediately join the fight&#8211;he instead hangs back and casts
  spells on the PCs, suggesting that they leave Drezen or trying to blind them
  or stun them so that the babaus can make sneak attacks. Once one babau is
  slain, he joins the fight, but he does so while fighting defensively the whole
  time. He casts healing spells on himself whenever he drops below 45 hit
  points.
Morale: >-
  Joran is a coward at heart. If reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, he drops
  to his knees and begs for mercy. Any babaus who still live shriek in delight
  at this and move quickly to kill the dwarf if they can.
Gear: wand of silence (8 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +2 fire resistance banded mail, +1 heavy steel shield, +1 spell storing light
  hammer, 9 gp
