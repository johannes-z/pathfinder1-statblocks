    description: >-
      Zombies have poor reflexes and can only perform a single move action or
      standard action each round. A zombie can move up to its speed and attack
      in the same round as a charge action.
  - name: Zyphus Rot (Su)
    description: >-
      When a Zyphus zombie kills a living creature and feeds on it, the zombie
      passes on a magical disease called Zyphus rot that causes the victim to
      quickly animate and rise as a zombie in 1d4 minutes. Once risen, the new
      zombie no longer carries Zyphus rot and can't pass it to another living
      creature. A corpse can be "cured" of Zyphus rot by receiving a cure
      disease spell prior to reanimation. A Zyphus zombie cannot be cured of the
      disease unless the artifact that caused it is destroyed. Any creature with
      more than 10 HD is immune to the effects of Zyphus rot. Zyphus rot only
      affects corporeal creatures (other than undead) that have a skeletal
      system.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The zombie stands in the northeast hallway of the crypt. Once he hears the
  PCs, he moves down the 10-foot-wide hallway toward A2, but stops at the pit
  (T3). Having already stepped into the pit once, he knows not to try to cross
  it.
DuringCombat: >-
  Should the PCs spot the zombie and ignore him, he wanders north and comes at
  the PCs from another angle (he will not cross T3). He attacks the first PC he
  sees and mindlessly bludgeons her until she's unconscious before shifting to
  the next nearest PC.
Morale: The zombie fights until destroyed.
