BeforeCombat: >-
  If Galenna is near a civilized area, she presses others into service to assist
  her in an upcoming battle. No town can deny her access to whatever guard they
  have, and she has been known to demand that even farmers fight for her.
  Galenna casts invisibility and enters combat with chill touch when she deems
  the moment right.
DuringCombat: >-
  Galenna recognizes fellow spellcasters and attempts to disable them first with
  her offensive spells and her wand of magic missile. She then casts sleet storm
  to catch the largest number of enemies in its area, even if this means
  damaging her allies.
Morale: >-
  Galenna is unafraid of death, knowing that her sisters will eventually recover
  her body and restore her to life, but she prefers to avoid being killed if it
  is within her power to do so. If things go poorly in a battle, she uses her
  potion of gaseous form to escape.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of gaseous form, scroll of dispel
  magic, scroll of obscuring mist, scroll of tiny hut, wand of magic missile (CL
  3rd, 30 charges)
