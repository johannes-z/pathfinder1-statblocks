BeforeCombat: >-
  As soon as she hears the PCs approaching (either due to a fight against the
  wights or the triggering of the glyph of warding in area 2), Avalexi assumes
  the form of "Lex Avai," teleports into the cell, and prepares to trick the PCs
  as detailed above.
DuringCombat: >-
  Avalexi's first act in combat after her death attack attempt is to retreat to
  her cell to retrieve her bow and arrows. She then teleports into the catacombs
  (area 2), attempts to summon a babau demon to send back to attack the PCs,
  then attempts to use her wand via Use Magic Device to arm herself with a flame
  blade before assuming her true form and teleporting back into area 3 to
  continue the fight 3 rounds after she first teleported away. In her natural
  form, the redheaded succubus looks uncannily like a demonic version of the
  goddess Sarenrae&#8211;especially with her flaming scimitar. Avalexi
  blasphemously acts the part, claiming to be the true scion of the Dawnflower
  and accusing any obvious worshipers of Sarenrae of being heretics. She uses
  dominate person and charm monster on any foes that seem to be particularly
  good at harming her, using vampiric touch on heavily armored foes to hurt them
  and heal herself whenever she's brought below 40 hit points.
Morale: >-
  Avalexi has put too much work into corrupting the shrine to want to abandon
  it, and as such she fights almost to the death. If reduced to fewer than 10
  hit points, she teleports elsewhere to recover and, for the time, abandons her
  plans for the shrine. In this event, the PCs have still effectively disrupted
  her short-term plans, but Avalexi might become a recurring villain if you
  continue beyond this adventure.
