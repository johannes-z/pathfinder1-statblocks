  The gloom dragons tries to hamper and fell as many PCs as possible, using the
  portals to flit around the Town Square and evade those that try to engage them
  in melee, and using greater invisibility as often as they can. They treasure
  their wands, and they only use them if they are concerned that the PCs may win
  the fight or the PCs otherwise prove to be a major threat.

  A gloom dragon flees if it is reduced below 12 hit points, and both flee if
  all of their other allies have fallen or fled.
