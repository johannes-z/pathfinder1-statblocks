BeforeCombat: >-
  Svendack casts lesser restoration, heroes' feast, greater magic weapon, and
  magic vestment daily. Baphomet has given her descriptions of the PCs, and she
  may cast greater scrying now and then to observe them at your discretion.
  Before combat, she casts air walk, freedom of movement, stoneskin, and unholy
  aura.
DuringCombat: >-
  Svendack is delighted to finally have a chance to defeat the PCs and return
  home, and cackles gleefully as she begins the fight, lamenting that "other
  responsibilities prevent me from giving you the lingering, painful deaths you
  deserve." She lets her tarry demodand minions engage the PCs in melee at first
  while she uses air walk to stay at range and fight with her spells, starting
  with her most powerful ranged spells and augmenting them with quickened magic
  as she gets the chance. Remember, she can use faith's reach to use touch
  spells at range. She prefers saving her mythic power to fuel mythic spells
  rather than to surge, and prefers to avoid using enlarge person unless she's
  only facing one enemy.
Morale: >-
  Svendack is among Baphomet's most loyal followers, but she also realizes that
  if she dies, she can no longer serve him. If reduced to fewer than 40 hit
  points, she uses plane shift to escape to her home, takes the time to recover,
  then returns to the Ineluctable Prison and makes her way to the herald's
  prison (area P), where she makes her last stand against the PCs, fighting at
  the herald's side.
Gear: scrolls of heal (2)

  headband of inspired wisdom +6, mythic amulet of the Abyss (see page 63), ring
