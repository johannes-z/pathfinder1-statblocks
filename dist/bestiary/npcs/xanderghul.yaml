SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Contingency (Sp)
    description: >-
      If an active displacement spell on him ends, a new displacement spell is
      cast on him. Deific Xanderghul can grant divine spells. This does not
      require any specific action on his behalf. He grants access to the domains
      of Evil, Law, and Trickery and to the subdomains of Deception and Tyranny.
      His symbol is a peacock feather with an eye inside, and his favored weapon
      is the lucerne hammerUE.
  - name: Enshrined (Ex)
    description: >-
      As long as the Peacock Shrine in area O3 remains active, if Xanderghul is
      slain, his body and shadow gear vanish, only to be restored in area O3
      after 1 minute. Being restored in this manner otherwise functions as true
      resurrection. If Xanderghul is slain while this Peacock Shrine is
      inactive, he dies normally and his shadow gear dissipates into nothing.
  - name: Exceptional Statistics (Ex)
    description: >-
      Xanderghul's ability scores were generated using a 25-point buy, and he
      has a +5 inherent bonus to all six ability scores. This increases his
      final CR to 17.
  - name: Permanent Spells (Sp)
    description: >-
      Xanderghul has these permanent spells: arcane sight, see invisibility, and
      tongues.
  - name: Runelink (Ex)
    description: >-
      Xanderghul's mind is linked to a rune that allows him to commnicate with
      his minion Tuirziaz. If this rune is destroyed (see area M10), Xanderghul
      gains one permanent negative level. As long as he has this negative level,
      he also takes a -8 penalty on concentration checks.
  - name: Shadow Gear (Su)
    description: >-
      Xanderghul carries shadowy duplicates of his favorite possessions,
      including a Sihedron Tome. These items function normally in all ways, save
      that if Xanderghul is killed, the items vanish along with his body. The
      Sihedron Tome functions as Xanderghul's spellbook, and it contains all of
      his prepared spells as well as all sorcerer/ wizard spells (save those of
      the schools of conjuration and transmutation) from the Pathfinder RPG Core
      Rulebook (at your discretion, it might contain more spells than these).
      The Sihedron Tome allows Xanderghul to prepare additional spells as if his
      Intelligence score were 6 points higher.
Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: conjuration, transmutation
BeforeCombat: Xanderghul casts mind blank and nondetection.
DuringCombat: >-
  Xanderghul avoids melee combat if possible and engages the PCs through a
  projected image if he can. Otherwise, he casts quickened greater invisibility
  and mage's sword the first round, quickened displacement and prismatic spray
  the second round, and quickened mirror image and prismatic spray again on the
  third round. He casts quickened magic missile combined with other combat
  spells over the following rounds.
Morale: >-
  As long as the Peacock Shrine in area O3 remains active, Xanderghul fearlessly
  fights to the death. If this shrine is destroyed, though, Xanderghul sees the
  folly of resistance, and his pride finally breaks if he's reduced to 20 or
  fewer hit points. He promises to help the PCs if they spare his life.
