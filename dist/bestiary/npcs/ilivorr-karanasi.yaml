  - name: s Familiar (Ex)
    description: >-
      A witch forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her
      magic and helps to guide her along her path. Instead of a spellbook,
      Ilivorr must commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. A
      witch's familiar otherwise functions like the wizard's arcane bond class
      feature.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ilivorr casts false life on herself each day. In preparation for the arrival
  of the PCs in the cenotaph, she uses her flight hex, drinks her potion of
  barkskin, uses her stone salve, and activates her boots of speed. She casts
  greater heroism, spectral hand, and see invisibility from her hand of glory.
  Ilivorr then casts grease directly in front of the clock portal and readies an
  action to release 3 charges from her ring of the ram at the doughtiest
  fighter.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ilivorr uses her flight hex to stay airborne away from the PCs. She casts
  spells that can affect multiple foes, such as mass hold monster, wail of the
  banshee, chain lightning, or black tentacles. She targets a spellcaster with
  feeblemind or her agony hex, and uses her death curse, forced reincarnation,
  and retribution hexes on anyone who closes to fight in melee. She uses her
  spectral hand to deliver vampiric touches from her wand.
Morale: Ilivorr defends the cenotaph and its contents to the death.
Gear: >-
  potion of barkskin (CL 12th), ring of the ram (35 charges), stone salve, wand
  of vampiric touch (CL 20th, 21 charges)
