BeforeCombat: >-
  A Peacock Spirit priest drinks a potion of barkskin +3 before battle if
  possible.
DuringCombat: >-
  Encountered in small numbers, Peacock Spirit priests open fights with flame
  strike and unholy blight. In larger groups, they hang back and cast sanctuary,
  followed by air walk, bull's strength, and divine favor before entering
  combat. A priest casts invisibility on himself if he's reduced to 30 or fewer
  hit points and then takes time to cast healing spells on himself and retreat
  to a better tactical position before reengaging in combat.
Morale: A Peacock Spirit priest fights to the death while protecting the temple.
