  - name: Arcane Reinforcement (Ex)
    description: >-
      A wyrwood mage is made from magically grown material that grants it
      several benefits. The wyrwood gains fast healing 5 and fire resistance 10.
      It can see through all types of fog and smoke, and it is treated as two
      size categories larger when determining bonus hit points based on its
      size.
  - name: Programmed Spells (Ex)
    description: >-
      A wyrwood mage is specifically programmed with a number of spells equal to
      its Intelligence modifier. The wyrwood mage can prepare these programmed
      spells without referring to a spellbook, and other creatures can attempt
      to learn a programmed spell from a destroyed wyrwood mage as though its
      body were a spellbook. These wyrwood mages are programmed with fireball,
      greater dispel magic, mass hold person, overland flight, and wall of fire.
BeforeCombat: A wyrwood mage casts mage armor, overland flight, and shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  A wyrwood mage keeps it distance using flight, harrying its foes with spells

  casting of fireball or lightning bolt when necessary to catch multiple
  opponents.
