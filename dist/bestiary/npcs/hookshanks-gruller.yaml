DuringCombat: >-
  Hookshanks orders the orphans to attack the PCs (they do so if Hookshanks
  succeeds at a DC 9 Intimidate check), then moves to open the door to area A4
  to yell out an alarm and let Bloo enter the fray. He prefers to use his kukri
  in melee combat against intruders.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 4 hit points or fewer, Hookshanks attempts to flee into the
  slums. If caught, he begs for his life and promises to tell the PCs everything
  about the fishery in return for mercy. He knows more or less everything about
  the place except for what's in Gaedren's den (area A14).
