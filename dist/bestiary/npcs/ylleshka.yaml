  - name: Conjoined (Ex)
    description: >-
      When she's targeted with a mind-affecting effect, Ylleshka can roll twice
      and use the higher result.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Ylleshka starts combat via project image if she can. If the PCs begin in the
  Crimson Cage, she starts filling it with blade barriers. She uses telekinesis
  to push any PCs who enter the main throne room through blade barriers or into
  pools of lava. She simply replenishes lost projected images until the PCs
  confront her in her lair, whereupon she casts fly on the first round of combat
  and then makes use of her prodigious number of attacks to cut the PCs down. If
  she's being hit too often, she starts allocating bonuses from her defending
  longswords to her Armor Class. She remains highly mobile in combat, taking
  advantage of both her fleet charge and fleet warrior champion abilities. This
  tactic, combined with her enormous number of attacks, can catch most foes off
  guard, but in order to stay mobile, she generally drops any grappled foes
  she's constricted with her tail attack as soon as her turn is over. She only
  continues to constrict and crush a grabbed enemy once no other foes remain
  standing.  Ylleshka's pride is enormous&#8211;she almost never takes advantage
  of her ability to summon aid in combat, preferring to save this ability for
  minor uses like calling in a demon to torment or force into service. And
  indeed, with her strength and skill at arms, she rarely needs help in battle! 
  If Ylleshka is forced to use greater teleport, she must leave her breastplate
  behind. When not wearing it, she always allocates all of her swords' defensive
  bonuses to her AC.
Morale: >-
  Ylleshka flees if reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, teleporting to either
  area L or area I to recruit aid and gather the keys needed to leave the
  prison. If she finds either Svendack or Plorig-Stagul has been defeated, she
  then teleports to just inside the Groaning Gates. If they've both been
  destroyed, she flees, intending to abandon her post and seek a new lord. If
  she becomes trapped, she teleports to area P and prepares to make a last stand
  against the PCs at the side of the Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth.
Gear: >-
