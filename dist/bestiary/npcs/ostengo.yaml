    description: >-
      Ostengo has a +1 natural armor bonus to his Armor Class. This replaces the
      normal tiefling darkness spell-like ability.
Gender: Male
Bloodline: infernal
DuringCombat: >-
  Ostengo does his best to play up his disturbing appearance; if he can trick
  enemies into a panic by convincing them they face a mummy, he'll play the
  part. Further, attempts to use fire against him are unlikely to do much damage
  at this low level due to his resistance. He uses charm person to take
  weak-willed creatures out of the fight (suggesting that the charmed person go
  home for more potions or try to convince his friends to stop fighting) and
  magic missile to damage hard-to-hit targets. When he runs out of 1st-level
  spells he relies on acid splash and daze in the same manner, and uses bleed on
  fallen opponents that any PC healers try to stabilize.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 5 hp or fewer (or if only two of his thug guards are still
  alive), Ostengo flees into area G4 and closes the door behind him. On his next
  turn he uses a tanglefoot bag to seal the door behind him for 2d4 rounds (it's
  a DC 17 Strength check to break open the sealed door) even if this means he
  traps his allies on the same side of the door as the PCs. He then flees to
  warn the other Bastards and join his brother in defending the lair.
Gear: tanglefoot bag, potion of cure light wounds
