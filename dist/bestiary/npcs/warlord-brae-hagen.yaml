BeforeCombat: >-
  If he is alerted by noise above or by someone triggering the trap in area A2,
  Brae-Hagen immediately pulls the lever to open the mouth. As the mouth of the
  bunker opens, he casts bull's strength and shield on himself. If given
  additional time, he casts darkness on his spear.
DuringCombat: >-
  Brae-Hagen initially moves to engage heavy melee opponents, using his arcane
  pool for pool strike bonuses and saving his frigid touch and shocking grasp
  for targets he believes he can easily spellstrike. If he flies outside the
  mouth of the bunker, he uses glitterdust to blind his enemies before
  re-entering and engaging, either from the mouth or by breaking through the
  eyes in area A3.
Morale: >-
  When reduced below 35 hp, Brae-Hagen retreats outside the bunker, vowing, "I
  shall break you at the gates of Jormurdun!" Contrary to this, he flies out and
  casts vanish (PCs must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to hear the verbal
  components over the throng of battle below). He prefers to wait for a PC to
  step to the edge of the bunker's mouth, at which point he casts hydraulic push
  to knock them into the canyon (see the Falling Into War sidebar). However, if
  no PC takes his bait, he takes an opportunity to heal before rejoining the
  combat and fighting to the death.
