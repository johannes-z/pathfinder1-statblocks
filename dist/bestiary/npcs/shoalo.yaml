  - name: Water Dependent (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gillman's body requires constant submersion in fresh or salt water.

      water risk internal organ failure, painful cracking of the skin, and death
      within 4d6 hours.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  The gillmen's first goal is to escape with the Pathfinders' artifact, and once
  they have it in hand, they withdraw until they get out the door, jumping into
  the water and swimming away. If the PCs block their exit or hold onto the
  artifact, the two focus their attacks on whoever stands in their way or
  possesses the relic.
Morale: >-
  If the gillmen haven't managed to grab the relic or can't escape, they fight
  to the death. As soon as they have the Azlanti artifact in hand, they attempt
  to flee.
Gear: >-
  light crossbow with 10 bolts, spear, small sharkskin pouch with Aspis
