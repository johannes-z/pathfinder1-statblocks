BeforeCombat: >-
  When she becomes aware the PCs are drawing near, Luersa casts eagle's splendor
  on herself and uses fiendish boon to make her longsword magical.
DuringCombat: >-
  If anyone accepts the antipaladin's challenge, she requests the melee take
  place on the landing near the stairs. Using the Shield Slam feat in
  combination with her cruelty ability, Luersa attempts to drive the combat down
  the stairs, where Dulvan can join in, or near the library at area L8. More
  than anything else, Luersa despises the church of Iomedae. If a PC openly
  wears the sword and starburst, Luersa specifically challenges him, activating
  her smite good ability as she calls him out. If the PCs refuse her challenge
  and fight her as a group, she tries to get assistance from Dulvan or retreats
  into area L10 to get the embalming bear to attack the PCs. She doesn't stay
  and fight on her own.
