  Giggles lives up to his name in combat, chortling and snickering at anything
  remotely funny (and often at things that aren't funny at all). He focuses his
  attacks on whoever struck him most recently in a combat. Giggles uses his
  Bludgeoner feat to deal nonlethal damage with his flail at first, hoping to
  catch the PCs alive for later interrogation, but if he's reduced to 15 or
  fewer hit points, he starts dealing lethal damage instead. He drinks a potion
  of cure light wounds whenever he's reduced to fewer than 5 hit points, if he
  can disengage from melee.
Morale: Giggles fights to the death.
Gear: potions of cure light wounds (3)
OtherGear: chainmail, composite longbow (+3 Str) with 20 arrows, flail, 72 gp
