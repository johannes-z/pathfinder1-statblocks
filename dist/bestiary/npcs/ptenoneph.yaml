SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Thought Draining Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Ptenoneph's death, caused by his own failed attempt to drain his thoughts
      into a canopic jar, grant him a ravenous hunger for new thoughts that he
      can drink in through his eyes. This manifests as a gaze attack with a
      range of 30 feet that deals 1d4 points of Intelligence drain (Will DC 23
      negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.
Gender: Male
Bloodline: destined
BeforeCombat: >-
  In the unlikely event that Ptenoneph has a chance to prepare for combat, he
  casts mage armor and shield. (Since he's unlikely to be able to do so, these
  bonuses are not calculated into his stat block.)
DuringCombat: >-
  Ptenoneph favors magic over other attacks, but also wants to preserve PCs so
  he can interrogate them. He uses dominate person and suggestion to try to
  compel the PCs to cease attacking and follow his commands. Against foes who
  are particularly resistant to mind-affecting effects, he resorts instead to
  flesh to stone. On the first 2 rounds of combat, he casts quickened mage armor
  and quickened shield. If faced with someone who wears the Mask of the
  Forgotten Pharaoh or otherwise bears the visage of Hakotep, Ptenoneph becomes
  enraged and overwhelmed with memories of his old master. In this case, he
  abandons spellcasting and focuses his corrupting touch attacks on that target.
Morale: Ptenoneph fights until destroyed.
