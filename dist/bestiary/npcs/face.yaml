BeforeCombat: The face uses magic to try to win over potential enemies and avoid combat.
Morale: >-
  The face avoids direct clashes whenever possible, preferring to let brawnier
  allies go toe to toe against foes. If she cannot use her glib tongue to soothe
  enemies and halt the fight, she flees. She casts innocence if the authorities
  get involved.
