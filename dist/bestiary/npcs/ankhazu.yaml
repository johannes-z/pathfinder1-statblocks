  - name: Fatal Fate (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Ankhazu can lay a compulsive curse upon the living, forcing
      them to take up her work or face a terrible end. Ankhazu can lay this
      curse by making a touch attack, which forces the target to attempt a DC 18
      Will save; failure means being stunned for 1 round. During this round, the
      target receives a flood of images suggesting a course of action-though it
      might remain vague or require research into the ghost's history to discern
      an exact meaning. The target has 10 days to fulfill Ankhazu's intentions.
      If the target does not fulfill the course of action suggested by the
      vision within this set period, it takes 1d4 points of Constitution drain
      per day. This effect can be overcome via the spell remove curse, requiring
      a caster level check versus DC 18. The save DC is Charisma-based. (This
      ghost special attack originally appeared on page 25 of Pathfinder Campaign
      Setting: Classic Horrors Revisited.)

      The only way to permanently destroy Ankhazu is to cast a consecrate spell
      upon her mortal remains (see Development, below) and then burn them. As
      long as her remains exist, her spirit restores itself in 2d4 days.
