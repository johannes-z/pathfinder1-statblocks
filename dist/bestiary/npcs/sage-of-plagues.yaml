    description: >-
      Any creature that confirms a critical hit against the allip with a
      piercing or slashing melee weapon breaks off a piece of its mad essence.
      Melee weapons with reach don't endanger their users in this way. The
      attacker briefly becomes enveloped by a cloud of insanity mist (inhaled;
      save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Wis; cure 1
      save).
DuringCombat: >-
  The Sage of Plagues begins combat by debilitating one or more enemies with a
  spell-like ability and then attacks anyone holding a shard of the shattered
  ruby or a nearby foe. So long as it has spell-like abilities remaining, the
  Sage of Plagues alternates between using those and its maddening touch. It
  prefers to use bestow curse and disfiguring touch on creatures it knows can
  hurt it, and it saves inflict moderate wounds to heal itself. It pursues
  fleeing enemies but does not go outside.
