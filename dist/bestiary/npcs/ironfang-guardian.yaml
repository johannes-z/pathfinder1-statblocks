BeforeCombat: >-
  Kosseruk's guardians take turns maintaining shield other spells on her
  throughout the day. If they hear combat begin, they cast protection from
  energy and spell immunity on Kosseruk, relying on scouting reports and 
  observations during the battle to make educated guesses about the tactics the
  PCs may use.
DuringCombat: >-
  In combat, the guardians stick close to Kosseruk to defend her with the
  Bodyguard feat, and cast cure and restoration spells as necessary. If they
  have a moment to take the offense, they cast spiritual weapon on opponents and
  righteous might on themselves.
Morale: >-
  The Ironfang guardians are elite slaves, raised from birth to die for their
  charges. They fight to the death.
Gear: >-
  +2 chainmail, +1 heavy steel shield, mwk light flail, cloak of resistance +2,
