BeforeCombat: >-
  The lunarma casts mage armor and shield on itself before entering combat. It
  casts unseen servant daily (mostly to aid it in manipulating small elements in
  the ship).
DuringCombat: >-
  The lunarma prefers to utilize its spells from range, but in combat it attacks
  with its tentacles and mindrender (when it attacks with the mindrender, it
  gives up a tentacle attack). The creature generally tries to remain out of
  reach from foes but in reach with its tentacles so it doesn't provoke attacks
  of opportunity when it fires the weapon in combat. It uses its unseen servant
  to pick up and retrieve objects dropped by the PCs if the opportunity arises.
Morale: >-
  The engine attendant doesn't pursue foes out of the wreck, but fights to the
  death and chases PCs relentlessly for the honor of its rotting home as long as
  intruders remain inside of it.
