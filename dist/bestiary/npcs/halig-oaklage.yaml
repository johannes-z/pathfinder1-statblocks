BeforeCombat: >-
  In his home, Halig has two guards (NE male ghoul fighters 1) nearby at all
  times, and is quick to summon them if he is in danger. If there are chattel
  about, Halig also summons them to fight at his side&#8211; even if only to
  distract his opponents for a moment.
DuringCombat: >-
  Halig uses his channel energy ability to heal himself and his undead allies or
  to injure living opponents. He targets his largest enemy's weapon with

  paralyze as many opponents as possible.
Morale: Halig uses his darkness spell to flee if the combat turns against him.
