BeforeCombat: >-
  Shimazi used nightdrops, then cast magic vestment, greater magic weapon,
  bear's endurance, enlarge person, entropic shield, and divine favor in his
  confrontation with Amara and Tsuneo. All but divine shield are still active
  when the PCs arrive, and he recasts divine shield at that time. Shimazi used
  many other spells fighting Amara and Tsuneo; when the PCs arrive, Shimazi has
  only two 4th-level spell slots, two 3rd-level spell slots, three 2nd-level
  spell slots, and one 1st-level spell slot remaining.
DuringCombat: >-
  If no PCs directly confront him, Shimazi casts wall of fire to split the PCs,
  trusting the saboteur to distract ranged threats. Shimazi relishes melee
  combat but casts fog cloud if harassed by ranged weapons and spells.
Morale: >-
  Shimazi has dedicated a tremendous number of Golden League resources to this
  mission, and he has craved an opportunity to exact revenge against the Way of
  the Kirin for years. As a result, he fights to the death.
