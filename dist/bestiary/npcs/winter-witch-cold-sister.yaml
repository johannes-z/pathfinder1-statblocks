SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cold Flesh (Ex)
    description: >-
      A winter witch gains endure elements as a constant, spell-like ability,
      but only against cold temperatures. At 4th level, she gains cold
      resistance 5, making her comfortable in near-freezing temperatures. This
      replaces the witch's 4th-level hex.
  - name: Freeze and Thaw (Su)
    description: >-
      At 2nd level, a winter witch can freeze water or melt ice and snow with a
      touch. As a standard action, a winter witch can melt an adjacent 5-foot
      cube of ice or 10-foot cube of snow. Melting snow produces a volume of
      water equal to 10% the snow's volume. Alternatively, a winter witch can
      freeze 5 cubic feet of water into solid ice. This freezing takes place
      gradually over 1 round, making it almost impossible to trap a creature
      unless it's helpless. This ability cannot affect water within a creature.
      One cubic foot of ice contains roughly 8 gallons of water and weighs about
      60 pounds. This ability works on fresh water and saltwater, but has no
      affect on water creatures; on liquids (frozen or otherwise) other than
      water; or on magical water, ice, or snow. A winter witch can use this
      ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level.
      Hyperboreal Patronage A winter witch's patron reveals an icy aspect. A
      winter witch adds the following spells to her spell list at the following
      class levels, but does not automatically learn them: 3rd-wall of ice,
      5th&#8211;icy prisonUM, 7th&#8211;freezing sphere. Ice Magic When a winter
      witch casts a spell with the cold descriptor, the save DC of the spell
      increases by 1. A winter witch cannot learn or cast spells with the fire
      descriptor.
  - name: Sculpt Ice and Snow (Sp)
    description: >-
      At 4th level, a winter witch can sculpt ice and snow into any shape that
      suits her purpose (as stone shape, except that it works with ice). This
      ability also works on snow, doubling the volume affected. At 7th level,
      this ability functions on ice or snow like the fabricate spell, increasing
      the volume manipulated and allowing a higher degree of craftsmanship. The
      winter witch must succeed at appropriate Craft checks to form complex
      items or ones with fine detail. Items created by the fabricate version of
      this ability solidify into ultra-hard ice (hardness 5, 10 hit points per
      inch of thickness) that resists normal melting but takes double damage
      from fire. The ice remains in this ultra-hard state for 1 hour per class
      level before returning to normal ice. A winter witch can use this ability
      a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level.
  - name: Unnatural Cold (Su)
    description: >-
      At 3rd level, whenever a winter witch's spell, spell-like ability, or
      supernatural ability deals cold damage, treat affected creatures as having
      half their normal cold resistance when determining damage dealt. Winter
      Witchcraft Levels of the winter witch prestige class stack with witch
      levels for determining when the winter witch learns new hexes, the effect
      of her hexes and other witch class abilities (including archetype
      abilities), the abilities of her witch's familiar, and the level at which
      she can select major hexes or grand hexes.
