  Although these thugs are proficient in using their farming tools (a mix of
  rakes, hoes, sickles, pitchforks, and hammers), they attack to deal nonlethal
  damage and thus take a &#8211;4 penalty on attack rolls (this penalty is
  figured into their melee attack above). The thugs hope to run off the PCs and
  the others, forcing them to abandon the coffin so they can haul it and the
  body downriver to the Harrowstone memorial (area O, see page 63), where they
  burn the coffin and the body in the hope of dispersing the "curse" on the
  town.
Morale: >-
  As soon as a thug takes any damage, he drops his weapon and flees (or drops to
  his knees and begs for mercy if flight is impossible or too dangerous).
