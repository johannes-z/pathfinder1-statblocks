      Each time a blood golem hits a living opponent with a slam attack, it
      gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. These
      bonus hit points are added to the blood golem's total, even if the
      addition takes it above its current maximum hit points. A blood golem
      cannot gain more hit points than the maximum hit points allowed by its HD
      (not including any bonus hit points it may have from its Con score or
      other sources). For these blood golems, this maximum is 96 hit points. If
      a blood golem successfully hits an opponent with both of its slam attacks
      in a single round, that opponent suffers catastrophic blood expulsion,
      taking 2d4 points of Constitution damage (DC 15 Fortitude save for half).
      A blood golem gains 5 hit points per point of Constitution damage it
      deals. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
      When a blood golem reaches its maximum hit points for its Hit Dice, it
      divides (see cell division, below).
  - name: Cell Division (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a blood golem absorbs enough blood to raise its hit points to the
      maximum for its HD, it splits into two identical blood golems, each with
      half the original's hit points. In other words, if one of these advanced
      blood golems should reach 96 hit points, it splits into two blood golems
      with 48 hit points each.

      A blood golem is slowed (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds by any cold-based
      attacks or effects. A purify food and water spell deals 1d6 points of
      damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to a blood golem. A blood golem can
      attempt a Fortitude save to reduce this damage by half.
