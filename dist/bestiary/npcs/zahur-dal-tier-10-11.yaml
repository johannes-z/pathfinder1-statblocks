BeforeCombat: >-
  Zahur casts mage armor and overland flight at the start of each day. When
  preparing to ambush the PCs, he casts invisibility, extended shield, and
  protection from energy (fire, cold, and acid), then drinks his potion of
  barkskin, in that order.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zahur starts by casting solid fog to hinder the PCs' movement, and then uses
  elemental blast to make them vulnerable to electricity. He follows this with
  empowered spells converted to deal electricity damage such as ice storm and
  fireball, as well as maximized scorching ray and quickened magic missile. He
  remains aloft and uses flight to stay out of melee, casting fog cloud to stop
  ranged attacks.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 hit points or less, Zahur attempts to retreat invisibly and
  flees Sothis.
Gear: >-
  potion of barkskin, potion of cure serious wounds, scroll of pyrotechnics,
  scrolls of summon monster II (2), wand of magic missile (50 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  dagger, cloak of resistance +2, belt of mighty constitution +2, headband of
  alluring charisma +2, ring of protection +1
