BeforeCombat: Gilbrok casts overland flight on himself every day.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once Gilbrok finishes his weather control hex, or once he's confronted in
  combat, he uses a dose of dust of disappearance at once&#8211;he knows he's
  close to helpless in direct melee combat, and relies upon the greater
  invisibility afforded by the dust to survive, using flight to stay mobile and
  change position each round while he harries foes with his ranged attacks. Each
  time his dust wears out, he uses a new dose to maintain invisibility.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points or if his invisibility tactics aren't
  working (or if he runs out of dust of disappearance), Gilbrok flees to
  Harrigan's side in area G3 to cower behind him for protection. He won't
  surrender or flee at this point, but if Harrigan is slain, he immediately
  surrenders and begs the PCs for mercy, promising to serve them well if they
  spare his miserable life.
Gear: >-
  dust of disappearance (4 doses), potions of cure moderate wounds (3), potion
  of gaseous form, wand of cure moderate wounds (24 charges)
OtherGear: masterwork quarterstaff, necklace of adaptation
