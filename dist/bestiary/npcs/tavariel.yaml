BeforeCombat: >-
  Tavariel casts longstrider on Jumblegrin, her crocodile companion, and waits
  out of sight. In her blind, she has total cover and cannot be detected until
  the PCs start across the river. Once a PC triggers the swinging axe trap or
  when a PC reaches the halfway point swimming or climbing across the river,
  Tavariel and Jumblegrin attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tavariel rains arrows upon PCs crossing the river, using silver arrows against
  PCs with the bestial simple template. She prefers to avoid melee, but draws
  her scimitar to fight if necessary.
Morale: Extraordinarily confident in her abilities, Tavariel fights until disabled.
