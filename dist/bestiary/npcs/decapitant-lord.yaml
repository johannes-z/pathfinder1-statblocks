SpecialAbilities:
  - name: s Demand (Su)
    description: >-
      The Decapitant Lord searches endlessly for a replacement for his name,
      often demanding one that belongs to a future victim, though it never
      satisfies him. Once per day as a standard action, the Decapitant Lord can
      place death's demand on a target within 60 feet (Fortitude DC 24 negates).
      If the Decapitant Lord knows and speaks the target's name, the target
      takes a -2 penalty on the save. If the victim fails the save, it becomes
      staggered for 1d6 rounds. For the next 24 hours (or until the Decapitant
      Lord is slain), all critical threats against the victim are automatically
      confirmed. Finally, the victim automatically fails all Constitution checks
      to stabilize while dying. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save
      DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Mooncharger (Su)
    description: >-
      When charging, running, or taking a double move, the Decapitant Lord
      strides across open air as if he were using air walk. He is never tired by
      this action, but can't trample while using this ability.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      If killed, the Decapitant Lord's physical form reconstitutes itself in 2d4
      days. The only way to permanently destroy the Decapitant Lord is to lay
      the haunt in area T14 permanently to rest.
  - name: Stormlance (Su)
    description: >-
      The Decapitant Lord is proficient with all weapons in the spear fighter
      weapon group. When he wields such a weapon, it deals an additional 1d6
      points of sonic damage and gains the keen weapon special ability.
  - name: Tenpin Toss (Su)
    description: >-
      The Decapitant Lord can seize his severed head by the horns and hurl it as
      a ranged weapon that deals 1d8 points of damage, with a range increment of
      40 feet. On a successful hit, the Decapitant Lord can attempt a trip
      combat maneuver check against the target as part of the attack. This trip
      attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the check is
      successful, the target is knocked prone and is staggered for 1 round. The
      Decapitant Lord's head is not harmed during this attack and returns to him
      as if it had the returning weapon special ability.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  The Decapitant Lord prefers to charge, taking advantage of his belt of
  thunderous charging to increase his damage output, though if enemies use brace
  weapons, he reassesses the risks of charging. With his mooncharger ability and
  reach, he can run over difficult terrain and still reach creatures on the
  ground. He uses his tenpin toss ability to set a target up for a thunderous
  trample.
Morale: >-
  Bound to Skirkatla for eternity, the Decapitant Lord fights until destroyed;
  his body rejuvenates 2d4 days later.
