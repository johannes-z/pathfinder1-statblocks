BeforeCombat: >-
  Kuurung casts extended water breathing on Mparu every morning, and charm
  monster on the  tylosaurus once per week (there's a 14% chance that today was
  the day he used this spell). He casts extended mage armor on himself daily.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kuurung casts mirror image on the first round of combat, followed by shield on
  the second. Thereafter, he uses his ranged spells on PCs, starting with
  higher-level spells first.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 30 or fewer hit points, Kuurung attempts to flee by first
  casting slow on his enemies, then swimming to safety. If he escapes, he goes
  into hiding but plots on revenge. At some point later in the adventure,
  Kuurung tracks down the PCs and uses alter self to appear as a human, hoping
  to lure a PC away long enough to charm his victim into a mind-controlled
  agent.
