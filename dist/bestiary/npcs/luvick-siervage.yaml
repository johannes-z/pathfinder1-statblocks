    description: >-
      Luvick Siervage can have up to 68 enslaved spawn. He can communicate with
      his spawn telepathically, one at a time and for as long as he wishes, so
      long as they are on the same plane. While using this ability, Luvick
      enters a catatonic state and is treated as helpless, though he is alerted
      by jarring noises, the presence of visible creatures within 5 feet, and
      any damage that befalls his body.
