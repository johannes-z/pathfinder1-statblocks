    description: >-
      Creatures meeting the gaze of a floating eye must succeed on a DC 10 Will
      save or stand and stare blankly at the floating eye (similar to the
      effects of a hypnotism spell) for 1d6+1 rounds. A swimming creature that
      fails its save does not sink, but floats on the surface of the water. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
