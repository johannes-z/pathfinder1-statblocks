BeforeCombat: >-
  The Knurly Witch activates her bead of karma, then casts shield of faith and
  air walk as soon as she sees the PCs approach her home.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Knurly Witch casts summon monster spells for the first 2 rounds of combat
  to liven up the battlefield, moving into the air above her home via air walk
  if she can before she begins casting. She uses her ranged spells as much as
  possible, but if melee becomes unavoidable, she casts divine power, activates
  her destructive aura, and attacks with tooth and claw (and periodic touch
  spells).
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 100 hit points, the Knurly Witch casts word of
  recall. As an "adopted" native of the First World, she can use this spell to
  retreat to her sanctuary-area K16 in the House at the Edge of Time. There, she
  seeks out Nyrissa to report her failure to defend the Knurly House and
  prepares as mentioned in area K16 to confront the PCs one last time.
Gear: >-
  +3 leather armor, scarab of protection (9 charges), strand of prayer beads
