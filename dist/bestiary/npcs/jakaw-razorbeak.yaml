BeforeCombat: >-
  Jakaw casts barkskin, bear's endurance, greater magic fang, and longstrider if
  the alarm is raised.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jakaw uses his hunter's bond to grant bonuses to the smugglers in the area on
  the first round of combat, while declaring the toughest-looking human enemy as
  his quarry. If the alarm is raised, Jakaw can establish one of the PCs as his
  quarry early by watching them from afar if he gets the chance. Jakaw leaps
  into battle with a cackle once he's established quarry and granted his
  companions his hunter's bond, focusing his attacks on his quarry before moving
  on to other humans or elves if possible.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 40 hit points, Jakaw attempts to retreat to
  Harrigan's side (area G3) to report his failure and then help protect his
  captain. He fights to the death otherwise.
Gear: >-
  +2 chain shirt, +1 kukri, +1 scimitar, belt of giant strength +2, ring of
  protection +1, mwk shortbow, keys to areas D5 and E5, 78 gp
