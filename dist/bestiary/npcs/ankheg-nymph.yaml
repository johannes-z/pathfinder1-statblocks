SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Spit Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 6 hours, an ankheg nymph can spit a 15-foot line of acid.
      Creatures struck by this acid take 2d4 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 13
      half). Additionally, in the 6 hours following the ankheg nymph's use of
      this ability, its bite attack doesn't deal any additional acid damage. As
      a result, an ankheg nymph doesn't use this ability unless it's desperate
      or frustrated, such as when reduced to fewer than half its hit points or
      when it can't successfully grab an opponent. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
