BeforeCombat: >-
  Before ambushing the PCs, Durnil uses her wand of mage armor, drinks her
  potion of bull's strength, and casts expeditious retreat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Durnil uses her scroll of shrink item on the first round of combat, holding
  the charge until she gets close enough to use it on the keg. If she
  successfully shrinks the keg, she attempts to steal it, casting vanish
  afterward, which makes her invisible for 2 rounds&#8211;long enough to run
  away. The twins have taken pains to look as similar as possible, and try to
  keep the fact that there are two of them a secret.
Morale: >-
  Durnil imbibes her potion of cure light wounds if brought to 4 hit points or
  fewer. She has a long and close relationship with her sister, and neither is
  willing to risk death. If one sister is captured or falls, the other offers to
  surrender the keg to ensure her sister survives. The two are simply trying to
  steal the keg, and fight only if cornered. If death seems like an imminent
  threat, both attempt to flee, whether they have the keg in tow or not.
