BeforeCombat: >-
  Elessia casts shield of faith and invisibility on herself if she senses any
  creatures approaching, then waits in the shadows for an opportune moment to
  strike.
DuringCombat: >-
  If surprised, Elessia casts invisibility on herself as soon as possible, then
  follows up with summon monster III and shield of faith. She uses charm person
  and other enchantment spells to garner as many weak-willed allies as possible,
  then channels negative energy to damage multiple foes at once (using her Quick
  Channel feat if she's in position to use an inflict wounds spell that round as
  well). Elessia heals herself with her wand whenever she falls to fewer than 15
  hit points. She uses her whip only as a last resort, and relies heavily on her
  undead and charmed allies to defend her in melee.
Morale: >-
  Completely devoted to her cause, Elessia has come too far to accept failure,
  and fights to the death.
Gear: wand of cure moderate wounds (12 charges), wand of invisibility (6 charges)

  15.
