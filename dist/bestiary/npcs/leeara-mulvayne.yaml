Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Leeara uses her rust bag of tricks, pulling out two animals and placing them
  in the room as guardians before she hides behind one of the canvases hanging
  from the northern wall.
DuringCombat: >-
  Leeara makes a sneak attack from hiding as soon as she can&#8211;if she can't
  make the attack on a surprise round, she takes advantage of her animal minions
  to flank the PCs, preferring to use Spring Attack to make sneak attacks in
  this way while preventing enemies the luxury of gaining a full-attack action
  against her in melee.
Morale: >-
  Leeara attempts to flee into the wild if reduced to fewer than 15 hit points.
  She remains in hiding for several days, eventually sneaking back into this
  area to try to reclaim her cave lair, but by then the grace period for easy
  removal of her id mutant template has passed.
