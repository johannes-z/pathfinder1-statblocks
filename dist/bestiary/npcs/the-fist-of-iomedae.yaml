Source: AP 107
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  The Fist activates her winged boots before combat if she can. Knight Commander
  Graxus Phand maintains a status effect on the Fist as well.
DuringCombat: >-
  Numerous rocks lie around the cloister should the Fist need ammunition to
  throw, but she greatly prefers to use her fists in combat. She often utilizes
  Stunning Fist, and makes use of Improved Overrun to get through opponents and
  block progress into the main cathedral. Note that as soon as the Fist takes
  damage or suffers an ailment, the status effect alerts Knight Commander Graxus
  Phand, who drops everything to come to area A36 to provide aid (assume that
  Phand can arrive in this room 1d4+4 rounds after the first alert during the
  day or in 4 minutes during the evening-this includes the time he takes to cast
  short-duration defensive spells such as bull's strength).
Morale: The Fist fights to the death, but does not pursue foes out of Bastion Devotio.
Gear: amulet of natural armor +1, cloak of resistance +3, winged boots
