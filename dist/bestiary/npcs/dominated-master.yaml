DuringCombat: >-
  The master is Jathyl's unquestioning thrall and believes the PCs to be the
  threat she has painted them as. When adjacent to a foe at the start of his
  turn, he spends a ki point to gain an additional flurry attack, using Stunning
  Fist on his first strike. Otherwise, the master uses Spring Attack and
  Stunning Fist whenever possible, directing his followers in Vudrani while
  spewing insults at the PCs in Common.
Morale: >-
  Completely under Jathyl's control, the master truly believes the PCs are the
  largest threat to the survival of his monastery, and he fights to the death.
  When reduced to 20 or fewer hit points, he throws the 5d6 bead from his
  necklace of fireballs into the largest concentration of PCs, disregarding his
  own safety and that of his followers.
Gear: necklace of fireballs (type I)
