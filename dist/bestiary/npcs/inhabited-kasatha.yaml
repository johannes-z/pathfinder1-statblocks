DuringCombat: >-
  The inhabited kasathas start combat by trying to sneak attack flat-footed
  foes. They then either use invisibility to set up sneak attacks every other
  round or flank foes to do the same. They rely on confusion and daze monster
  against foes who seek to maintain ranged superiority.
Morale: >-
  An inhabited kasatha fights to the death. If slain, the intellect devourer
  within emerges, at which point its allies move to protect it during the round

  devourer fights to the death.
