SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Command Skeletons (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, Lashton can automatically command all normal skeletons
      within 30 feet of him (as per command undead, CL 10th). He is able to
      command skeletal champions, but they can attempt a DC 16 Will save to
      resist his command. Normal skeletons will never attack Lashton unless
      compelled to do so.
DuringCombat: >-
  Lashton commands the skeletons under his service to set up flanking
  opportunities or to harry and distract intruders. He fights from atop his
  skeletal nightmare, preferring attacks with his lance.
Morale: Lashton fights until destroyed.
Gear: +1 full plate, +1 buckler, +2 lance, mwk longsword
