Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Salvator is no fighter, and he knows it. In combat, he cowers behind his
  allies, throwing punches only when there's no other choice.
Morale: >-
  Salvator flees if all his allies are defeated, or if reduced to fewer than 25
  hit points. If he does so, his  primary goal is to find a small dark place to
  hide, and he eventually works his way back to his home (only to be eaten by
  the otyughs if the PCs haven't defeated them).
