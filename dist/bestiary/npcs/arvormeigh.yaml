BeforeCombat: >-
  Arvormeigh observes intruders from the pool while in fish form to discern
  their intent. Then she reverts to her natural form to drink her potion of
  resist energy before swimming to the water's surface to speak with them. A
  Sense Motive check (DC 22) detects the nixie stalling for time during the
  conversation&#8211;she waits only long enough for the next obscuring mistfrom
  the wardstones before attacking (see Hazard).
DuringCombat: >-
  Arvormeigh knows the pool well enough to time the waves of mist to her
  advantage. On any round while her vision remains unimpeded, she keeps her
  distance, rising from the water to shoot opponents with her bow and making
  sure to use her Deadly Aim feat and bleeding attack ability if possible,
  selectively targeting spellcasters with sleep arrows. During rounds with the
  obscuring mistin place, Arvormeigh uses her lure ability instead, drawing
  victims into the pool and the waiting vortex of her elemental ally. She uses
  sneak attack underwater on anyone left in the pool.
Morale: >-
  As the final guardian of the wardstones, Arvormeigh fights to the death, only
  temporarily retreating to drink her potion of cure moderate woundsbefore
  resuming the attack.
