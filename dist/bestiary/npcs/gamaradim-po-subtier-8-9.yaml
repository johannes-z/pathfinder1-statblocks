DuringCombat: >-
  Po prefers not to fight, as his master gave him specific orders to let the
  Pathfinders attempt to navigate the manor, but if the PCs attack him or his
  wife, Domitilla, he fights to protect himself and Domitilla. If fighting in
  the manor, he uses whatever is on hand as an improvised weapon (either melee
  or thrown) and fights with his fists if outside. He uses Stunning Fist on any
  caster who he can get adjacent to.
Morale: >-
  Po flees to area A10 at the first opportunity and holes up with his wife until
  the PCs leave.
