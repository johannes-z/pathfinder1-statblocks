  - name: Adaptive Learning (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gearsman has a number of skill points equal to 4 + its Int modifier per
      Hit Die, and treats Craft and Profession as class skills beyond those
      possessed by all robots. In addition, a gearsman has a number of bonus
      skill ranks equal to its Hit Dice that can be reprogrammed to apply to any
      skill-these ranks cannot be split among multiple skills and must all apply
      to one skill. A gearsman may change what skill these bonus ranks apply to
      up to once per day by concentrating for 1 minute, during which time it can
      take no other actions. Rather than spend these bonus ranks on a skill, a
      gearsman can choose to devote them to weapon knowledge, gaining
      proficiency with a single weapon instead of bonus ranks in a skill. All
      gearsmen are automatically proficient with all simple weapons.
  - name: Charge Weapon (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any metal melee weapon wielded by a gearsman becomes charged with
      electricity and deals +1d6 points of electricity damage on a hit.
      Self-Repair (Ex) A gearsman's nanites heal it of damage at the rate of a
      number of hit points per hour equal to its Hit Dice (4 hit points per hour
      for most gearsmen). Up to once per day, as a full-round action, it can
      heal any robot it touches of 4d6 points of damage&#8211;if a gearsman uses
      this ability on itself, it automatically heals the maximum amount: 24
      points of damage.
