SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Discorporate (Su)
    description: >-
      The Wriggling Man can collapse his body into a shapeless swarm of worms as
      a free action. He drops all held, worn, and carried items, and his
      Strength score changes to 1. He functions as a true swarm while
      discorporated, and has a reach of 0 feet (his space remains unchanged).
      While discorporated, he loses all of his defensive abilities but gains all
      of the standard swarm traits. He also loses his slam attack and all
      special abilities and special attacks, but can make a swarm attack that
      inflicts 5d6 points of damage. He can reform into his true form as a
      full-round action, as long as he has at least 1 hit point-doing so
      provokes an attack of opportunity.
  - name: Engulf (Ex)
    description: >-
      If the Wriggling Man successfully grapples a foe, he can engulf that foe
      as soon as the attempt to grapple succeeds. He then sends a large number
      of the worms that comprise his body to swarm over the grappled creature.
      He can only engulf one target per round. These worms inflict 5d6 points of
      damage per round. The damage caused by an engulf attack is treated as
      swarm damage for the purposes of what creatures it can affect. Any
      creature damaged by this engulf attack is also subjected to distraction,
      and must make a DC 21 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Grab (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Wriggling Man can use his grab attack on targets that are no more than
      one size category larger than himself.
  - name: Tenacious (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Wriggling Man gains a +8 racial bonus on CMB checks made to grapple a
      foe, rather than the normal +4 racial bonus granted to most creatures with
      the grab special attack. In addition, he gains a +4 racial bonus to his
      CMD. Worm That Walks Traits The Wriggling Man has no discernable anatomy,
      and is not subject to critical hits or flanking. He can be damaged
      normally by weapons (such blows scattering worms or temporarily disrupting
      a portion of its body), but damage is mitigated normally by fast healing
      and damage reduction. Reducing him to 0 hit points forces him to
      discorporate&#8211;at 0 hit points he is staggered, and at negative hit
      points he is dying. He is immune to any spell or effect that targets a
      specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as
      disintegrate), with the exception of such spells and effects generated by
      himself, which treat him as a single creature if he so chooses.
      Mind-affecting effects that target single creatures also function normally
      against him since his individual components share one hivemind in common.
      He takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that
      affect an area, such as splash weapons and many evocation spells. The
      Wriggling Man is susceptible to high winds&#8211;treat him as a Fine
      creature for the purposes of determining the effects of wind.

BeforeCombat: >-
  The Wriggling Man casts mind blank every day, and activates his ring of
  invisibility as soon as the PCs enter the House at the Edge of Time. He casts
  overland flight and resist energy (cold) once updates from Nyrissa convince
  him the PCs will soon be entering this room.
DuringCombat: >-
  As soon as the PCs enter the room, the Wriggling Man, who stands near the
  throne but is invisible, casts time stop. He has at least 2 rounds to cast
  spells while time is stopped&#8211;he first casts quickened shield and then
  summon monster IX to summon an astral deva. The next round, he casts
  telepathic bond on the deva so he can communicate with it silently and
  quickened fire shield (chill shield) on himself. If he has enough time during
  time stop, he'll also cast quickened resist energy (acid) and protection from
  energy (sonic) on the third round, mage's sword on the fourth round, and
  reverse gravity on an area where he can affect the most walking PCs. When his
  time stop ends, he telepathically commands the summoned astral deva to
  imperiously demand that the PCs leave this place, claiming that they tread
  upon the works of one under the protection of Heaven itself. This is, of
  course, a lie&#8211;the Wriggling Man doesn't expect the PCs to fall for it,
  but the tactic does amuse him and it could work, especially if the PCs don't
  ask to make Sense Motive checks to see through the angel's forced lie. If the
  PCs persist, the Wriggling Man telepathically orders the angel to attack the
  PCs, starting with a blade barrier and following up with melee attacks with
  its hammer. The Wriggling Man keeps in motion, flying around the room
  invisibly as a move action after each time he casts an attack spell on the PCs
  each round so that it's difficult to track his position. The Wriggling Man
  tries to avoid melee combat if possible, but if his magic manages to
  incapacitate a character, he won't be able to resist approaching to engulf the
  poor PC.
Morale: >-
  If the Wriggling Man's contingency activates, he uses dimension door to
  retreat to area M6. He waits until he's recovered, then casts dimension door
  to return to this room to start the attack anew&#8211;this time he fights to
  the death.
