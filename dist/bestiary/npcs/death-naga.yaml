SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Atrophic Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, death nagas can blast opponents with a 60 foot cone
      of deteriorating negative energy. The blast deals 12d6 points of unholy
      and negative energy damage (half of each). In addition, those within the
      cone gain one negative level. A Reflex DC 22 save halves the damage and
      prevents the negative level. Undead remain unharmed within the cone but
      gain 2d4 x 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
