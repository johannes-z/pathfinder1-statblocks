BeforeCombat: >-
  When the PCs attack or talk to the mercenaries in area A5, Celeena is alerted
  to their presence. At this point she uses her scroll of mage armor and her
  scroll of shield and hides behind the northwest shelf. Once she thinks the PCs
  have either allied with her mercenaries or killed them, she casts summon
  monster III and summons a dretch, directing it to stand in the square just
  north of the door and attack the first PC who enters.
DuringCombat: >-
  Celeena casts glitterdust first, hitting the PCs fighting the dretch. She then
  uses her wand of magic missile, and casts scorching ray and acid arrow for
  ranged attacks, and casts suggestion, color spray, and burning hands once the
  PCs get closer. If the dretch falls and she has time, she summons another to
  prevent the PCs from reaching her.
Morale: >-
  Celeena is obsessed but not stupid&#8211;if reduce to 5 hit points or fewer,
  she surrenders.
