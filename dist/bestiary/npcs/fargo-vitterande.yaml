BeforeCombat: >-
  Fargo casts false life every morning. Once the PCs engage the Jester's Grin,
  he shifts into his hybrid form and casts cat's grace, jump, see invisibility,
  shield, and spider climb on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Fargo casts greater invisibility and climbs into the ship's rigging. From
  there, he creates a major image of himself on the fore deck (area R1) to make
  it seem that he teleported to the far side of the ship. Fargo uses the
  illusion to draw out conversations with his enemies; the illusion acts in a
  conciliatory fashion while he himself uses tricky spells to secretly target
  them with charm monster or suggestion. He follows those spells with message so
  he can whisper directions to anyone affected by his enchantments. Fargo
  targets anyone who sees through his ruse with debilitating spells such as
  confusion or hideous laughter so they can't inform the others. He then slips
  back into the fray, executing sneak attacks or casting hold person on enemy
  spellcasters. Against especially dangerous foes, he keeps his distance while
  firing his wand of lightning bolts.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, Fargo casts blink and withdraws. Diving
  overboard, he transforms into a dire rat and clings to the ship's hull while
  holding his breath. If he eludes pursuit, Fargo abandons his crew (and his
  ship, if the PCs commandeer it) and makes for shore at nightfall.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds, wand of lightning bolt (12 charges)
