SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Death (Su)
    description: >-
      Deathleeches radiate an unnerving aura of death and destruction. Undead
      recognize this aura and the powerful necromantic energy that it
      represents. Mindless undead do not attack a deathleech unless attacked
      first. Intelligent undead with Hit Dice at least equal to the deathleech's
      total Hit Dice plus class levels must succeed on a DC 23 Will save to
      attack a deathleech. Once it makes a successful save, that undead creature
      never again has to make a save to attack that same deathleech. Intelligent
      undead with more Hit Dice than the deathleech are unaffected by this aura.
      This aura radiates in a 5-foot radius around the deathleech creature. The
      save DC is Charismabased.
  - name: Aura of Evil (Su)
    description: >-
      Naphrathoth radiates an aura in a 30 ft. radius spread around his form.
      Any non-good creature in this area must succeed on a DC 25 Will save or be
      overcome with awe and unable to attack him that round. Good creatures
      within the area must make a successful DC 25 Will save or be unable to
      even look at Naphrathoth for one day. An affected good creature functions
      as if blinded (as the blindness spell) when attacking Naphrathoth. On a
      successful save, a creature is immune to Naphrathoth's aura of evil for
      one day. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus.
  - name: Death Knell (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day for each 3 Hit Dice plus class levels (if any) a deathleech
      has, it can draw forth the ebbing life force of a creature to fuel its own
      power. This functions as a death knell spell with a caster level equal to
      the deathleech's total Hit Dice plus class levels (if any).
  - name: Deathsight (Su)
    description: >-
      A deathleech can determine the condition of creatures near death within 30
      feet. (This range doubles for every 10 HD a deathleech has.) This
      functions as a deathwatch spell with a caster level equal to the
      deathleech's Hit Dice. This ability is always on, but can be suppressed or
      negated. A deathleech can restart it again as a free action on its next
      turn.
  - name: Greater Death Knell (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per month for each 8 Hit Dice plus class levels (if any) a deathleech
      has, it musters enough negative energy to perform a greater death knell.
      This ability functions as a death knell spell, except the hit points and
      Strength gained are permanent. If the target succeeds on its Will save,
      the deathleech actually loses 1d8 hit points permanently and takes 2
      points of Strength drain. A deathleech can only ever gain a number of hit
      points equal to three times its Hit Dice from using this ability. It can
      never gain more than 6 Strength points from this ability. Naphrathoth has
      used this ability to gain 6 points of Strength and 15 permanent hit
      points, and now may only drain 24 more hit points and gain the temporary
      caster level.
  - name: Unholy Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Naphrathoth can increase the radiance of his form and
      release it in a cone-shaped blast to a range of 60 ft. that deals 15d6
      points of damage and blinds any creature in the area (as the blindness
      spell) for 3d6 minutes. Affected creatures can make a successful DC 22
      Reflex save to halve the damage and avoid being blinded. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
