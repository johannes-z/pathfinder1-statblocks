SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burst of Speed (Ex)
    description: >-
      Captain Henley has learned to coax speed out of her ship when it really
      counts. With a successful DC 20 Profession (sailor) check, she doubles her
      ship's maximum speed for 1 round. She can use this ability once per day.
  - name: Classic Duelist (Ex)
    description: >-
      Captain Henley gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls made with a
      cutlass, rapier, or short sword.
  - name: Storm Sailor (Ex)
    description: >-
      Captain Henley treats all storms as if they were one category less severe
      for the purposes of sailing and navigation. She can attempt Acrobatics
      checks to move at her normal speed across uneven ground without increasing
      its DC, and she doesn't take penalties on any Acrobatics checks because of
      slightly slippery, slightly unsteady, or moderately unsteady conditions.
  - name: Windrigger (Ex)
    description: >-
      Captain Henley has learned the tricky art of tacking. With a successful DC
      15 Profession (sailor) check, she increases her ship's maximum speed by 5
      feet for 1 hour.
