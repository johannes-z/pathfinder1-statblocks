SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Lesser Shadow Evocation (Sp)
    description: >-
      This spell-like ability functions identically to the spell shadow
      evocation, but it can only create quasi-real versions of sorcerer or
      wizard evocation spells of 2nd level or lower. This spell-like ability is
      the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Nicasor is confident in his abilities, and he utilizes full attacks with both
  his swords whenever possible, unafraid to take the fight directly to his foes.
  If faced with formidable ranged combatants, Nicasor uses lesser shadow
  evocation to waylay his enemies with shadow versions of scorching ray and
  magic missile.
Morale: >-
  Nicasor, faced with no escape from the midnight mirror without the PCs' aid,
  fights to the death, seeing it as the only way to end his suffering if the PCs
  won't assist him.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds
