BeforeCombat: >-
  Lessikal casts magic vestment every day, and drinks a potion of barkskin and
  potion of shield of faith as soon as he hears his guards raise the alarm.
DuringCombat: >-
  Lessikal uses summon monster IV to summon a fiendish giant mantis (normally
  not a creature most spellcasters can summon with this spell), then uses his
  other ranged spells to provide support. He prefers to heal his pet dinosaurs
  or his summoned mantis before healing his acolytes. Just before entering melee
  combat, he casts divine power.
Morale: >-
  If Lessikal is reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, he flees to his lair and
  uses stone shape to retrieve the mantis blade from hiding, hoping that he can
  use it to defeat the PCs. (Remember that while he does not have the
  proficiency to wield the mantis blade as a light weapon, he can still wield it
  as a martial weapon.) Once armed with the blade, Lessikal fights to the death.
Gear: >-
