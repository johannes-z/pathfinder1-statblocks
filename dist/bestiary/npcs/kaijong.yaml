BeforeCombat: Kaijong casts mage armor on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kaijong starts combat with his breath weapon, then swoops down to attack foes
  in melee, making full attacks each round that follows. He prefers to use Power
  Attack, but holds off on using his breath weapon after it recharges until he
  can target at least three foes with it. Once reduced to fewer than 50 hit
  points, he backs off, casting vanish if possible, and stays away from melee.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, Kaijong retreats to the lighthouse to
  rest and hide (if the fight's elsewhere) or abandons his treasure and flies
  west, out to sea. He may or may not return in a few days to try to regain his
  treasure or seek revenge.
