SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Abandon Flesh (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a vermlek can abandon an inhabited body, crawling
      hideously out of its host and leaving behind an empty sack of skin and
      bits of gristle. In so doing, it absorbs much of the body's flesh to heal
      itself, restoring 2d6+3 hit points. A vermlek cannot later reclaim this
      body with its inhabit body ability.
  - name: Flesh Armor (Su)
    description: >-
      When a vermlek wears a humanoid body (see inhabit body, below), it treats
      the dead flesh and muscle as armor and gains a +3 armor bonus to its AC.
  - name: Inhabit Body (Su)
    description: >-
      A vermlek can crawl into the body of any dead Medium humanoid, consuming
      and replacing the bulk of the humanoid's skeleton and internal organs as
      it does so. This process takes 1d4 rounds for the vermlek to complete,
      during which it is considered flat-footed. Once the process is complete,
      the vermlek appears for all practical purposes to be a living but
      hideously obese version of the previous humanoid-it gains a +8 racial
      bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a normal humanoid while wearing a
      dead body in this manner, but does not gain any of the abilities that the
      dead creature possessed in life, including natural attacks, unusual
      movement types, or bonuses to natural armor. It loses its own burrow speed
      while inhabiting a body, but gains the ability to wield weapons or wear
      armor shaped for humanoids (although note that the armor bonus granted by
      wearing armor does not stack with the bonus granted by the vermlek's flesh
      armor ability).
  - name: Negative Energy Affinity (Ex)
    description: >-
      A vermlek is healed by negative energy and harmed by positive energy as if
      it were an undead creature.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Dakang is aware of the PCs' approach, he casts shield of faith and spider
  climb, preparing for the impending battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  Dakang opens by casting bane, followed by mass inflict light wounds, trying
  to   climb to the ceiling to avoid melee combat. If a particular enemy seems
  especially threatening, Dakang casts cause fear on the foe to remove her from
  combat. If surrounded, Dakang casts mass inflict light wounds (targeting
  himself as one of the affected creatures), preferring to channel negative
  energy only to heal himself since his spell-like ability allows him to both
  heal himself and harm his attackers.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, Dakang sheds his humanoid form and
  attempts to escape by burrowing into the ground.
