    description: >-
      Strix receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the
      human subtype due to special training against these hated foes.
BeforeCombat: The strix hide among the ruins of the tower.
DuringCombat: >-
  The strix want to humiliate the PCs, especially any human PCs. They try to
  entangle a human PC in a snag net. If they succeed, the strix with the net
  tries to trip the entangled PC, while the other strix uses their Flyby Attack
  feat to strike that PC with a longspear. If all three strix miss with their
  nets, they may try to fly away and refold the nets, or fight with their
  longspears. If the PCs knock a strix unconscious, the other strix screech and
  takes to the air, attacking with their longbows from point-blank range.
Morale: >-
  A strix attempts to flee if she believes that the PCs are likely to knock her
  unconscious before she will have another opportunity to escape. If one strix
  is unconscious or dead, the other strix fight to the death to protect their
  ally.
