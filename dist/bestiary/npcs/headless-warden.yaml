SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Spirit Slam (Su)
    description: >-
      Within the Uqtaal Necropolis, a headless warden is surrounded by spirit
      wisps that harass its foes. These spirits make one slam attack each round
      against a living foe that is adjacent to the warden, using the warden's
      full base attack bonus, plus its Charisma modifier. The slam deals 1d4
      points of negative energy damage, plus additional negative energy damage
      equal to the warden's Charisma modifier (+2 in most cases).
  - name: Spirit Wisps (Su)
    description: >-
      Within the Uqtaal Necropolis, a headless warden is guided and warded by
      the spirits of the dead that swirl around the warden in pale glowing
      wisps. These spirits grant the warden blindsight 60 feet and make it
      difficult for the warden's enemies to see it. Ranged attacks and melee
      attacks made by creatures that are not adjacent to the warden (typically
      because of reach) have a 20% miss chance.
DuringCombat: >-
  The headless wardens make slam attacks at the closest foe. If enemies are near
  the crevasse, they attempt to bull rush them into it.
Morale: The headless wardens fight until destroyed.
