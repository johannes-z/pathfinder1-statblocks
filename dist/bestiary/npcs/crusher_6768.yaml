SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Flailing Chains (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because he has been shackled for most of his life, Crusher is highly
      capable of fighting using the chains of his manacles. Crusher's chain
      attacks deal different amounts of damage depending on whether or not orcs
      are still chained to his wrists. With attached orcs, Crusher takes a -2 on
      attack rolls with his chains. On a successful hit, the attached orc takes
      damage equal to the amount of damage Crusher deals as the giant swings his
      allies wildly about and smashes them into opponents. If the attached orcs
      die, their bloody corpses fall off the chains after 1 round. Thereafter,
      Crusher makes chain attacks without attached orcs.
  - name: Handlers (Ex)
    description: >-
      Crusher requires the constant attention of four handlers&#8211;two orc
      beast-tamers controlling his legs and two chained orcs controlling his
      arms. Normally, Crusher follows his leg handlers with little need for
      direction, allowing the beast-tamers to take normal actions during combat.
      The two orcs chained to his arms, however, must spend move actions to move
      with the giant and standard actions to direct Crusher's attacks. If not
      directed in this way, the giant takes no actions, moaning in pain or
      gazing listlessly at the blood on the battlefield until he eventually
      succumbs to his violent temper. For each orc handler still conscious and
      attached to him, Crusher gains a cumulative +2 bonus on Will saves against
      his violent temper ability (maximum +8).
  - name: Violent Temper (Ex)
    description: >-
      Crusher becomes violently enraged if he isn't tended to by his "little
      green play-people." Each round of combat on his turn, Crusher must succeed
      at a DC 14 Will save or become enraged for 4 rounds. While enraged,
      Crusher gains the confused condition and does not follow the guidance of
      his handlers. He gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution
      (including 9 additional hit points), a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and
      a &#8211;2 penalty to Armor Class. Crusher always makes chain attacks
      while enraged. After raging, Crusher is fatigued for a number of rounds
      equal to the number of rounds spent enraged, and he cannot become enraged
      again while fatigued or exhausted. This effect is otherwise identical to a
      barbarian's rage.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Crusher uses his slam attacks as directed by his orc handlers until they are
  dead or until he succumbs to his violent temper, at which point he uses his
  chains&#8211;with or without attached orcs.
Morale: Crusher knows only pain, and he fights to the death.
