DuringCombat: >-
  The morlocks rage and ambush travelers with leaping attacks first, followed by
  a swarming advance to sneak attack foes. They use their no escape rage power
  to cut off retreat, and try to herd opponents into areas filled with bony
  caltrops.
Morale: >-
  Fearful of their serpentfolk masters, the morlocks fight to the death unless
  faced with a prominent source of light such as a daylight spell. If blinded by
  such a light source and reduced to half their numbers, they retreat into the
  nooks and crannies of the Collapsed Warrens, stealthily following along the
  walls and ceilings to execute hit-and-run attacks from cover with their
  javelins thereafter.
