DuringCombat: >-
  The Thing from Beyond Time is not immune to the effects of the occluding
  field&#8211;in fact, its presence causes the monster extreme discomfort and
  pain. Beyond its first manifestation in the room (made possible only by the
  Leng Device's fluctuation of energy), this hound of Tindalos cannot use its
  angled entry ability at all. The feeling of being trapped and cut off from the
  angles of time enrages the monster, driving it into a blind frenzy.
Morale: >-
  If the occluding field is brought down, the hound immediately uses plane shift
  to flee, never to return. Otherwise, it fights to the death.
