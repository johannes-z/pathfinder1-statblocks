BeforeCombat: The coven casts mind blank on Byurka each day.
DuringCombat: >-
  Byurka blasts foes with lightning bolt each round for the first 3 rounds of
  battle. She uses her wand of cure serious wounds on any ally who drops below
  20 hit points, but she otherwise focuses on making melee attacks using Power
  Attack against any foes within reach. Given the chance, she tries to blow
  characters out of this room and through a telescope-created window using
  control winds or gust of wind. A character who falls through a window in the
  northern quarter of the wall plummets 20 feet onto the balcony north of H6,
  while a character who falls through any other location falls 60 feet to the
  ground below.
Morale: >-
  Byurka casts sanctuary on herself if brought to fewer than 20 hit points and
  spends her next few actions healing her wounds. If the coven is broken by the
  death of another hag, she instead flees Hyrantam and does not return if
  reduced to 20 or fewer hit points.
