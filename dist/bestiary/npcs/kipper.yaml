DuringCombat: >-
  Kipper mans a ballista, hoping to fire on a PC within 30 feet so that he can
  make one of the most memorable sneak attacks of his life. He then drinks his
  second potion of invisibility, moves to an advantageous spot, and makes a
  second sneak attack against a foe with his bow. He continues to snipe with his
  bow until the PCs engage in melee, at which point he moves to flank, if
  possible, with his sword.
