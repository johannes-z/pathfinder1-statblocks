    description: >-
      The clockwork controller has a built-in defense system in case any
      unauthorized creature attempts to extract unauthorized data, subvert its
      programming, or tinker with its controls. Once per round as a standard
      action, the clockwork controller can fire a jet of energy at a single
      target within 60 feet as a ranged touch attack. This attack deals 6d6
      points of damage, and the clockwork controller can choose from the
      following damage types each time it fires the energy jet: cold,
      electricity, fire, force, or sonic. Self-Destruction (Su) When its hit
      points are reduced to 0, the clockwork controller begins shuddering and
      sparks run along its seams. One round after it is destroyed, the clockwork
      controller explodes in a violent burst that deals 12d6 points of slashing
      damage and 12d6 points of fire damage in a 20-foot radius. Creatures in
      the area can attempt a DC 25 Reflex save to halve this damage. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
