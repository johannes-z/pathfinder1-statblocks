BeforeCombat: >-
  Navah casts alarm each day on her mutation lab. Before combat, Navah casts
  cat's grace, mage armor, shield, and stoneskin on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Navah is confused each round of combat. Any round she rolls a result of "act
  normally," she attempts to use restraining spells such as interposing hand,
  black tentacles, and baleful polymorph. Any round she rolls a result of
  "attack nearest creature," she instead unleashes her more dangerous spells,
  such as enemy hammer, flesh to stone, and cloudkill. Any round she rolls a
  result of "babble incoherently," she instead tries to augment herself for some
  as-yet-unseen threat, casting blink or resist energy on herself.
Morale: >-
  Navah believes she is fighting for her life. If reduced below 10 hit points,
  she attempts to transform into a bird and fly through a window to escape.
Gear: pearl of power (2nd level)
