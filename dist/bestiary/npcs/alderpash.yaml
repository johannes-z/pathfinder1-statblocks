BeforeCombat: >-
  Alderpash has maintained his appearance on the day of his death via regular
  castings of gentle repose&#8211;he casts the spell every day in order to
  ensure it never expires. He casts false life every day as well. In addition,
  he casts quickened eagle's splendor and drinks a potion of barkskin +5 just
  before combat (or any initial encounter with the PCs).
DuringCombat: >-
  Alderpash casts time stop at the start of any combat. In the first 2 rounds of
  this spell's duration, he casts greater invisibility and fly, moving to a
  different location to throw off his foes. If he has additional rounds of
  actions, he casts crushing hand, clenched fist, and delayed blast fireball,
  setting these spells up to affect different enemies as appropriate. Once his
  time stop ends, he casts project image and empowered quickened magic missile
  to further vex foes. Following this, he continues to hit foes with his more
  powerful ranged attacks, supplementing them with quickened spells each round.
  He saves his wish spell to recover from unexpected setbacks or to restore
  himself to full health once he's reduced to fewer than 40 hit points.
Morale: >-
  Alderpash fights to the death, trusting in the power of his phylactery to save
  him. See area O5 for details on his phylactery and its defenses. If he
  rejuvenates, he begins to put all his resources into learning more about the
  enemies that defeated him&#8211;he can observe them from afar via greater
  scrying. Even if he remains in the Ineluctable Prison (assuming said prison
  still functions as such after the PCs are through with it), Alderpash has ways
  to influence the outer world, if only via a wish spell. Agents of the first
  Runelord of Wrath may well seek out the PCs as objects of his revenge in the
  future!
