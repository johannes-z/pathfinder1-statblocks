SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cursed Flesh (Su)
    description: >-
      Zagmaander's curse prevents her from using planar travel and causes her
      immense pain as long as she remains on the Material Plane. She does not
      have access to her planewalking ability, and any means she uses to attempt
      to leave the Material Plane fails. She is treated as a native outsider on
      the Material Plane in most ways, but she retains the normal outsider trait
      of not being subject to raise dead, resurrection, or reincarnate. The pain
      of existing on the Material Plane imparts a -2 penalty to her Strength,
      Dexterity, and Constitution&#8211;these penalties are included in her
      stats above. A character must succeed at a DC 20 caster level check to
      remove this curse via remove curse or break enchantment.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: starsoul
DuringCombat: >-
  Zagmaander uses charm person at the start of a fight, but once a battle is
  underway, she resorts to paralysis and rays of enfeeblement to subdue foes.
  She uses Arcane Strike when attacking, but generally does so to deal nonlethal
  damage (taking a &#8211;4 penalty on her attack rolls) so she can preserve
  living victims for her eggs. If reduced to fewer than 40 hit points, however,
  the xill abandons this tactic and uses lethal force.
Morale: >-
  Zagmaander fights to the death unless she's had her curse removed. If freed of
  her curse, she flees combat if reduced to fewer than 30 hit points and then
  planewalks back to the Ethereal Plane as soon as she feels safe enough to
  escape in this way.
