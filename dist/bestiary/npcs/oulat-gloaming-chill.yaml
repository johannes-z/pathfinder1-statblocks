DuringCombat: >-
  Oulat attacks opponents he can flank, using Flyby Attack to dart forward and
  then dash away. He uses his studied target ability on an opponent that closes
  with him, cocking his head at an unnatural angle as though peering through
  them as he does so.
Morale: >-
  Auberon has promised Oulat that he will restore him to life if Oulat is
  destroyed while in the lich's service. In truth, Auberon isn't entirely
  convinced of his ability to do so, but Oulat knows that the lich is
  exceedingly powerful and therefore believes Auberon's claim. As a result,
  Oulat fights to the death.
