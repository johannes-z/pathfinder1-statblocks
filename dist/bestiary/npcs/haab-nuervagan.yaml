BeforeCombat: >-
  Haab prefers to huddle up if he expects problems, loading his crossbow and
  casting enlarge person on himself. The effects of this spell-like ability are
  already factored into his statistics.
DuringCombat: >-
  Haab uses his Improved Shield Bash to shove opponents into his soldiers, but
  if opponents prove especially difficult to hit, he instead focuses on using
  his warhammer alone.
Morale: More proud than practical, Haab fights to the death.
