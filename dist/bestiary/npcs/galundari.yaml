SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Abyssal Rift (Su)
    description: >-
      The first time Galundari slays a creature in a round (but no more than
      once per round), a rift tears open between the plane he currently occupies
      and the Abyss. The slain creature must immediately make a DC 29 Will save
      or his body and gear are drawn through the rift, transported to
      Galundari's trophy room in his palace on the Abyss. Regardless of whether
      the creature's body is drawn through the rift, the rift immediately slams
      shut a moment after it forms, creating a 20-foot-radius burst of chaotic
      energy that staggers all non-demons in the area of effect for 1d10
      rounds-a DC 29 Fortitude save reduces the staggering effect to 1 round. If
      Galundari slays multiple creatures simultaneously, the body targeted by
      the rift is determined randomly. If the body targeted by the rift was a
      good outsider, all creatures (including the dead creature in danger of
      being pulled through the rift) take a &#8211;2 penalty on all saving
      throws against that specific Abyssal rift. This is a teleportation effect.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
