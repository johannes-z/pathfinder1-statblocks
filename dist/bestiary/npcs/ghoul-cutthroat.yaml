    description: >-
      Ghoul Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 13; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC
      is Charisma-based. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more who dies of ghoul
      fever rises as a ghast at the next midnight; all other humanoids rise as
      ghouls.
DuringCombat: >-
  The ghouls try to set up flanking attacks with Clanartus or each other. Once a
  ghoul has tasted the flesh of an enemy, it concentrates all of its attacks
  against that individual.
Morale: The ghouls fight until destroyed.
