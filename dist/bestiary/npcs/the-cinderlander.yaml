BeforeCombat: >-
  The Cinderlander casts pass without trace before going on any scouting
  missions. Before engaging in combat, the Cinderlander casts barkskin on
  himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Cinderlander prefers to fight at range with Vindicator, casting gravity
  bow on the crossbow and then targeting Shoanti to the exclusion of all other
  foes if given a choice. A favorite tactic against mounted enemies is to cast
  charm animal on a mount to lessen its rider's mobility. He resorts to his
  masterwork handaxe only when forced to. His animal companion Neverfar remains
  at his side-the Cinderlander prefers to use the firepelt cougar as a guardian
  while he sleeps rather than as a bodyguard or assassin.
Morale: >-
  Although far from cowardly, the Cinderlander doesn't particularly like the Red
  Mantis. He can be bought, and for a bribe of no less than 500 gp, he abandons
  Cinnabar and the assassins to their fate, even switching sides in the middle
  of combat. He's seen what they're capable of, though, and isn't particularly
  interested in picking a fight against them. In any event, he attempts to flee
  if brought to fewer than 20 hit points.
