BeforeCombat: >-
  Orlicino casts longstrider, barkskin, and gravity bow (which increases his
  bow's base damage to 2d6 for 6 minutes) as soon as he becomes aware of the
  PCs' approach. He then climbs to the top of the fountain and readies an arrow
  to fire at the first person down the staircase.
DuringCombat: >-
  Orlicino uses a move action on the first round and every second round
  thereafter to activate his hunter's bond for his teammates' benefit, targeting
  any human among the PCs. Every other round (or if lacking a suitable human
  target) he makes full attacks using Rapid Shot and Deadly Aim. He uses his bow
  as long as possible, even if enemies climb on the fountain to engage him in
  melee, since his Point Blank Master feat allows him to make ranged attacks
  with his bow without provoking attacks of opportunity.
Morale: >-
  Orlicino does not run until Lyone has surrendered, fled, or been killed, in
  which case he runs for the balcony and attempts to climb the well's shaft to
  escape.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds

  +1 breastplate, +1 composite longbow (+2 Str) with 40 arrows, masterwork
  greatsword, lesser bracers of archery, 25 gp
