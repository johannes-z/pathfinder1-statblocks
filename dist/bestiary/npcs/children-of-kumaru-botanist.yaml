BeforeCombat: >-
  The botanist casts mage armor and false life every morning. The botanist also
  casts blur, shield, and stoneskin if expecting combat, but these three spells
  aren't reflected in the statistics above.
DuringCombat: >-
  The botanist tries to keep out of melee, usually by capturing foes in an acid
  pit or an aqueous orb. The botanist then makes use of chain lightning, greater
  flaming sphere, or the acid jet exploit to attack foes. If forced into melee,
  the botanist attempts to defensively cast plant shape III to transform into a
  treant.
Morale: >-
  The botanist flees the Blue Gardens if reduced to 40 hit points or fewer,
  either with the dimensional slide exploit or the teleport spell. If retreat
  seems impossible, the botanist surrenders.
Gear: >-
  potions of cure serious wounds (2), scroll of greater dispel magic, scroll of
  summon monster IV, scroll of wall of force
OtherGear: >-
  mwk sickle, amulet of natural armor +2, belt of mighty constitution +2, cloak
  of resistance +2, headband of mental prowess +2 (Int, Cha), Tlil mask (see
