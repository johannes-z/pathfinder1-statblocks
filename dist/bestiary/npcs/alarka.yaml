SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burning Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a creature fails a saving throw and takes fire damage from one of
      Alarka's spells, it catches on fire. This fire deals 1 point of fire
      damage per spell level at the beginning of the burning creature's turn.
      The fire lasts for 1d4 rounds, but it can be extinguished as a move action
      if the creature succeeds on a Reflex save (using the spell's DC). Dousing
      the creature with water as a standard action grants a +2 bonus on this
      save, while immersing the creature in water automatically extinguishes the
      fire. Spells that do not grant a save do not cause a creature to catch on
      fire.
  - name: Gaze of Flames (Su)
    description: >-
      Alarka can see through fire, fog, and smoke without penalty as long as the
      light is sufficient to allow her to see normally. She can also gaze
      through any source of flame within 10 feet per oracle level, as if using
      clairvoyance. She can use this ability for a number of rounds per day
      equal to her oracle level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.
  - name: Molten Skin (Ex)
    description: Alarka gains resist fire 10.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Alarka has used one of her 3rd-level spells each day to create food and water
  for those trapped in the tomb. Once she hands over the scepter, allowing the
  door to be opened, she casts divine favor, shield of faith, and bull's
  strength on herself, just in case the PCs betray her. Otherwise, she waits to
  cast these spells, along with divine power, before ambushing the PCs later
  (these are not factored in to her stats).
DuringCombat: >-
  Alarka is a brutal combatant, using her spells and revelations to incinerate
  her foes. She opens with wall of fire to separate the group, before moving on
  to fireball and sound burst to burn and cripple those on her side of the wall.
  She only heals the desert raider if it proves convenient.
