SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Challenge (Ex)
    description: >-
      A number of times per day as a swift action, a samurai chooses one target
      within sight to challenge. The samurai's melee attacks deal extra damage
      when made against the target of his challenge. This extra damage is equal
      to the samurai's level. The samurai can use this ability once per day at
      1st level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels beyond
      1st, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.
  - name: Mount (Ex)
    description: >-
      A samurai gains the use of a trusty and loyal steed; however, the ronin's
      steed does not make an appearance in this scenario.
  - name: Order Challenge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a ronin is the target of a challenge, a smite, a quarry, or
      similar effect, and he issues a challenge against that character in
      return, the ronin receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made against
      the target of his challenge and a +1 dodge bonus to his AC against attacks
      made by the target of his challenge. These bonuses increase by +1 for
      every four class levels the samurai possesses (to a maximum of +5 at 20th
      level).
  - name: Resolve (Ex)
    description: >-
      A number of times per day, a samurai may use resolve in order to perform
      one of the following special abilities. Determined: As a standard action,
      the samurai can spend one use of his resolve to remove the fatigued,
      shaken, or sickened condition. If the samurai is at least 8th level, he
      can alternatively remove the exhausted, frightened, nauseated, or
      staggered condition. If the condition has a duration longer than 1 hour or
      is permanent, this ability removes the condition for 1 hour, at which time
      the condition returns. Resolute: Whenever the samurai is required to make
      a Fortitude or Will save, he can spend one use of his resolve as an
      immediate action to roll twice and take the better result. He must decide
      to use this ability before he rolls the saving throw. Unstoppable: When
      the samurai is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points but not slain, he can
      spend one use of his resolve as an immediate action to instantly stabilize
      and remain conscious. He is staggered, but he does not fall unconscious
      and begin dying if he takes a standard action. He does fall unconscious if
      he takes additional damage from any source.
  - name: Self Reliant (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever the ronin fails a Will saving throw against an effect with a
      duration greater than 1 round, he can attempt another saving throw at the
      end of the second round of the effect. If he makes this saving throw, it
      has the same effect as if he had made the original save (negating part or
      all of the effect). In addition, whenever a ronin is brought below 0 hit
      points, on his next turn he can roll twice to stabilize, taking the better
      result.
  - name: Weapon Expertise (Ex)
    description: >-
      The ronin can draw his katana as a free action as if he had the Quick Draw
      feat. In addition, whenever he threatens a critical hit with a katana, he
      gains a +2 bonus on the confirmation roll. Finally, his samurai levels
      stack with any fighter levels he possesses for the purposes of meeting the
      prerequisites for feats that specifically select his chosen weapon, such
      as Weapon Specialization.
