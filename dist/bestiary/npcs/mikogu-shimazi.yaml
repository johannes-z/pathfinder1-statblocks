BeforeCombat: >-
  Shimazi used nightdrops, then cast magic vestment, bear's endurance, enlarge
  person, entropic shield, and divine favor in his confrontation with Amara and
  Tsuneo. All but divine shield are still active when the PCs arrive, and he
  recasts divine shield at that time. Shimazi used many other spells fighting
  Amara and Tsuneo; when the PCs arrive, Shimazi has only one 3rd-level spell
  slot, three 2nd-level spell slots, and one 1st-level spell slot remaining.
DuringCombat: >-
  If no PCs directly confront him, Shimazi either uses bestow curse to
  debilitate the most threatening PC or casts sound burst while taking cover
  from enemy archers and spellcasters, trusting the saboteur to handle them.
  Shimazi relishes melee combat but becomes easily frustrated and casts fog
  cloud if harassed by ranged weapons and spells.
Morale: >-
  Shimazi has dedicated a tremendous number of Golden League resources to this
  mission, and he has craved an opportunity to exact revenge against the Way of
  the Kirin for years. As a result, he fights to the death.
