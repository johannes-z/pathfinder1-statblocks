      At will, a paladin can use detect evil, as the spell. A paladin can, as a
      move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and
      determine if it is evil, learning the strength of its aura as if having
      studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the
      paladin does not detect evil in any other object or individual within
      range.
