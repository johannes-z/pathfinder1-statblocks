DuringCombat: >-
  All of the Akhumen unleash their arrows on the first round of combat. On
  subsequent rounds, three of the soldiers hang back, continuing to fire arrows
  at foes while the remaining five close ranks and charge into melee, taking
  flanking positions to take advantage of their menacing khopeshes. They
  immediately use their burst of vengeance ability for 2 consecutive rounds,
  hoping to disable their opponents so they can kill foes with slam attacks.
Morale: Loyal to Hakotep even in undeath, the Akhumen fight until destroyed.
Gear: >-
