SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Contingency (Sp)
    description: >-
      If Alaznist takes damage when she doesn't have a displacement spell
      active, a displacement spell immediately activates on her.
  - name: Exceptional Statistics (Ex)
    description: >-
      Alaznist's ability scores were generated using 25 points, rather than the
      standard 15. Additionally, she has much more gear than an NPC of her level
      would normally have. These modifications increase her total CR by 2.
  - name: Feats (Ex)
    description: >-
      Inscribe Rune allows Alaznist to inscribe potent magical runes and was
      used in the creation of her runewell and other historical events, while
      Fleshwarper allows her to craft grafts and create fleshwarped creatures.
      Neither feat plays a direct role in this adventure.
  - name: Immortal (Ex)
    description: >-
      Pacts with forces from the Abyss have allowed Alaznist to live well beyond
      a human's normal lifespan. She gains the +3 bonus to her Intelligence,
      Wisdom, and Charisma scores for having lived beyond venerable age, yet she
      retains the youth of a young woman and does not take the penalties to her
      physical ability scores. She is immune to disease and to all forms of
      madness (including confusion effects and feeblemind).
  - name: Inherent Bonuses (Ex)
    description: >-
      Alaznist has used wish spells to increase her statistics and has a +4
      inherent bonus to her Constitution, Dexterity, Strength, and Wisdom scores
      and a +5 inherent bonus to her Charisma and Intelligence scores.
  - name: Permanent Spells (Sp)
    description: >-
      Alaznist has made the following spells permanent on herself: arcane sight,
      darkvision, see invisibility, and tongues.
  - name: Profane Pact (Su)
    description: >-
      Alaznist bears a brand in the form of the rune of wrath on her hip-a mark
      bestowed by the powerful lilitu demon Ariashrael that also grants the
      runelord a profane pact; this pact grants Alaznist a +4 profane bonus to
      her Constitution score.
