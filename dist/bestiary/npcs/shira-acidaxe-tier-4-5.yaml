BeforeCombat: >-
  Shira has heard of the PCs' investigation from other crewmembers, and she
  drinks her mutagen when they first approach her (already calculated into
  stats).
DuringCombat: >-
  Shira throws bombs at PCs from range, but does not hesitate to fight in melee,
  preferring her natural attacks over her axe, and applying one available dose
  of injury poison to her axe or a claw as a swift action each round. If there
  are any half-orc PCs, she targets them first.
Morale: Shira is maniacal and fights to the death.
