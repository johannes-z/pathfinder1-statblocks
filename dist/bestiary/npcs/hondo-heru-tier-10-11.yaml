BeforeCombat: >-
  Hondo casts mage armor at the start of each day (included in his statistics).
  When his alarm spell triggers or he hears the PCs set off one of the
  basement's traps, he casts invisibility, fly, see invisibility, shield, mirror
  image, and greater arcane sight in that order. When the PCs enter the chamber
  and if they're willing to talk or don't immediately notice him, Hondo tries to
  cast haste, improved invisibility, and displacement, ending with delayed blast
  fireball to initiate combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Hondo starts by casting improved invisibility, followed by a wall of force to
  divide the PCs, and then black tentacles, cloudkill, or transmute rock to mud.
  He uses cloudkill and stinking cloud with impunity in the enclosed area as his
  necklace of adaptation makes him immune to both of them. He uses disintegrate
  on enemy spellcasters and phantasmal killer on melee combatants, reserving
  dispel magic and greater dispel magic for effects that negate his
  invisibility. Against troubling opponents, he casts quickened true strike (or
  true strike) and attacks in melee with his sickles, hoping to get a sneak
  attack if possible.
Morale: >-
  Unwilling to give up his headquarters without a struggle, Hondo fights until
  reduced to 15 or fewer hit points before attempting to teleport away from
  Sothis.
Gear: >-
  masterwork sickles (2), cloak of resistance +2, belt of physical might
  (Constitution and Dexterity) +2, eyes of the eagle, headband of vast
  intelligence +2, necklace of adaptation, ring of protection +2, ointment worth
  250 gp (for true seeing), spell component pouches (2), spellbook (contains all
  prepared spells plus all 0-level and 1st-level spells in the Core Rulebook)
