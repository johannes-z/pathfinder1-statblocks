  The goblin warriors are not brilliant tacticians&#8211; they attack whoever is
  closest and keep attacking until their target is dead or they are. One warrior
  remains at the back, firing his bow, and doesn't resort to melee until the PCs
  reach him.
Morale: The goblin warriors fight to the death.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds
