BeforeCombat: If the cultists hear the PCs approaching, they cast shield of faith.
DuringCombat: >-
  The cultists attempt to flank their opponents in order to make use of sneak
  attack. Since using channel energy would affect their companions, they hold
  off from using that resource until it is tactically sound.
Morale: >-
  Afraid of Melisenn's wrath if they let the PCs delve too deeply into Iris
  Hill, the cultists fight to the death. Once only one cultist remains in the
  fight, that cultist uses channel energy with reckless abandon.
