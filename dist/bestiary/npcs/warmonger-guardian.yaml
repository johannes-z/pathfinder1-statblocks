DuringCombat: >-
  The warmonger devils do their best to remain adjacent to each other so as to
  take advantage of their phalanx ability; note that these devils are not
  impeded by the floor's nature. They enter melee with foes as soon as possible,
  but they use their reach to force smaller creatures to approach via the spiky
  floor. They don't bother summoning lemurs or bearded devils against foes as
  powerful as the PCs.
Morale: The warmonger devils fight to the death.
Gear: +4 full plate, +4 returning adamantine trident
