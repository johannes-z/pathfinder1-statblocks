DuringCombat: >-
  Mr. Thope's main goal is to protect the strongbox and get it to Sethic, but he
  can't carry the heavy box and wield his greatsword at the same time, so he
  remains in the boat or adjacent to it, always keeping the chest within reach.
  If attacked, the half-orc rages, attempting to demoralize his opponents using
  Dazzling Display and his glamered greatsword (which appears to be a fancy
  walking stick until used).
Morale: >-
  Mr. Thope has sworn to deliver the money to Sethic. He does not stop until
  unconscious or dead.
Gear: potion of lesser restoration
OtherGear: +2 glamered breastplate, +1 glameredUE greatsword, mwk chakramUE
