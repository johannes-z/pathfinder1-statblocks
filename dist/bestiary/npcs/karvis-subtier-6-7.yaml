BeforeCombat: >-
  Karvis casts barkskin and produce flame as her group's boat approaches the
  PCs. When Scurvy is within reach, Karvis casts greater magic fang and bull's
  strength on her. In the round just before the boats grapple, she casts summon
  nature's ally IV to summon either an owlbear (space permitting) or a medium
  air elemental in the midst of her enemies.
DuringCombat: >-
  Karvis remains in her own boat, supporting the pirates with spells, hurled
  flame, and bolts of electricity. She drinks her healing potion if reduced to
  28 or fewer hit points.
Morale: >-
  If Scurvy and half of her other allies are killed or incapacitated, Karvis
  uses wild shape to transform into a water elemental and flees north. She also
  flees if reduced to 14 hit points and she has already consumed her healing
  potion.
