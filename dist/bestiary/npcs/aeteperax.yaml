SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Call Grioth (Sp)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as long as the rift at area G5 is open, and only
      within 60 feet of it. This functions as planar ally, but can be used only
      to conjure grioths. Aeteperax doesn't have to present called grioths with
      any offerings-as long as the rift exists, called grioths are bound to his
      will automatically.
  - name: Shameful Name (Ex)
    description: >-
      The first time a PC calls Aeteperax by his true name, Szangi, the dragon
      is visibly rattled&#8211;he becomes staggered for 1 round as he angrily
      roars and curses in Draconic. During this time, he can't focus his mind
      enough to cast spells. Each additional time his true name is spoken beyond
      the first, Aeteperax can resist being staggered if he succeeds at a DC 20
      Will save&#8211;he gains a cumulative +2 bonus on this save each time
      beyond the second his true name is used. If he manages to drop a PC's hit
      points below 0 or kill a PC, he gains an additional +4 bonus on all future
      Will saves to avoid this effect. After the PCs have uttered his true name
      five times, it no longer has an effect on him (other than to make him even
      angrier).
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: Aeteperax casts mage armor.
DuringCombat: >-
  The dragon starts any battle with his breath weapon, swooping down to try to
  catch as many PCs in its area as possible. For the next few rounds, he moves
  back and forth between ledges, casting spells or using entangle on foes down
  below to soften them up. His staff of illusion has only 2 charges remaining
  after his use of persistent image and mislead during the auction, but before
  he enters melee combat he uses the staff to cast mirror image, then drops the
  staff somewhere safe so that he can swoop down and engage foes in melee. His
  first attack is an Improved Vital Strike bite, after which he makes full
  attacks if possible. He spreads his attacks out among multiple targets, but if
  a foe is particularly dangerous, he focuses all of his attacks on that
  opponent.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 40 hit points, Aeteperax suddenly realizes he's in
  significant danger, but his obsession with his treasure and books keeps him
  from fleeing immediately. Instead, he moves to area G8 and starts to gather
  his belongings. Rima, by this point, has hidden herself in the cave, and the
  dragon roars in rage if she's nowhere to be seen. If the PCs take longer than
  5 minutes to reach him, Aeteperax finds and kills Rima, then flees the region
  with the bulk of his treasure gathered up in the chimera skin clutched to his
  chest. If the PCs confront him before this point but after he's found Rima, he
  holds her hostage, telling the PCs he'll hand her over alive if they let him
  leave with his treasure. At this point, if the PCs wish to try to kill him
  before he can make good on his promise to kill her, roll initiative
  again&#8211;on his count, the dragon drops Rima and uses his breath weapon on
  the PCs, stubbornly fighting to the death thereafter.
Gear: staff of illusion (2 charges currently remaining after use at auction)
