BeforeCombat: >-
  If she can, Nyrissa casts death ward, shield, barkskin, spectral hand, and
  flame blade before combat begins.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nyrissa is a complex character with a huge number of choices in battle. She
  also has the advantage of being able to watch everything the PCs do in her
  home via the Fable. As a result, you should take the time to tailor Nyrissa's
  tactics to match the PCs' tactics as closely as possible. She begins most
  battles by casting antilife shell to prevent the PCs from approaching her if
  she can (although in the small confines of the Fable, she'll likely need to
  move up against a wall to make sure that the spell's emanation excludes the
  PCs when she casts it). She uses quickened spells to great effect, healing
  herself of damage or using them to cast spells like haste, displacement, or
  greater invisibility to bolster her defenses. If one of the PCs wields Briar,
  she focuses all of her attention on that PC, doing everything she can to
  defend herself from that PC and either defeat him or separate him from Briar.
  As an artifact, Briar is immune to dispel magic and damage, but that doesn't
  mean she can't use telekinesis to try to disarm it, dismissal on its wielder
  (only if the fight takes place on the First World), or (her favorite tactic)
  maze to keep that foe out of the battle (remember, though, that Briar grants
  SR 30 against her spells).
Morale: >-
  If Nyrissa is reduced to fewer than 100 hit points, she exits the Fable, then
  casts dimension door to reenter a different Fable portal long enough to use
  her magic to heal herself before she returns to area M7c to confront the PCs
  again. In the end, Nyrissa's madness and pride push her to the edge&#8211;she
  fights to the death.
