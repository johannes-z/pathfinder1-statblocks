DuringCombat: >-
  The froghemoth has dug into a large bog just south of the westernmost tree,
  its eyestalk extended up above the surrounding mud. The monster lurches out to
  attack the first creature to come within reach of its tongue, then charges the
  nearest foe if it's not able to grab and gulp down its first target.
Morale: >-
  The froghemoth fights to the death. It does not pursue foes beyond the extent
  of the region shown on the map.
