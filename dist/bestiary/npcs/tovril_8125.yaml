DuringCombat: >-
  Tovril remains invisible, and targets Ekira with beneficial spells and effects
  while encouraging her in Celestial. He avoids performing actions that would
  end invisibility so that he might continue his corruption of the inquisitor,
  though he tends to giggle when everything is going according to plan during
  Encounter 5 (DC 20 Perception to detect the approximate location).
Morale: >-
  Tovril does not actually want to fight, and he flees if his invisibility is
  compromised or when he is reduced to 10 or fewer hit points.
