SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Consumptive Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Like a normal meladaemon, the Jackal Prince radiates an aura of hunger to
      a radius of 20 feet. Every round a creature begins its turn within this
      aura, it must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of
      nonlethal damage and become fatigued from extreme hunger. Creatures that
      don't need to eat are immune to this effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Corrupted Weapons (Su)
    description: >-
      The Jackal Prince's natural weapons-as well as any weapons he
      wields&#8211;are treated as evil for the purpose of overcoming damage
      reduction.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Daemonic Wasting: bite&#8211;injury; save Fort DC 26; onset 1 day;
      frequency 1 day; effect 1d4 Con and 1d4 Cha damage; cure 2 consecutive
      saves.
  - name: Hunger (Su)
    description: >-
      The Jackal Prince's claw attacks and attacks with the Ravenous Blade deal
      an extra 2d6 points of nonlethal damage as it causes terrible pangs of
      hunger. Creatures that don't need to eat are immune to this additional
      damage.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  If aware of an imminent attack, the Jackal Prince casts displacement and
  devours a fruit from the Tree of Desolation, gaining fast healing 2.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Jackal Prince begins combat with waves of exhaustion to weaken his foes.
  He then uses another of his powerful spell-like abilities before closing to
  melee range and allowing his aura to further weaken anyone not affected by his
  previous effects. The Jackal Prince tries to grapple weak characters and
  impale them on the Tree of Desolation.
Morale: Unwilling to give up now, the Jackal Prince fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  +2 leather, Ravenous Blade (+2 wounding falchion; see sidebar on page 57),
  minor ring of energy resistance (acid), ring of evasion
