BeforeCombat: Vorr prepares for combat by casting mirror image and stoneskin on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vorr opens most confrontations with his breath weapon, then uses black
  tentacles and wall of ice to isolate ranged combatants and spellcasters so he
  can focus his attacks on warriors and other "powerful" threats. If reduced
  below 150 hit points, he attempts to recover with the use of false life or
  vampiric touch.
Morale: Vorr fights to the death.
OtherGear: >-
  +2 breastplate, +3 greataxe, amulet of natural armor +2, belt of physical
  might +2 (Str, Con), cloak of resistance +3, ring of protection +2
