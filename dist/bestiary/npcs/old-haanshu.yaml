BeforeCombat: Old Haanshu casts unseen servant every day.
DuringCombat: >-
  Old Haanshu tries to catch as many PCs as possible in the range of effect of a
  crushing despair spell before closing in for melee combat. If he is fighting
  alongside his hobgoblin alchemist allies, the barghest casts mass bull's
  strength on them all and then mass enlarge person if there's room to do so. He
  hangs back in combat to use his spells at range, starting with fly to help him
  stay out of melee. If he's confronted in combat, he casts mirror image on
  himself.
Morale: >-
  The barghest didn't get to be called "Old Haanshu" by being foolish. If
  reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, he surrenders and relies upon the PCs'
  mercy. He vows to leave the area and never return as long as the PCs allow him
  to take his manuscript with him. He cares little about what happens to the
  hobgoblins.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds, potions of cure serious wounds (2), potions of
  invisibility (2), potion of spider climb, scrolls of sending (4), wand of
  scorching ray (CL 7th, 22 charges)
