SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Contingency (Sp)
    description: >-
      If Sorshen is ever reduced to fewer than 100 hit points, a teleport spell
      whisks her away to safety.
  - name: Everdawn Infusion (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sorshen calculates her hp using her Charisma rather than her Constitution
      modifier, and she is immune to bleed effects.
  - name: Exceptional Stats (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sorshen's ability scores were generated using 25 points, and she has more
      gear than an NPC of her level would normally have. These modifications
      increase her total CR by 2.
  - name: Feats (Ex)
    description: >-
      Inscribe Rune allows Sorshen to inscribe potent magical runes and was used
      in the creation of her runewell and other historical events.
  - name: Immortal (Ex)
    description: >-
      Long exposure to the Everdawn Pool has allowed Sorshen to live well beyond
      a human's normal lifespan. Unless slain by violent means, she is immortal.
      She gains the +3 bonus to her Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores
      for having lived beyond venerable age, yet she retains the youth of a
      young woman and does not gain the penalties to her physical ability
      scores. She is immune to disease and to all forms of madness (including
      confusion effects and feeblemind). Sorshen also has the immortal base
      mythic ability from her mythic tier.
  - name: Inherent Bonuses (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sorshen has used wish spells to gain a +5 inherent bonus to all of her
      ability scores.
  - name: Permanent Spells (Sp)
    description: >-

      darkvision, see invisibility, and tongues.
