    description: Numoz is doomed to remain a ghost until Istravek is destroyed.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Numoz identifies a capable warrior and attempts to possess her with his
  malevolence ability. If unable to find a suitable target or if the attempt
  fails, Numoz uses his greater command spell to compel his foes to locate
  Istravek and defeat him. If these strategies fail, Numoz attacks his opponents
  with a combination of his shortspear attacks and his offensive spells,
  augmenting his melee attacks with his greater bane ability.
Morale: Numoz fights until destroyed, only to re-form in this room in 2d4 days.
Gear: +2 ghost touch holy shortspear
