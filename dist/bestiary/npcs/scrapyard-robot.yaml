SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fall to Pieces (Ex)
    description: >-
      Attacks and effects that deal more than 25% of a scrapyard robot's maximum
      hit points to it in damage (10 hit points for a standard scrapyard robot)
      impair one of the robot's components. Determine which subsystem is
      affected randomly by rolling 1d6. If the subsystem that's rolled is
      already impaired, there is no further effect. 1 CPU: The robot becomes
      confused. 2 Fractured Plating: The robot's natural armor bonus is reduced
      by 3. 3 Power Core: Attacks against the robot with natural weapons,
      unarmed strikes, or metal weapons deal 1d6 points of electricity damage to
      the attacker, and the robot's slam attack deals an additional 1d6 points
      of electricity damage. The robot shuts down from power loss in 1d4+1
      rounds. 4 Rotary Saw: The robot loses its rotary saw attack. 5 Servos: The
      robot's speed is reduced to 15 feet, and its CMD against trip combat
      maneuvers is reduced by 8. 6 Sensors: The robot is blinded.
  - name: Repair (Ex)
    description: >-
      A scrapyard robot can use the inactive bodies of other robots to repair
      damage to itself. Doing so restores 10 hit points and removes one
      condition imparted by its fall to pieces ability per 8-hour period of
      uninterrupted work. Eight hours of repair expends all of the salvageable
      parts from one Medium robot that's being used for scrap. For each size
      category a scrapped robot is above Medium, the scrapyard robot can perform
      another 8 hours of repairs using that robot's parts. For each size
      category smaller than Medium the scrapped robots being used are, the
      scrapyard robot requires twice as many scrapped robots to complete 8 hours
      of work.
  - name: Staggered (Ex)
    description: >-
      The poor construction of a scrapyard robot allows it to take only a single
      move or standard action each round. In effect, it always has the staggered
      condition. A scrapyard robot can move up to its speed and attack in the
      same round as a charge action.
DuringCombat: >-
  The robots flank foes when possible, but they attack anyone who attempts to
  damage or use the batteries themselves in preference to any other target.
Morale: A scrapyard robot fights until destroyed.
