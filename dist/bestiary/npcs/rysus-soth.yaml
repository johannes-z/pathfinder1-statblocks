BeforeCombat: >-
  Soth uses any interaction with the PCs before beginning combat to determine
  which Pathfinder seems to be most suspicious or in charge. He prefers to study
  humans, as he knows himself to be most effective in killing them, but prepares
  his death attack against whoever seems to be the greatest threat against his
  ruse.
DuringCombat: >-
  If Soth has prepared his death attack and can execute it against a flat-footed
  foe, he does so, risking retaliation before he can cast greater teleport the
  following round.
Morale: >-
  If unable to execute his death attack in the first round, Soth uses his ring
  of the binding word's daily greater teleport ability to flee to his master's
  chamber in area C6 in the first round of combat.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds (2)
