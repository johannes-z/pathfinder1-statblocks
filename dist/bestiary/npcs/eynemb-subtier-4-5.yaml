BeforeCombat: >-
  Eynemb casts mirror image on himself and uses his shadow puppets ability to
  summon a shadowy fiendish constrictor snake (DC 16 Will save to treat as 20%
  real; see page 17) before interrupting the festival.
DuringCombat: >-
  While letting his giant snake do the fighting, Eynemb casts crushing despair
  and daze monster on those  PCs who seem like obvious fighters. He summons
  another constrictor snake when the first one is destroyed, and he otherwise
  tries to use the nearby rocks as cover from the PCs. He also calls the PCs the
  "true puppets" of the wayangs and their "silly ritual."
Morale: >-
  Eynemb surrenders if reduced to 12 or fewer hit points, calling off his
  shadows in the process. It's unlikely the PCs have time to properly
  interrogate him, as after 3 rounds of combat, the ritual disruption creates a
  more pressing concern (see encounter B2).
