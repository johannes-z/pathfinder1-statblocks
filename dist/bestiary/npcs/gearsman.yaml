SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adaptive Learning (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gearsman has bonus skill ranks that it can reallocate, but this specific
      gearsman does not use this ability.
  - name: Charge Weapon (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any metal melee weapon wielded by a gearsman becomes charged with
      electricity and deals +1d6 points of electricity damage on a hit.
      Self-Repair (Ex) A gearsman's nanites heal it of damage at the rate of a
      number of hit points per hour equal to its Hit Dice (4 hit points per hour
      for most gearsmen). Up to once per day, as a full-round action, it can
      heal any robot it touches of 4d6 points of damage-if a gearsman uses this
      ability on itself, it automatically heals itself of the maximum amount of
      damage: 24 points.
DuringCombat: >-
  Upon noticing intruders, the gearsman lurches to life, confronting them with
  its shrill metallic voice in Androffan: "Intrusion detected. Initiating purge
  protocol 11-321. Please stand down and submit, intruders. Purge protocol
  11-321 demands compliance per core Divinity Directive." The gearsman attacks
  at once, focusing its attacks   on the closest character and continuing to
  attack that target until it falls, at which point it switches to the next
  closest target, repeats its lines, and continues the attack.
Morale: >-
  The gearsman fights until destroyed, but it does not pursue foes from this
  room, nor does it say anything else to the PCs.
