  - name: Sign of the Architect (Ex)
    description: >-
      Kosseruk was born under an auspicious sign for minotaurs, granting her a
      +4 bonus to her Charisma and Intelligence scores.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Kosseruk's bodyguards cast shield other on her each day, halving the damage
  she takes from most sources. If combat is imminent, they further augment her
  with protection from energy and spell resistance. Kosseruk prepares herself
  before combat by using her scrolls of heroism and see invisibility.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kosseruk begins by unleashing her scroll of fireball and then taking a move
  action to center her senses (gaining a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls,
  weapon damage, and Will saves). She relies on Combat Expertise to augment her
  defense and uses Vital Strike whenever possible. The minotaur targets
  spellcasters first.
Morale: Kosseruk is proud and fights to the death.
