DuringCombat: >-
  Ranfearg uses his breath weapon as often as he can, preferring to coordinate
  his attacks with another winter wolf&#8211;for example, flanking or tripping
  an opponent within an area threatened by another wolf.
Morale: >-
  Ranfearg continues to fight as long as one other wolf remains alive. When
  reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, or fewer than 60 hit points if all the
  other wolves are dead, Ranfearg uses dimension door to escape to somewhere
  else in the village.
