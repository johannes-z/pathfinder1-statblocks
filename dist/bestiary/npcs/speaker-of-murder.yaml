BeforeCombat: >-
  One speaker of murder uses inspire courage as soon as the bandits begin down
  the road, and continues until out of performance rounds or dead. The other
  uses countersong if any casters try to use sonic effects on the bandits,
  taking over inspire courage instead if his comrade falls.
DuringCombat: >-
  Both speakers of murder hold back from melee, staying mounted and using spells
  and arrows to fight. One of them lobs a vial of alchemist's fire at the center
  of the barricade each round, attempting to burn it away.
Morale: >-
  Both speakers of murder remain as long as there are bandits to assist; if all
  tengus on the barricade are killed before the final wave, the speakers retreat
  up the road to meet with the reinforcements.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds
OtherGear: >-
  leather lamellar*, katana*, shortbow with 20 arrows, flask of alchemist's
  fire, light horse (combat trained), riding saddle
