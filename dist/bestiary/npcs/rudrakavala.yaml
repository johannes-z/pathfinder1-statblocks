  his feet.
DuringCombat: >-
  Rudrakavala concentrates on stalling those foes capable of dealing the most
  damage. He uses debilitating attacks like energy drain, enervation, and
  vampiric touch before moving in for the kill with his devour soul ability.

  fewer than 60 hit points. There he gathers reinforcements before returning to
