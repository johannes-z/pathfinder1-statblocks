    description: >-
      The ghost captain knows the dread sailors face-that of drowning in the
      briny deep-for it was this horrible fate that claimed him so long ago. As
      a standard action, the ghost captain can cause a single target within 30
      feet to experience the horrors of drowning, which functions as phantasmal
      killer (DC 16 to resist). A creature that successfully saves against this
      effect is immune to it for 24 hours. Water-breathing creatures are also
      immune to this mind-affecting fear effect.
BeforeCombat: The ghost captain casts shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  The ghost captain lets his undead crew do most of the fighting while he
  supports them with psychic spells.
Gear: +1 ghost touch spear, pirate lord's patch*
