DuringCombat: >-
  Koya avoids combat if possible, preferring instead to cast sanctuary and then
  move among the battlefield casting healing magic on her allies. If faced with
  a situation where she can't avoid healing enemies with her channel energy
  ability, Koya always chooses to use the ability anyway if an ally is wounded
  and she has no other options. If confronted on her own, she uses sanctuary to
  aid in her escape after casting longstrider to increase her speed.
Morale: >-
  Koya flees from any combat where she has no allies, but if even one ally
  remains alive, she remains to try to keep him alive as long as she can.
