BeforeCombat: >-
  As soon as Nugrah notices intruders entering the cellar, he casts meld into
  stone to step into the southern wall of area Z11c to listen and wait. While in
  the stone, he casts barkskin, spider climb, and longstrider (already included
  in his stat block). He then clambers out of the wall and up onto the ceiling
  to scuttle forward to see who's intruded in his den.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nugrah's first act is to use wild shape to assume the form of a wolverine,
  while remaining affixed to the ceiling 15 feet above. He swaps out cure
  moderate wounds to cast summon nature's ally III to summon a giant ant to
  attack the PCs, followed by summon swarm. Only then does he scuttle down to
  attack in melee. He does not pursue foes out of the cellar.
Morale: Nugrah fights to the death.
