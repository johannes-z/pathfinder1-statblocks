    description: >-
      Each of the amphisbaena's heads functions independently of the other. An
      amphisbaena that is cut in half by 10 or more points of slashing damage
      from a single attack for a Tiny creature, 20 or more points of damage for
      a Small or Medium creature, 30 or more points of damage for a Large
      creature, 40 or more points of damage for a Huge creature, 50 or more
      points of damage for a Gargantuan creature, and 60 or more points of
      damage for a Colossal creature continues to function normally (each with
      half its current hit points) and reattaches its body together in 1d2 days.
      An amphisbaena that has been split cannot be split again until it
      reattaches.
