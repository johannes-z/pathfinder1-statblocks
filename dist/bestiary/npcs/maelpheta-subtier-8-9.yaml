SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Confusion (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature bitten by a marai's bite (from either its actual mouth or the
      snakes it has for hands) must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or become
      confused for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Energy Bolts (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action that provokes an attack of
      opportunity, Maelpheta's six snake arms can each spit a bolt of energy to
      a maximum range of 60 feet. Each bolt deals 1d8 points of damage and has
      an additional effect if the target fails to resist it with a successful DC
      21 Fortitude save, as summarized below. The save DC is Constitution-based.
      Amethyst Viper: Cold damage plus sickened for 1d4 rounds. Crimson Viper:
      Fire damage plus burn (1d4, DC 19). Emerald Viper: Acid damage plus
      nauseated for 1 round. Magenta Viper: Electricity damage plus staggered
      for 1 round. Turquoise Viper: Sonic damage plus stunned for 1 round.
      Violet Viper: Force damage plus knocked prone.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: destined
BeforeCombat: >-
  If aware that something has gone wrong at the Golden Serpent, Maelpheta casts
  mage armor in anticipation of conflict. This spell effect is already included
  in her statistics.
DuringCombat: >-
  If the PCs do not force her into close combat, Maelpheta uses her energy bolts
  to target as many PCs as possible, following up with crushing despair,
  scorching ray, and acid arrow while her viper arms recharge. She uses blink to
  increase her survivability while continuing her energy bolt assault and
  employing dispel magic to eliminate any particularly powerful spell effects.
  In close combat, she makes full attacks against a single opponent, counting on
  her confusion supernatural ability to distract her opponent on the following
  round to give her time to move away.
Morale: >-
  Maelpheta flees if brought down to 25 hit points or fewer, using her cape of
  the mountebank to get as far from the PCs as possible.
Gear: >-
  cape of the mountebank, pearl of power (2nd level spell), ring of
  forcefangsAPG, key to all locks in area C
