    description: >-
      When a lurker above grapples a target, it forms an airtight seal around
      its prey. A grappled target cannot speak or cast spells with verbal
      components, and must hold its breath (see the rules for suffocation on
      page 445 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).
DuringCombat: >-
  The lurker above has to squeeze while it's inside the gazebo, and as such
  takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to its AC as long as it
  remains within. It remains in the gazebo until it's no longer grappling a foe,
  at which point it squeezes out to attack and chase the nearest foe. Canny PCs
  might be able to get the lurker above to fight the tendriculoses or other
  creatures in the region.
Morale: >-
  The lurker above flees back up to the Asylum Stone's ceiling far above if
  reduced to 20 or fewer hit points-it does not return to this region.
