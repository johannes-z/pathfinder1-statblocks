SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burnt Othur Oil (Ex)
    description: >-
      This Dawnflower assassin has a dose of burnt othur fumes distilled into a
      liquid form. This poison functions as burnt othur fumes, except that its
      type is changed to injury.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Before breaking into the merchant's room, the assassin has consumed his
  potions of barkskin and cat's grace, applied his oil of magic weapon and burnt
  othur oil to his scimitar, and dipped his darts in giant wasp venom.
DuringCombat: >-
  The assassin focuses on killing the merchant. He turns invisible or flanks as
  necessary to avoid enemy attacks and to deal sneak attack damage. If he's
  unable to complete his mission due to the PCs' efforts, he attacks them until
  he again has an opportunity to assassinate his target.
Morale: >-
  Unless he believes he is just about to finish off the merchant, the assassin
  flees if reduced to 5 or fewer hit points. If he kills the merchant, he begins
  striking down the zombies (as they are an affront to Sarenrae), fleeing if
  reduced to 11 or fewer hit points.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of cat's grace, potion of barkskin, oil
  of magic weapon, smokestick, tanglefoot bag
