BeforeCombat: If he hears intruders approaching, Svilennius drinks his shield extract.
DuringCombat: >-
  Svilennius orders Mr. Marrow to attack intruders before casting bomber's eye
  and throwing frost bombs. If forced into melee, Svilennius drinks his mutagen,
  increasing his Strength and natural armor at the expense of his intellect,
  then drinks one of his potions of enlarge person.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, Svilennius drinks his expeditious
  retreat extract and tries to flee through area 26 or one of the other exits
  (likely by jumping down the shaft to area 11) to escape the ossuary. He
  refuses to be captured and brought before the church of Pharasma for justice,
  so if cornered, he fights to the death.

  command undead (13 charges), acid (2), alchemist's fire (2), smokesticks (2),
