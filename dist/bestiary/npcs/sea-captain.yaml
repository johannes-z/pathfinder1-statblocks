BeforeCombat: The druid casts barkskin and bull's strength.
DuringCombat: >-
  The druid is well aware of his physical shortcomings, and wild shapes into a
  Medium air elemental the first chance he gets to escape melee combat. Once at
  a safe altitude, he casts wind wall and freedom of movement. If still
  threatened, he casts offensive spells such as flame strike or sleet storm, or
  uses his Weather domain spell-like abilities. If targeted by spellcasters, he
  casts fog cloud to obscure vision. If forced into melee, he casts greater
  magic fang before wild shaping into a Huge animal (preferably a triceratops or
  an orca).
