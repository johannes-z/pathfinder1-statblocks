  - name: Vulnerable to Smoke (Ex)
    description: >-
      Smoke from particularly smoky fires or effects (such as that caused by a
      pyrotechnics spell) causes a giant bee troop to become nauseated if it
      fails a DC 14 Fortitude save. This condition persists as long as the troop
      remains in the smoke, plus 1d4 rounds.
DuringCombat: >-
  The bees adjust the shape of their troop so as to include as many foes as
  possible within their area.
Morale: >-
  While defending their hives, the giant bees are fearless and fight to the
  death, though they flee if attacked while nauseated by smoke. Outside the
  hive, they're less aggressive, and the troop withdraws if reduced to 20 hit
  points or fewer.
