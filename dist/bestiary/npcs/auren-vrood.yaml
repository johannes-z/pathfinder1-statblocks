BeforeCombat: >-
  Vrood casts false life and mage armor every morning. Before combat, he casts
  stoneskin, shield, fly, and protection from good, in that order.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vrood tries to keep his undead allies in front of him, activating his negative
  energy conduit aura to bolster them, and making ranged touch attacks with
  spectral hand. If it looks like any enemies might reach him, he flies to the
  central part of the tower and threatens, "When next we meet, I shall spit your
  hearts upon the Gallowspire!" Contrary to these words, he then flies out of
  sight, casts greater invisibility, and flies back in to continue his attack,
  using his lesser silent metamagic rod to cast silent spells at foes.
Morale: >-
  Vrood fights to the death. He asks no quarter and if captured refuses to talk
  to enemies, preferring death.
Gear: lesser silent metamagic rod, wand of animate dead (10 charges)
OtherGear: >-
