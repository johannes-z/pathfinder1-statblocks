SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Command Ghouls (Su)
    description: >-
      A dread ghoul can automatically command all normal ghouls within 30 feet
      as a free action. Normal ghouls never attack a dread ghoul unless
      compelled.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature killed by a dread ghoul that lies undisturbed and uneaten
      until the next midnight rises as a dread ghoul at that time. The new dread
      ghoul is not under the control of its creator. A protection from evil or
      gentle repose spell cast on the corpse prevents this.
  - name: Death Burst (Ex)
    description: >-
      Overstuffed from ravenous consumption, the bellies of these corpulent
      ghouls explode in a burst of filth when killed. All adjacent creatures are
      exposed to this gore and must make a DC 17 Fortitude save to avoid being
      sickened for 1d6 rounds and contracting ghoul fever.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Ghoul Fever: Death Burst-contact; save Fort DC 17; onset 1 day; frequency
      1/day; effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
DuringCombat: >-
  The ghouls flank with each other to make sneak attacks, though if a ghoul
  successfully paralyzes an opponent, it immediately begins feeding on its
  victim, ignoring other foes.
Morale: >-
  The ghouls fight until destroyed, exploding in a shower of gore and
  disease-ridden flesh.
Gear: +1 leather armor, amulet of mighty fists +1
