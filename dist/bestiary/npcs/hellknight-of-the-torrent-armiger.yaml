DuringCombat: >-
  Even if unarmed (as detailed above), the armigers are brave and eager to help
  in a fight. Of course, they would prefer to be outfitted with their full plate
  and halberds first. They begin any battle using Power Attack, but abandon this
  tactic if after a few rounds they're having trouble hitting foes.
Morale: >-
  A Torrent armiger fights to the death unless ordered to do otherwise by a
  superior.
