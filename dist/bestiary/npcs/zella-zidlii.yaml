SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blessing of the Harrow (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Zella can spend 10 minutes to provide a 24-hour-long bonus
      by performing a harrowing for herself and all allies within 20 feet. Roll
      1d6 to determine the results: 1 = +1 on all attack rolls, 2 = +1 to AC, 3
      = +1 on weapon damage rolls, 4 = +1 on all skill checks, 5 = +1 on all
      saving throws, 6 = +1 on caster level checks and concentration checks.
      Harrower Abilities To speed game play, Zella's harrower class abilities
      presented here use die rolls to resolve their effects, but you can use the
      rules given in the harrower prestige class if you have a Pathfinder Cards:
      Deluxe Harrow Deck.
  - name: Harrow Casting (Su)
    description: >-
      Up to six times per day, Zella can perform a harrow casting by adding a
      somatic component and focus component (her harrow deck) to a spell as she
      casts it. When she does so, she rolls 1d6 three times: 1 = Zella gains the
      tower of charisma; 2 = Zella gains the tower of intelligence; 3 = Zella
      gains the tower of strength. The bonuses granted by these tower effects
      stack. She gains no benefit from results of 4-6.
  - name: Spirit Deck (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once per day, Zella can create a translucent harrow
      deck made of force and cause it to strike a target within 30 feet. She
      rolls 1d6 six times to determine how much force damage the deck deals (the
      results are cumulative): 1 = 5 points of damage; 2&#8211;3 = 3 points of
      damage; 4&#8211;5 = 1 point of damage; 6 = 0 points.
  - name: Tower of Charisma (Su)
    description: >-
      Each time she rolls a 1 when using harrow casting, Zella increases the
      spell's save DC by 1.
  - name: Tower of Intelligence (Su)
    description: >-
      Each time she rolls a 2 when using harrow casting, Zella adds a +1 bonus
      on rolls made to penetrate Spell Resistance.
  - name: Tower of Strength (Su)
    description: >-
      Each time she rolls a 3 when using harrow casting, Zella's spell deals 1
      extra point of damage per damage die (if the spell deals hit point
      damage).
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Zella casts cat's grace, mage armor, false life, and shield before combat. In
  addition, each morning she performs a blessing of the harrow for Barzillai.
  Make sure to note what effect her blessing grants to herself and Barzillai
  (since this is a random bonus, it is not already calculated into her
  statistics or Barzillai's).
DuringCombat: >-
  Zella begins combat with chain lightning, then follows with her pit spells to
  keep the PCs from controlling the battlefield. She enjoys using her spirit
  deck attack on severely wounded enemies in hopes of killing them with the
  attack. If forced into melee, she fights with her bladed scarf, using its
  bonus to aid her AC while she seeks to move to range or find allies so she can
  return to spellcasting.
Morale: >-
  Zella is eager to meet her final reward in Hell, but believes suicide will
  undo her hard work. She fights to the death as a result.
Gear: >-
  +2 defending bladed scarf, belt of mighty constitution +2, cloak of resistance
  +1, ring of protection +1, infernal-themed harrow deck worth 600 gp, 146 gp
