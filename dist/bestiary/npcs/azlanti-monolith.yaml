    description: >-
      As a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds, an iron golem can exhale a
      10-foot cube of poisonous gas. This gas cloud persists for 1 round; any
      creature within the area when the golem creates it (as well as any
      creature that passes through the cloud during the remainder of that round)
      is exposed to the cloud's poisonous effects. This poison is magically
      created each time the golem uses this power. Breath weapon-inhaled; save
      Fort 19; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution damage;
      cure 2 saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. Cold Iron This iron golem
      is constructed from cold iron, meaning its slam attacks count as cold iron
      weapons.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      An iron golem is immune to spells and spell-like abilities that allow
      spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against
      it, as noted below. &#8226; A magical attack that deals electricity damage
      slows an iron golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving
      throw. &#8226; A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow
      effect affecting the golem, and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points
      of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would
      cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess
      as temporary hit points. The iron golem gets no saving throw against fire
      effects. &#8226; An iron golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such
      as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.
  - name: Powerful Blows (Ex)
    description: >-
      An iron golem inflicts one and a half times its Strength modifier and
      threatens a critical hit on a 19&#8211;20 with its slam attacks.
