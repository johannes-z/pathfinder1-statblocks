SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Ghoul Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 13; onset 1 day; frequency 1 day;
      effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC
      is Charisma-based. A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at
      the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none
      of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of any
      other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like
      a normal ghoul in all respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as
      a ghast.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Dalirio sits at his desk, looking over paperwork. Unless otherwise warned, he
  does not expect the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  Dalirio orders his skeletons to attack and uses cause fear, lesser confusion,
  and hold person to keep the PCs back. Once those spells are gone&#8211;or once
  the PCs reach him&#8211;he switches to melee and relentlessly attacks the
  nearest PC. Once this victim is unconscious, Dalirio picks the next closest PC
  to attack, and so on.
Morale: Dalirio fights to the death.
