DuringCombat: >-
  After using its spore burst ability, the xenopterid spore zombie bites and
  claws at the nearest PC it can reach. The zombie attempts to grapple that PC
  and use its blood drain ability. It drags a grappled PC into a corner if it
  can, to protect itself from attacks from other PCs while it feeds.
