BeforeCombat: >-
  At the earliest indication that someone else is in the tower, Eliza casts mage
  armor from her wand; otherwise, she casts it on the first round of combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Eliza activates her dark half ability. While in area P13, she relies on the
  symbol of mirroring, but she casts mirror image if she moves to a new
  location. She uses mind thrust II as her primary attack and makes use of her
  phrenic amplifications to bolster herself.
Morale: >-

  the veiled master's domination, however, she may consider surrendering,
  particularly if Rayland asks her.

  fire (4)
