SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Crystallization (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature struck by a ruby-wing gargoyle's sting must succeed at a DC 17
      Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. On a critical hit,
      the sting deals 1d6 points of Dexterity damage if the target fails its
      save. As long as the target creature suffers any of this damage, portions
      of its body appear as living red crystal and it gains the earth creature
      subtype. A creature drained to 0 Dexterity in this manner transforms into
      a red crystal statue, as if affected by flesh to stone. Every day, a
      petrified creature can attempt a new DC 17 Fortitude saving throw to break
      free from its petrified state, but if it fails two of these saving throws
      in a row, the petrification becomes permanent. The save DC is
      Charisma-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.
