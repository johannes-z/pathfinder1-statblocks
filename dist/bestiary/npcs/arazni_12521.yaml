  - name: Exceptional Resources (Ex)
    description: >-
      Arazni has the wealth of a 20th-level PC rather than an NPC. This
      increases her CR by 1. She used some of this wealth to acquire the
      following books to gain inherent bonuses to her ability scores: manual of
      gainful exercise +5, manual of quickness in action +4, tome of clear
      thought +5, and tome of leadership and influence +5. Permanent Spells
      Using permanency, Arazni gave herself the constant effects of arcane
      sight, resistance, and see invisibility. A contingency effect casts harm
      on her if she's brought below 100 hit points.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Every day, Arazni casts detect scrying, false life, greater magic weapon,
  mythic mage armor, and overland flight on herself, using her arcane
  metamastery path ability to gain the benefit of Extend Spell with each.
DuringCombat: >-
  Arazni begins combat by casting time stop and then casts spell turning, mind
  blank, greater invisibility, haste, and resist energy on herself, in that
  order. She uses her spells efficiently, such as by casting meteor swarm to
  clear out assembled defenders.
Morale: >-
  Arazni's goal is not to slay Tar-Baphon-as she knows that such a victory would
  be temporary without access to his phylactery-but instead to provoke the
  volatile tyrant into unleashing the Radiant Fire onto her and his troops. As
  such, she doesn't back down or retreat from fighting him.
Gear: >-
  lesser maximize metamagic rod, pearls of power (2, 3rd level), rod of
  absorption, scroll of greater scrying, scroll of teleport, scroll of tongues,
  wand of inflict light wounds (48 charges)
