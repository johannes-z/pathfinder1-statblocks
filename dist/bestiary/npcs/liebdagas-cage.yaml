    description: >-
      Liebdaga's cage can effectively move at a speed of 30 feet as if under the
      effects of air walk, as it moves by shifting its position in the room by
      lengthening or shortening the chains that hold it in the room. It cannot
      leave area F37 at all.
DuringCombat: >-
  The cage cannot leave this chamber, and remains animated as long as there are
  visible targets. The cage itself is red hot, and inflicts additional fire
  damage on each hit. In addition, for every cooling chamber left active, the
  cage gains 2 points of fast healing-the stats here assume all five cooling
  chambers are deactivated.
Morale: The cage fights until destroyed.
