SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Chain of the Dead (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a gallowdead can use its chain to attack its
      enemies. This acts as a ranged touch attack against any foe within 20
      feet. If the attack hits, the target takes 1d6 points of damage for every
      2 Hit Dice possessed by the gallowdead, to a maximum of 10d6. In addition,
      if the attack hits, the gallowdead can make a free combat maneuver check
      against its target with a +4 racial bonus. If the check succeeds, the
      target becomes grappled, but the gallowdead does not gain the grappled
      condition in this case. The gallowdead can make a free combat maneuver
      check each round to maintain its grip on the victim, but cannot take any
      of the special grapple actions against the victim if the check is a
      success.
  - name: Whispers (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gallowdead constantly whispers vile secrets and blasphemous chants. Any
      creature within 30 feet of a whispering gallowdead must make a DC 21 Will
      save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds. Shaken creatures that fail this
      saving throw become nauseated by the secrets revealed. Each round, an
      affected creature may make a new Will save to recover from the effect-once
      a creature recovers from a gallowdead's whispers, it is immune to this
      ability for 24 hours. Each additional overlapping whisper aura from
      additional gallowdead increases the save DC by +2. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  Gallowdead always use Power Attack (included in stat block). They fight with
  single-minded purpose, focusing their attacks against one foe at a time before
  moving on to the next target.
