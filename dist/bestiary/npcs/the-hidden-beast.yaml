Bloodline: undead
BeforeCombat: >-
  The Hidden Beast casts extended false life on itself every day and places a
  silent mental alarm at each of the room entrances. It uses its ring of
  invisibility to remain invisible at all times.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Hidden Beast concentrates on maintaining the illusion of the undead
  speaker, hoping the PCs waste at least a round fighting it while its vampire
  minions move into position around them. The creature uses ventriloquism to
  disguise its actual location, taking the first few rounds of combat to cast
  displacement, mirror image, and shield on itself. The Hidden Beast is fond of
  using telekinesis to disarm foes, but it generally starts its offense by
  casting phantasmal killer or lightning bolt. It avoids melee combat unless it
  can engage a foe one-on-one.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 0 hit points, the Hidden Beast automatically assumes gaseous
  form and attempts to escape through the fissures in and around the dais in the
  center of this room. These narrow fissures lead down 30 feet to a circular
  cavern, 20 feet in diameter, that serves as the Hidden Beast's "coffin." Once
  at rest here, it rematerializes and is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after
  1 hour, then it is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit
  points per round from its fast healing. Once fully healed, it seeks out the
  PCs for swift and brutal revenge, losing sight of all other tasks until it
  succeeds at this quest.
