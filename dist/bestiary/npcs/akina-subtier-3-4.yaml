SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A vampire can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the vampire
      establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of
      Constitution damage. The vampire heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary
      hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points
      equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood.
  - name: Dominate (Su)
    description: >-
      A vampire can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action.
      Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly
      under the vampire's influence, as per dominate person (caster level 12th).
      The ability has a range of 30 feet.
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by a vampire spawn's slam gains 1 negative level. This
      ability triggers only once per round, regardless of the number of attacks
      the vampire spawn makes.
  - name: Gaseous Form (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous form at will (caster
      level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of
      20 feet with perfect maneuverability.
  - name: Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)
    description: >-
      A raise dead or similar spell cast on a vampire spawn destroys it (Will
      negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material
      component.
  - name: Shadowless (Ex)
    description: A vampire casts no shadows and shows no reflection in a mirror.
  - name: Spider Climb (Ex)
    description: >-
      A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though under the effects of a spider
      climb spell. Vampire Weaknesses Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor
      of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil
      from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don't harm
      the vampire-they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at
      least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make
      melee attacks against that creature. Holding a vampire at bay takes a
      standard action. After 1 round, a vampire can overcome its revulsion of
      the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 25 Will save.
      Vampires cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by
      someone with the authority to do so. Reducing a vampire's hit points to 0
      or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see fast
      healing). However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire
      to direct sunlight staggers it on the first round of exposure and destroys
      it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure if it does not
      escape. Each round of immersion in running water inflicts damage on a
      vampire equal to one-third of its maximum hit points-a vampire reduced to
      0 hit points in this manner is destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a
      helpless vampire's heart instantly slays it (this is a full-round action).
      However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the head is
      also severed and anointed with holy water.
