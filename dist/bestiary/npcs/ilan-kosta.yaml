BeforeCombat: >-
  Should Ilan hear the sound of combat from elsewhere in the cultists' complex,
  he casts magic circle against good on himself, and desecrate in the center of
  the inner sanctum. Neither of these effects are reflected in Ilan's stats or
  those of his allies.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ilan casts bestow curse and blindness/deafness, then uses his whip to soften
  up enemies for energy drain. If he has no luck with his whip, he instead
  employs hold person on the closest target, and drains the creature of its
  blood the following round. When he and his allies need healing, he
  spontaneously casts cure spells or channels negative energy to heal them; he
  only uses channel negative energy to harm his foes if all his allies have been
  destroyed.
Morale: >-
  Ilan fights in his sanctum and knows there is nowhere he can go to escape
  utter destruction if he is defeated. Thus, he fights to the death to keep his
  cult alive.
