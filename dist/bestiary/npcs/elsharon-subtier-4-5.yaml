SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Earth Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A burrowing earth elemental can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any
      other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water.
      If protected against fire damage, it can even glide through lava. Its
      burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple
      or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area
      containing a burrowing earth elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet,
      stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds at a DC 15 Fortitude
      save.
  - name: Earth Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      An earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it
      and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or
      waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls.
      These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the
      elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These
      modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  If Elsharon opposes the PCs, she trusts her strength against them and doesn't
  use Power Attack unless a foe seems unfazed by one of her hits. Depending upon
  the combat situation, she may use bull rush maneuvers to grant her allies
  attacks of opportunity rather than using her slam attacks. If she reduces a PC
  below 0 hit points, she takes a round to attack the closest air elemental
  before turning her attention back to the remaining PCs. She attacks oreads
  last if she can help it. If Elsharon is the PC's side, she attempts to clear
  out the smaller air elementals first before turning her attention to Iyasset.
Morale: >-
  Elsharon fights to the death against the Ainsi representatives. If the PCs
  surrender, she mocks them for siding with Iyasset, but allows them to leave
  with their lives.
