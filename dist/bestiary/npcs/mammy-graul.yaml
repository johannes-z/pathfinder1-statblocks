SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ogrekin Deformities (Ex)
    description: >-
      Mammy Graul's thick layers of blubber increase her natural armor bonus by
      an additional 3 points, but her obesity also reduces her speed to 5 feet
      and imparts a -4 penalty to her Dexterity.
Gender: Female
ProhibitedSchools: Abjuration, Enchantment
BeforeCombat: >-
  As soon as she hears trouble outside, Mammy Graul casts mage armor and false
  life on herself. If she realizes someone's about to enter her room, she casts
  mirror image and fly as well.
DuringCombat: >-
  If the PCs confront Mammy Graul here, she's more enraged at her boys for
  allowing the PCs to get this far than she is at the PCs themselves, and her
  profanity-laced shrieks against her boys fill any surviving Grauls with such
  fear that none of them dare come to their mother's aid. Mammy Graul sends her
  three zombies to engage the PCs while she remains on her bed in the northwest
  corner of the room and casts spells. She starts with spectral hand and follows
  up with her offensive spells.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, she casts dimension door and retreats to
  area A16 to secure the aid of any surviving Grauls there. She leads them back
  to the farmhouse to attack the PCs, this time fighting to the death.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds, wand of magic missile (CL 3rd, 44 charges),
  wand of ray of enfeeblement (28 charges), wand of vampiric touch (33 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork quarterstaff, spellbook (contains all prepared spells plus animate
  dead, magic missile, ray of enfeeblement, and 2d4 additional spells of your
