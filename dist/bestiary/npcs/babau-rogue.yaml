SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Protective Slime (Su)
    description: >-
      A layer of acidic slime coats a babau's skin. Any creature that strikes a
      babau with a natural attack or unarmed strike takes 1d8 points of acid
      damage from this slime if it fails a DC 19 Reflex save. A creature that
      strikes a babau with a melee weapon must make a DC 19 Reflex save or the
      weapon takes 1d8 points of acid damage; if this damage penetrates the
      weapon's hardness, the weapon gains the broken condition. Ammunition that
      strikes a babau is automatically destroyed after it inflicts its damage.
DuringCombat: >-
  The babau demons attempt to lure the PCs toward the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing
  by moving to flank it, swatting at the gnome, and attacking the PCs with
  chakrams. They avoid entering the reach of the wolf-in-sheep's clothing unless
  doing so would be to their advantage; they correctly suspect that the
  aberration doesn't want to attack them, especially not if there is other food
  available.
Morale: If one babau dies, the other flees if reduced to 30 hp or less.
OtherGear: mwk longspear, chakrams (4)
