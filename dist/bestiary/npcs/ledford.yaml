BeforeCombat: >-
  Eager to brawl, only Deandre's intimidation keeps Ledford from rushing in
  before her signal.
DuringCombat: >-
  On his first turn, Ledford begins his rage ability, moves to the first PC he
  can reach, and attacks using power attack. He maintains his rage for the
  following 6 rounds, but stops using Power Attack if his first two attacks miss
  a particular PC. If given a choice of targets, Ledford always chooses the
  biggest, strongest PC. Gleeful at finally being paid to fight people, Ledford
  shouts out taunts with each blow, followed with a short laugh. He clearly
  enjoys combat.
Morale: >-
  While raging, Ledford fights to the death. If fatigued at the end of his 6
  rounds of rage and reduced to 4 or fewer hit points, Ledford offers to call
  the fight a draw. Disgusted with his performance, Deandre may strike the
  failed barbarian.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork chain shirt, greataxe, block of wax in a metal tin, fine comb with
  a long handle, bottle of whiskey and four silver cups, 25 gp
