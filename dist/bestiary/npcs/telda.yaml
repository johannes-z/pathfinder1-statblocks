SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Armor of Bones (Su)
    description: >-
      Telda can conjure armor made of bones that grants her a +4 armor bonus for
      4 hours per day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it
      must be spent in 1-hour increments.
  - name: Bleeding Wounds (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a creature takes damage from one of Telda's spells or effects
      that causes negative energy damage, it begins to bleed, taking 1 point of
      damage each round. The bleeding can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal
      check or any effect that heals damage. Skeleton Summoner Telda adds "human
      skeleton" to the list of creatures she can summon with summon monster I
      and "human skeletal champion" to the list of creatures she can summon with
      summon monster III. Once per day, when casting summon monster, she may
      summon a skeletal version of one of the creatures on that spell's
      summoning list (apply the skeleton template to that creature to create
      this monster).
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If she discovers that intruders have entered her lair, Telda conjures her
  armor of bones and casts false life and shield of faith before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once combat begins, Telda's curse takes effect, causing her voice to deepen
  and only allowing her to communicate in Abyssal. Telda casts obscuring mist
  during the first round of combat. She hides within the mist while she casts
  summon monster I to summon a human skeleton using her Skeleton Summoner feat.
  Telda casts lesser animate dead on any available corpse or skeleton, including
  a slain PC if the opportunity presents itself.
Morale: >-
  Telda fights to the death, believing that her goddess will reward her in the
  afterlife for her unfaltering servitude.
