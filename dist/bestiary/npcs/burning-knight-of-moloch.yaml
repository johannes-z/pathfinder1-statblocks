SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hellfire Aura (Ex)
    description: >-
      Creatures adjacent to a Burning Knights of Moloch take 1d6 points of
      hellfire damage at the start of their turn. Anyone who strikes a Burning
      Knights of Moloch with an unarmed strike or natural attack takes 1d6
      points of fire damage. This replaces the graveknight's phantom mount
      ability.
  - name: Inferno Bound (Su)
    description: >-
      The Burning Knights of Moloch are tied to the powers of the Inferno Gate.
      Each hour a Burning Knight spends farther than 1 mile from the Inferno
      Gate, it takes a cumulative -1 penalty to its Charisma score.
  - name: Ruinous Revivification (Su)
    description: >-
      A Burning Knights of Moloch is ablaze with hellfire, and its channel
      destruction, devastating blast, and hellfire aura abilities deal hellfire
      damage, half of which is fire damage and half of which is damage from
      unholy energy. Evil-aligned creatures and creatures with the evil subtype
      take no damage from the unholy energy, but good-aligned creatures and
      those with the good subtype take double the normal damage from it.
      Creatures under the effects of spells like protection from evil are
      unaffected by the unholy energy, though they still take fire damage.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Burning Knights unleash their devastating blasts, then leap into melee
  with their longspears. The knights throw spears at opponents beyond melee
  range.
Morale: The Burning Knights of Moloch fight until they are destroyed.
