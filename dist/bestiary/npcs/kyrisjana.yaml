SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Anathema (Su)
    description: >-
      Kyrisjana has been rejected by the purity of nature. Normal plants within
      20 feet wither and die if she remains in proximity for more than 5
      minutes. Pure environments such as untouched forests and clear streams and
      ponds may become spoiled and polluted if she remains in that environment
      for more than 1 day. Each round that a plant creature remains within 20
      feet of Kyrisjana, it must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or take 1d2
      points of damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Defiling Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature struck by Kyrisjana's claws takes 1d6 points of Charisma damage
      (Fortitude DC 22 negates), in addition to the attack's normal damage. The
      damage dealt by Kyrisjana's natural attacks resists all magical healing
      (though it can be healed normally through rest). A creature attempting to
      cast a cure spell or heal spell on a creature damaged by Kyrisjana's claws
      must succeed at a DC 22 caster level check, or the spell has no effect on
      the injured creature. The DC is Constitution-based, and includes a +2
      racial bonus. Spells Kyrisjana casts spells as a 9th-level druid.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Kyrisjana casts endure elements and longstrider every day. Before combat, she
  casts feather step and bloody claws.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kyrisjana emerges from the pile of wildflowers and casts stone call while her
  blinding beauty affects all who look at her. She casts summon nature's ally V
  to summon a Large air elemental, taking advantage of its whirlwind ability to
  increase the damage of her call lightning spell. Kyrisjana uses her stunning
  glance to throw her opponents off guard before attacking with her claws and
  defiling touch, reveling in the sensation of her enemies' blood on her bare
  skin.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 25 hit points, Kyrisjana offers to surrender,
  promising a variety of depraved pleasures to her captors if they let her live,
  though she turns on those who show her mercy at the first opportunity. If her
  offer is rebuffed, Kyrisjana fights to the death, hurling curses at her foes.
