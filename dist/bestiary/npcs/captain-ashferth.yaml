BeforeCombat: >-
  Captain Ashferth imbibes his potions of bear's endurance and bull's strength
  if he has time to prepare for intruders.
DuringCombat: >-
  Captain Ashferth uses Power Attack on every swing with his longsword. Because
  of his dulled wits, there is only a 50% chance each round that he will
  remember to use Spring Attack and Mobility when he would tactically benefit
  from it.
Morale: >-
  If Captain Ashferth is brought to half his total hit points, his sense of
  self-preservation kicks in, allowing him an opposed Charisma check against
  Gravvik to break the enchantment on him. Whether or not the charm is still in
  effect, if brought below 20 hit points, Captain Ashferth surrenders. If given
  no quarter, he fights to the death.
Gear: potion of bear's endurance, potion of bull's strength
OtherGear: >-
  +1 breastplate, masterwork light steel shield, +1 longsword, masterwork short
  sword, ring of protection +2, Chelish officer's uniform (stained and ripped),
  keys to the colony locks
