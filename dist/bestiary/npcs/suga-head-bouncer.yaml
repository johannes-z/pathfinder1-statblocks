SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Break Free (Ex)
    description: >-
      At 5th level, a tetori adds his monk level on combat maneuver or Escape
      Artist checks made to escape a grapple. If a tetori fails a save against
      an effect that causes him to become entangled, paralyzed, slowed, or
      staggered, he may spend 1 point from his ki pool as an immediate action to
      attempt a new save. Counter-Grapple (Ex) At 4th level, a tetori wrestler
      may make an attack of opportunity against a creature attempting to grapple
      him. This ability does not allow the tetori to make an attack of
      opportunity against a creature with the Greater Grapple feat. At 6th
      level, he may use counter-grapple even if his attacker has concealment or
      total concealment, at 8th level even if he is flat-footed, and at 10th
      level even if his attacker has exceptional reach.
  - name: Form Lock (Su)
    description: >-
      At 13th level, a tetori can negate a polymorph effect by touch with a
      Wisdom check, adding a bonus equal to his monk level, against a DC of 11 +
      the caster level of the effect (or HD of the creature, for supernatural
      polymorph effects). This is a standard action requiring 2 points from the
      tetori's ki pool, or an immediate action if a creature the tetori is
      grappling attempts to use a polymorph effect.
  - name: Graceful Grappler (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tetori uses his monk level in place of his base attack bonus to
      determine CMB and CMD for grappling. At 4th level, he suffers no penalties
      on attack rolls, can make attacks of opportunity while grappling, and
      retains his Dexterity bonus to AC when pinning an opponent or when
      grappled. At 8th level, a tetori gains the grab special attack when using
      unarmed strikes, and can use this ability against creatures his own size
      or smaller by spending 1 point from his ki pool, or against larger
      creatures by spending 2 points from his ki pool.
  - name: Inescapable Grasp (Su)
    description: >-
      At 9th level, a tetori can spend 1 point from his ki pool to suppress his
      opponents' freedom of movement and magical bonuses to Escape Artist or on
      checks to escape a grapple. At 13th level, this ability also duplicates
      the effect of dimensional anchor. Inescapable grasp is a swift action and
      lasts until the beginning of the wrestler's next turn.
  - name: Sunlight Petrification (Ex)
    description: >-
      A rock troll that is exposed to natural sunlight is staggered and must
      make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round to resist permanently turning to
      stone. A stone to flesh spell (or similar effect) restores a petrified
      rock troll, but if it remains expose
