DuringCombat: >-
  Sef keeps hidden during combat for as long as she can and makes ranged sneak
  attacks. She does so by hurling flasks of alchemist's fire and thrown daggers
  before using her fast stealth rogue talent to move deeper into the shadows to
  hide again. If cornered, she lashes out with her short sword until she can
  break free and run, but always returns after eluding (or fooling) pursuit,
  waging guerrilla attacks to wear down her opposition.
Morale: >-
  Sef surrenders if reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, begging for mercy. She
  gives up all the information and treasures she has in return for the chance to
  slink away&#8211; whether or not she harbors a grudge and returns later to get
  revenge on the PCs is left to you to decide.
