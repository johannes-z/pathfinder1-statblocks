    description: >-
      The rose window has spent its 1 Construction Point on an additional slam
      attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  The window begins combat by leaping onto a creature from its perch (requiring
  a ranged touch attack and dealing 1d6 points of damage) and relying on its
  hardness to resist the damage to itself. It then attacks with its slam
  attacks, focusing on one creature at a time.
