SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Conceal Thoughts (Su)
    description: >-
      If targeted with detect thoughts or a similar effect, Kafar may choose
      what thoughts are detected, while his true thoughts remain private. This
      does not affect mind-affecting effects other than thought-reading.
  - name: Concentrated Blue Whinnis Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Kafar has created a concentrated dose of blue whinnis poison (injury; save
      Fort DC 16; frequency 1/ round for 3 rounds; initial effect 1 Con damage;
      secondary effect unconsciousness for 1d3 hours; cure 1 save).
  - name: Mask Alignment (Su)
    description: >-
      At 2nd level, as a standard action, Kafar can alter his alignment aura to
      deceive effects that detect alignment. He may choose to be detected as any
      specific alignment or detect as no alignment at all. This affects only
      alignment detection, not effects that cause harm or are otherwise based on
      alignment. This effect lasts until he dismisses it or changes his
      alignment aura again. At this time, Kafar detects as being lawful neutral.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Kafar wants to ensure he is prepared in the event that his meeting with the
  Diamond Sage goes poorly. To this end, he recently consumed his extracts of
  ant haul, delay poison, endure elements, and false life, as well as his
  Strength mutagen and a potion of barkskin. Nefti has also cast heroism on him.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kafar throws a stink bomb at the PCs and enters the smoke cloud to strike with
  a poisoned sickle, using his delay poison extract to protect himself from the
  cloud's nauseating effect. He aims to knock the PCs out just long enough to
  allow him to deliver the topaz gem.
Morale: >-
  Kafar offers parley if reduced to 12 or fewer hit points or if Nefti falls or
  surrenders.
