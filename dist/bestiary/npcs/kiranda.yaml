DuringCombat: >-
  Kiranda delights in using her swift, acrobatic combat style against more
  heavily armored foes, but if she's having trouble hitting them, she hangs back
  and uses her various mind-controlling spell effects to get armored foes to
  strip out of their armor. If she can control multiple foes, she may even have
  them help allies out of their armor. She prefers to leave her victims alive so
  she can control them thereafter as minions, but won't hesitate to strike to
  kill if someone proves particularly difficult to affect with mind-control
  techniques.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 40 hit points, Kiranda teleports to Chorussina's side
  in area G10 to warn her of the PCs. The PCs may encounter her again in that
  area, at which point the succubus again teleports away once reduced to fewer
  than 40 hit points&#8211;this time far to the south to report to Aponavicius
  herself. This report has no immediate repercussions, as Aponavicius is focused
  on her ongoing attacks against Nerosyan, but at your whim the PCs may find
  themselves ambushed in the future by Kiranda, as she returns with a few
  demonic minions in search of revenge.
