BeforeCombat: Velriana casts mirror image and uses her wand of shield before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Velriana uses her spells to control the battlefield and weaken the opposition,
  favoring her wand of scorching ray. She tries to support the other members of
  the Scorched Hand, but she does not hesitate to strike if one of them is in
  the way of her attack&#8211;she believes that all members of the Scorched
  Hand, as followers of Nethys, should be aware of the destructive side effects
  of magic. Given time, Velriana uses her scroll of warding weapon to defend
  herself while casting spells, but not if her lack of offensive action might
  lead to the fight getting out of hand.
Morale: >-
  Velriana has no interest in showing mercy to her enemies, and she doesn't
  expect to receive any herself. As a result, she fights to the death.
