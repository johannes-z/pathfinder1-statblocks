BeforeCombat: >-
  Depending on the PCs' efforts in the earlier encounter, the assassin may have
  already injured the merchant with the poisoned scimitar.
DuringCombat: >-
  The assassin focuses on killing the merchant. He turns invisible or flanks as
  necessary to avoid enemy attacks and to deal sneak attack damage. If he's
  unable to complete his mission due to the PCs' efforts, he attacks them until
  he again has an opportunity to assassinate his target.
Morale: >-
  Unless he believes he is just about to finish off the merchant, the assassin
  flees if reduced to 3 or fewer hit points. If he kills the merchant, he begins
  striking down  the zombies (as they are an affront to Sarenrae), fleeing if
  reduced to 7 or fewer hit points.
Gear: >-
