SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Damned (Ex)
    description: >-
      If Avahzi is slain, her soul immediately travels to Hell. A character who
      attempts to return her to life must make a DC 12 caster level check or the
      spell fails.
  - name: Infernal Charisma (Ex)
    description: >-
      Avahzi gains a +2 bonus on all Charismabased checks when interacting with
      devils.
  - name: Infernal Bargain (Ex)
    description: >-
      Avahzi can halve the price of servitude when she casts planar ally (or a
      similar spell) by successfully making an opposed Charisma check against a
      called (but not summoned) devil.
  - name: Channel Hellfire (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action twice per day, Avahzi can alter a spell she casts that
      deals energy damage so that it instead deals hellfire damage. Spells
      altered in this way gain the lawful and evil descriptors. Hellfire damage
      is half fire damage and half damage from unholy energy. Evil-aligned
      creatures and creatures with the evil subtype take no damage from the
      unholy energy part of hellfire damage, but good-aligned creatures and
      creatures with the good subtype take double damage from the unholy energy.
      Protection from evil prevents all damage caused by the unholy damage
      portion of hellfire, but offers no protection from the fire damage.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Avahzi casts status on two randomly determined thieves every morning (often
  one stationed in area E1 and one in F1), along with magic vestment on her
  armor. The status effects serve as early warnings-if the PCs kill or harm one
  of these thieves, Avahzi knows to prepare. If she has time to prepare for a
  battle (such as if she notices intruders entering area F7), she casts air
  walk, bear's endurance, freedom of movement, and shield of faith on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Avahzi hangs back in battle as long as she can, using her ranged spells to
  blast foes. She moves out into area F7 as soon as possible, and takes care to
  try to position herself so that she's between the PCs and the doors to F12 at
  all times (see Morale, below).
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 or fewer hit points, Avahzi casts wall of stone between
  herself and the PCs to block off their easy access to area F12. She then flees
  to that area, casts sanctuary and resist energy (fire), and trusts to this to
  allow her a desperate flight through area F13. She hopes to race to the center
  of the Nessian Spiral, reach Liebdaga, and beg his aid before the PCs reach
  him themselves- how far she gets is left up to you. Base Statistics hp 51;
