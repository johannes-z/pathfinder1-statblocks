SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mark Quarry (Su)
    description: >-
      A crawling hand is assigned a quarry by anointing the hand with a drop of
      the intended quarry's blood. If the hand has no current quarry, it
      automatically gains the next creature it damages as its quarry. Once
      attuned to a target, it becomes aware of the target's location as if under
      the effect of a continuous locate creature spell. The hand gains a +1
      bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks made to seek out
      and destroy the marked quarry. The mark quarry ability lasts until the
      quarry or the hand is slain.
  - name: Strangle (Ex)
    description: >-
      An opponent grappled by a crawling hand cannot speak or cast spells with
      verbal components.
DuringCombat: >-
  The crawling hands attempt to strangle any obvious spellcasters first, then
  target the nearest creatures with their claw attacks.
Morale: The crawling hands fight to the death.
