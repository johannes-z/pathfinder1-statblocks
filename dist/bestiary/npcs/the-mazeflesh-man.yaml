DuringCombat: >-
  The Mazeflesh Man opens combats with his magic repeating crossbow, but rarely
  gets to the point in a battle where he's forced to reload the weapon since his
  bloodlust to wade into melee combat to smash foes with his fists takes over.
  He prefers to attack humans whom he loved in life, particularly Varisian
  women, who mock him with their beauty and curves. Against weak and helpless
  foes, he often assumes wolf form to lengthen the drama of his hunt, finishing
  his kill by draining blood.
Morale: >-
  The Mazeflesh Man fights until reduced to 0 hit points, at which point he
  retreats to one of the coffins here to recover.
Gear: +1 repeating heavy crossbow with 20 bolts, golembane scarab
