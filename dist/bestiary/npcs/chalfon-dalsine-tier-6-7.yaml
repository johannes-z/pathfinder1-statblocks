SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Improved Spell Combat (Ex)
    description: >-
      When using the spell combat ability, Chalfon receives a +2 circumstance
      bonus on concentration checks, in addition to any bonus granted by taking
      an additional penalty on the attack roll.
  - name: Spell Combat (Ex)
    description: >-
      Chalfon can cast spells while wielding a weapon at the same time. This
      ability functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the off-hand weapon
      is a spell that is being cast. As a full-round action, he can make all of
      his attacks with his melee weapon at a -2 penalty and can also cast any of
      his prepared spells with a casting time of 1 standard action (any attack
      roll made as part of this spell also takes this penalty). If he casts this
      spell defensively, he can decide to take an additional penalty on his
      attack rolls, up to his Intelligence bonus, and add the same amount as a
      circumstance bonus on his concentration check. If the check fails, the
      spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. Chalfon can
      choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attack first.
  - name: Spellstrike (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever Chalfon casts a spell with a range of "touch", he can deliver the
      spell through any weapon he wields as part of a melee attack. Instead of
      the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, Chalfon
      can make one free melee attack with his weapon (at his full base attack
      bonus) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack
      deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If Chalfon
      makes this attack in concert with spell combat, this melee attack takes
      all the penalties accrued by his spell combat melee attacks. This attack
      uses the weapon's critical range, and the spell effect deals x2 damage on
      a successful critical hit. *See Ultimate Magic.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Chalfon cast keen edge when his cousin showed up less than an hour ago. He
  uses his scroll of major image to make an image of himself laughing at the top
  of the stairs while he hides invisibly and watches his cousin and Pasha al-
  Jakri duel, concentrating on the spell until the PCs enter the room. During
  the following 3 rounds of the spell's duration, he casts haste, cat's grace
  and shield before engaging the PCs under the cover of invisibility, expending
  an arcane pool point as a swift action to grant a +3 enhancement bonus to his
  rapier for 1 minute that stacks with its existing enhancement bonus. These
  effects are all included in Chalfon's stats.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Chalfon casts an empowered fireball using his
  daily empower magic magus arcana power and expending 1 arcane pool point.
  Chalfon attempts to use his spell combat and spellstrike abilities each round,
  making two melee attacks with his rapier, each at a &#8211;2 penalty,
  channeling a touch attack through one of the two attacks. When he has a swift
  action available, he expends 1 arcane pool point to grant himself an insight
  bonus on all attack rolls until the end of his turn equal to his Intelligence
  bonus (+4). If he runs out of touch attack spells, he expends an arcane pool
  point to retrieve shocking grasp, using it the following round as if he had
  not cast it previously. When brought below 35 hit points, Chalfon casts
  vampiric touch as part of his spell combat and spellstrike abilities; if he
  has at least 3 arcane pool points to retrieve it, he does so each time the
  temporary hit points he gained previously are expended.
Morale: >-
  Chalfon fights to the death, knowing his plot to destroy the Pathfinder
  Society has already been put into motion.
