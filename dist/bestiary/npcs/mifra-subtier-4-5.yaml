BeforeCombat: >-
  If alerted to the presence of enemies, Mifra casts mage armor and hides behind
  one of the tubs.
DuringCombat: >-
  Mifra tries to stay out of melee while using darkness, speed, and stealth to
  bait the PCs into chasing her through the hazardous room. She commands her
  darkmantles to attack, uses her scroll to summon a fiendish crocodile, and
  uses her spells to neutralize other threats.
Morale: >-
  Mifra is viciously territorial, but she would rather live to torment her
  enemies than die by their hands. If Xarmigash is killed and Mifra is reduced
  to 9 hit points or fewer, she flees.

  monster III
