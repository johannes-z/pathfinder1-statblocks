SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ability Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A divine guardian heals 1 point of ability damage per round in each
      damaged ability score.
  - name: Blessed Life (Ex)
    description: >-
      A divine guardian does not age or breathe. It does not require food,
      drink, or sleep.
  - name: Bound to the Faith (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cleric or paladin (or other class that can channel energy) of the deity
      who granted the divine guardian its power can expend one use of channel
      energy to command the divine guardian as if using the Command Undead feat.
      The divine guardian is treated as if it were an undead creature with half
      its total Hit Dice for the purpose of this ability.
  - name: Sacred Site (Ex)
    description: >-
      Each divine guardian is assigned to guard a specific site sacred to the
      deity that invested it with power. The divine guardian is charged with
      protecting the site from harm and preventing incursions by those not of
      the faith. Should the divine guardian ever move out of the area defined as
      the sacred site, it immediately loses the divine guardian template.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The Scion of the Sea casts alarm on the secret doors to area E8, E9, and E10
  every day.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Scion of the Sea seals doors with arcane lock or hold portal to prevent
  foes from escaping, attacking them with its claws before transferring them to
  its paralytic tentacles. It focuses its attacks on paladins or clerics of good
  gods, if possible.
Morale: The Scion of the Sea fights to the death to protect the temple.
