DuringCombat: >-
  If able to prepare an ambush, the bandits fire on the most heavily armored
  opponents first, hoping to wound them before engaging in melee. Thereafter,
  they drop their bows, draw their swords, and charge.
Morale: >-
  If overmatched or caught by surprise, the bandits withdraw, believing the
  Taldan authorities have come to avenge Lady Argentea's abduction. Fighting
  defensively, they separate to put distance between themselves, covering each
  other with their bows, while they try to make it back to the lodge to warn the
  bandits of the PCs' presence. If pinned down (or flanked), they draw their
  swords and fight.
