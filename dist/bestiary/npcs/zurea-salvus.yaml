BeforeCombat: >-
  Zurea casts greater magic weapon on her lucerne hammer and magic vestment on
  her chainmail every day, using the altar of the Peacock Spirit in area K5 to
  extend both spells' durations. She also casts screen  every day to give area
  K5 a more outlandish appearance (see page 33 for more details). A few rounds
  before combat begins, she casts quickened bear's endurance and quickened
  shield of faith. If combat starts before she can prepare, these two spells are
  among the first spells she casts in battle. Finally, if she has any advance
  knowledge of the PCs' tactics (including reports from cultists who might have
  escaped from the PCs in the prior adventure) she uses the altar to extend
  spell immunity, choosing spells she knows the PCs favor if possible.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zurea casts sanctuary on the first round of combat, letting her followers
  engage the PCs at first while she takes the time to cast true seeing and air
  walk on herself before she climbs up into the air to stay out of melee. She
  then uses her ranged spells against the PCs, starting with destruction and
  following with screaming flames. She casts silence against a spellcaster,
  confusion against those engaged in melee, and greater command or hold monster
  to disrupt those who work together efficiently. If reduced to 40 hp, she casts
  invisibility and then spends a few rounds staying mobile and casting healing
  spells on herself before casting a touch spell such as bestow curse or poison,
  holding the charge, and then using invisibility to move up into melee range to
  deliver the spell as a dramatic way to return to combat.
Morale: >-
  Zurea fights to the death once a battle begins, and she commands those who
  serve under her to do the same.
Gear: potions of cure moderate wounds (4)
