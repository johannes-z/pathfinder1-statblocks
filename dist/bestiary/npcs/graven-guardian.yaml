SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Evil Weapons (Su)
    description: >-

  - name: Faith Bound (Su)
    description: >-
      A graven guardian cannot attack any creature that openly wears or displays
      the holy or unholy symbol of the deity to which the graven guardian is
      dedicated unless that creature first attacks the graven guardian.
  - name: Magic Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A graven guardian that carries its deity's favored weapon treats that
      weapon as a +1 weapon as long as it is wielded by the guardian. If the
      weapon is a melee weapon, it gains the keen weapon special ability.
DuringCombat: >-
  The graven guardian initiates combat by casting haste on itself, then focuses
  its attacks on the nearest PC not displaying Areshkagal's demonic rune, or the
  nearest PC to attack it, always attacking a standing target over a prone
  target if multiple creatures are adjacent to the guardian.
