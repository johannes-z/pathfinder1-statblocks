DuringCombat: >-
  The Tears uses detect evil at the start of anything that looks like combat to
  ensure that those it faces are evil, but if it's attacked, it fights back,
  starting  with holy word (a much swifter method of determining which foes are
  evil). The Tears then casts holy aura and quickened holy smite, then moves to
  attack foes in melee. The elemental does not pursue foes more than 30 feet
  from the pool's outer edges.
Morale: The Tears of St. Ilnea fights to the death.
