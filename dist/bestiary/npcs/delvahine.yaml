SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Agonizing Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      Delvahine can deal 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with a touch attack at
      will as a standard action. She deals an additional 1d3 points of nonlethal
      damage with her natural attacks.
  - name: Binding Whip (Ex)
    description: >-
      Delvahine does not provoke attacks of opportunity when she uses a whip in
      melee. She can also attempt to entangle a Large or smaller foe with a
      whip-to do so, she makes a touch attack against a target. If she hits, the
      target is entangled. If she succeeds at an opposed Strength check against
      the target, the target can not move farther than 15 feet away from
      Delvahine. An entangled creature can escape with a successful DC 20 Escape
      Artist check (a full-round action) or DC 25 Strength check, or by
      sundering the whip. As long as she entangles a foe with her whip,
      Delvahine cannot use that whip to make additional attacks. Delvahine can
      release a foe from her binding whip as an immediate action.
  - name: Deadly Whip (Ex)
    description: >-
      Delvahine can choose to deal normal damage with a whip rather than
      nonlethal damage.
  - name: Enchantment Specialization (Ex)
    description: >-
      Delvahine gains a +1 bonus to overcome SR when she casts dominate person,
      and the save DC of any dominate person spell she casts increases by 1.
  - name: Penetrating Whip (Su)
    description: >-
      Delvahine can harm any foe with her whip, regardless of the foe's armor or
      natural armor bonuses.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Delvahine is unlikely to be caught off guard by the PCs since her daughters
  keep in telepathic contact with her. Once she knows the PCs are approaching
  (either at her permission or otherwise), she casts freedom of movement,
  eagle's splendor, and mirror image.
DuringCombat: >-
  Delvahine prefers to fight with allies, particularly her submissive daughters,
  who are well trained at protecting her. She uses her bardic performance to
  inspire courage on the first round of combat, then moves on to use dominate
  person and confusion against her foes. If forced to fight in melee, she fights
  with dagger and sadist's lash, using Arcane Strike each round to deal an
  additional 3 points of damage with each hit.
Morale: >-
  Delvahine teleports to area I2 if brought below 20 hit points&#8211;as
  distasteful as it is to her, she hopes to seek aid from Vraxeris. When she
  discovers he is dead and only his simulacra remains, she assumes his form,
  allies with his simulacra, and awaits the PCs' arrival in that wing to seek
  revenge.
