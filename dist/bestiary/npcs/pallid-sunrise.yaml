SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bone Dweller (Ex)
    description: >-
      Pallid Sunrise is well-adapted to dwelling within the bony terrain of the
      grand ossuary. It has a burrow speed of 40 feet through loose bones and
      tremorsense with a range of 60 feet.
BeforeCombat: Pallid Sunrise casts mage armor and shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Pallid Sunrise fights without fear, surprising trespassers by bursting up from
  beneath the floor's surface and breathing fire before closing to melee. If
  spellcasters pose it a serious threat, it casts silence spells on bones in the
  floor.
Morale: Equal parts loyal and miserable, Pallid Sunrise fights until destroyed.
