SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Law (Ex)
    description: >-
      Octavio's aura of law (see the detect law spell) is equal to his total
      character level (8th level). Discipline Octavio's seek the taken
      discipline is detailed on the following page under the Order of the
      Torrent entry.
  - name: Force of Will (Ex)
    description: >-
      Octavio gains a +2 bonus on Will saves against spells with the fear
      descriptor.
  - name: Hellknight Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      When Octavio wears Hellknight plate, he reduces its armor check penalty by
      1, increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by 1, and moves at full
      speed.
  - name: Smite Chaos (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as the paladin's smite evil class feature, but
      against chaotic-aligned creatures. This ability is twice as effective
      against outsiders with the chaotic subtype, chaotic-aligned aberrations,
      and fey.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Octavio prefers to attack chaotic targets at the start of a fight, using smite
  chaos from the beginning of the battle and focusing on one foe at a time. He
  prefers to capture enemies alive unless they're mindless creatures, undead, or
  evil or chaotic outsiders. In battle, he uses Vital Strike on his first
  attack, then Power Attack with his full attacks. He saves his merciful arrows
  to use against foes he knows he wants to interrogate later, or to pacify those
  he suspects are being forced to act against their will.
Morale: >-
  Octavio fights to the death if any allies still stand, but on his own he
  retreats from combat if reduced to fewer than 20 hit points.
Gear: +1 merciful arrows (8)
