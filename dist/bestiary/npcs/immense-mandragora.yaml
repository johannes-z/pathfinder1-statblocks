SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Vine whip-injury; save Fort DC 28; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
      confused for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Shriek (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, as a standard action, an immense mandragora can give voice
      to an unsettling shriek that sounds not unlike the cry of gargantuan baby.
      All creatures within 30 feet of a shrieking immense mandragora must make a
      DC 25 Reflex save or take 15d6 points of sonic damage and a DC 25 Will
      save or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. A successful Reflex save halves
      the sonic damage, while a successful Will save negates the nausea. This is
      a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Vulnerable to Darkness (Ex)
    description: >-
      An immense mandragora in an area of darkness loses its fast healing and
      becomes slowed, as per the spell.
DuringCombat: >-
  The mandragoras require the entire first round of combat to collect into their
  Gargantuan form. During this round, the immense mandragora cannot make
  attacks. Once it is fully formed, it uses Power Attack with every strike, and
  Awesome Blow against characters that are able to make large numbers of melee
  attacks trying to force the characters to take move actions to get back in
  range, thus minimizing the damage they do.
Morale: The immense mandragora fights to the death.
