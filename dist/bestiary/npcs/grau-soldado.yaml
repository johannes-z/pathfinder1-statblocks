    description: >-
      As long as Grau remains drunk, he functions as if he were sickened-these
      penalties are included in the statistics above.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Grau's sword is a masterful piece of work-the only thing of any real value he
  still owns. It represents the talent he once had, but as long as he's drunk,
  he makes poor choices. He always uses Power Attack and more or less ignores
  any opportunity to set up a sneak attack. He limits his attacks to the PC whom
  he challenged to a duel, but if any other PC enters the fight he sputters and
  cries out "Foul! You'll pay for that, varlet!" and from that point on attacks
  random PCs each round, to the extent that he may well provoke attacks of
  opportunity as he moves from foe to foe.
Morale: >-
  If Grau is reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, the fight goes out of him
  entirely; he drops his sword and breaks down in tears of self-loathing.
Gear: mwk chainmail, light steel shield, +1 mithral longsword, 32 gp
