BeforeCombat: >-
  Trazel prefers to kill with a kiss rather than a blade, and woos suitors (or
  groups of them) to fight on his behalf. He always opens combat somewhere near
  water&#8211; city docks, riversides, lake shores&#8211;to take advantage of
  his natural gifts and escape should things go badly. If caught on land, he
  relies on mirror image for protection.
DuringCombat: >-
  Trazel stays in the water whenever possible, gaining cover and becoming
  invisible while he inspires allies into a raging fury with his music. He uses
  enchanting music and charm person to bring individual victims close while
  using his hydraulic torrent to keep other opponents at bay.
Morale: >-
  Trazel uses his transparency or expeditious retreat to flee if brought below
  50 hit points.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds (2), scroll of eagle's splendor (2), scroll of
  invisibility (2)
OtherGear: >-

  strength +2, hat of disguise
