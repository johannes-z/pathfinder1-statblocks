  Delexia uses Vital Strike in any round in which she has to move to engage a
  foe, saving her stunning fist for a first attack in a full attack action. When
  facing foes who wield weapons one-handed, she generally devotes at least one
  attack per round to a disarm attempt; if successful, she prefers to hold the
  weapon but eschews attacking with it. If she wrests away a second weapon, she
  drops the less intimidating one as far away from a foe as she can. Delexia
  takes an endurance approach to combat, trusting in her Combat Reflexes,
  defenses, and allies to keep her in the fight rather than attempting to do
  lots of damage quickly.
Morale: Delexia fights to the death.
