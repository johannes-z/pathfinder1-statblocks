SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Possessed (Su)
    description: >-
      Naquun is possessed by a quasit named Eguriak; the quasit can take no
      actions other than communicating with its host and using
      Intelligence-based skills. It can be detected by divinations but cannot be
      targeted by spell effects (except as described under spell vulnerability
      below). Damage to Naquun does not harm the quasit. If Naquun is killed,
      Eguriak appears in his square. If the possession is ended without killing
      Naquun (see below), the hunter's alignment returns to neutral.
  - name: Profane Attacks (Su)
    description: >-
      Naquun's melee attacks deal an extra 1d6 points of damage to creatures of
      good alignment. In addition, his weapons are treated as evil-aligned and
      magic for the purpose of overcoming DR.
  - name: Spell Vulnerability (Ex)
    description: >-
      If Naquun is targeted with a banishment or dismissal spell, he must
      succeed at a Will save or the quasit is banished back to the Abyss. If
      Naquun is targeted with dispel chaos, dispel evil, protection from chaos,
      or protection from evil, he must also make a Will save. On a failed save,
      the quasit is driven out of his body and appears in the nearest open
      square. It cannot possess a new host.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: Naquun casts feather step before taking position in front of the door.
DuringCombat: >-
  Naquun casts protective spirit on the first round of combat. He activates his
  ranger's focus ability on the first foe to attack, making the majority of his
  attacks against that opponent. If surrounded by enemies, Naquun casts
  invisibility to better position himself and attack from surprise.
Morale: >-
  As long as he is possessed, Naquun fights to the death. If freed from his
  possession, he immediately surrenders and offers to help the PCs find Tunuak
  and bring him to justice.
