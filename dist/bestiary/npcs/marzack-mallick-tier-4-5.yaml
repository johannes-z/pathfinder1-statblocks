BeforeCombat: >-
  Marzack attempts to catch PCs off guard on the first round of combat to
  utilize his sneak attack against a flatfooted foe.
DuringCombat: >-
  Marzack tries to flank foes with his ally to increase his damage output, but
  fights solo, using Combat Expertise as needed to increase his AC against
  particularly heavy hitters.
Morale: >-
  Marzack knows that he's tipped his hand to the PCs and admitted his guilt by
  attacking them. He fights to the death rather than face captain Veane's
  discipline or the punishment of the Mordant Spire elves.
