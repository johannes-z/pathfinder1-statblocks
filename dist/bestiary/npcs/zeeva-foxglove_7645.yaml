DuringCombat: >-
  Zeeva is unarmed and ill prepared for combat. She tries to stay out of harm's
  way, using her fortune and healing hexes to assist the PCs as needed. She
  pleads with the Pathfinders not to kill the Aspis attackers, and withdraws or
  uses full defense if directly threatened by one of the thugs.
Morale: >-
  If all the PCs are knocked unconscious or killed, or if she is reduced to
  fewer than half her total hit points, Zeeva surrenders to the Aspis
  Consortium. She agrees to meet with them in private in her office to talk, but
  if they attempt to convince her to go to another location, she refuses to
  leave the market.
