SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      This functions as the vampire ability of the same name (Pathfinder RPG
      Bestiary 271).
  - name: Damage Reduction (Su)
    description: >-
      A nosferatu has damage reduction 5/ wood and piercing (this includes all
      wood-shafted weapons like arrows, crossbow bolts, spears, and javelins,
      even if the weapon's head is made of another material.
  - name: Dominate (Su)
    description: >-
      This functions as the vampire ability of the same name (Pathfinder RPG
      Bestiary 271).
  - name: Spider Climb (Ex)
    description: >-
      This functions as the vampire ability of the same name (Pathfinder RPG
      Bestiary 271).
  - name: Swarm Form (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a nosferatu can change into a bat swarm, centipede
      swarm, rat swarm, or spider swarm. The swarm has the same number of hit
      points as the nosferatu, and any damage done to the swarm affects the
      nosferatu. A nosferatu in swarm form is immune to any physical spell or
      effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including
      single-target spells such as disintegrate), with the exception of such
      spells and effects generated by the nosferatu itself, which treat the
      nosferatu as one single creature if it so chooses. While in swarm form, a
      nosferatu cannot use its natural claw attacks or any of its special
      attacks, although it gains the natural weapons and extraordinary special
      attacks of the swarm it transformed into. It also retains all of its usual
      special qualities. While in swarm form, a nosferatu is still considered an
      undead creature with its total number of Hit Dice. It can remain in swarm
      form until it assumes another form, retakes its original form as a
      standard action, or until the next sunrise.
  - name: Telekinesis (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a nosferatu can use telekinesis, as the spell
      (caster level 12th).
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: Ramoska casts mage armor before combat, using his Spell Mastery feat.
DuringCombat: >-
  If pressed into combat, Ramoska uses his dominate ability to gain an ally to
  defend him. He uses his spells to hold off opponents as long as possible, but
  only so long as he is winning.
Morale: >-
  Ramoska has no interest in fighting the PCs. If unable to defeat them, he
  casts detonate, followed by quickened invisibility (using metamagic mastery)
  to make his escape, in swarm form if possible.
