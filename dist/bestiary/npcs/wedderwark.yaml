Bloodline: fey
BeforeCombat: >-
  Wedderwark casts mage armor as soon as  she hears the elevator moving, hides,
  and commands her minions to do the same. As it opens, she casts shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Wedderwark first casts silent glitterdust to confound as many foes as possible
  without revealing her position. She then uses grease, deep slumber, or fear
  before wading into melee with frigid touch and natural attacks. She uses her
  trip ability to keep spellcasters prone and favors casting touch spells when
  she cannot manage a full attack.
Morale: >-
  Wedderwark attempts to parley in Undercommon if reduced to fewer than 30 hit
  points, and she casts vanish to flee if she fails to negotiate her peaceful
  surrender.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, wand of fear (4 charges)
OtherGear: amulet of natural armor +1, handy haversack, hexagonal elevator key.
