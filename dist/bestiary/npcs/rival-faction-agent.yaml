DuringCombat: >-
  The agents' first goal is to get information, and they use their poison to
  paralyze and incapacitate their targets so they can extract whatever knowledge
  their opponents have. If given what they desire, however, as well as a safe
  opportunity to do so, the agents quickly turn on their captives and attempt to
  slay them.
Morale: >-
  When dropped below 7 hit points, these agents flee. They are only hired
  muscle, and have no loyalty to their faction beyond the coins in their purses.
