SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cold Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action three times per day, an ice seer can cause waves of cold
      to radiate from his body. This cold deals 5d6 points of cold damage to all
      creatures within 10 feet (Fort DC 19 half). In addition, a flurry of snow
      momentarily surrounds the ice seer, granting him concealment until his
      next turn.
  - name: Ice Armor (Su)
    description: >-
      An ice seer can conjure armor of ice that grants a +8 armor bonus to AC in
      cold conditions. The ice seer can use this armor for 10 hours per day.
      This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-hour
      increments.
  - name: Icy Skin (Ex)
    description: An ice seer gains cold resistance 10.
  - name: Snow Sight (Su)
    description: >-
      An ice seer can see through falling snow and sleet without taking any
      penalties on Perception checks as long as there is enough light for him to
      see normally.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The ice seer uses his ice armor revelation and casts freedom of movement and
  shield of faith before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The ice seer casts icy prison on anyone he catches attempting to break down or
  open the blockhouse door, then focuses on aiding the dragonkin with his spells

  attempting to open the door with his offensive spells.
