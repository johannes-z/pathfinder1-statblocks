  - name: Fighting (Ex)

      Kerberus fights with a greatclub or javelin in each hand. Because of each
      of its three heads, the bizarre ogre does not take a penalty on attack or
      damage rolls for attacking with two weapons. Obviously, there was some
      ettin in Kerberus's lineage at some point.
