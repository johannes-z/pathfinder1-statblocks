BeforeCombat: >-
  In order to hide any signs of weakness before Rovagug's favored servant,
  Tasutek has already cast delay poison and freedom of movement on himself using
  his scrolls. If his homunculus has warned him that the PCs are approaching
  area C, he has also cast bless and granted his destructive attacks blessing to
  the thognorok just before the PCs arrive.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tasutek uses his enthrall ability to stop the PCs in their tracks, giving him
  a moment to cast spells that augment his combat abilities and move to a more
  advantageous position. When possible, he flanks a target with the thognorok.
  He uses his fervor ability each round to grant himself greater combat prowess.
Morale: >-
  Rovagug demands his greatest servants die on their feet, and Tasutek fights
  until dead.
