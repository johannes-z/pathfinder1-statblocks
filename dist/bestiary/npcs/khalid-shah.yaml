SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Earth and Water Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Khalid-Shah gains a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls (already
      factored into his stats) as long as he touches earth or water (or a
      combination of both). He takes a -4 morale penalty on attack and damage
      rolls when attacking an airborne creature or attacking while airborne.
  - name: Exude Muck (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, Khalid-Shah can exude a puddle of slippery muck in
      a 10-foot-radius spread. This muck remains in the affected area until
      washed away. It otherwise functions as a grease spell (DC 15). Creatures
      with the earth or water subtypes are immune to this effect.
  - name: Mudball (Su)
    description: >-
      Khalid-Shah can hurl a mudball as a ranged touch attack with a 20-foot
      range increment. It deals 1d8+6 points of nonlethal damage, and covers the
      target in slippery sludge, affecting the target's equipment as if by a
      grease spell, as well as granting the target fire resistance 3 for the
      duration. The slippery coating lasts for 1 minute or until washed off with
      at least 10 gallons of water. Creatures with the water subtype are immune
      to this effect.
  - name: Smother (Ex)
    description: >-
      On a successful grapple check, Khalid-Shah can fill his opponent's mouth
      and nose with noxious muck. The opponent must immediately hold her breath
      or drown (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 445) and cannot speak or cast
      spells with a verbal component. Furthermore, the opponent must make a DC
      19 Fortitude save each round that she is unable to breathe or be nauseated
      until 1d4 rounds after the muck is cleared. A creature can remove this
      smothering muck by succeeding on a DC 15 Constitution check as a move
      action that provokes attacks of opportunity. This move action may be
      performed even while being grappled. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: Khalid-Shah casts stoneskin on himself before engaging in combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Khalid-Shah uses transmute mud to rock on anyone floundering in his mud pit in
  order to encase the victim in a shell of hardened stone. His affinity with the
  magic is such that he can transform single 10-foot cubes of mud around PCs in
  order to trap them in the cubes' confines. The cubes of stone then sink to the
  bottom of the pit; entrapped characters must be freed before they drown or
  suffocate within the rock. If the PCs avoid his mud pit, Khalid-Shah resorts
  to mudballs and smother attacks to incapacitate them.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, Khalid-Shah retreats to the bottom of
  his pit and seals it above himself with a horizontal wall of stone.
