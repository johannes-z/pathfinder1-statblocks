BeforeCombat: >-
  Luscilia paces the deck and screams obscenities. If she has any reason to
  suspect she's about to be attacked (such as spotting a PC on the deck as she
  approaches), she sends her zombie ahead of her.
DuringCombat: >-
  Luscilia lets her zombies do the brunt of the fighting and uses her Channel
  Energy ability frequently, choosing to either harm the PCs or heal her zombie
  depending on where it will do the most good. She hits the strongest melee
  fighter as soon as the battle starts with blindness/deafness (which causes
  blindness only)  and attempts to use cause fear to scare anyone else away from
  her. She only fights in melee if she has to.
Morale: >-
  If reduced below 5 hit points, Luscilia attempts to flee back to the cooper's
  warehouse under which Dalirio mans the cult's headquarters.
