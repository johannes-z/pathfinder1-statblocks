Source: PFS S5-13
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Balefire (Su)
    description: >-
      Ghalcor's balefire oracle revelation allows him to burn his foes with
      eldritch fires drawn from the Abyss itself twice per day. As a standard
      action, he causes one target within 30 feet to become wreathed in flames;
      the target takes 10d6 points of fire damage and is staggered for 1 round
      (Reflex DC 21 half and negate staggered).
  - name: Planar Haze (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, Ghalcor can fill an area with a fog cloud, like the
      spell of the same name, except it originates at the center of the spell
      effect and cannot expand beyond the spell's area.
  - name: Relentless Compulsion (Su)
    description: >-
      Ghalcor constantly tries to recalculate how he failed and why,
      relentlessly pursuing a perfect solution that is just out of reach. Thus,
      he's adept at predicting failure allowing him to re-roll any one d20 roll
      and taking the higher result, even after knowing the results.
  - name: Wrecker (Su)
    description: >-
      Any held objects by Ghalcor gain the broken condition when he attempts to
      use or equip them but regain their actual condition if employed by anyone
      else. If a held item is restored to unbroken condition, it becomes broken
      again the following round.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ghalcor casts resist energy (fire) as soon as he detects intruders in his
  tower. He then waits just inside the  room's floor and casts invisibility
  purge when he hears the doors to area A4 open.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ghalcor babbles and attacks any living creature, focusing on priests of
  good-aligned gods because they remind him of his life's work and tragic
  demise. He uses spells like confusion and greater command to slow down
  attackers.
Morale: Ghalcor fights until destroyed.
