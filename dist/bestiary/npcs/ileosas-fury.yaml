SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Everdawn Infusion (Ex)
    description: >-
      The furies have bathed in the Everdawn Pool recently. As a result, they
      can teleport in the Sunken Queen without restriction, modify their hit
      point totals with their Charisma modifiers rather than their Constitution
      modifiers, and are immune to bleed effects.
DuringCombat: >-
  The furies prefer to fight in melee, wielding their tridents two-handed and
  using Power Attack, but each round one of them hits the largest group of
  enemies she can with an unholy blight; if their foes prove resistant to this
  tactic, the erinyes instead joins her companions in melee. If a single foe
  proves particularly troublesome, the four devils target that foe with fear
  spells, hoping at least one of the spells will take effect-but keep in mind
  the furies are forewarned of the PCs's abilities and won't  bother trying to
  cast fear on a paladin or other character they know is immune to this effect.
  They generally use their rope attacks against clerics or other healers. They
  avoid using their summon devil spell-like ability, saving that for emergencies
  or for a fight at Ileosa's side.
Morale: Bound by contract, the furies fight to the death.
Gear: >-
  +1 chainmail, +1 flaming returning trident, cloak of resistance +1, silk rope
