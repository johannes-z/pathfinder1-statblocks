SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Channel Hellfire (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action 4 times per day, Lady Iyis can cause spells that deal
      energy damage to deal hellfire damage (half fire damage, half damage from
      evil energy). These spells gain the evil and lawful descriptors. Hellfire:
      Damage dealt from this accursed flame results half from fire and half from
      evil energy (which is not subject to being reduced by resistance to
      fire-based attacks). Evil-aligned creatures and those with the evil
      subtype take no damage from evil energy. Good aligned creatures and those
      with the good subtype take double damage from evil energy. Creatures under
      the effects of protection from evil are unaffected by evil energy, but
      still take normal damage from the fire.
  - name: Hellfire Ray (Sp)
    description: >-
      Lady Iyis can fire a 75-foot-long ray of hellfire twice per day. This ray
      deals 10d6 points of hellfire damage. Any creature killed by this ray is
      damned to Hell, requiring non-evil spellcasters to make a caster level
      check (DC 10 + the dead creature's level) when attempting to resurrect the
      victim.
  - name: Heresy (Ex)
    description: Lady Iyis gains a +4 on all checks made to research true names and sigils.
  - name: Infernal Bargain (Ex)
    description: >-
      Devils summoned by Lady Iyis must make an opposed Charisma check or serve
      her for half the cost.
  - name: Infernal Charisma (Ex)
    description: >-
      Lady Iyis gains a +5 on Charisma-based checks when interacting with
      devils.
  - name: Infernal Transport (Su)
    description: >-
      When in Hell, Lady Iyis can cast dimension door twice per day or use both
      spells to travel as per teleport.
  - name: Master Conjurer (Ex)
    description: >-
      Lady Iyis can bargain with a familiar devil she calls as a move action,
      adding +15 to her Charisma check. PC Gear Lady Iyis has equipment equal to
      a 20th-level PC. This increases her CR by +1. Venerable Age Lady Iyis is
      more than 100 years old, but retains her youth and beauty via a bargain
      with Mammon. She possesses all the benefits of venerable age but none of
      the penalties.
