SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Beastspeech (Su)
    description: >-
      The Stag can speak with any animal as though using the speak with animals
      spell (caster level equal to the Stag's Hit Dice), but this is a free
      action and does not require sound. This ability is always active.
  - name: Bugle (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Stag can make a loud, strange call that can be heard for miles. All
      who worship Erastil immediately recognize the sound and know the direction
      and general distance of the source of the sound. Heroes'
  - name: Feast (Sp)
    description: >-
      This ability functions like the heroes' feast spell, except the Stag lies
      down and dies to begin the "casting" before an evening meal. His vines and
      horns transform into a simple table and chairs, and his flesh and blood
      becomes the magical feast, feeding up to 18 creatures. At the next
      sunrise, the Stag's remains knit themselves back together and he returns
      to life. The Stag can only use this ability once per month.
  - name: Lay on Hands (Su)
    description: The Stag can use lay on hands as an 18th-level paladin.
  - name: Cascade of Spears (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, the Stag can shed fragments of its antlers, creating up to
      18 +1 shortspears, +1 spears, or +1 longspears in any combination
      (alternatively, the Stag can create 5 +1 arrows or +1 crossbow bolts
      instead of a spear, up to 90 arrows or bolts total). These weapons retain
      their magic for 18 minutes, after which they become common weapons made of
      antler.
  - name: Protective Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability
      provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving
      throws to anyone within 20 feet of the Grim White Stag. Otherwise, it
      functions as a magic circle against evil effect and a lesser globe of
      invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals the
      Stag's Hit Dice). (The defensive benefits from the protective aura are not
      included in the Stag's stat block.)
