    description: >-

      attack. Her weapons are treated as chaotic and evil for the purposes of
      overcoming damage reduction.
  - name: Demonic Mark (Ex)
    description: >-
      Areelu bears Deskari's rune. Once per day, she can use this mark as part
      of casting a spell to give that spell the chaotic and evil descriptors.
      This prevents the spell from being expended as she casts it.
  - name: Energumen (Su)

      a demonic spirit for up to 10 rounds, during which she gains a +6 profane
      bonus to her Constitution and immunity to electricity and poison. When
      this effect ends, she becomes confused for 10 rounds. At the start of each
      round of confusion, she may attempt a DC 25 Will save to end the effect
      immediately.
  - name: Mythic Familiar (Ex)
    description: >-
      Areelu's familiar, Gimcrak, is a gift to her from Deskari, and is far more

      uses of her mythic power for that day and gains 2 negative levels.
  - name: Passion (Su)
    description: >-
      Up to 20 times per day, Areelu can drain energy from a mortal she lures
      into an act of passion-unwilling victims must be grappled first. Her

    description: >-
      Areelu can walk through any swarm without fear of taking damage or
