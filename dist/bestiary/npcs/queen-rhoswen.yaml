BeforeCombat: >-
  Every day, Rhoswen casts mage armor for protection and tree stride to move
  about her palace, renewing them as necessary. If warned of approaching
  intruders, she augments herself with vampiric touch (targeting one of the
  "songbirds") and shield. Before her opponents arrive, she casts summon monster
  IV to summon an air elemental (which looks like a swirling cloud of smoke and
  shadow but is otherwise a normal air elemental).
DuringCombat: >-
  Rhoswen uses tree stride to enter the hollow columns of her throne room, using
  small holes to observe the fight. She casts baleful polymorph, deep slumber,
  and hideous laughter, and summons additional "shadowy" air elementals. She
  uses her staff to create a major image of herself in a far part of the room to
  distract her opponents and get them to use up resources. If discovered in one
  of the hollow pillars, she uses tree stride to get to another one, creating
  another illusion of herself if necessary.
Morale: >-
  If the battle turns against Rhoswen, she uses tree stride to flee from her
  throne room into the pillars of her bedchamber (area H23) to recover and
  prepare for a last stand.
Gear: crook of Cildhureen (10 charges), potion of cure moderate wounds (3)
OtherGear: >-
  thorn darts (5), headband of alluring charisma +2, ring of protection +2,
  greenblood oil (3)
