BeforeCombat: >-
  Cizmekris attempts to summon a bone devil. If he has the chance, he casts
  divine favor and shield of faith.
DuringCombat: >-
  Cizmekris starts combat by casting invisibility on himself in the first round,
  then uses a major image to make himself appear elsewhere in the area, hoping
  to draw off enemy resources, wasting them on the illusion. Once battle begins
  in earnest, he moves into melee with his mace, fighting with allies so he can
  use his Outflank feat to gain a +4 flanking bonus on his attacks. He always
  uses Power Attack when flanking a foe. (Since his allies    don't actually
  have Outflank, the feat allows his allies to take attacks of opportunity when
  Cizmekris confirms a critical hit, but he can't take attacks of opportunity in
  response to his allies' critical hits.) Cizmekris relies on walls of ice to
  block off attackers that use ranged weapons or ranged spells against him so he
  can focus exclusively on fighting up close. Cizmekris has no method to exit
  his polymorphed condition himself in this adventure, but if the PCs manage to
  dispel the effect (the polymorph any object functions at caster level 15th),
  they face the bone devil in his true form.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, Cizmekris uses a quickened invisibility
  to vanish, then retreats into the Kintargo Opera House to heal: the board room
  (area E8), the archives (area F6), and the vault (area G12) all contain
  healing supplies, and Cizmekris makes for the closest one. Once he's healed,
  he searches for surviving allies, preferring to seek out Jilia in her coffin
  (area H2) in the subbasement, and then returns with Jilia at his side to
  launch a new attack. Cizmekris has been ordered to remain in the opera house
  until the PCs are dead, and so the best he can do in a hopeless battle is to
  hide in the building; if the bone devil can simply outwait the PCs or force
  them to retreat, his orders allow him to teleport back to the temple of
  Asmodeus to report to Corinstian Grivenner. Should this occur, you'll need to
  incorporate the bone devil into the next adventure yourself, as Hell's Rebels
  assumes he is defeated in "Dance of the Damned."
