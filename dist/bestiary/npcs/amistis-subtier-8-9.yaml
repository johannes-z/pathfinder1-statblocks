SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Favored Community (Ex)
    description: >-
      Amistis gains a bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (local),
      Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks while in his favored communities.
      The ranger leaves no trail while traveling through his favored communities
      (though he may if he wishes).
  - name: Push Through (Ex)
    description: >-
      Amistis is never slowed by difficult terrain in his favored communities.
      In addition, he can move through the space occupied by local citizens as
      if they were allies. This does not apply to creatures intent on harming
      the ranger. Areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede
      motion, however, still affect him.

  disguise as Syrdathiel and appear less militant or suspicious. Quick Draw gets
  him in the fight fast.
DuringCombat: >-

  bonuses. He grants the rogues his companion bond bonus against the PC who
  seems the most dangerous.

  to 10 hit points or fewer.
