SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Exceptional Resources (Ex)
    description: >-
      As Nazhena Vasilliovna's apprentice, Radosek has access to all of the
      resources of the Pale Tower, granting him the same wealth as a PC. This
      increases his CR by 1.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: Radosek always casts false life and mage armor before battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  Radosek casts summon monster III on the first round of combat, using the
  cauldron of overwhelming allies in area Q20 to summon 2d3 Small ice elementals
  to surround and protect himself. He then uses his flight hex to levitate or
  fly above the fray, conjuring ice spears with his icicle wand or casting
  blindness/deafness on anyone targeting him with ranged attacks or spells.
  Thereafter, Radosek resorts to his touch spells, spending a swift action to
  infuse them with his frozen caress hex, either delivering hexes himself or
  relying on his familiar, Valstoi, to do so.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 15 or fewer hit points, Radosek flees, either through the room's
  windows using his flight hex, or into area Q23 to use the ice crystal
  teleporter. In either case, he retreats to the courtyard (area Q2), where he
  rallies any remaining defenders in the Pale Tower (see Development on page
  45). Thereafter, Radosek fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  icicle wand (42 charges; see page 61), potions of cure moderate wounds (2),
  scroll of animate objects
OtherGear: >-
  amulet of natural armor +1, cloak of resistance +1, ring of protection +1,
  spell component pouch
