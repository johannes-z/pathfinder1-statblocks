SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoid slain by a great ghul becomes a ghoul on the next moonrise.
      Likewise, a slain janni becomes a ghul and a slain genie becomes a great
      ghul. Blessing or destroying the body (such as with acid or fire) prevents
      this reanimation.
  - name: Cursed Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      A great ghul's claws count as both cold iron and magic for the purpose of
      bypassing damage reduction. Genie-Kin (Ex) For all race-related effects
      (such as a ranger's favored enemy), a great ghul is considered a genie
      (and thus a chaotic outsider and an evil outsider) even though its type is
      undead.
  - name: Warp Metal (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a great ghul may warp and deform any one metal
      object within 20 feet. This functions like warp wood, but affects only
      metal objects that fail a DC 22 Fortitude save. Armor or shields lose half
      their bonus to AC (enhancement bonuses are unaffected), and weapons are
      rendered useless except as improvised clubs. Other objects, such as doors,
      are rendered useless for their function. The transformation lasts 1
      minute, after which the affected metal reverts to its normal state. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The great ghuls cast greater invisibility on themselves on the first round of
  combat, then move forward to attack foes. They prefer to fight divine
  spellcasters first, teaming up on foes like clerics or paladins in an attempt
  to deny the PCs healing while simultaneously taking out the PCs who pose the
  greatest threat to them.
Morale: The great ghuls fight until destroyed.
