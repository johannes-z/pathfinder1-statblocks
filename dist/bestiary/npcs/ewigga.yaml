Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  If her deception is revealed, Ewigga keeps her wits about her and targets her
  attackers with ranged spells for as long as possible. She casts entangle to
  hinder foes and extended heat metal on opponents wearing metal armor (the
  increased duration makes the metal searingly hot for the third through twelfth
  rounds), followed by attack spells such as pox pustules, produce flame, and
  tar ball. If pressed into melee combat, Ewigga casts obscuring mist and
  dismisses her alter self spell, resuming her hag form and relying on her
  Blind-Fight feat to successfully attack opponents in the mist with her claws.
Morale: >-
  Having already witnessed the destruction of her coven, Ewigga has no wish to
  follow her sisters into death. If reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, the hag
  casts invisibility and attempts to flee the Vault of Thorns.
Gear: goodberries (5), lesser extend metamagic rod, scroll of call lightning

  leather baby shoes, wooden toy rattle, 1 gp
