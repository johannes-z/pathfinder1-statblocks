Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Setrona prefers to avoid combat if possible, instead seeking political or
  clandestine solutions to conflicts. If forced into a fight, she stays mobile,
  looking for flanking opportunities if she has allies or taking the time to
  dart away into hiding to ambush foes again and again. If faced with a stand-up
  fight, she uses a tanglefoot bag on her enemy and then disengages to escape
  the combat.
Morale: >-
  Setrona flees if she's forced into a stand-up fight or if she's reduced to 15
  or fewer hit points, preferring to survive a fight to plot vengeance later. If
  doing so results in allies being captured, she uses her resources in the days
  to come to engineer a rescue operation as best she can.
Gear: potions of cure light wounds (2), tanglefoot bags (2)
OtherGear: mwk studded leather, +1 dagger, darts (5), 112 gp, 5 sp
