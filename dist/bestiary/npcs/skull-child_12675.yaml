SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      A juvenile humanoid slain by a skull child rises the following night as a
      free-willed skull child. A bless spell cast on the body before that time
      ceases the transformation. Adults and non-humanoids killed by a skull
      child do not rise as undead.
  - name: Daylight Powerlessness (Su)
    description: >-
      A skull child's energy drain, create spawn, terrifying gaze, and weakness
      abilities only function after sunset.
  - name: Masquerade (Su)
    description: >-
      Between the hours of dawn and dusk, it is impossible to tell a skull child
      from another, normal, child of the race it is posing as. Any form of
      detection, such as detect undead reveals nothing. True seeing or similar
      spells show a dark haze around a skull child during the day but nothing
      else. Additionally, Bluff is always a class skill for a skull child.
  - name: Terrifying Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Any living creature that meets the gaze of a skull child must succeed on a
      DC 14 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. Creatures with more than 5 HD
      are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Vicious Claws (Su)
    description: >-
      The claws of a skull child are supernaturally sharp. A skull child
      threatens a critical on a 19-20 with its claw attack.
  - name: Weakness (Su)
    description: >-
      The bite of a skull child deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage on a
      successful hit unless the target succeeds on a DC 14 Fortitude save. A
      creature dies if this Constitution damage equals or exceeds its actual
      Constitution score. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Gear: pipes of the sewers, purse containing yellow topaz (510 gp).
