DuringCombat: >-
  Hargulka uses Power Attack and Vital Strike tactically, adjusting when he uses
  them to strike foes with lower armor classes or to remain mobile and prevent
  powerful foes from getting full attacks on him in the unlikely event that he's
  outmatched. His necklace of fireballs is somewhat legendary among his
  minions&#8211;he uses it against foes that try to hang back and avoid melee
  combat against him (starting with the most powerful first) or against a large
  number of foes that seem to be teetering on the brink of death.
Morale: Hargulka fights to the death.
