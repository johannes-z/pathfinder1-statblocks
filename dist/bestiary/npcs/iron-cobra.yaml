    description: >-
      Once per day, an iron cobra's creator can order it to find and kill a
      specific creature within 1 mile, which it does as if guided by discern
      location. The creator must have seen or be holding an item from the
      specified creature for this order to function.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      An iron cobra's bite injects poison from a hidden reservoir within its
      body. Because it is a construct, the cobra does not naturally produce this
      poison, and its creator must refill this reservoir manually. The reservoir
      holds enough poison for 3 successful bite attacks, after which the
      creature merely deals bite damage. Refilling the reservoir takes 5 rounds
      and provokes attacks of opportunity. The creator can fill the reservoir
      with any injury poison (typically black adder venom), though acid,
      alchemical substances, and even stranger liquids have been used. Black
      Adder Venom Bite-injury; save Fort DC 11; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds;
      effect 1d2 Con damage; cure 1 save.
