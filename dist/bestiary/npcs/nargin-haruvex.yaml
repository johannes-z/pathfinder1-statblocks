BeforeCombat: >-
  Nargin casts mage armor on himself daily. If he has the opportunity before
  combat, he also casts fire shield, freedom of movement, fly, protection from
  energy, blur, and mirror image on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  If combat seems inevitable, Nargin casts the spells listed above while he's
  protected by the walls of his prison, patiently continuing this set of spells
  even if the PCs manage to start harming him. He switches to his offensive
  spells when he's done preparing those defensive spells, or once the PCs reduce
  him to 40 or fewer hit points. If he has freedom of movement cast, he casts
  web with himself at the center of the effect to give him more protection
  without impeding his mobility.
Morale: >-
  Nargin's faith that he will be reborn if slain prompts him to fight to the
  death&#8211;but unfortunately for him, death has no future gifts for him. The
  next time he dies, it's for real.
