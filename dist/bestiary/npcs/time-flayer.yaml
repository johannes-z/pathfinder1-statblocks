SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Foresight (Su)
    description: >-
      A time flayer can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents
      a time flayer from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It
      also grants the time flayer an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom
      bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time flayer can restart it as
      a free action on its next turn.
  - name: Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A time flayer is immune to all time-related spells and effects (including
      time stop, temporal stasis, and the like).
  - name: Reality Bend (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a time flayer can fold the dimensional space
      surrounding it so its true location is hard to discern. The time flayer
      can activate this ability after it is hit in battle to suddenly not be
      where it was the moment before, giving it a 50% miss chance it can apply
      to successful strikes after they occur (but before damage is rolled). This
      is similar to the miss chance granted by a displacement spell. See
      invisibility does not reveal the creature's location, but true seeing
      does.
  - name: Temporal Displacement (Su)
    description: >-
      As a +12 melee touch attack up to three times per day, a time flayer can
      attempt to send a creature a few seconds into the future. The creature
      touched can resist being temporally displaced with a successful DC 20
      Fortitude save. On a failed save, the creature vanishes in a flash of
      white light, only to reappear in the same space 1d4 rounds later. If that
      space is occupied when the creature returns, it is shunted harmlessly
      aside to the closest unoccupied space. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Time Jaunt (Su)
    description: >-
      A time flayer normally has the ability to travel through time and space,
      but in this encounter, the nature of the stopped time prevents the time
      flayer from using this power entirely.
DuringCombat: >-
  The time flayer targets PCs exclusively, silently striking with its sword. It
  uses its temporal displacement ability on any character that seems
  particularly dangerous, doing its best to keep that PC locked out of time for
  as much of the battle as possible.
Morale: The time flayer fights until destroyed.
