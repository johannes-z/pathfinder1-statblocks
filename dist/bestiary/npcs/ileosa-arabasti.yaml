SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Contract Bound (Ex)
    description: >-
      Queen Ileosa forged a contract with an erinyes devil, gaining the benefits
      of the devil-bound template. If Ileosa dies, she cannot be brought back to
      life without Sermignatto's permission; if that devil is slain, the
      contract itself reverts to Sermignatto's hidden master, the Duke of Hell
      known as Lorthact.
  - name: Everdawn Infusion (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ileosa can cast teleport in the Sunken Queen without restriction. She
      calculates her hit points using her Charisma modifier rather than her
      Constitution modifier, and is immune to bleed effects.
  - name: Exceptional Stats (Ex)
    description: >-
      Queen Ileosa was destined from birth to achieve greatness. Her ability
      scores were generated using 25 points, rather than the standard array.
      Additionally, she has a potent artifact and her gear was determined as if
      she were a PC rather than an NPC to account for her vast wealth. These
      advantages increase her total CR by 1. Inherent Bonuses With the aid of
      genie-granted wishes and other expenditures of her wealth, Ileosa has the
      following inherent bonuses to her ability scores: Strength +3, Dexterity
      +4, Constitution +4, Intelligence +3, Wisdom +3, Charisma +5. Permanent
      Spells Ileosa has arcane sight and tongues as permanent spells, both
      functioning at CL 16th.
  - name: Susceptible to Serithtial (Ex)
    description: >-
      The infusion of Kazavon into Ileosa's soul allows Serithtial to suppress
      her regeneration. Each time she takes damage from Serithtial, she must
      succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or gain a negative level as the sacred
      blade carves away at the power granted to her by the dragon's fangs.
  - name: True Seeing (Su)
    description: >-
      Queen Ileosa continuously benefits from true seeing, as a benefit from her
      infernal contract.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ileosa casts stoneskin (from her ring of spell storing) and freedom of
  movement before combat, and activates the flight power of her crimson gown.
  She prepares herself, her four erinyes furies, and five of her six false
  Ileosas with a getaway spell, using area B19 of the Sunken Queen as the
  designated location.
DuringCombat: >-
  When combat starts, Ileosa activates her inspire courage bardic performance
  and casts project image to create a duplicate of herself amid the PCs while
  she flies out of melee range. She uses her eyes of charming each round against
  foes she knows have poor Will saves (her knowledge of the PCs allows her to
  choose her targets appropriately). The Crown of Fangs casts mirror image on
  her on the first round, recasting it as necessary as the combat goes on or
  casting dominate person otherwise. On the second round, she uses her greater
  quicken metamagic rod to cast quickened mind fog and then summons an ice devil
  to join the fight. On the third round, she uses her projected image to target
  a PC with irresistible dance while she casts quickened displacement. She saves
  her last quickened spell from the rod to cast greater dispel magic to cancel
  any particularly vexing spell effect. If she manages to control a foe's mind,
  she's fond of issuing orders like "Lay down your arms and bow before me!" or
  (to the appropriate PC) "Return to the floor below to find and take the
  largest gem you discover." Once confronted in melee, she fights back with her
  rapier and uses Arcane Strike when attacking (the bonus damage is included
  above).
Morale: >-
  Ileosa triggers her getaway spell if reduced to 60 or fewer hit points
  (bringing along any furies or false Ileosas within 30 feet of her) to retreat
  to area B19 of the Sunken Queen, then uses the heal spell from her ring and
  other spells to recover quickly before returning to the fight. Once she
  rejoins the battle, she fights to the death, unwilling to abandon her plans
  this close to fruition.

  greater quicken metamagic rod, major ring of spell storing (contains heal,
  stoneskin), wand of magic missile (CL 9th, 34 charges)
