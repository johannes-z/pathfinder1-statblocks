BeforeCombat: >-
  Ulla keeps mage armor active at all times, recasting it as needed. When she
  has time to prepare for combat, Ulla casts bull's strength, bear's endurance,
  greater invisibility, and haste.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ulla hits massed foes with area effect spells like ice storm and sleet storm,
  and targets strong warriors with ray of exhaustion or ray of enfeeblement. She
  uses scorching ray and magic missile against ranged attackers. Once in melee
  combat, Ulla combines her hasted claw attacks with chill touch, making use of
  greater invisibility to cast spells safely before attacking again with
  surprise. If surrounded by enemies, she makes use of her elemental blast
  ability.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to below 30 hit points, Ulla casts elemental body I and flees,
  using fog cloud to cover her escape, returning later to exact revenge on her
  attackers.
