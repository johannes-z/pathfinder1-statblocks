  Klorak rages on the first round of combat and then charges the nearest foe,
  resorting to javelins only against foes who flee and can outrun him. Klorak is
  somewhat obsessed with blood, especially since one of Malikadna's many lies to
  him was that the blood of his enemies can increase his virility. The round
  after he first damages a foe, he attempts a touch attack (this action provokes
  an attack of opportunity and forces him to drop or sheath his scimitar) to
  gather the foe's blood on his palm so he can smear the blood across his chest
  and face, rolling his eyes and howling maniacally as he does so. He does this
  the same every round after he drops a foe into negative hit points. This
  tactic should help to make Klorak a memorable foe against the PCs as well as
  to give them a few moments of respite against the powerful enemy&#8211;if you
  find that the PCs are having little problem handling the dangerous barbarian,
  feel free to omit this behavior.
Morale: Klorak fights to the death.
