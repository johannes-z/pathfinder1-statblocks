BeforeCombat: Maroux casts mage armor before emerging from her hut.
DuringCombat: >-
  Maroux employs to her quarterstaff only as a last resort, preferring to use
  her spells on foes. She casts cure moderate wounds on herself whenever she
  falls below 17 hit points.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 5 hit points, Maroux suddenly gives up the fight and
  transforms into a pitiful sight indeed, dropping to her knees and begging for
  her life. In this case, she'll promise to help the PCs in any way they wish,
  although she'd prefer to limit her aid to simply advising them as detailed in
  Offering to Help on page 10. If the PCs force her to accompany them, she
  serves dutifully until she sees her first chance to try to escape into the
  swamp&#8211;if she manages this, she lies low for several days, hoping to
  outwait the PCs' presence in the area.
Gear: >-
  potions of cure light wounds (4), scrolls of cure moderate wounds (2), scroll
  of remove disease, scroll of remove curse
OtherGear: masterwork quarterstaff, amulet of natural armor +1, spell component pouch
