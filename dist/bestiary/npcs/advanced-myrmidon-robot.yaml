SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Combined Arms (Ex)
    description: >-
      When taking a full-attack action, a myrmidon robot can attack with melee
      and ranged integrated weapons simultaneously.
  - name: Force Field (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shimmering field of energy encases the myrmidon, granting it 55 bonus
      hit points. All damage dealt to the robot is deducted from these hit
      points first. As long as the force field is active, the myrmidon is immune
      to critical hits. This force field has fast healing 12, but once its hit
      points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and doesn't reactivate
      for 24 hours.
  - name: Integrated Laser Rifle (Ex)
    description: >-
      A myrmidon's eye is an integrated laser rifleTG. It cannot make iterative
      attacks with this weapon. The laser rifle can be targeted by effects that
      target manufactured weapons (such as sunder attempts). It doesn't provoke
      an attack of opportunity when used in melee combat (and cannot be
      harvested for use outside of the robot's body).
  - name: Quantum Lash (Ex)
    description: >-
      The robot's two facial tentacles are primary melee attacks with a reach of
      20 feet. They deal force damage; this damage is not modified by Strength
      and cannot be improved via Power Attack. A quantum lash that strikes a
      force effect has a chance to disrupt the effect. Against a magical force
      effect (such as a wall of force), the myrmidon attempts a special caster
      level check (with a bonus of +11) as if it were casting dispel magic
      against the effect. Against a robot's force field or a force effect
      granted by a technological item, the creature struck can resist having the
      force effect negated with a successful DC 20 Fortitude save-failure
      indicates that the force effect is negated for 1d10 rounds. If a robot's
      force field is suppressed in this way, it returns with the same number of
      hit points it had when it was deactivated. The save DC is
      Intelligence-based.
  - name: Resilient (Ex)
    description: Myrmidon robots receive a +3 racial bonus on all saving throws.
  - name: Rockets (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a myrmidon can fire a rocket to a range of 800 feet.
      A rocket explodes on impact in a 30-foot-radius burst, dealing 6d6 points
      of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in the area (Reflex DC 20 half).
      The robot carries a maximum of five rockets at any one time, and can
      replenish fired rockets at a rate of one per 12 hours, crafting new
      rockets from scrap metal and other collected components. The save DC is
      Intelligence-based.
  - name: Superior Optics (Ex)
    description: >-
      A myrmidon robot sees invisible creatures or objects as if they were
      visible.
DuringCombat: >-
  The myrmidon focuses its attacks on targets wielding the highest number of
  technological items first, as it's been ordered by the League to capture such
  victims before any others.
Morale: The myrmidon fights until destroyed.
