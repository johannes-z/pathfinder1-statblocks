SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Law (Ex)
    description: >-
      The power of Lictor Clandegar's aura of law (see the detect law spell) is
      equal to that of a cleric of his total character level (15th level).
  - name: Detect Chaos (Sp)
    description: >-
      This ability functions like a paladin's detect evil class feature, save
      that it detects chaos.
  - name: Fearsomeness (Ex)
    description: >-
      When Lictor Clandegar uses the Intimidate skill to cause a creature within
      10 feet to become shaken, he can instead cause that creature to become
      frightened.
  - name: Force of Will (Ex)
    description: >-
      Lictor Clandegar gains a +4 bonus on Will saves against spells with the
      phantasm descriptor and a +2 bonus versus those with the compulsion
      descriptor.
  - name: Hellknight Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      Lictor Clandegar reduces the armor check penalty of Hellknight armor by 2,
      increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by 2, and moves at full
      speed while wearing it.
  - name: Smite Chaos (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as the paladin's smite evil class feature, but
      against chaotic-aligned creatures. This ability is twice as effective
      against outsiders with the chaotic subtype, chaotic-aligned aberrations,
      and fey.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Lictor Clandegar uses smite chaos against foes whom he recognizes as
  worshipers of demons or other chaotic cults, but otherwise focuses his wrath
  on obvious agents of Thrune, preferring those who look the most like
  well-dressed politicians or priests over foes who wear heavy armor. He makes
  liberal use of his Greater Sunder feat, and if he notices any opponent who
  seems to be focused on bolstering the enemies, he moves within 10 feet to try
  to frighten them with an Intimidate check.
Morale: Lictor Clandegar fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  +3 Hellknight plateISWG, +2 tower shield, +2 wounding battleaxe, belt of
  physical might +2 (Str, Con), cloak of resistance +1
