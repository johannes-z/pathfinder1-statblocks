      meteorites that fall in a 5-foot column, 30 feet high, with a range of 30
      feet. The meteors deal 1d4+2 points of cold damage (DC 16 Reflex negates).
  - name: Bloodline Arcana (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever the Devourer of Reason casts an evocation spell, it may select

  spends a charge from its wand of protection from arrows, and drinks its potion
  of invisibility, hiding in the corner and waiting to attack the first creature
  with its back turned.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Devourer of Reason tries to take out divine casters first, silencing them
  with its bloodline arcana power, and uses its evocation spells alongside its
  lesser elemental metamagic rod to deal cold damage.
