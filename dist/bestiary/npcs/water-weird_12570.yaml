SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Command Elemental (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a greater weird can attempt to enslave elementals of
      the same subtype within 30 ft. Elementals receive a DC 19 Will save to
      negate the effect. Elementals that fail their saves fall under the greater
      weird's control, obeying its commands to the best of their ability as if
      under the effects of a dominate monster spell. Intelligent elementals
      receive a new save once each week to resist command. A greater weird can
      command any number of elementals, so long as their total Hit Dice do not
      exceed its own. If the elemental is under the command of another creature,
      the greater weird must make an opposed Charisma check to gain control of
      the elemental. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial
      bonus.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      When reduced to 0 hit points or less, a greater weird collapses. If
      contacting its element, it reforms 1 minute later with 5 hit points,
      allowing its fast healing thereafter to resume healing it.
  - name: Transparency (Ex)
    description: >-
      When submerged in its element, a greater weird is effectively invisible
      and gains total concealment (50% miss chance). Additionally, a submerged
      greater weird gains a +12 racial bonus on Stealth checks and can move at
      full speed without taking a penalty on Stealth checks.
