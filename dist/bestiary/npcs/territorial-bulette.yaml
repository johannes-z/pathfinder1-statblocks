SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Leap (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bulette can perform a special kind of pounce attack by jumping into
      combat. When a bulette charges, it can make a DC 20 Acrobatics check to
      jump into the air and land next to its enemies. If it makes the Acrobatics
      check, it can follow up with four claw attacks against foes in reach, but
      cannot make a bite attack.
  - name: Savage Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bulette's bite is particularly dangerous. It applies 1-1/2 times its
      Strength modifier to damage inflicted with its bite attack, and threatens
      a critical hit on a 19-20.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The bulettes wait under the cave floor until the PCs are about a third of the
  way into the cavern, then burrow up to attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  One of the bulettes attacks in the first round, attempting to burrow up into
  the middle of the PCs and cause the party to split up. The second bulette
  waits until the second round, when it bursts from the ground to attack
  whichever PC is farthest from its mate. The bulettes prefer halfling targets
  above all others.
Morale: >-
  The aggressive bulettes have little regard for their own safety and fight to
  the death.
