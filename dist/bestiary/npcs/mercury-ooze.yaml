    description: >-
      Slam-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1 Dex
      damage and 1 Con damage; cure 1 save. A creature affected by mercury
      poisoning must receive the benefits of a neutralize poison effect within 1
      week of being poisoned. Failing this, the victim must succeed at a DC 17
      Will save after the week is over or be affected as if by an insanity spell
      (caster level 10th). This effect can be removed by greater restoration,
      heal, miracle, or wish. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  Unlike most corporeal creatures, the mercury ooze is unaffected by the
  shattered glass covering the ground in area B7, and can move across this area
  unimpeded.
