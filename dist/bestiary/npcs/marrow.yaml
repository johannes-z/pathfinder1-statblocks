BeforeCombat: Marrow casts shield on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Marrow relies on her zombies to engage the enemy in melee, allowing her to
  hang back and use her ranged spells on foes. She switches to her wands once
  her spells are exhausted, and does her best to stay mobile in a battle and out
  of melee entirely&#8211;her dagger is only for last resorts. She prefers to
  use her channeled negative energy for healing her precious undead minions.
Morale: Marrow fights to the death.
