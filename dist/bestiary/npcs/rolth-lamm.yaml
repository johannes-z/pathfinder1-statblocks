ProhibitedSchools: illusion, transmutation
BeforeCombat: Rolth casts shield, mage armor, and false life before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Rolth prefers to let allies fight in melee, so he can hang back and use spells
  at range. He prefers to leave foes alive but incapacitated so he can kill them
  at leisure with his knife. A successful casting of hold person is his favorite
  method of enabling sneak attacks.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, Rolth flees via dimension door; if he
  escapes, he can become a recurring antagonist who seeks to add the PCs to his
  collection of undead servants.
