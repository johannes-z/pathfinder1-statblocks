SpecialAbilities: []
Gender: Male and Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  The Twins have no preparatory magic to cast, but with warning use detect
  thoughts and clairaudience/clairvoyance to evaluate the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Twins favor melee over spellcasting, and they look for opportunities to
  gain sneak attacks whenever possible.
Morale: >-
  As long as both dandasukas are alive and have more than half their respective
  hit points, they fight mercilessly. If either is killed, the other surrenders
  when reduced to 10 hit points or fewer if he can negotiate terms for long-term
  escape. If both are reduced to fewer than half their total hit points, the
  Twins surrender together, and express a desire to depart the lair and Absalom
  in general out of fear of the Mistress.
