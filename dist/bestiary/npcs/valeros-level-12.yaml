DuringCombat: >-
  Valeros activates his boots of speed, using the extra movement to get into a
  position from which he can take a full attack action in the following round,
  and maintaining the effects of haste as long as he can continue to benefit
  from an additional attack each round. When he's unable to make more than one
  attack, he prefers his longsword and utilizes Vital Strike to increase his
  damage output. Unless he absolutely must wield a weapon in two hands to gain
  the additional damage potential, he wields both swords to take advantage of
  his Two-Weapon Defense feat.
