  On Wedderwark's orders, the jinkins hide in the perimeter corridors, consume
  their potions, and prepare to ambush whatever emerges from the elevator.
DuringCombat: >-
  The jinkins hide in the perimeter corridors to fire their shortbows from
  cover. After each attack, they scurry to another hole to hide again. If
  cornered, they use spider climb or cast dimension door to escape.
Morale: >-
  The jinkins fight until Wedderwark orders them to stand down or until she
  falls in combat, at which point the jinkins flee using dimension door. If the
  PCs cannot speak to a surrendering Wedderwark in Undercommon, the jinkins
  interpret for them.
