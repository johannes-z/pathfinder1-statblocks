SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Profane Gift (Su)
    description: >-
      Each of these clerics has used planar ally to contact a succubus to gain
      her profane gift-a profane bonus to Wisdom.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Each rasper casts air walk, bear's endurance, shield of faith, and spell
  resistance on herself before combat, and casts magic vestment on her buckler.
  One of the raspers casts sending to alert Areelu that the PCs are attacking
  just before combat begins.
DuringCombat: >-
  Each rasper directs her dragon to breathe acid as often as possible,
  supporting these attacks with ranged magic. Melee is a tactic of last resort,
  but if the PCs attempt to enter area F2, the raspers and their dragons swiftly
  move to engage in melee there to prevent the activation of the phase door to
  area F3. Raspers are fond of using their selective metamagic rods to render
  themselves and their allies immune to blade barriers and flame strikes.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 50 or fewer hit points, a rasper casts word of recall to retreat
  to area F17, whereupon she heals herself and then moves to area F21 to stay at
  Areelu's side to protect her. A rasper fights to the death when doing so.
OtherGear: >-
  +4 leather armor, mwk buckler, headband of inspired wisdom +6, selective
  metamagic rodUE
