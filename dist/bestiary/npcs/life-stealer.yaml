BeforeCombat: >-
  The barbarian uses stealth and deception to get close to enemies without them
  noticing, and uses his chime of opening to break into locked strongholds.
DuringCombat: >-
  The barbarian tries to disarm opponents at the beginning of combat, using
  poison against a target's weakest ability score if he knows his target in
  advance. He triggers his mighty swing on a sword critical that might slay his
  target, and uses his rage-enhanced senses to find creatures trying to hide or
  flee. He uses his buckler when faced with many foes, but against lone targets
  uses his nine lives stealer for two-handed Power Attacks.
