SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fireworks (Ex)
    description: >-
      The goblins who made the effigy stuffed fireworks into their creation. Now
      that the effigy is animated, the goblin-made monstrosity can use these
      fireworks as a weapon. With each movement, spinning pinwheels and gouts of
      sparks erupt from the effigy. Once every round, a random creature within
      10 feet of the effigy takes 2d6 points of fire damage from these
      constantly erupting fireworks. This damage is halved if the target of the
      attack succeeds at a DC 15 Reflex save.
  - name: Haunted (Ex)
    description: >-
      The goblin chief effigy is haunted by the spirit of the cannibalistic
      goblin Vorka. It takes damage from positive energy as if it were an undead
      creature and can be detected by detect undead.
  - name: Slower (Ex)
    description: >-
      The goblin chief effigy's construction is slapdash, in the typical goblin
      style. This lack of careful engineering reduces the effigy's movement to
      20 feet.
DuringCombat: >-
  The goblin chief effigy is an engine of destruction. It crashes around in the
  dell outside the cave, attacking anything that moves. To close the gap between
  itself and any targets, it rushes over, hoping to catch goblins in its trample
  attack. Once it is adjacent to any goblins, it smashes them with its burning
  slams and tries to stay close to multiple targets so its fireworks have the
  chance to affect the greatest number of targets.
Morale: Mindless and destructive, the goblin chief effigy fights until destroyed.
