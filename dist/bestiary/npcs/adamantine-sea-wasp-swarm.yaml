      Dexterity drain; cure 2 consecutive saves. A creature whose Dexterity
      score is reduced to 0 freezes solid (similar to a flesh to stone spell)
      for 1d4 hours as his body hardens into ice. If reduced to 0 hit points or
      below while frozen, the creature shatters into pieces and dies. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The sea wasp swarm attacks all living targets it encounters, but it does not
  pursue foes beyond areas A6-A8.
Morale: The swarm fights until it is destroyed.
