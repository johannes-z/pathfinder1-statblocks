SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bay (Su)
    description: >-
      When a shadow mastiff howls or barks, all creatures except evil outsiders
      within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or become
      panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. A
      creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same mastiff's
      bay for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial
      bonus.
  - name: Shadow Blend (Su)
    description: >-
      In any condition of illumination other than full daylight, a shadow
      mastiff disappears into the shadows, giving it total concealment.
      Artificial illumination, even a light or continual flame spell, does not
      negate this ability. A daylight spell, however, does. A shadow mastiff can
      suspend or resume this ability as a free action.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The shadow hound lurks behind one of the room's larger crates, waiting to be
  fed. When the PCs enter, it doesn't recognize their scent and initiates combat
  with its bay ability.
DuringCombat: >-
  The hound pursues PCs to the length of its chain, attacking while trying to
  remain at least partially hidden in the shadows of the crates and cargo stored
  here in the Material Plane.
Morale: >-
  The shadow hound fights to the death, and howls loudly and relentlessly if the
  PCs move beyond its reach.
