Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Erdija prefers to engage foes from a distance with her bow, using her speed to
  keep out of reach of melee combatants. She hates giants and attacks them over
  other foes.
Morale: >-
  Erdija's loyalty is to her clan, not to the PCs, and her first priority is to
  report to Korak Kaag rather than sacrifice herself for non-centaur strangers.
  Nevertheless, she won't abandon allies unless it's clear that the battle is
  lost.
Gear: potion of resist energy (cold)
OtherGear: >-
  chain shirt, mwk composite longbow (+3 Str) with 20 +1 arrows, mwk longsword,
  ring of protection +1, 14 gp
