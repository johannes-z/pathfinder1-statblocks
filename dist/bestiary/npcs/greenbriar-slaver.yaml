BeforeCombat: >-
  The slavers cast all of their spells before combat&#8211;barkskin to increase
  their armor class, lead blades on both weapons, and longstrider to increase
  their speed.
DuringCombat: >-
  The slavers work together to flank foes, but prefer to focus on halflings
  first, tieflings or aasimars second, and other foes thereafter. One slaver in
  the group makes sure to activate his hunter's bond to grant Delexia and
  Krittorax combat bonuses against an appropriate target.
Morale: >-
  As long as their leader remains standing, the slavers fight to the death. If
  Delexia is incapacitated, they switch tactics to attempt to secure her and
  retreat with her to safety; if she is slain, a slaver flees if reduced to 20
  hit points or fewer.
Gear: >-
  +1 chainmail, +1 short swords (2), belt of giant strength +2, thunderstone, 13
