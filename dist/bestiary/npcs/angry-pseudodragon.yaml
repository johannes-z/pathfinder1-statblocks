    description: >-
      Sting-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/minute for 10 minutes; effect
      sleep for 1 minute; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based and
      includes a +2 racial bonus.
BeforeCombat: >-
  1d4 rounds after combat begins, the three pseudodragons arrive simultaneously
  from different windows.
DuringCombat: >-
  The pseudodragon attacks PCs threatening the hippogriff, or any PCs attempting
  to steal an egg (see Treasure below). He telepathically yells to them, "Get
  out, friends of egg thieves!" Even if the PCs are not attempting to steal
  eggs, he assumes they are friends of Craik.
Morale: >-
  Though he fights furiously, the pseudodragons are willing to hear reason. A PC
  who succeeds at a DC 24 Diplomacy check as a standard action or who returns a
  stolen egg can initiate a telepathic parley (see Development below). However,
  if the PCs steal an egg or kill any member of his clutch (including the
  hippogriff), the pseudodragons fight to the death. The PCs either convince all
  of the pseudodragons to stand down or none of them.
