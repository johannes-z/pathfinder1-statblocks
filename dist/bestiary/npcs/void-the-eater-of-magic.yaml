SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Abyssal Stare (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action a soulless creature can stare into the eyes of
      another living being within 30 ft. and force it to confront the infinite,
      empty void beyond death. Targets who fail a Will save (DC 10 +1/2 soulless
      HD + Charisma modifier) waver in their will to survive and take a -4
      penalty to all saves and skill and ability checks for 1d4 rounds. Divine
      casters are particularly disturbed. They must succeed on a caster level
      check (20 + spell level) to cast a divine spell while under the effect of
      abyssal stare or the spell is lost. Creatures affected by abyssal stare
      are immune to other uses of the stare for 24 hours. This is a
      mindaffecting, fear effect.
  - name: Arcane Servant (Su)
    description: >-
      All archwizards of 2nd and higher level are treated as if they have a
      permanent unseen servant near them at all times. The servant can go no
      further than 100 ft., but otherwise confer to the rules of normal unseen
      servants. If destroyed, the servant reappears the following round.
  - name: Bound Soul (Ex)
    description: >-
      The soul of a soulless creature resides in a special prison in the Abyss.
      This soul cannot return to the base creature without the permission of
      Orcus. A soulless creature cannot be raised or resurrected, nor do these
      spells have any effect on a soulless creature. Detect Expertise All of a
      3rd level archwizards detect spells are treated as if using the Detect
      Expertise feat. In addition, the archwizard gains information one round
      earlier than normal, if the detect is round-dependent. At 6th level, the
      archwizard gains information 2 rounds earlier.
  - name: Divine Exclusion (Ex)
    description: >-
      The soulless creature has no connection to the divine. A soulless creature
      cannot take levels in any divine class, cast divine spells, or use magic
      items constructed with spells found only on a divine caster's spell list.
      Forgo Materials A first level archwizard no longer needs mundane material
      components to fuel his spells, and acts as if he has the Eschew Materials
      feat. The archwizard may cast any spell with a material component cost of
      up to 10 gp per archwizard level without needing the actual component.
  - name: Metamagic Enhancement (Su)
    description: >-
      An archwizard is a master at manipulating magical forces. At first level,
      he reduces the cost of any metamagic feat known by one level less than
      standard i.e. a first level archwizard casts a spell with the Empower feat
      at one spell slot higher than the original spell. The metamagic
      enhancement can only be applied to one enhancement per spell. This ability
      does not affect the Heighten Spell feat. At 5th level and 10th level, the
      adjusted level is reduced one additional spell level. Spellcasting Master
      At 2nd level, the archwizard gains a +5 insight bonus to Knowledge
      (arcana), Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device.
  - name: Vessel of Orcus (Su)
    description: >-
      By manipulating an imprisoned soul Orcus can possess a soulless creature,
      enabling the demon lord to see and hear through the soulless creature's
      body.
