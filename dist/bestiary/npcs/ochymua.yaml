BeforeCombat: >-
  Ochymua starts its day by casting moment of prescience. In preparation for
  combat, it casts fickle winds, fly, haste, mirror image, and shield. If
  alerted to the PCs, Ochymua also casts protection from energy, resist energy,
  and spell turning, keyed to elements and spells it knows the PCs are fond of
  employing in combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The veiled master starts combat by employing its scroll of time stop, using
  the extra rounds to cast any spells listed in Before Combat that it was unable
  to cast in advance. It then sets up illusions of itself or other prominent
  NPCs to further confound enemies when time resumes. Ochymua attempts to
  dominate impressionable foes, turning them against their allies, while
  delaying martial foes with maze.
Morale: >-
  Ochymua yearns to see its people restored and humanity laid low. If reduced
  below 200 hit points, Ochymua attempts to cast quickened dominate person
  against a divine caster, commanding the enslaved target to heal it. It fights
  until reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, at which point it retreats using
  teleport to the entrance of the Doomsday Stores to regroup.
Gear: scroll of time stop
OtherGear: >-
  headband of mental prowess +4 (Int, Cha), ring of freedom of movement, ring of
  protection +4
