BeforeCombat: Teko stands guard at area R5.
DuringCombat: >-
  Teko attempts to prevent enemies from crossing the bridge and uses his Greater
  Bull Rush feat to push enemies off the ledge. In melee, he uses Critical
  Mastery whenever possible to inflict his enemies with various conditions as
  allowed by his generous selection of critical feats. He only aids the bugbears
  if attacked by the PCs from range.
Morale: Teko knows that flight upstairs is not an option, and fights to the death.

  natural armor +1, cloak of resistance +1, +2 keen longsword
