DuringCombat: >-
  If the PCs see through Vimanda's deception, she snarls and attacks. In combat,
  she takes to the air and hurls her javelins, as well as casts scorching ray
  and magic missile. If pushed into melee, she switches to physical attacks,
  delivering stunning fists with her kukri on her first attack each round. She
  does not assume her true form in battle.
Morale: >-
  If Vimanda is brought to fewer than 50 hit points, she attempts to bargain
  with the PCs, congratulating them on their skill and asking them if they would
  like her aid in defeating the man who is their true enemy- Bahor. If the PCs
  don't agree, she uses a precious charge of her wand of dimension door to flee
  to Old Korvosa and recover from the fight. In time, she could seek out the PCs
  again for revenge.
Gear: wand of dimension door (3 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 ki focus shock kukri, javelins of lightning (2), gold armbands worth 1,400
