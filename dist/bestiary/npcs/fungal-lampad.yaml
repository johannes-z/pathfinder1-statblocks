SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature killed by Constitution damage from a fungal creature's poison
      spore cloud transforms into a fungal spawn over a period of 24 hours. A
      plant growth spell halves the transformation time, and a diminish plants
      spell doubles it. A blight spell destroys the fungal spores and prevents
      the corpse's transformation, but spells that remove disease are
      ineffective against the growing spores. Once a creature fully transforms
      into a fungal spawn, the corpse from which it grew is destroyed. A fungal
      spawn gains the fungal creature template, but it loses all class levels
      and memories of the base creature from which it was spawned. If the base
      creature has 1 or fewer racial Hit Dice and normally has class levels, use
      a 1st-level warrior version of it as the base creature. The fungal spawn
      awakens as a free-willed being that knows all it needs to know (including
      language) in order to use its abilities and survive. Although it bears no
      allegiance to the fungal creature that created it, the new fungal creature
      immediately recognizes other fungal creatures as its own kind.
  - name: Fungal Metabolism (Ex)
    description: A fungal lampad breathes, but does not eat or sleep.
  - name: Guarded (Su)
    description: >-
      A lampad adds her Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to her Armor
      Class.
  - name: Insane Beauty (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability affects all humanoids within 30 feet who are viewing a lampad
      in conditions brighter than dim light. Those who look directly upon the
      lampad must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or gain the confused condition
      for 1d6 rounds, as per the confusion spell. A creature that succeeds at
      the save is immune to the same lampad's insane beauty for 24 hours. A
      lampad can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison Spore Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a fungal creature can release a choking cloud of spores in a
      15-foot-radius spread that lingers in the air for 10 rounds. This cloud
      functions as an inhaled poison. Any breathing creature in the cloud must
      succeed at a Fortitude save or inhale the spores. A creature that remains
      in the area of the spore cloud must continue to attempt Fortitude saves
      against its effects. Fungal Spores: Poison-inhaled; save Fort DC 18;
      frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con damage and fatigued for 1
      minute; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Poisonous Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      A fungal creature's blood and flesh are ingested poisons. Any creature
      that makes a bite attack against a fungal creature, swallows one whole, or
      otherwise ingests part of one must succeed at a Fortitude save or be
      afflicted by the poison. Fungal Blood or Flesh: Poison-ingested; save Fort
      DC 18; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect 1 Str damage, 1 Dex
      damage, and nauseated for 1 minute; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A fungal creature gains all the sustenance it requires from contact with
      moist natural earth, but it must rejuvenate itself as often and for as
      long as humans need sleep. As long as it is in contact with moist natural
      earth, a resting fungal creature regains hit points as though it were
      undergoing complete bed rest and long term care (4 hit points per Hit Die
      for each day of rest). The fungal creature can engage in light activity
      during rejuvenation, but any strenuous activity (like fighting, running,
      or casting a spell) prevents it from regaining hit points for that day.
      Complete bed rest doesn't increase the amount of healing a fungal creature
      gains from rejuvenation. Spells A lampad casts spells as a 5th-level druid
      but can't swap out prepared spells to cast summon spells.
  - name: Weep (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a lampad can unsettle those near her when she cries.
      Any creature within 30 feet who can hear a lampad weeping becomes shaken
      for 1 minute unless it succeeds at a DC 18 Will saving throw. This ability
      can't cause a creature to become frightened or panicked. This is a
      mind-affecting fear effect that relies on audible components. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  The lampad uses her weep special ability first and then uses her spells to
  support her allies. She uses spider climb to avoid melee but tries to stay
  within range of her insane beauty ability.
Morale: The lampad fights to the death.
