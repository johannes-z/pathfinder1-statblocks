SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Isirah's aggregate can breathe a cone of caustic gas infused with the
      screaming spirits of her fellow crewmembers. In addition to taking acid
      damage, any creature harmed by the aggregate's breath weapon must also
      succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save and a DC 23 Will save. A creature that
      fails the Fortitude save is exposed to the aggregate's poison. A creature
      that fails the Will save is shaken for 1d4 rounds.
  - name: Chemical Burn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature struck by the aggregate, or that strikes her with a natural
      weapon or unarmed attack, is affected as if by the burn special attack,
      but takes acid damage instead of fire damage. The chemical burn persists
      for multiple rounds, just as a normal burn, but can be ended early if the
      affected creature is doused in at least 1 gallon of liquid (requiring a
      full-round action from the victim or another creature) or fully submerges
      itself in water.
  - name: Ghost In The Machine (Ex)
    description: >-
      Isirah's shade is an undead collective acting as an AI, granting the
      aggregate both her feats as an artificial intelligence and those of the
      elemental she inhabits. Despite not being undead, she has all the
      immunities of a creature of the undead type, including immunity to
      mind-affecting effects.
  - name: Haunted Grace (Su)
    description: >-
      Isirah's aggregate gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to her Charisma
      modifier.
  - name: Misty Form (Su)
    description: >-
      The aggregate's body is composed of a semisolid chemical mist similar to
      thick foam. Isirah's aggregate does not have a Strength score and cannot
      manipulate or wear solid objects. This form grants her the amorphous
      defensive ability, and enables her to move through areas as small as 1
      inch in diameter with no reduction to its speed. She cannot enter water or
      other fluids, and is treated as a Medium creature for the purposes of how
      wind affects her.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Caustic corruption-inhaled; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 4
      rounds; effect 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Sentimental (Ex)
    description: >-
      Isirah's shade still envies the happy life she had before losing her life,
      and she finds the existence of the compact AI core both fascinating and
      unsettling. A PC can display the compact AI core prominently, appeal to
      the shade, and attempt a DC 20 Diplomacy check as a full-round action. If
      successful, the aggregate is staggered for 1 round and takes 4d6 damage
      that bypasses its damage reduction as the shade's will to exist crumbles.
  - name: Vulnerable to Wind (Ex)
    description: >-
      Isirah's aggregate takes damage every round that she's exposed to stronger
      than moderate winds: 1d6 points of damage for strong winds, 2d6 points of
      damage for severe winds, and an additional 1d6 points of damage for each
      wind force category beyond severe (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 439). Gust
      of wind is considered severe wind for this ability. She cannot use her
      breath weapon while being affected by stronger than moderate winds and for
      1 minute afterward.
DuringCombat: >-
  Isirah's aggregate maneuvers to include as many foes as possible in her stench
  aura before using her breath weapon. In subsequent rounds, she splits her
  slam  attacks among multiple creatures, using her breath weapon when it
  becomes available. All the while, she gloats about her newfound freedom and
  speculates aloud about the terrors she might inflict after untold ages of
  captivity.
Morale: Isirah's aggregate fights until destroyed.
