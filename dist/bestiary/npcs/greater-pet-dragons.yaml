SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Freezing Mist Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      A frost drake can, as a standard action, spit a ball of liquid that bursts
      into a cloud of freezing mist. This attack has a range of 60 feet and
      deals 7d6 points of cold damage (DC 20 Reflex half ) to all creatures in a
      20-foot-radius spread. The mist cakes all surfaces in the area with a
      sheet of slippery ice that turns the area into difficult terrain for 2d4
      rounds, after which the ice cracks or melts enough to revert to the normal
      terrain features in the area. Once a frost drake has used its freezing
      mist breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The Reflex save is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Icewalking (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability works like spider climb, but the surfaces the drake climbs
      must be icy. It can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not
      need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.
  - name: Speed Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a swift action, a frost drake may draw on its
      draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional
      move action in that round.
  - name: Snow Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A frost drake can see perfectly well in snowy conditions, and does not
      take any penalties on Perception checks while in snow.
DuringCombat: >-
  The frost drakes use their freezing mist breath on the PCs in the first round
  of combat, creating icy ground near the cave's mouth. If any PCs remain in
  this area, the drakes take turns attempting to bull rush them over the edge,
  provoking attacks of opportunity but gaining a +2 bonus on their CMB checks
  thanks to the icy ground.
Morale: The frost drakes are loyal to Jerevyx and fight to the death.
