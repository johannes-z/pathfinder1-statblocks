DuringCombat: >-
  Audrahni does her best to avoid combat, but if pressed she whips out her
  bladed scarf and fights defensively as she retreats, disarming enemies when
  possible to ensure her safety. Despite this caution, she does not abandon
  those she has befriended, and fights by their side to the death if necessary
  (although she advises retreat before death becomes an inevitability).
Morale: >-
  Audrahni flees as best she can after taking any damage or being seriously
  threatened.
