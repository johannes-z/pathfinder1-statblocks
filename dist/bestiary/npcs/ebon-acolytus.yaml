SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Prostration (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an ebon acolytus can attempt to force any creature
      it is currently grappling into a sacrificial position. The construct must
      make an additional combat maneuver check against its target to reposition
      it into an advantageous position. If it succeeds, and the victim remains
      grappled at the beginning of the construct's next round, the ebon acolytus
      may make use of its sacrifice ability. An ebon acolytus gains a +2 bonus
      on its combat maneuver check for the purposes of making this check if it
      is adjacent to an altar or similar site of ceremonial bloodletting.
  - name: Sacrifice (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, an ebon acolytus may make a coup de grace attack
      with its dagger against any target currently grappled into place by means
      of its prostration ability. The target is affected by the coup de grace
      attack and must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + damage dealt) or
      die as normal. If the target is killed by this attack, its soul is sent
      straight to the plane of the being to which the altar is dedicated,
      regardless of alignment, and cannot be raised from the dead except by a
      cleric sworn to the same deity or by a miracle or wish spell. A creature
      under the effects of a protection from evil spell-ora similar spell that
      opposes the alignment of the god the ebon acolytus is crafted to
      serve&#8211;may be resurrected as normal.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The ebon acolytus stands inert in the chapel access until it is attacked or
  until the safe house is damaged.
DuringCombat: >-
  The ebon acolytus attempts to grapple the nearest intruder, using its
  prostration ability to put victims into a position where they can be
  sacrificed to Lissala. The stone dais in this room does not count as an altar
  for the purpose of the ebon acolytus's prostration ability.
Morale: The ebon acolytus pursues intruders relentlessly and fights until destroyed.
