    description: >-
      Ulthun has access to Lastwall's vaults. He bears a holy avenger as a
      symbol of office and can command other wealth, but this does not change
      his CR.

BeforeCombat: >-
  Before entering combat, Ulthun casts bull's strength on himself and drinks his
  potion of heroism.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ulthun is a conservative foe in battle, fighting defensively and testing his
  opponents before targeting them with channeled positive energy (if they are
  undead) or his necklace of fireballs. Once he has taken the measure of his
  enemy, he fights aggressively with his holy avenger.

  without good reasons.
