DuringCombat: >-
  If Erin panics, he tries to flee to area A3 or area A10, whichever is farther
  from the PCs, and barricades himself in the room. If he has a chance, he'll
  open the doors to areas A11 and A13, or pound on the door leading downstairs
  from area A4 to bring more dangerous foes than him into the fight.
Morale: >-
  If brought below 10 hit points or cornered, Erin drops to his knees and begs
  for mercy. He blames his sinister experimentation on Caizarlu, saying the
  necromancer forced him to take part in several experiments and warning the PCs
  that Caizarlu dwells downstairs. If the PCs seek Caizarlu out, Erin takes the
  first chance he can to flee&#8211;if he escapes, he heads south to Magnimar,
  hoping to lose himself in the big city and, someday, repair and rebuild his
  reputation.
