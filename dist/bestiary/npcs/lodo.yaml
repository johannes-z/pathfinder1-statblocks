  Lodo not only considers the PCs to be intruders, but suspects they killed
  Hunclay. It attacks as soon as someone triggers the trap on the telescope's
  seat, swooping down to bite creatures after it makes a token attempt to use
  its wand of lightning bolt. Lodo pursues PCs throughout the manor.
Morale: Lodo fights to the death.
Gear: wand of lightning bolt (5 charges)
