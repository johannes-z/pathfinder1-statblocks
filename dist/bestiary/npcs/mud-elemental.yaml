  - name: Earth Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A burrowing mud elemental can pass through dirt, gravel, or other loose or
      porous solid matter as easily as a fish swims through water. It cannot use
      this ability to pass through a solid barrier such as a stone or brick
      wall. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create
      any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an
      area containing a burrowing mud elemental flings the elemental back 30
      feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds at a DC 15
      Fortitude save.
  - name: Entrap (Ex)
    description: >-
      The mud from an elemental's entrap ability can be washed away in 1d3
      rounds of immersion in water.
