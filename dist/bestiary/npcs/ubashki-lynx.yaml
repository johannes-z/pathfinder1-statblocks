SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Piercing Howl (Su)
    description: >-
      When an ubashki lynx howls, all creatures except other undead within a
      300-foot spread must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be frightened for 1d4
      rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. Whether or not the save is
      successful, an affected creature is immune to the same ubashki lynx's
      piercing howl for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Ubashki Rot (Su)
    description: >-
      Curse and disease-bite; save Fort DC 16; onset 1 hour; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d6 Str and 1d6 Wis; cure &#8211;. Ubashki rot is both a curse and
      a disease and can only be cured if the curse is first removed, at which
      point the disease can be magically removed. Even after the curse element
      of ubashki rot is lifted, a creature suffering from it cannot recover
      naturally over time. Anyone casting a conjuration (healing) spell on the
      afflicted creature must succeed at a DC 20 caster level check, or the
      spell is wasted and the healing has no effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
