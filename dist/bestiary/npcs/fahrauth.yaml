BeforeCombat: >-
  Fahrauth is typically alerted to the presence of enemies by his minions. He
  often sizes up his opponents remotely using project image. Once he determines
  the nature of the threat, he then bolsters himself by using limited wish to
  recreate a protective spell suitable for his foes.
DuringCombat: >-
  Fahrauth opens combat against living creatures with his breath weapon. If
  space permits, he hovers above his enemies, casting spells between uses of his
  breath weapon. If he's feeling especially confident, he lands near his foes
  and finishes them off with his melee attacks. He sticks close to the gate to
  the Negative Energy Plane to receive constant healing from its emanations.
Morale: >-
  Arrogant and unafraid of dying so close to the gate, Fahrauth fights to the
  death if encountered in his lair.
