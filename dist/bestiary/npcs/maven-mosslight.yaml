SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Corrupting Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      By passing part of its incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard
      action, Maven inflicts 10d6 damage. This damage is not negative energy-it
      manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural
      aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but
      otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A Fortitude
      save (DC 19) halves the damage inflicted.
  - name: Grave Trappings (Su)
    description: >-
      Maven bears a ghostly lantern that sheds an unnerving glow. This light
      functions like a candle of invocation, causing all evil creatures that
      come within 30 feet of Maven to gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls,
      saving throws, and skill checks. Once per day she can use the candle to
      summon 1d4 will-o'-wisps. Maven can interact with the lantern as though it
      were incorporeal. If Maven is destroyed, the lantern is destroyed as well,
      and reforms with her upon rejuvenating.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      If "destroyed" through combat, Maven restores herself in 2d4 days. She can
      only be put to rest if her sunken, fish-eaten remains and the richly
      interred corpse of Lady Sylnia Whitchaste have their places swapped.
  - name: Telekinesis (Su)
    description: >-
      Maven can use telekinesis as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds
      (caster level 12th).
