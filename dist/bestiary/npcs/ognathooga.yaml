SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath of Madness (Su)
    description: >-
      Ognathooga can exhale a cloud of foul-smelling, narcotic breath as a
      standard action once every minute. This black smoke fills a 60-foot cone.
      All creatures in the area take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage and become
      confused for 1d6 rounds (a successful DC 27 Will save halves the Wisdom
      damage and negates the confusion effect). This is a mind-affecting poison
      effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ognathooga starts combat by attempting to dominate one of the PCs while
  herself remaining hidden mostly underwater. If she manages to dominate the PC,
  she uses her control to lure the rest of the party any way she can into the
  waters of the lake, where she then risks losing control of her dominated
  minion by ordering it to attack its allies. She uses demand and other
  spell-like abilities to try to scatter the PCs, so that she can then swim in
  and attack them one at a time. Note that while in the area of effect of the
  abysium reactor, two of her abilities (transdimensional tentacles and warp
  dimensions) do not work-Ognathooga is unlikely to pursue the PCs beyond area
  D6, but if she does, these abilities (detailed in full on page 406 of Rise of
  the Runelords Anniversary Edition) function normally.
Morale: >-
  If brought below 75 hit points, Ognathooga retreats to area D3. If encountered
  there, she fights to the death.
