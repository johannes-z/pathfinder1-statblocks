  Most mornings, Damon casts longstrider on himself to ease the pain the open
  road is beginning to cause his joints. If he expects trouble, he also casts
  cat's grace.

  rushing him, then rains down arrows. He keeps Feargus by his side, and
  switches to his falchion should opponents draw near.

  Damon never flees and he loathes surrender. He does try to parley, however, if
  his enemy is the type of creature that may grant him his life.
