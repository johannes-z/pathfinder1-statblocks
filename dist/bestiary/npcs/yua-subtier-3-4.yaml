SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Corrupting Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      By passing part of her incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard
      action, Yua deals 5d6 points of damage (DC 16 Fortitude half). This damage
      is not negative energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and
      aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are
      immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of
      damage reduction. She typically chooses to deal this damage with her
      katana.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat:
      the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful
      spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently
      destroy Yua is to cremate her body and send her ashes to a resting place
      that her spirit deems acceptable, such as to her family or to the
      Ossuaries of the Fallen in Vigil.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Yua attacks her foes with her spectral katana. If the fight starts to go
  poorly for her, she casts darkness, hoping to force her foes to retreat and
  buy herself time to heal.
Morale: >-
  Trusting in her rejuvenation to restore her to unlife, Yua fights until
  destroyed.
