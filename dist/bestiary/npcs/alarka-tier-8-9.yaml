SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burning Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a creature fails a saving throw and takes fire damage from one of
      Alarka's spells, it catches on fire. This fire deals 1 point of fire
      damage per spell level at the beginning of the burning creature's turn.
      The fire lasts for 1d4 rounds, but it can be extinguished as a move action
      if the creature succeeds at a Reflex save (using the spell's DC). Dousing
      the creature with water as a standard action grants a +2 bonus on this
      save, while immersing the creature in water automatically extinguishes the
      fire. Spells that do not grant a save do not cause a creature to catch on
      fire.
  - name: Firestorm (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Alarka can cause fire to erupt around her. She can
      create eleven 10-foot cubes of fire, arranged in any pattern, but each
      cube must be adjacent to another and one must be adjacent to her. Any
      creature caught in these flames takes 11d6 points of fire damage. A DC 19
      Reflex save halves this damage. The firestorm lasts for 4 rounds. This
      ability can be used once per day.
  - name: Gaze of Flames (Su)
    description: >-
      Alarka can see through fire, fog, and smoke without penalty as long as the
      light is sufficient to allow her to see normally. She can also gaze
      through any source of flame within 10 feet per oracle level, as if using
      clairvoyance. She can use this ability for a number of rounds per day
      equal to her oracle level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.
  - name: Molten Skin (Ex)
    description: Alarka gains resist fire 10.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Alarka has used one of her 3rd-level spells each day to create food and water
  for those trapped in the tomb. Once she hands over the scepter, allowing the
  door to be opened, she casts divine favor, prayer, shield of faith, and bull's
  strength on herself, just in case the PCs betray her. Otherwise, she waits to
  cast these spells, along with divine power, before ambushing the PCs later
  (these are not factored in to her stats).
DuringCombat: >-
  Alarka is a brutal combatant, using her spells and revelations to incinerate
  her foes. She opens with wall of fire to separate the group, before moving on
  to fireball and flame strike to burn and cripple those on her side of the
  wall. She reserves slay living for anyone who dares to challenge her in melee
  combat. She only heals the desert raiders if it proves convenient, preferring
  instead to help them with prayer and the occasional mass cure light wounds.
