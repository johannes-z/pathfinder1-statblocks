SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Guardian of Jandelay (Su)
    description: >-
      The Oliphaunt was created to live in Jandelay, and attempting to remove it
      from the place is almost impossible. The Oliphaunt can prevent a gate or
      similar effect from opening inside Jandelay's borders unless the effect
      was created by an artifact or cast by a mythic character. If brought
      outside Jandelay, the Oliphaunt attempts a Will saving throw each day to
      return. The DC is equal to the DC of the spell that transported it, or the
      DC that spell would have if it allowed a saving throw. The return of the
      Oliphaunt triggers a magical punishment on those that stole it, laying
      waste to people and land. Centered on the point from which the Oliphaunt
      just departed, the ward triggers a mass hold monster spell targeting all
      creatures in a 5-mile radius. Then, that area is affected by an earthquake
      and storm of vengeance that last 1d12 months. While in Jandelay, the
      Oliphaunt's dimensional lock aura extends to protect the entire realm.
  - name: Massive (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Oliphaunt is so enormous in scale that it gains the benefits of a
      kaiju's massive ability (see Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4).
  - name: Ruinous Tusks (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Oliphaunt's gore attacks are treated as adamantine, and any creature
      hit by one is affected by a targeted greater dispel magic spell.
  - name: Ward against Command (Su)
    description: >-
      The Oliphaunt is immune to any mind-affecting spell or effect unless the
      Oliphaunt has line of sight to the caster. Even then, all mind-affecting
      spells and effects gain the language-dependent descriptor. Magical means
      of translation such as tongues do not bypass this restriction.
  - name: Wards of Jandelay (Su)
    description: >-
      Ancient protective magic was bound into the essence of the Oliphaunt. The
      wards give it a +20 deflection bonus to AC, spell resistance 41, and a
      constant freedom effect.
  - name: Weather Sphere (Su)
    description: >-
      The Oliphaunt can continuously change the environment around it, as
      control weather with a 5-mile radius. The Oliphaunt can change the weather
      to that of any season, and the effects manifest 1 round thereafter. If the
      Oliphaunt creates stormy weather, it can call down one lightning bolt per
      round as a free action, as if using call lightning storm.
