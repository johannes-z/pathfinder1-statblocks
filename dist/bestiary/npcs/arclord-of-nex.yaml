  - name: Arcane Architect (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Arclord of Nex can create constructs with the Craft Construct feat in
      only half the time it would normally take. In addition, she can apply the
      Extend Spell and/or Widen Spell metamagic feats to conjuration (creation)
      spells she prepares, even if she doesn't possess those feats. If she does
      possess them, the level increase for applying Extend Spell to a
      conjuration (creation) spell is eliminated, and the level increase for
      applying Widen Spell to a conjuration (creation) spell is reduced to 2.
