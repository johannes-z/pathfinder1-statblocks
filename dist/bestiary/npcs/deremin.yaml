BeforeCombat: >-
  As part of a prayer earlier in the day, Deremin has already cast magic
  vestment on his shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Deremin joins the other pirates, at first casting bless and striking his
  enemies with spells and storm burst. Once melee combat is inevitable, he casts
  divine favor and always maintains an illusory double with copycat. He flanks
  when possible and uses the trip combat maneuver regularly.
Morale: >-
  If Deremin suspects that he is fighting a losing battle&#8211; whether as a
  result of losing multiple scallywags in one round, being attacked in melee by
  multiple assailants, or simply an uncomfortable hunch&#8211;he casts water
  walk and makes a run for the river. If the PCs cannot threaten him from there,
  he pauses to strike with another spell or two before casting invisibility to
  run away.
Gear: >-
  +1 breastplate, heavy steel shield, heavy crossbow with 10 bolts, rapier,
  cloak of resistance +1, pyxes of redirected focusUE, key to area C8, 9 gp
