BeforeCombat: >-
  Before a fight or joust, the aristocrat drinks his potions of bear's endurance
  and bull's strength.
DuringCombat: >-
  The aristocrat opens with a charge. When confronting foes on foot, he stows
  his lance, then attacks with his longsword. Against mounted foes, he wheels
  about and charges so he can use Unseat, repeating this until all his opponents
  are dismounted. If he is unable to hit a well-armored rider, he is not above
  attacking the mount instead.
