BeforeCombat: >-
  To help with her disguise, Melisenn casts undetectable alignment every
  morning. If she is made aware of an imminent attack, Melisenn casts shield of
  faith and fly. If she witnessed the PCs during their investigation of Iris
  Hill using a particular spell frequently, especially a damaging spell or one
  that could hamper or control her, she casts spell immunity, selecting that
  spell.
DuringCombat: >-
  Aware that she is not suited to physical combat, Melisenn prefers to stay out
  of melee range. She lets the byakhee stand toe-to-toe with the PCs. She casts
  hold person on the most obviously dangerous PC, and uses spells such as
  blindness/deafness and hypnotic pattern in order to hinder or reduce the
  number of active combatants. Should the PCs get too close to her in melee
  combat, Melisenn uses fly to keep out of their reach, and she uses her channel
  energy ability liberally to blast her enemies.
Morale: >-
  A fanatic to the end, Melisenn isn't eager to give up all that she's worked
  for. She fights to the death.
