    description: >-
      Othok's advanced age modifies all of his ability scores, and reduces his
      CR by 1.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Othok gives smaller opponents a round to get in close without bothering to
  attempt any attacks of opportunity. He solely uses combat maneuvers even
  though his youthful skills have slipped away, only lashing out with claw and
  fang if his opponents attack with weapons.
Morale: >-
  If pinned, Othok takes his defeat in good humor-no Mireborn has beaten him
  since Shathva defeated him years ago to claim the role of chief and he enjoys
  the fight more than the victory. If opponents attack him maliciously, he
  fights to the death.
