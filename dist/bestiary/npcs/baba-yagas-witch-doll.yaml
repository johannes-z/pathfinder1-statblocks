SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Find Target (Sp)
    description: >-
      A witch-doll golem can unerringly find its linked target, as though guided
      by discern location (CL 15th).
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A witch-doll golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that
      allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells function differently
      against the creature, as noted below. &#8226; A confusion spell slows it
      (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. &#8226; A
      mending spell heals 2d6 hit points."
  - name: Linked Attack (Su)
    description: >-
      When a witch-doll golem successfully establishes a witch-doll link, any
      damage taken by the witch-doll golem from any source other than the linked
      target deals half its damage to the golem and half its damage to the
      linked target as long as the golem and the linked target are within 60
      feet of each other. Only the linked target can successfully attack a
      witch-doll golem and not take "linked damage." Attacks that don't damage a
      witch-doll golem (because of its immunities or its damage reduction)
      likewise deal no damage to the linked target. Attacks that damage the
      linked target do not damage the witch-doll golem (the link it establishes
      is one way). Healing (or repair in the case of the witch-doll golem) is
      not passed through the link. A witch-doll golem cannot attack itself in
      order to damage its linked target.
  - name: Target Focus (Su)
    description: >-
      A witch-doll golem deals an extra 2d10 points of damage with its slam
      attacks against its linked target.
  - name: Target Magic Defense (Ex)
    description: >-
      A witch-doll golem gains a +8 bonus on all saving throws against any spell
      or spell-like ability or effect cast by its linked target (provided the
      effect gets past the golem's immunity to magic). Witch-Doll
  - name: Link (Su)
    description: >-
      With a successful melee attack, a witch-doll golem can establish an
      invisible link between itself and a chosen target. The target must succeed
      at a DC 22 Fortitude save to resist the link. A witch-doll link is broken
      if the witch-doll golem is destroyed or the linked target dies. A
      witch-doll golem can only have one witch-doll link at any given time. The
      save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
