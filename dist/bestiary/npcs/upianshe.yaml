SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Enduring Pride (Su)
    description: >-
      Upianshe can expend 1 point from her arcane pool as a swift action to
      manifest a spectral version of her sword, Teralindar's Honor (a +2
      aberration-bane bastard sword, see page 35). The sword exists for 1 minute
      and deals damage as though she had used her corrupting touch ability;
      however, she applies the sword's enhancement bonus, special property, and
      expanded critical threat range to her attacks. She also benefits from any
      feats and special abilities as if she were using a bastard sword. The
      sword otherwise behaves as a natural weapon that cannot be disarmed.
  - name: Spiritual Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      This functions as a ghost's rejuvenation ability, but once she's
      "destroyed," her violent despair subsides, and her starting attitude
      toward most creatures becomes indifferent. Her hatred of all life returns
      after 2d4 days, after which the PCs must defeat her again in order to
      secure her cooperation.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: Upianshe casts shield and fire shield (chill).
DuringCombat: >-
  Upianshe activates her enduring pride magus arcana and dives into melee
  combat. There she lashes out with her spectral sword and uses her spells to
  batter secondary targets or disable threats.
Gear: >-
  ghost touch bracers of armor +4, spellbook (contains all prepared spells plus
  baleful polymorph, cone of cold, daylight, elemental touch, enlarge person,
  fireball, greater invisibility, ice storm, long arm, ray of exhaustion,
  shocking grasp, slow, stoneskin, and web)
