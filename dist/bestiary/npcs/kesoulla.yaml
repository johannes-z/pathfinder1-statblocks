BeforeCombat: >-
  Kesoulla keeps magic vestment on her armor and shield at all times. If alerted
  by the symbol of scrying in area B6, she also casts entropic shield, freedom
  of movement, and true seeing. These effects are reflected in her stat block.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kesoulla puts up a wind wall to prevent ranged attacks against herself, then
  pounds the party with ranged spells. She uses blade barrier if she can
  effectively split up the party. Otherwise, she continues to use ranged spells
  as long as possible. When forced into melee, Kesoulla uses greater command
  (flee) and grace to slip away. (Remember that characters who reenter the area
  need to make the save against forbiddance again.) When other choices are
  exhausted, she casts divine power, then fights defensively.
Morale: >-
  Once her guards are slain and it's clear she is going to lose the fight,
  Kesoulla tries to grab the chest filled with sigil wafers and flee out the
  back exit. Once she reaches the surface, she quaffs her potion of invisibility
  and flees using air walk. If the PCs withdraw from the room even briefly, she
  takes the opportunity to grab the sigil wafers and flee.
Gear: potion of invisibility, scroll of blade barrier, scroll of cure serious wounds
OtherGear: >-
  mwk breastplate, mwk light steel shield, +1 bastard sword, cloak of resistance
  +1, headband of inspired wisdom +2

BaseStatistics: >-
  If Kesoulla is not alerted by the symbol of scrying in area B6, there is no
  miss chance to hit her with ranged attacks and she lacks true seeing and
  freedom of movement. Without magic vestment, her statistics are AC 18, touch
  11, flat-footed 17.
