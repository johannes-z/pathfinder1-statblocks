SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Wrenching Spasms (Su)
    description: >-
      When an Abyss gigas hits an opponent with its bite attack, the opponent
      must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or be overcome by wrenching spasms
      that wrack its body. These spasms cause the victim to be nauseated,
      dealing 1d6 points of damage to its Strength and Dexterity due to the
      painful contortion of bones, muscles, and limbs. The spasms continue for
      1d6 hours, or until the victim is healed with heal, regenerate, or greater
      restoration. The effects of this ability do not stack with multiple hits,
      but once a creature has recovered from or been cured of the effect, it can
      be affected again. Once a creature has succeeded at a saving throw against
      this effect, it cannot be affected by the wrenching spasms from that
      particular gigas for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
