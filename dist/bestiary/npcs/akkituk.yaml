BeforeCombat: >-
  Akkituk casts barkskin, bear's endurance, and shield of faith before combat
  (already included in her stat block).
DuringCombat: >-
  Akkituk does not try to engage in melee against the PCs; she lets her minions
  do that while she casts water walk and makes a fighting retreat to area D4.
  She casts her spells as she goes, pausing to summon monsters whenever she
  feels she can safely do so without one of the PCs catching up to her. If she
  reaches the statue of the ape demon, she uses her stone salve to waken it.
Morale: >-
  Akkituk is sure of her rewards from Angazhan if she dies fighting hairless
  infidels&#8211;she fights to the death as a result.

  potion of cure light wounds, potion of cure serious wounds, wand of silence
