SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When a dark stalker is slain, its body combusts in a flash of white-hot
      flame. This acts like a fireball that deals 3d6 points of fire damage to
      all creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst. A DC 14 Reflex save halves
      this damage. The dark stalker's gear and treasure are unaffected by this
      explosion. This save is Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      Dark stalkers are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally
      poisoning themselves. Dark stalkers use black smear poison on their
      weapons and generally carry 6 doses on them. Black Smear-injury; save Fort
      DC 14; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save. The
      poison DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: See in Darkness (Su)
    description: >-
      A dark stalker can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including that
      created by deeper darkness.
BeforeCombat: >-
  When the PCs enter, the guardian casts shield of faith and applies poison to
  both of his swords. When the PCs begin to climb the stairs or ascend by other
  means, the guardian casts deeper darkness to shroud the tower in darkness,
  then casts silence on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  In battle, the dark guardian attempts to stay in darkness to utilize his sneak
  attack, channeling negative energy if he becomes surrounded by foes. If the
  majority of the PCs make it out of the darkened portion of the room, he scales
  the walls and casts deeper darkness on the other landing as well, dismissing
  silence as needed to cast spells later in battle.
Morale: >-
  The dark guardian never retreats except to heal under cover of darkness in
  order to sneak attack again, and fights to the death to eradicate all who dare
  violate his sacred site.
Gear: >-
  potion of inflict serious wounds, wand of inflict moderate wounds (16
  charges), black smear (6)
OtherGear: +1 leather armor, 2 short swords, silver holy symbol, 85 gp
