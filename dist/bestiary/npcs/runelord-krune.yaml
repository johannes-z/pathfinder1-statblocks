SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Contingency (Su)
    description: >-
      Krune used a wish to cast contingency before entering stasis. If Krune is
      ever affected by a spell effect that would impede his ability to teleport,
      that spell effect is targeted by dispel magic (CL 17th).
  - name: Exceptional Stats (Ex)
    description: >-
      Krune is an exceptionally talented wizard and a prodigy of rune magic. As
      a result, his ability scores were generated using 25 points, rather than
      using the standard 15 point buy used to create most NPCs. Krune also has
      far more wealth than an NPC of his level would normally have. These
      modifications increase his total CR by 2. Inherent Bonuses: Krune has used
      wish spells to increase his stats. He has a +3 inherent bonus to his
      Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma ability scores.
  - name: Permanent Spells (Sp)
    description: >-
      Krune has made the following spells permanent on himself: arcane sight,
      darkvision, and see invisibility. Runelord's
  - name: Dominion (Su)
    description: >-
      One of Krune's most powerful tattoos was granted to him directly by
      Lissala and grants him control over others' runes. As a swift action,
      Krune can subtly alter the Thassilonian runes on one creature or
      10-foot-square area that he can sense with his runesight ability. He may
      instead alter any number or runes that he can sense as a standard action.
      An altered rune that would normally grant a bonus to attacks, damage,
      ability checks, skill checks, ability scores, or saving throws instead
      inflicts an equal penalty to the same statistics. (See Runelord's
      Dominion, below.) Thassilonian runes that provide other beneficial effects
      are altered to provide the opposite effect, per GM discretion. This is a
      curse effect (Will DC 25 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Runes of Power (Su)
    description: >-
      The mystic runes that cover Krune's body are foci for powerful arcane
      enhancements. These include a rune of armor that hardens his flesh and
      grants him a +6 bonus to natural armor; a rune of alacrity that grants him
      a +4 dodge bonus to AC and a +4 insight bonus to Initiative checks; a rune
      of defense that grants him a +5 deflection bonus to AC and a +5 resistance
      bonus to saving throws; a rune of control that grants a +3 competence
      bonus on attack rolls with Krune's dragon-tooth longspear and protects him
      from any creature he conjures as if he were protected by protection from
      evil, except it protects against all such creatures regardless of
      alignment or subtype; and 3 runes of life that grant him an additional 40
      hit points each. These are already factored into his stats; see Weakening
      Krune on page 18 for disabling these benefits.
  - name: Runesight (Su)
    description: >-
      Several of the runes on Krune's body allow him to sense the presence of
      all other Thassilonian runes within 60 feet, just as if he possessed the
      blindsense ability.
  - name: Runic Ability Bonuses (Su)
    description: >-
      Some of Krune's mystic runes contain powerful magic that augments his
      ability scores, providing a +6 enhancement bonus to his Intelligence,
      Wisdom, and Charisma ability scores.
ProhibitedSchools: evocation, illusion
BeforeCombat: >-
  Krune cast mage armor before entering hibernation, and the spell's duration
  was maintained by his sanctum's energy. This spell's effects are already
  incorporated into his stats.
DuringCombat: >-
  Krune combines quickened spells, summoning spells, and defensive spells and
  abilities to grant himself a tactical advantage before using his most potent
  offensive spells. He divides up his enemies with conjured creatures and wall
  of stone, and does not hesitate to cast cloudkill in close quarters. If he
  feels overwhelmed, he uses phase door or another movement ability to move to a
  different part of his sanctum, cast more spells to augment his combat
  abilities, and summon a small army.
Morale: >-
  Krune does not surrender or retreat; he simply teleports to other parts of his
  sanctum to recuperate and launch another offensive. He fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  boots of speed, Krune's rune-carved rod, wand of acid arrow (CL 9th, 23
  charges), wand of summon monster III (12 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  Krune's dragon-tooth spear, belt of physical perfection +4, pearl of power
  (8th), periapt of proof against poison, ring of freedom of movement, ring of
  spell turning, diamond and granite dust (1,000 gp), spell component pouch
