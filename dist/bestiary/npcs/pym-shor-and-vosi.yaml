  Initially, the sprites snipe at the PCs while hiding in the trees. After
  firing, they can attempt another Stealth check at a &#8211;20 penalty to stay
  hidden. If anyone closes on their position, the sprites forgo further attacks
  until they can silently relocate to another tree. Any sprite spotted by the
  PCs fights defensively to protect itself, drawing the PCs' attention so its
  companions can sneak up behind the PCs and catch their enemies in a color
  spray. They take turns with this tactic to blind, stun, and knock out as many
  targets as possible, then rain arrows infused with numbing cold on those who
  remain.
Morale: >-
  If the sprites are faced with fire-based attacks or the PCs manage to slay the
  majority of them, the remaining sprites flee, seeking out Fawfein (at area E)
  or Izoze (at area H4) for protection. They cast dancing lights once more to
  mask their retreat, sending the lights in different directions as they dim
  their own luminosity in the hope of leading pursuers astray.
