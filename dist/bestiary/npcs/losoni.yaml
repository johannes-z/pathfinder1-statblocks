SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Clonal Tree Stride (Su)
    description: >-
      Rather than being bonded to a single tree, Losoni is bonded to the entire
      clonal colony of titan aspen that supports the Court of Spears. Because
      the titan aspen is a single organism, Losoni can use his tree stride
      spell-like ability to enter one trunk of the titan aspen, teleport to
      another trunk in the colony, and emerge from the new trunk, all as a move
      action rather than as a full-round action.
