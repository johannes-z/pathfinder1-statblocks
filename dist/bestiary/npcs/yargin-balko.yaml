DuringCombat: >-
  Yargin prefers to use his wand of acid splash in combat, but since he needs to
  roll at least a 12 to activate it with a Use Magic Device check, it
  occasionally fails-each time it does, he erupts into a loud burst of profanity
  and shakes the wand in frustration. Once he fails to use the wand a third
  time, he gives up and switches to thrown vials of acid or his crossbow. He is
  deathly afraid of melee combat, and fights with his dagger only if cornered.
Morale: >-
  Once he has used up his acid and his wand has failed him three times (or as
  soon as he takes any melee damage at all), Yargin shrieks in panic and
  attempts to flee to Gaedren's side to warn him. That he might inadvertently
  lead Gaedren's enemies right to him doesn't cross his mind in his panicked
  state.
Gear: wand of acid splash (28 charges), acid (3), thunderstone
OtherGear: >-
  leather armor, dagger, light crossbow with 10 bolts, brass key (unlocks all
  doors in the fishery), iron key (unlocks the cabinet in area A7), garnet
  amulet worth 100 gp
