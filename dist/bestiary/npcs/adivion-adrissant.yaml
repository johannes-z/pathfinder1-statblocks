SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gallowspire Fast Healing (Su)
    description: >-
      As long as Adivion is within 500 feet of Gallowspire, the tower
      continually infuses him with negative energy, granting him fast healing
      20. Adivion loses this ability if death ward or protection from evil is
      cast on him, blocking the effect. Although a forsaken lich is normally
      destroyed automatically in 1d10 days, Adivion's Gallowspire fast healing
      renews and replenishes the arcane energies that power him, allowing him to
      survive indefinitely as long as this ability is in effect. If Adivion is
      reduced to 0 hit points, the effects of fast healing end immediately.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Adivion casts stoneskin, mirror image, and true seeing, and uses his arcane
  pool to add the icy burst and shocking burst properties to his staff of
  shrieking. Just before the PCs reach him, he casts fire shield (chill shield).
DuringCombat: >-
  Adivion activates his hasted assault magus arcana as a swift action on the
  first round of combat, renewing it as needed later, and casts maximized chain
  lightning (using his maximized magic magus arcana). Thereafter he attacks
  opponents with both his staff and spells using his spell combat ability.
  Adivion uses a swift action each round to direct his soul lash, unless it
  makes better tactical sense to spend that action on another ability, in which
  case he takes the damage from the soul lash. He uses improved spell recall to
  cast disintegrate at powerful foes that continue to harass him, and attempts
  to maneuver near spellcasters to make use of his counterstrike ability.
Morale: >-
  Bound to Gallowspire and burning with arcane energies, Adivion fights until
  destroyed.
Gear: scroll of mind blank
OtherGear: >-
  +3 mithral chain shirt, staff of shrieking*, belt of physical might +2
  (Strength and Dexterity), bone beads (see page 35), cloak of resistance +3,
  headband of alluring charisma +4, scarlet and blue sphere ioun stone, ring of
  protection +4, diamond dust worth 500 gp, spell component pouch, spellbook
  (contains all prepared spells plus disintegrate and additional spells of your
  choice)
