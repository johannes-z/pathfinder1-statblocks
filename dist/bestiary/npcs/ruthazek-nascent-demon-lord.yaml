SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Abyssal Roar (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, Ruthazek can unleash a
      thunderous roar. This blast of unholy sound fills a 90-foot radius burst
      centered on Ruthazek. Demons within this area (including Ruthazek) are
      healed of 6d6 points of damage. All other creatures in the area take 20d6
      points of sonic damage and are staggered and deafened for 1 round. A DC 36
      Reflex save halves the sonic damage and negates the staggered and deafened
      effects. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Aura of Rage (Su)
    description: >-
      Ruthazek exudes an aura of jungle madness that has different effects on
      allies or enemies within 60 feet of the nascent demon lord. Any creature
      within this area must make a DC 28 Will save each round to avoid being
      overwhelmed with rage for 1 round. While under the effects of this aura of
      rage, a creature can take no action other than to physically attack the
      closest creature-spellcasting, the use of supernatural abilities, and any
      other act other than assault with a melee or ranged weapon is not
      possible; the creature also gains a +4 unholy bonus on all damage done
      with weapons and is immune to further mind-affecting effects other than
      the aura of rage. If Ruthazek is aware of an ally in this area, he can
      reflexively alter the effects of his aura of rage for that creature so
      that the aura instead grants a +4 unholy bonus to Strength and
      Constitution. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. Nascent Demon Lord Traits A nascent demon lord is a
      powerful demon that has not yet made the full transition from unique demon
      to full demon lord of an Abyssal realm. Their traits are summarized here.
      &#8226; Immunity to death effects, electricity, charm and compulsion
      effects, and poison. &#8226; Resistance to acid 30, cold 30, and fire 30.
      &#8226;
  - name: Summon (Sp)
    description: >-
      Nascent demon lords can summon any demon or combination of demons whose
      total combined CR is 20 or lower once per day. This ability always works,
      and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell. &#8226; Telepathy 300 ft. &#8226;
      A nascent demon lord's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
      are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of resolving damage
      reduction. &#8226; Nascent demon lords can grant spells to their
      worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on the
      nascent demon lord's behalf. All nascent demon lords grant access to the
      domains of Chaos and Evil&#8211;in addition, they grant access to two
      other domains and a favored weapon that vary according to the nascent
      demon lords' themes and interests.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ruthazek never enters combat without a small army of demons at his side; he
  prefers to fight alongside nalfeshnees, vrocks, and glabrezus, in a
  combination that equals a CR 20 threat&#8211;usually, these are demons he's
  conjured with his ability to summon demons. If he can, he summons demonic aid
  several rounds before he fears a fight is imminent. Otherwise, it is his first
  action in combat. Once he has allies, Ruthazek opens with a roar, then moves
  so that his aura of rage can affect as many targets as possible. Ruthazek
  tends to rely upon his spell-like abilities in combat until enemies move up to
  him, at which point he makes full attacks with his weapons. His hatred of
  goodaligned divine spellcasters is exceeded only by his loathing of worshipers
  of Angazhan&#8211;faced with a choice, he attacks these foes to the exclusion
  of others unless faced with an obviously overwhelming danger.
Morale: >-
  Ruthazek flees combat if reduced to fewer than 100 hit points by teleporting
  to safety&#8211;he only fights to the death if confronted in Usaro, his deep
  Mwangi lair.
