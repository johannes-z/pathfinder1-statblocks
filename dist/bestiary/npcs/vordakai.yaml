SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Atrophied Lich (Ex)
    description: >-
      A lich that remains immobile and insensible for extended periods of time
      (as Vordakai did after he was imprisoned in his tomb just prior to
      Earthfall 10,000 years ago) can grow atrophied. The exact effects of
      atrophy vary from lich to lich. In Vordakai's case, his effective wizard
      level has declined from 20th to 9th. Note that these are not negative
      levels-Vordakai must earn back the lost XP normally. More troubling to the
      lich is the fact that until he achieves at least 11th level as a lich, his
      phylactery is unusable&#8211;if he is destroyed, he crumbles to dust,
      forever dead.
Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: evocation, transmutation
BeforeCombat: >-
  Before engaging in combat, Vordakai casts false life, mage armor, and tongues
  on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vordakai casts quickened shield on the first round of combat (adjust his AC
  down by 4 if the PCs attack him before he acts as a result) and activates the
  oculus's true seeing as he casts waves of fatigue against the largest group of
  foes. He trusts to his damage reduction to protect him from most damage, using
  his spells and channeling negative energy in melee. He resorts to his touch
  attack against foes who seem to be able to hurt him easily. When he's reduced
  to fewer than 60 hit points, he uses dimension door to retreat to area W19,
  whereupon he uses his touch and negative energy to heal all of his damage,
  then uses dimension door to return to this room to begin the fight anew.
Morale: >-
  Vordakai is not willing to abandon his lair to intruders&#8211; as a result,
  he does not flee from combat in this chamber, and it is here that his ultimate
  fate shall be decided.
Gear: >-
  cloak of resistance +3, headband of mental prowess (+2 Int, +2 Cha, grants
  ranks in Knowledge [planes]), oculus of Abaddon, ring of protection +2, soul
  jar, phylactery (worth 3,500 gp if sold as an art object but worth
  considerably more to Vordakai)
