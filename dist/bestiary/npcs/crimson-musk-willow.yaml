SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A crimson musk willow can suck blood from a helpless, willing, or grappled
      living victim by making a successful grapple check. If it pins its foe, it
      drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. On each round it
      drains blood, the crimson musk willow gains 5 temporary hit points that
      last for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to
      its full normal hit points).
  - name: Create Crimson Musk Vampire (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a crimson musk willow can bore dozens of tendrils
      into the brain of a helpless creature within reach, such as a creature
      entranced by its pollen. This attack deals 1d4 points of Intelligence
      damage per round. When a creature is reduced to an Intelligence score of
      0, it dies, and the tendrils break off inside its brain. One hour later,
      the creature animates as a crimson musk vampire (see below). A creature
      killed by a crimson musk willow's blood drain ability also rises as a
      crimson musk vampire.
  - name: Pollen Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a crimson musk willow can spray a cloud of pollen at
      a single creature within 30 feet. It must make a ranged touch attack (+4
      bonus) to strike the target, which must then succeed at a DC 14 Will save
      or be entranced for 1d6 rounds. An entranced creature can take no action
      other than to move at its normal speed into a space within the crimson
      musk willow's reach, at which point an entranced creature remains
      motionless and allows the willow to insert tendrils into its brain. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
