SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      If the negative energy elemental is killed, it explodes in a flash of
      swirling negative energy that affects all within a 50-foot radius. Living
      creatures within the area take 8d8 points of negative energy damage
      (Reflex DC 22 for half ). Negative energy-based creatures and undead gain
      hit points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have
      otherwise dealt (see Negative Energy Attacks regarding temporary hit
      points and doubling hit points). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Negative Energy Attacks (Ex)
    description: >-
      The elemental's slam attacks are infused with negative energy. This deals
      extra damage to a living target but heals undead (and other negative
      energy-based creatures) by the same amount. Undead and negative energy
      creatures can be healed up to their normal hit point total, gaining extra
      hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1
      minute later. Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points must make
      a DC 22 Fortitude save or explode in a burst of negative energy (no damage
      to others). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Negative Energy Burst (Su)
    description: >-
      A negative energy elemental can channel negative energy in a 30-foot
      radius as a 17th-level cleric. The elemental can use this ability a number
      of times per day equal to its Constitution modifier. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
