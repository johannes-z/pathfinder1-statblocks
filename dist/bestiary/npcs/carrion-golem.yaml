    description: >-
      This functions as the stench ability, but causes affected creatures to be
      nauseated rather than sickened.
  - name: Immune to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A carrion golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. &#8226; Gentle repose
      causes a carrion golem to become stiff and helpless for 1d4 rounds if it
      fails a Will save against the spell. &#8226; Animate dead causes the
      various parts of the golem's body to shudder and tear, dealing 1d6 points
      of damage per caster level to the golem (no save). &#8226; Any magical
      attack that deals cold or fire damage slows a carrion golem (as the slow
      spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save). &#8226; Any magical attack that deals
      electricity damage hastes a carrion golem (as the haste spell) for 2d6
      rounds.
  - name: Plague Carrier (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a carrion golem is created, its creator infects it with a specific
      disease. The carrion golem can then infect those it strikes with its slams
      with this disease-most carrion golems inflict filth fever. The save DC is
      Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. Filth Fever:
      Slam&#8211;injury; save Fortitude DC 14; onset 1d3 days; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d3 Dex damage and 1d3 Str damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
