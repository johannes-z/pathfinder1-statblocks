SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      Unlike a standard imp, Benabak's change shape ability allows him to take
      the form of a bat instead of a boar or giant spider.
  - name: Infernal Jinx (Su)
    description: >-
      Benabak has developed the ability to curse other creatures with ill luck.
      As a standard action, he can jinx a creature within 30 feet who fails a DC
      13 Will save. A jinxed creature takes a -2 penalty on its next d20 roll.
      The effects of the jinx wear off after 1 minute. A creature that succeeds
      on the saving throw is immune to Benabak's infernal jinx for 24 hours. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.

    description: >-
      Sting-injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2
      Dex; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based, and includes a +2
      racial bonus.
