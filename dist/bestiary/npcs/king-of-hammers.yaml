SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Deafening Scream (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, the King can release a
      supernatural scream in a 30- foot cone. All creatures in this area take
      3d6 points of sonic damage and are deafened for 1d6 minutes. A successful
      DC 18 Fortitude save halves this damage and reduces the deafened duration
      to 1 round. The saving throw is Constitution-based.
  - name: Tower of Foes (Su)
    description: >-
      Any time the King confirms a critical hit with his hammer attack on an
      opponent deafened by his scream, the target must succeed at a DC 16
      Fortitude save or be transformed into an inanimate block of stone. A
      transformed creature may attempt a new saving throw each round as a
      full-round action, with a +1 bonus for each previous failed saving throw.
      The saving throw is Charisma-based.
