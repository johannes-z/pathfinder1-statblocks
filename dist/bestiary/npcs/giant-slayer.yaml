DuringCombat: >-
  The barbarian switches from a one-handed to a two-handed grip on his axe as
  the situation demands. He uses his shield against multiple foes but keeps his
  bow in hand if in melee against a lone enemy. He uses his rolling dodge before
  exposing himself to missiles, especially giant-hurled boulders, and assumes
  his guarded stance in melee. He charges with Spring Attack to get close to his
  enemies, following it up with full attacks.
