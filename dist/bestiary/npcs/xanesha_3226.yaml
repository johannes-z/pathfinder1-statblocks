BeforeCombat: >-
  If she realizes the PCs are near (as is the case if the faceless stalkers drop
  a bell), Xanesha casts invisibility and mirror image on herself. She also
  activates her Sihedron medallion's false life ability.
DuringCombat: >-
  Xanesha uses major image to make an illusory flying demon appear in a cloud of
  smoke that then begins to circle the top of the tower. She then moves to make
  a sneak attack on the nearest PC. After this attack, she prefers to fight in
  melee, saving her medusa mask to temporarily petrify any particularly
  dangerous foe. If she is reduced to fewer than 60 hit points, she casts cure
  serious wounds on herself.
Morale: >-
  If she's reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, Xanesha attempts to flee Magnimar,
  abandoning her plot and the scroll hidden in her nest. Simply slithering off
  the side of the tower and using feather fall to descend to the ground below is
  her easiest method of escape. If she escapes, she cuts ties with her kin and
  Mokmurian, afraid of the punishment for failure. She grows obsessed with the
  PCs, however, seeing their capture as the only way she can redeem herself to
  Mokmurian&#8211;in this case, she becomes a recurring villain who might ally
  with any number of foes the PCs find themselves up against in the next
  adventure&#8211;although she specifically tries to avoid any situation that
  would reveal her failure to her sister Lucrecia.
