SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dream Web (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dream spider has the web ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 305) but its
      webs carry an iridescent hue, making them easy to notice (Perception DC
      15). Any animal, humanoid, or monstrous humanoid that comes in contact
      with these webs experiences strange hallucinations, taking 1d6 points of
      Wisdom damage per round of contact. A DC 21 Fortitude save negates this
      damage. If the webs of a dream spider are burned, they create a spread of
      poisonous gas in a 10-foot radius. This gas deals 1d8 points of Wisdom
      damage to all creatures in the area (not just to those susceptible to
      contact with webs as listed above). A DC 21 Fortitude save halves this
      damage. The cloud of colorful vapor remains for only a single round before
      dissipating harmlessly. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 21; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; initial
      effect 1d3 Wis; secondary effect 1d3 Wis and paralysis for 2d6 hours; cure
      1 save.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Nightmare Dancer's tremorsense ability allows it to sense if anything
  brushes against its webs in the entire plaza, effectively extending the length
  of this ability for those purposes. If it notices any intruders, it
  immediately clambers out of its pit to attack&#8211;it ignores vegepygmies
  completely unless they attack it, in which case it fights them as well. The
  giant spider pursues foes anywhere in this district, but not beyond its
  borders.
