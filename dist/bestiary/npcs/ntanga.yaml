Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ntanga pretends to be a simple animal so potential enemies do not consider him
  a significant threat.
DuringCombat: >-
  If Kingstone is present, Ntanga pretends to wait until his "master" orders him
  to fight. He makes use of his climbing and Mobility to find an advantageous
  position in a battle, using his necklace of fireballs if facing many foes or
  if he needs to end combat quickly to maintain his cover.
Morale: >-
  If Ntanga is brought to 10 hit points or fewer, his behavior depends on what
  his opponents know. If they believe him to be just an animal, he flees or
  prostrates himself before them. If they know he is intelligent, he flees or
  tries to bargain for his life.
Gear: necklace of fireballs (type I; two 3d6 beads remaining)
