SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      As long as the quickwood retains energy it has absorbed from a spell (see
      spell absorption), it can release that energy as a swift action to create
      a fear aura with a radius of 10 feet per level of the spell it absorbed
      and released. All creatures in this aura must make a DC 24 Will save or
      become panicked. The fear aura lasts until the end of the quickwood's next
      turn. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Oaksight (Su)
    description: >-
      A quickwood may observe the area surrounding any oak tree within 360 feet
      as if using clairaudience/ clairvoyance. It can use this ability on any
      number of oak trees in the area. Although the quickwood does not need line
      of sight to establish this link, if it does have line of sight to even a
      single oak tree, it cannot be flanked.
  - name: Roots (Ex)
    description: >-
      A quickwood has dozens of long roots, but can only attack with up to six
      of them in any given round. If the quickwood uses its pull ability to pull
      a target within reach of its bite attack, it can immediately make a free
      bite attack with a +4 bonus on its attack roll against that target.
  - name: Spell Absorption (Su)
    description: >-
      If a quickwood's spell resistance protects it from being affected by a
      spell, the quickwood absorbs that spell's energy into its body. It can
      then release this energy to create a fear aura (see above). The quickwood
      cannot absorb another spell's energy while it contains a previously
      absorbed spell's energy. As long as a quickwood is storing spell energy,
      attempts to overcome its spell resistance receive a +5 bonus on the roll.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Tree That Weeps already has a 5th-level spell stored in its body from a
  previous fight, and unleashes its energy on the first round of combat to
  create a fear aura once foes come within 40 feet of it. It then uses its roots
  to attack foes and pull them close so it can bite them.
