    description: >-
      All creatures within a 30-foot radius must attempt a DC 14 Fortitude save
      once per round, and each round the DC of this saving throw increases by 1.
      A creature that fails its saving throw takes 1d4 nonlethal damage and is
      fatigued, as if affected by heat stroke (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook
      444). A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to that
      desiccated mummy's desert wind aura for 24 hours. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  When Shirin loses control of the mummy, it lurches upright, effortlessly tears
  its way out of its shroud, and activated its desert wind ability. The
  desiccated mummy isn't very intelligent, but it tries to prioritize attacking
  targets fatigued by its aura. It otherwise attacks a nearby target.
Morale: The desiccated mummy fights until destroyed.
