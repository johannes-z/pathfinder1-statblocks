SpecialAbilities:
  - name: s Dagger (Su)
    description: >-
      The dagger wielded by a guardian doll is treated as a masterwork weapon
      and deals 1d6 points of cold damage in addition to its normal damage.
      Those struck by the dagger must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be
      paralyzed by the supernatural cold of the weapon for 1d4 rounds. If the
      guardian doll is destroyed, its weapon becomes a useless child's toy. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Soul Focus (Su)
    description: >-
      Thora's soul is bound within the doll's gemstone eye. As long as this soul
      focus remains intact, it can be used to animate another doll, using the
      same cost as creating a new construct. Once bound into the soul focus, the
      soul continues to learn. If it is put into a new doll body, the soul
      retains its personality and memories from its previous bodies. A soul
      focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break DC of 20. Susceptible to
      Mind-Affecting
  - name: Effects (Ex)
    description: >-
      Like a soulbound doll, a guardian doll is susceptible to mind-affecting
      effects. However, because of the singular purpose with which it is imbued,
      its saves against such effects are made with a +1 racial bonus.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Thora casts levitate to rise into the air so she can more safely cast spells,
  using charm person to create allies to prevent others from attacking her. If
  forced into melee combat, she casts frostfall and then attacks with her doll's
  dagger, hoping to catch paralyzed opponents in the supernaturally chilled area
  of the spell.
Morale: Thora fights until destroyed.
