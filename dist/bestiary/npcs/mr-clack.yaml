      or natural attack takes 1d6 points of piercing damage from the

      Mr. Clack takes 2d6 points of piercing damage per round the grapple is
      maintained.
DuringCombat: >-
  Mr. Clack attacks anyone it notices approaching its den. Note that anyone who
  climbs down into the sinkhole (or, for that matter, bumps the edge of the
  railing) is in reach of the eurypterid's sting attack. With its tremorsense,
  Mr. Clack can lash out through the hole at anyone in or adjacent to area D9a.
Morale: Mr. Clack is too big to pursue foes out of it den. It fights to the death.
