DuringCombat: >-
  A boggard subchief rages at the start of combat and uses his terrifying croak
  (more to raise an alarm than in hopes of frightening the PCs), then enters
  combat in melee. The subchief only makes ranged attacks with throwing axes if
  it seems apparent that the boggard can't engage any foe in hand-to-hand
  combat.
Morale: A boggard subchief fights to the death.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds
OtherGear: masterwork hide armor, +1 greataxe, throwing axes (3), 141 gp
