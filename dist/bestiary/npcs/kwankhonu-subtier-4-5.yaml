SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Braggart (Ex)
    description: >-
      The cavalier can spend a standard action to extol his own accomplishments
      and battle prowess. He receives Dazzling Display as a bonus feat. He does
      not need a weapon in hand to use this ability. The cavalier receives a +2
      morale bonus on melee attack rolls made against demoralized targets.
      Cavalier's
  - name: Charge (Ex)
    description: >-
      The cavalier receives a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls on a charge while
      mounted (instead of the normal +2). In addition, the cavalier does not
      take any penalty to his AC after making a charge attack while mounted.
  - name: Challenge (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, the cavalier chooses one target within sight to
      challenge. The cavalier's melee attacks deal extra damage whenever the
      attacks are made against the target of his challenge. This extra damage is
      equal to the cavalier's level. In addition, whenever an order of the
      cockatrice cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +2 morale bonus on
      all melee damage rolls made against the target of his challenge as long as
      he is the only creature threatening the target (not counting his mount).
  - name: Tactician (Ex)
    description: >-
      At 1st level, a cavalier receives a teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must
      meet the prerequisites for this feat. As a standard action, the cavalier
      can grant this feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him.
      Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for
      every two levels the cavalier possesses. Allies do not need to meet the
      prerequisites of these bonus feats. Precise Strike Whenever you and an
      ally who also has this feat are flanking the same the creature, you deal
      an additional 1d6 points of precision damage with each successful melee
      attack. This bonus damage stacks with other sources of precision damage,
      such as sneak attack. This bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical
      hit.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Before leading his force into the village, Kwankhonu uses his tactician
  ability, giving himself and his allies the Precise Strike feat. This deducts 1
  round from the ability's duration, but allows all the tengus to begin combat
  with it.
DuringCombat: >-
  Depending on how many of his bandit soldiers made it into battle with him,
  Kwankhonu tries to get into flanking positions with his allies, using Dazzling
  Display to demoralize the PCs. He uses Ride-By Attack to charge in and out of
  combat, striking at opponents flanked by his minions or charging at
  individuals. If his mobility becomes limited, he closes with an opponent
  (preferably one who is flanked) and attacks with his blade and bite,
  challenging any PC he ends up fighting alone.
Morale: Kwankhonu's pride won't allow him to retreat, and so he fights to the death.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds, potion of cure moderate wounds
