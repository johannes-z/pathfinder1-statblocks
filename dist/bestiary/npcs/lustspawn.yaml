SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Martial Proficiency (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sinspawn are proficient in all simple and martial weapons, armor, and
      shields (except tower shields). Sin-Scent (Su) Sinspawn can smell the
      presence of creatures whose nature reflects the sinspawn's sin. For
      example, lustspawn can scent creatures that are especially desirous or
      lustful, at the GM's discretion.
  - name: Sinful Bite (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature bitten by a lustspawn is overwhelmed with lust (DC 14 Will save
      negates). These unfettered impulses and emotions are so powerful that the
      target becomes sickened for 1d6 minutes. An affected target that is bitten
      a second time is staggered if it fails its saving throw. Additional failed
      saves increase the duration of this effect but do not increase its
      severity. Calm emotions, remove curse, or break enchantment negates the
      effects of sinful bite. The save DC is Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  Against a single foe, the lustspawn tries to take its enemy alive, bringing
  its victim back to the House of Lust to have its way with it before feeding on
  the still-living victim. Against multiple enemies, the lustspawn focuses its
  attacks on the character with the highest Charisma. Once an enemy falls, the
  lustspawn must make a DC 15 Will save or it immediately begins to feed on its
  fallen victim, automatically inflicting bite damage every round and ignoring
  other opponents for 1d4 rounds.
Morale: >-
  The lustspawn flees back to the House of Lust if reduced to fewer than 8 hit
  points. If cornered there, it fights to the death.
