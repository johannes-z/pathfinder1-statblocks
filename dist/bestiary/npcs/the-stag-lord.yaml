BeforeCombat: >-
  The Stag Lord is in a perpetual state of hangover or drunkenness, and as a
  result he is sickened&#8211;his stats have been adjusted to reflect this (and
  as a result, his CR is 1 lower than normal). If he sobers up, these stats
  effectively gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving
  throws, skill checks, and ability checks.
DuringCombat: >-
  When attacking with his bow, the Stag Lord usually employs his Deadly Aim feat
  (included in his stats). He prefers to fight with his bow if possible,
  favoring attacks on foes who are flat-footed, using the insightful shot
  ability of his stag's helm or taking time to move into hiding and use Stealth
  to set up new shots so that he can make sneak attacks. In melee, he shifts and
  moves to flank foes if possible. Humans are his favorite targets, for in many
  of them he sees the face of his father. He drinks potions to heal damage if
  reduced below 20 hit points.
Morale: The Stag Lord fights to the death.
