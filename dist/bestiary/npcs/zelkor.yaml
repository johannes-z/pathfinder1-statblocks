SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoids slain by a spectre become spectres themselves in 1d4 rounds.
      Spawn so created are less powerful than typical spectres, and suffer a -2
      penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, receive -2 hp per HD, and only drain
      one level on a touch. Spawn are under the command of the spectre that
      created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose
      their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and freewilled spectres.
      They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
  - name: Magic Jar (Su)
    description: >-
      A gift from Orcus on converting to evil, Zelkor was given the ability to
      magic jar as per the spell at will as a supernatural ability. The high
      priests of Orcus from the lower temple gave Zelkor the peridot gem that he
      uses as the receptacle for the spell. Using his magic jar ability is a
      full round action. The room is designed so that anyone within the room is
      within the range of the magic jar spell.
  - name: Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)
    description: >-
      A raise dead or similar spell cast on a spectre destroys it (Will
      negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material
      component.
  - name: Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)
    description: >-
      Spectres are powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell)
      and flee from it. A spectre caught in sunlight cannot attack and is
      staggered.
  - name: Turn Resistance (Su)
    description: >-
      An additional effect from the gift of Orcus increases Zelkor's turn
      resistance to +6.
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Animals, whether wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of
      a spectre at a distance of 30 ft. They do not willingly approach nearer
      than that and panic if forced to do so unless a master succeeds at a DC 25
      Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. A panicked animal remains so
      as long as it is within 30 feet of the spectre.
