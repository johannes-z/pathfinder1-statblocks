SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Suffocation (Su)
    description: >-
      Agmazar's alien presence breaks down the atmosphere around it, causing the
      air to become thin and nearly unbreathable. Within 1 mile of Agmazar,
      breathing creatures are subject to fatigue and altitude sickness as if at
      high peak altitude (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 430). Creatures within 60
      feet of Agmazar must hold their breath or begin to suffocate (Core
      Rulebook 445).
  - name: Channel Negative Energy (Su)
    description: >-
      Agmazar can channel negative energy as a 20th-level evil cleric. This
      ability requires no divine focus.
  - name: Creaturesense (Ex)
    description: >-
      Agmazar has lifesense up to 120 feet. In addition, it can sense the
      presence and position of undead creatures within 1,200 feet as if it had
      blindsense.
  - name: Force Field (Su)
    description: >-
      Agmazar is surrounded by a field of force that grants it a deflection
      bonus to AC equal to its Charisma bonus and resistance 30 against force
      effects. Its natural weapons are treated as force effects for dealing
      damage to incorporeal or ethereal targets. The first time each round
      Agmazar is targeted with a ranged attack, there's a 75% chance that attack
      is deflected by the force field, with a 50% chance of it being reflected
      back upon its originator and a 50% chance of it being deflected toward a
      random creature within 60 feet of Agmazar (or deflected harmlessly if no
      creature is within this range). This deflected attack uses the same attack
      roll result, caster level, and save DC as the original attack.
  - name: Gravitic Control (Su)
    description: >-
      Agmazar can radically alter the effect of gravity, bending or even
      inverting gravity to suit its will. As a standard action, it can alter
      gravity for 2d6 rounds, choosing one of five effects (with effective
      caster level 20). Only one type of gravitic control can be in effect at a
      time. Involuntary movement forced by gravitic control doesn't provoke
      attacks of opportunity. Agmazar and its serpent arms are immune to its
      gravitic control, except for gravitic deceleration. The save DCs are
      Charisma-based. &#8226; Gravitic Acceleration: This ability functions as
      telekinesis (CMB +35, Will DC 40). &#8226; Gravitic Attraction: This
      ability functions as repulsion but in reverse; any creature that fails its
      saving throw (Will DC 40) can't move away from Agmazar. Each round it
      doesn't spend a move action resisting the attraction, it is pulled 1d6 x 5
      feet toward Agmazar. &#8226; Gravitic Deceleration: All creatures within
      30 feet are affected as by feather fall. Flying creatures in this radius
      move at half speed, and a creature making a ranged weapon attack targeting
      a creature in the radius takes a -2 penalty on the attack roll. &#8226;
      Gravitic Inversion: This ability functions as reverse gravity (Reflex DC
      40), but Agmazar can concentrate on the spell. Each round it continues to
      do so, the radius of the effect doubles. &#8226; Gravitic Repulsion: This
      ability functions as repulsion, but a creature that fails its saving throw
      (Will DC 40) not only can't move toward Agmazar, but is also pushed 1d6 x
      5 feet away from the kaiju each round it doesn't spend a move action
      resisting the gravitic repulsion.
  - name: Powerful Blows (Ex)
    description: >-
      Agmazar adds 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus on damage rolls with slam
      attacks.
  - name: Serpent Arms (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, Agmazar can detach and release one or two of the
      lower arms from its body, revealing that the joints buried into its torso
      are alien serpent heads. The arms move and fight independently as hollow
      serpents (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 149), beginning on the round they're
      detached. For each arm it detaches, Agmazar takes 25 points of damage that
      can't be reduced. When a hollow serpent uses channel negative energy or a
      spell-like ability, it counts against Agmazar's uses of that ability.
      While its arms are detached, Agmazar's fast healing is reduced by 10 for
      each missing arm, and it can make slam attacks only with the arms still
      attached. If a hollow serpent is destroyed while separated, Agmazar can
      regrow its missing arm in 1 hour. Reattaching one or both lower arms is a
      full-round action and restores Agmazar's fast healing to the normal rate
      (though does not regain the hit points lost from detaching).
