BeforeCombat: >-
  The sentries take no special preparations while guarding the doors, but they
  drink their potions of bull's strength if they expect trouble (not reflected
  in these statistics).
DuringCombat: >-
  If these sentries catch anyone attempting to sneak in or start a fight, they
  try to incapacitate the interlopers with Stunning Fist and flurry of blows.
  The sentries might imprison incapacitated troublemakers in area L10 for a few
  days for questioning. If the sentries meet with serious opposition, they
  attempt to flank foes together and use their Improved trip and Vicious Stomp
  feats to kill rather than incapacitate.

  Any sentry reduced below 20 hit points decides that the pay isn't worth it and
  flees.
