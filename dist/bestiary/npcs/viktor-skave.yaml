DuringCombat: >-
  Viktor prefers to use his sacred weapon enhancement bonus to give his flail
  the flaming weapon special ability against foes. He tries to use the confined
  space to his advantage, and relies on his fervor ability to cast spells on
  himself as swift actions. Against enemies reliant on a single weapon, Viktor
  attempts to sunder their weapons, but he combines Power Attack and Cleave when
  facing multiple opponents.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, Viktor is willing to negotiate a
  surrender as long as his companions remain standing. If his allies are slain,
  however, Viktor fights to the death to avenge them.
Gear: potion of haste
