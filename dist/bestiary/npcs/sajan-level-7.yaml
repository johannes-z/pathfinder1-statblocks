  Sajan uses fast movement and Acrobatics to get into a strategic location in
  combat, and uses a combination of Combat Reflexes and flurry of blows to deal
  as much damage as possible to his targets. He employs combat maneuvers when
  it's strategically advantageous&#8211;grappling spellcasters and tripping foes
  with his temple sword when his allies flank them. Against a particularly
  powerful single enemy, he utilizes Stunning Fist to take the combatant out of
  commission.
