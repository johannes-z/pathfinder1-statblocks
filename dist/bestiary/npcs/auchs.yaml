DuringCombat: >-
  Auchs is singularly unimaginative in battle, roaring wordlessly and wielding
  his club in both hands.
Morale: >-
  Auchs fights to the death if Dovan is visible, but otherwise surrenders and
  begs for his life if brought below 5 hp. If granted mercy, Auchs becomes the
  loyal companion of whoever "saved him," but his natural tendency toward
  cruelty might make for later problems.

  leather armor, club, knight and dragon toys worth 45 gp in all, silver Stag
