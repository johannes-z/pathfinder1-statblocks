BeforeCombat: The Sisters drink their potions of blur before combat ensues.
DuringCombat: >-
  The monks work together, attacking as a single group flanking one or two
  opponents if the opportunity presents itself. They attempt to push enemies
  into the pit in area C9 using their Punishing Kick feat, or make flurry of
  blows attacks, using their nunchaku to disarm opponents. If fighting on the
  Lattice (area C9), the monks use their superior acrobatics skills to maneuver
  around and outflank foes. The Sisters think nothing of leaping the 10 feet
  between the iron bars.
Morale: >-
  Devoted followers of Munasukaru, the Sisters of the Broken Path do not
  surrender, defending their living god to the death. When a monk reaches 10 hit
  points or fewer, she screams an oath to Munasukaru's glory and commits seppuku
  (ritual suicide by performing a self-inflicted coup de grace with her dagger).
Gear: potion of blur
OtherGear: >-
  daggers (4), masterwork nunchaku, amulet of natural armor +1, bracers of armor
  +2, 100 gp worth of jeweled studs for piercings
