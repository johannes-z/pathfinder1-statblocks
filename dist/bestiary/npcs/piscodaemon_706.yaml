    description: >-
      Tentacles-injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect
      1d2 Con plus staggered for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves.
DuringCombat: >-
  The piscodaemon attacks well-armored foes in preference to spellcasters, for
  it knows that making a melee fighter staggered with its poison is more
  crippling than the same effect applied to a spellcaster&#8211;it trusts its
  spell resistance and other defenses to protect it from most magical attacks.
  If reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, the daemon casts stinking cloud on
  itself&#8211;it's immune to the spell's poison effect and hopes to slow down
  its attackers with this tactic. (Note that since this piscodaemon is itself
  summoned, it cannot use its own summon ability.)
Morale: The piscodaemon fights to the death.
