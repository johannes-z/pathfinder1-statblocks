BeforeCombat: >-
  If Bjorn has a chance to show off his prowess before the fight starts, he uses
  his Dazzling Display feat to cow enemies. His relative inexperience with
  battle magic means that he avoids reliance on spellcasters, though he is
  willing to accept beneficial spells if the opportunity presents itself. If he
  expects to be outnumbered or fighting a powerful opponent, he drinks his
  potion of bull's strength in preparation for battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  Wielding the prince's axe, Bjorn relies on his rage and Power Attack feat to
  maximize damage. He likes to sunder enemy weapons, and uses his Step Up and
  Disruptive feats to press the attack against lightly armored enemies and
  spellcasters.
Morale: >-
  Bjorn believes that he has a destiny to fulfill. As such, he does not waste
  his time with fights that do not serve his cause, nor with battles he cannot
  win. If Bjorn is reduced to 20 or fewer hit points, he retreats. He also
  retreats from an obviously superior foe. If he is convinced that he is working
  toward the destruction of the sorcerer, he is implacable and will seek any
  advantage.
