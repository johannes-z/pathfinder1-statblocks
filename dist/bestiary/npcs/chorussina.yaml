SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Damned (Ex)
    description: >-
      If Chorussina dies, her soul travels to Deskari-a successful DC 20 caster
      level check is required to bring her back to life.
  - name: Demonic Mark (Ex)
    description: >-
      Deskari's rune marks the back of Chorussina's neck; she can use this mark
      once per day as she casts a spell to not expend that spell as it is
      cast&#8211;doing so gives the chaotic and evil descriptors to the spell.
  - name: Energumen (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Chorussina can open her soul to a form of demonic possession
      for 3 rounds, during which time she gains a +2 profane bonus to an ability
      score of her choice. After these rounds expire, she becomes confused for 3
      rounds as the spirit then revels in full control of her body; she can
      attempt a successful 25 Will save to end the confusion at the start of
      each round as a free action.
Gender: Female
ProhibitedSchools: divination, necromancy
DuringCombat: >-
  As soon as combat begins, Chorussina quits focusing on the ritual, retreats to
  a corner, and casts wall of force to protect her from the PCs. While her
  minions attack the PCs, she takes the time to cast fire shield, displacement,
  bear's endurance, cat's grace, false life, mirror image, mage armor, and
  shield on herself. She uses energumen to gain a +2 bonus to her Constitution,
  then dismisses the wall of force to attack. The effects of these spells and
  her energumen are precalculated into the stats above. Once she attacks, she
  casts her offensive spells on the PCs while her energumen lasts, then
  continues casting unless she become confused.
Morale: Chorussina fights to the death.
Gear: scroll of dimension door, scroll of dispel magic
