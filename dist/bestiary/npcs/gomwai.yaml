  - name: Backing of the Golden League (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because of his connection to the Golden League crime syndicate, Gomwai has
      significantly more wealth than an average NPC of his level, raising his CR
      by 1.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Prior to combat, Wu Jufeng casts greater heroism (CL 13) on Gomwai, the
  effects of which have already been included in his stats. If Gomwai has had
  the chance to observe the PCs' past rounds and knows they are likely to hit
  him often, the hobgoblin drinks his potion of barkskin prior to entering the
  battlefield (not included in his stats).
DuringCombat: >-
  Gomwai directs his allies to flank, and coordinates their attacks on a single
  opponent until that foe is unconscious, using a combination of combat
  maneuvers, nonlethal damage, and stunning fist to debilitate foes. The
  hobgoblin prefers to eliminate foes in the following order: healers, arcane
  casters, ranged combatants, melee combatants.
Morale: >-
  Knowing this is the final round of the Ruby Phoenix Tournament, and that the
  Golden League's chance of dominance rests with him, Gomwai fights to the
  death.

  potion of barkskin (CL 9th; +4 natural armor bonus), potion of cure serious
  wounds, potion of fly
