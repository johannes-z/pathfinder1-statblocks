    description: >-
      The horror tree's branches are encrusted with a virulent fungus that grows
      rapidly when in contact with blood, sending filaments ripping through the
      bodies of any living creatures damaged by its slams and dealing 1d6 points
      of Dexterity damage in the process. A creature brought to 0 Dexterity by
      this effect is slain.
DuringCombat: >-
  The horror tree has an uncanny knack for sensing druids, rangers, gnomes, and
  other creatures with ties to the natural world. It targets these foes over
  others. The horror tree pursues foes as long as they remain in sight but does
  not pursue enemies into the cabin (though if foes remain in reach, it does
  strike at them through open doors and windows).
Morale: The horror tree fights until destroyed.
