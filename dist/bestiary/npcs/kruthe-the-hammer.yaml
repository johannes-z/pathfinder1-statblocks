    description: >-
      Like all ogrekin, Kruthe is deformed. His right wrist ends in an ugly,
      fleshy lump of cartilage and bone from which protrude two hook-like spurs,
      giving his hand the appearance of a claw hammer. This hand cannot wield
      weapons or shields, but the misshapen club grants him a natural weapon
      that deals 1d8 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage on a successful
      hit. Kruthe gains a +2 bonus on attempts to grapple, trip, and disarm foes
      with this claw.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Kruthe is loud and unimaginative but still deadly in combat, prone to calling
  out his targets as he attacks them with crude and simpleminded threats, like
  "Die you dumb metal person!" when fighting an armored warrior, or "You go
  squish now on Kruthe's hammer, little girly!" when facing an unarmored
  sorcerer.
Morale: >-
  Kruthe sees this battle as another chance to impress Chammady, and fights to
  the death as a result.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds (2)
OtherGear: >-
  +2 spiked banded mail; +1 warhammer; shrunken head pouch with 13 gp, 25 sp,
  and a cracked ruby worth 800 gp
