BeforeCombat: Erylium becomes invisible as soon as she hears enemies approaching.
DuringCombat: >-
  Although tough to hit and capable of healing  from wounds quickly, Erylium
  remains something of a coward in a fight. She uses flight to maintain ranged
  superiority over foes, using spells like summon monster or hold person (aimed
  at the best-armored of her foes) in the first few rounds of combat. She uses
  her Tiny +1 cold iron returning dagger against foes once she runs out of
  spells, but if cornered, she fights with her claws and bite.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 5 hit points or fewer, Erylium becomes invisible and flees,
  waiting for her fast healing to fix her up before returning here to attack the
  PCs again.
OtherGear: >-
  +1 cold iron returning dagger, tiara worth 50 gp, black silk gown worth 25 gp,
  obsidian unholy symbol of Lamashtu worth 10 gp
