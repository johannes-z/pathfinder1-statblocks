BeforeCombat: >-
  The Eel drinks extracts of darkvision, false life, and resurgent
  transformation every day. Before planting his bombs on the pirate lords' ships
  (see Event 8), he drinks his greater mutagen, followed by extracts of fluid
  form, cat's grace, expeditious retreat, freedom of movement, protection from
  energy (fire), see invisibility, shield, and spider climb.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Eel drinks an extract of greater invisibility on the first round of
  combat, using spider climb and his ring of jumping to leap and scamper from
  one wall to another as he fights. While invisible, he hurls explosive or
  dispelling bombs at his opponents, enhancing his throws with bomber's eye or
  true strike, if given time. If his invisibility expires or proves ineffective,
  the Eel drinks extracts of displacement and nondetection to further hide his
  position. If cornered, he activates his armor's elemental aura and drinks an
  extract of elemental touch (acid) to better defend himself. If still
  surrounded when his armor's aura expires, the Eel drinks an extract of
  detonate.
Morale: >-
  If the Eel is reduced to fewer than 39 hit points, his resurgent
  transformation activates, and he drinks an extract or potion of cure serious
  wounds to further restore himself. If his resurgent transformation expires, or
  he is reduced to fewer than 25 hit points, the Eel drinks an extract of fly
  and attempts to flee elsewhere on the island until he can escape. If unable to
  flee, the Eel fights to the bitter end.

  serious wounds, potion of water breathing, greater mutagen (+6 Con, +4 Dex),
