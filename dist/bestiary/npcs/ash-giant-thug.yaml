DuringCombat: >-
  The ash giant rages at the start of combat, then moves to engage in melee. He
  has no rocks available in this room to throw at foes.
Morale: >-
  The ash giant fights to the death unless the charm monster effect placed on
  him by the lamia matriarch is dispelled, in which case he swiftly volunteers
  to aid the PCs in murdering his ex-mistress. The ash giant is good for his
  word as an ally until Ursathella is slain, at which point he turns on the PCs
  in an attempt to kill them as well. Without the false courage granted by charm
  monster, the ash giant flees combat if reduced to fewer than 40 hit points.
