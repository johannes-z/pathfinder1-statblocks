  - name: Psychotic (Ex)
    description: >-
      Dawnbark suffers from psychosis (GameMastery Guide 251), changing her
      alignment to chaotic evil and granting her a +10 competence bonus on Bluff
      checks to hide her insanity.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Dawnbark focuses on one opponent at a time, but quickly switches to any foe
  that uses fire attacks against her. She uses her animated trees to block
  opponents' escape from the clearing and to attack spellcasters and others who
  stay out of melee combat.
Morale: Unless cured of her madness, Dawnbark fights to the death.
