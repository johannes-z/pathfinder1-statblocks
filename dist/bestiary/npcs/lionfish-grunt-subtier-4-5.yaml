BeforeCombat: >-
  If the grunts in the warehouse are given time to prepare for a fight against
  intruders, they get into tactical positions around the warehouse, hiding
  around corners and using their thunderstones, smokesticks, and potions of
  invisibility to disorient opponents and gain sneak attacks against them on the
  first round.
DuringCombat: >-
  In addition to flanking and making sneak attacks whenever possible, the guards
  use the boxes of cargo as weapons, pushing them onto unsuspecting PCs from the
  other side of the makeshift barriers (see the Subtier 1&#8211;2 tactics).
Morale: >-
  Being the lowliest of Alejia's crew members, the warehouse grunts have no wish
  to die for their cause, and surrender when brought to 5 hit points or fewer,
  or when the last one standing is brought to fewer than 8 hit points.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure light wounds, potion of invisibility, smokestick, tanglefoot
  bag, thunderstone
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork studded leather, light crossbow with 10 bolts, masterwork cutlass,
  masterwork thieves' tools, 45 gp
