SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Brain Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      Andrexiel can take a standard action to violently probe the mind of a
      single intelligent enemy within 100 feet. The target receives a Will save
      to negate the effect and immediately knows the source of this harmful
      mental prying. Those who fail this save are wracked with pain, taking 1d4
      points of damage per oracle level. After successfully attacking with this
      ability, Andrexiel may use a full-round action to sort through the jumble
      of stolen thoughts and memories to make a single Knowledge check using the
      victim's skill bonus. The randomly stolen thoughts remain in her mind for
      a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier. Treat the knowledge
      gained as if she had used detect thoughts. This is a mind-affecting
      effect.
  - name: Light Fortification (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on Andrexiel, there is a 25%
      chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is
      instead rolled normally.
