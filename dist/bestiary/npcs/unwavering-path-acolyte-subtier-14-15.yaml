SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Crystalline Dust Form (Su)
    description: >-
      An axiomite can shift between its solid body and one made of golden,
      crystalline dust as a free action once per round. In dust form, the
      axiomite looks like a shifting mass of glowing mathematical symbols and
      equations. In this form it can fly and gains the incorporeal quality; it
      can use spell-like abilities but cannot make physical attacks. In its
      solid form, an axiomite cannot fly. Both shapes are the axiomite's true
      form, and it does not revert to a different form if killed. A true seeing
      spell reveals both forms simultaneously.
  - name: Summon Inevitable (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day, four axiomites can join hands to summon a single zelekhut
      inevitable with 100% chance of success as a full-round action.
  - name: Unwavering Blade (Su)
    description: >-
      Any weapon an Unwavering Path acolyte wields (including its longspear) is
      treated as a +1 axiomatic weapon in addition to its other qualities.
      Weapons retain this quality for 1 round after the axiomite releases the
      weapon.
