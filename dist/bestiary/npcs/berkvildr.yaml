  Berkvildr casts barkskin at the first sign of trouble, and resist energy if
  she witnesses opponents using energy-based attacks. While the cold riders
  engage foes in melee, Berkvildr casts spells like burst of nettles, call
  lightning, entangle, and stone call. Before wading into melee combat, she
  casts bull's strength and magic fang,  and prepares to deliver a touch spell
  such as poison before rending foes with her claws and Power Attack.
Morale: Berkvildr flees when reduced to fewer than 30 hit points.
