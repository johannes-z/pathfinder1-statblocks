Source: Undead Revisited
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Channel Destruction (Su)
    description: >-
      Any weapon Lictor Shokneir wields deals an additional +3d6 points of
      damage on a successful hit.
  - name: Devastating Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, Lictor Shokneir may unleash a 30-foot cone of
      destructive force. This blast deals 10d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC
      22 half ).
  - name: Phantom Mount (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per hour, Lictor Shokneir can summon a skeletal horse similar to a
      phantom steed (CL 15th). This mount is more real than a typical phantom
      steed, and can carry one additional rider. If the mount is destroyed, it
      can be summoned again with full hit points 1 hour later.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      One day after Lictor Shokneir is destroyed, his armor begins to rebuild
      his body. This process takes 1d10 days-if the body is destroyed before
      that time passes, the armor merely starts the process anew. After this
      time has elapsed, Lictor Shokneir wakens fully healed.
  - name: Sacrilegious Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Lictor Shokneir constantly exudes an aura of intense evil and negative
      energy in a 30- foot radius. This aura functions as desecrate, which the
      graveknight constantly gains the benefits of (these benefits are included
      in the stats above). In addition, this miasma of fell energies hinders the
      channeling of positive energy. Any creature that attempts to use positive
      energy in this area&#8211; such as through a cleric's channel energy
      ability, a paladin's lay on hands, or any spell with the healing
      descriptor&#8211;must make a DC 25 caster level check or the attempt to
      use positive energy fails.
  - name: Undead Mastery (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Lictor Shokneir can attempt to bend any undead
      creature within 50 feet to its will. The targeted undead must make a DC 22
      Will save or fall under the graveknight's control. This control is
      permanent for unintelligent undead. An undead with an Intelligence score
      is allowed an additional save every day to break free from Lictor
      Shokneir's control. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected
      again by Lictor Shokneir's undead mastery for 24 hours. Lictor Shokneir
      can control up to 75 Hit Dice worth of undead creatures at a time. If he
      exceeds this number, he loses control over some of his minions, as per the
      spell animate dead.
