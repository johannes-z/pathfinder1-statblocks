  - name: Hole (Su)
    description: >-
      When a kikimora chooses a house to inhabit, she can create an
      extradimensional space by scrawling a sigil on a wall, baseboard,
      cupboard, or semipermanent object (like a stove). This sigil serves as the
      entrance to the kikimora's tiny domain, where she can live within the
      house without being detected. Only the kikimora can enter this hidey-hole.
      Anytime after designating a hidey-hole, the kikimora can transport herself
      and up to 50 pounds of objects to the hidey-hole as a standard action, as
      long as she is in the same room as the sigil. The kikimora can exit the
      hidey-hole in the same way, appearing in the closest empty square to the
      sigil. Any objects left within the hidey-hole remain there when the
      kikimora exits the space, even if she removes the sigil and places it in
      another location. While inside the hidey-hole, the kikimora can see what
      is going on outside of the space through a special sensor, as if the
      kikimora were standing where her sigil is placed. As a result, mundane
      objects placed in front of the sigil can block the kikimora's sight from
      the hidey-hole. Zorka has scrawled her sigil in rooms throughout the
      Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga, allowing her to enter and exit her hidey-hole
      from any of the Dancing Hut's configurations. In effect, Zorka has access
      to every room within the Dancing Hut, even those rooms currently
      inaccessible because of the hut's physical location. Because multiple
      sigils provide access to Zorka's hidey-hole, removing one of the sigils
      has no effect on the hidey-hole or any creatures inside it unless all of
      the sigils within the Dancing Hut are removed.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Zorka tries to avoid combat if at all possible, but she uses her spell-like
  abilities to hinder her attackers until she can safely flee, targeting
  opponents with deep slumber or pain strike. She casts break on their weapons,
  and uses major image to create the illusion of a more fearsome enemy for foes
  to face.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, Zorka flees to her hidey-hole, casting
  summon swarm to cover her retreat.
