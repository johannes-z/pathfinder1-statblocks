      The Shade's exposure to specialized nanites has granted her the following
      benefits: +6 natural armor bonus, +6 Dex, +6 Con, fast healing 10, and
      darkvision 120 ft. This increases her CR by 1.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  The Shade uses inspire courage to bolster herself and her champions at the
  start of any fight. If the PCs intervene, the Shade casts greater invisibility
  on herself, following that up with haste and dance of a hundred cuts so she
  can move about quickly, hitting foes with her monowhip while never remaining
  in one place for long. She always uses Arcane Strike to augment her attacks
  with her monowhip. She casts healing magic on herself whenever she's reduced
  to 80 hit points or fewer.
Morale: >-
  The Shade uses dimension door to escape combat if reduced to hit points or
  fewer, then flees back to the Technic League compound. If she escapes,
  increase the PCs' Notoriety by 10.
