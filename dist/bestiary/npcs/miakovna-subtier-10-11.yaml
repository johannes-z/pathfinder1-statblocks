SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A lamia matriarch drains 1d4 points of Wisdom each time she hits with her
      melee touch attack. The first time each round that she strikes a foe with
      a melee weapon, she also drains 1 point of Wisdom. A DC 22 Will save
      negates the Wisdom drain. Unlike with other kinds of ability drain
      attacks, a lamia matriarch does not heal damage when she uses her Wisdom
      drain. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: Arcane
BeforeCombat: >-
  Miakovna casts mage armor daily. As soon as she is warned by one of her alarm
  spells going off, she casts invisibility and slithers up to the top of the
  northeastern pillar. She then casts the following spells in order: stoneskin,
  shield of faith, bull's strength, eagle's splendor, blur, extended divine
  favor, and extended haste. If she hears the PCs attempting to enter the
  chamber before she is prepared, she creates a major image as described above
  and continues preparing, using her ventriloquism spell-like ability to throw
  her voice elsewhere in the room as she casts spells, and recasting major image
  as needed to keep the distraction going.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once all her spells are in place, she casts quickened mirror image and then
  targets the PCs with debilitating spells from atop the statue. When she feels
  they have been sufficiently softened, she draws her whip and drops down to
  attack with both weapons, using the whip to trip opponents at range while
  slashing at closer foes with her scimitar. She stays in melee until she loses
  50 or more hit points, at which point she recasts invisibility and slithers
  around the room to hide her position while healing and recasting protective
  spells. When faced with one particularly overpowering foe, Miakovna uses charm
  monster or suggestion to get the PC to leave combat.
Morale: >-
  When reduced to 30 or fewer hit points, Miakovna attempts to flee, swimming
  straight across the pool and racing up through the levels of the temple
  complex. As soon as she is out of sight of the PCs, she uses change shape,
  hoping that if the PCs catch her in this form, they'll assume it is another
  distraction and leave her.
Gear: potion of protection from energy (fire)
