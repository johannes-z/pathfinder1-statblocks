SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Destructive Attacks (Ex)
    description: >-
      An abrikandilu's natural attacks can threaten and confirm critical hits
      against objects. In addition, they gain a +5 racial bonus on Strength
      checks made to break or destroy objects.
  - name: Mutilation (Su)
    description: >-
      An abrikandilu's bite causes hideous, ugly wounds that not only mar beauty
      but supernaturally diminish a creature's sense of self-worth. A creature
      bitten by an abrikandilu must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or gain a
      -1 penalty on all Charisma-based checks. This penalty can stack as high as
      a -5 penalty with multiple bites and failed saves. This lasts even after
      the wounds are healed; the penalty decreases by 1 point every 24 hours.
      This is a curse effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Hatred of Mirrors (Ex)
    description: >-
      An abrikandilu loathes the sight of its own reflection. Using a mirror
      grants a +5 bonus on Intimidate checks against an abrikandilu. An
      abrikandilu adjacent to a mirror or attacked by a mirror-carrying creature
      (at the GM's discretion, some shields could be considered mirrors) must
      attempt a DC 15 Will save at the start of its turn. If it fails, it must
      focus all of its actions that round on attempts to destroy the mirror.
BeforeCombat: >-
  One berserker noisily begins breaking apart the control panels as the other
  one inspects its surroundings.
DuringCombat: >-
  The abrikandilu berserker on the platform takes cover behind the control panel
  and continues to damage it, redirecting its attacks to nearby enemies. The
  other abrikandilu defends the stairs, throwing hunks of rubble and metal at
  distant foes. The demons delight in breaking smaller weapons, wands, and
  potions.
Morale: >-
  After decades of stasis, the demons are itching for a chance to destroy
  something. They fight to the death.
Land: 1
BaseStatistics: >-
  When not raging, the abrikandilu demon's statistics are AC 17, touch 12,
  flat-footed 15; hp 63; Fort +8, Will +5; Melee bite +12 (1d6+4 plus
  mutilation), 2 claws +12 (1d4+4); Str 19, Con 12; CMB +12, CMD 24; Skills
