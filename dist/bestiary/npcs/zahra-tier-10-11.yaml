SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Psychosis (Ex)
    description: >-
      Zahra is afflicted with the psychosis insanity, shifting her alignment
      from neutral good to chaotic evil and granting her a +10 bonus on Bluff
      checks to hide her insanity.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  When the secret door to area 4d opens, Zahra prepares for intruders by casting
  heroism, cat's grace and haste, in that order. If she has time, she also casts
  heroism and displacement on Moukadeem. Once she has buffed herself and the
  marid, she casts greater invisibility.
DuringCombat: >-
  One the first round of combat, Zahra uses her bladethirst bardic performance
  to give her scorpion whip an additional +1 enhancement bonus and the shock
  special property. She acts as support for Moukadeem, using her whip from a
  distance, either to deal direct damage or to trip and disarm those attacking
  him outright, and buffing his defenses as much as she can with her spells.
  Whenever possible, Zahra uses her Arcane Strike feat to boost her damage
  output with her whip.
Morale: >-
  If cured of her insanity during combat, Zahra immediately joins the PCs in
  defeating Moukadeem. If she remains insane and Moukadeem falls in battle, she
  flies into a rage, casting no more spells, and making full attacks each round.
  While afflicted by psychosis, Zahra fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  +2 chainmail, +2 scorpion whip, ioun stone (pink and green sphere), ring of
  protection +2, wayfinder, journal (written in Aquan)
