BeforeCombat: >-
  Eynemb casts mirror image on himself and uses his shadow puppets ability to
  summon a shadowy fiendish giant spider (DC 15 Will save to treat as 20% real;
  see page 17) before interrupting the play.
DuringCombat: >-
  While letting his giant spider do the fighting, Eynemb casts cause fear and
  lesser confusion on those PCs who seem like obvious fighters. He summons
  another giant spider when the first one is destroyed, and he otherwise tries
  to use the nearby rocks as cover from the PCs. He also calls the PCs the "true
  puppets" of the wayangs and their "silly ritual."
Morale: >-
  Eynemb surrenders if reduced to 6 or fewer hit points, calling off his shadows
  in the process. It's unlikely the PCs have time to properly interrogate him,
  as after 3 rounds of combat, the ritual disruption creates a more pressing
  concern (see encounter B2).
