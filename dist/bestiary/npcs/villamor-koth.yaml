BeforeCombat: Before any fight, Villamor drinks a potion of barkskin.
DuringCombat: >-
  Villamor takes his time jousting and is eager to toy with the PCs in an
  attempt to humiliate and hurt them&#8211;especially if they're doing well in
  the competition and look like they have a good chance at winning. He figures
  that if he can egg their jousting contestant into attacking him, he can kill
  that PC in self-defense without getting in too much trouble. He does not
  attempt to unseat a PC contestant, but instead makes actual attacks against
  his opponent with his lance on each pass. Note that each time a character
  takes damage while riding, she must make a DC 5 Ride check to remain in the
  saddle&#8211;it's certainly possible this tactic could unseat a particularly
  inept rider. To observers, of course, Villamor's tactics are easily mistaken
  for overly aggressive attempts to unseat a rider&#8211;the crowd certainly
  loves the violence. If he's properly unseated by a PC, Villamor swallows his
  pride for now and nurtures the thought of revenge&#8211;he's one of Irovetti's
  closest allies, after all, and knows that the king plans to go to war.
Morale: >-
  Villamor does not fight to the death at this time; if the PCs respond to his
  goading by attacking, he'll "defend" himself (and attempt to kill the
  attacking PC), but if all the PCs start to gang up on him, or if he's reduced
  to fewer than 150 hit points, he breaks off his attack and Irovetti steps in
  to try to calm things down. If the PCs continue to attack, Irovetti uses
  dimension door to escape back to the Royal Pavilion with Villamor and
  announces that the Rushlight Festival is cancelled due to unwarranted
  aggression on a visitor's behalf. He gives the PCs an hour to leave Pitax
  before he attempts to have them arrested as criminals; in any event, this
  development gives him a handy, if flimsy, excuse to go to war with the PCs.
  Certainly the PCs aren't thought of kindly by the other competitors and
  attendants at the festival, for they see the PCs as the ones responsible for
  the tournament's cancellation in this case. See Part Two for more information
  on how the war develops.
