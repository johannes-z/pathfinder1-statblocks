SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Despair (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures within a 30-foot radius that see Naphthra-Tep must make a DC
      19 Will save or be paralyzed by fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the
      save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by his despair
      ability for 24 hours. This is a paralysis and a mind-affecting fear
      affect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Mummy Rot (Su)
    description: >-
      Curse and disease-slam; save Fort DC 19; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha; cure -. Mummy rot is both a curse and disease
      and can only be cured if the curse is first removed, at which point the
      disease can be magically removed. Even after the curse element of mummy
      rot is lifted, a creature suffering from it cannot recover naturally over
      time. Anyone casting a conjuration (healing) spell on the afflicted
      creature must succeed on a DC 20 caster level check, or the spell is
      wasted and the healing has no effect. Anyone who dies from mummy rot turns
      to dust and cannot be raised without a resurrection or greater magic. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
