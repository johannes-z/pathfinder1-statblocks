SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Transformation (Ex)
    description: >-
      If reduced to 0 hit points, Kazavon immediately transforms into his
      draconic form, destroying his armor in the process. The transformation
      takes place quickly and fully heals him, but leaves Kazavon staggered for
      2d4 rounds.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Kazavon relies on his spells for ranged combat and, if he can, generally takes
  a few rounds at the start of a battle to cast mirror image and shield. He
  doesn't bother with haste unless he's fighting alongside allies. If reduced to
  200 hit points or fewer, he casts time stop, and then casts black tentacles,
  greater invisibility, and wall of force to regain battlefield dominance. In
  melee, he always uses Power Attack.
Morale: Kazavon fights to the death in human form (but see death transformation)
Gear: >-
  +5 spiked heavy fortification mithral breastplate, +5 keen unholy wounding
  adamantine spiked chain, amulet of natural armor +5, ring of protection +5
