  - name: Swamp Crumble (Su)
    description: >-
      Curse and disease-slam; save Fort DC 17; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d3 Dex, 1d3 Con, and 1d3 Cha; cure -. Otherwise treated as mummy
      rot, this disease causes the victim's bones to become brittle and
      dissolve; upon death, only the skin, internal organs, and other soft
      tissues remain. A side effect of swamp crumble is that the victim's hair
      becomes tinged with red, with light-colored hair turning as red as fresh
      blood (Classic Horrors Revisited 44).
DuringCombat: >-
  The mummies surround foes, attempting to infect victims with swamp crumble and
  drag them into the pond to drown.
Morale: The mummies fight until destroyed.
