BeforeCombat: Kimandatsu casts flame arrow from her wand before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kimandatsu uses invisibility and flight to keep out of reach of opponents,
  targeting them with flaming arrows from her bow. To avoid being pinned down,
  she casts invisibility after a series of attacks and moves to a new position
  to fire again. She casts charm monster to gain allies from among her foes and
  targets groups of opponents with cone of cold or deep slumber if she thinks it
  will have any effect.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 25 hit points, Kimandatsu casts invisibility and
  attempts to flee until she can regenerate back to full health, then returns to
  attack her enemies again by surprise. If cornered or surrounded, Kimandatsu
  casts gaseous form in a last-ditch effort to escape.
Gear: wand of flame arrow (10 charges)
