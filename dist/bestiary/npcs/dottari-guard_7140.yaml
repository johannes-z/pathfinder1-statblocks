DuringCombat: >-
  The dottari guards are frustrated and enraged if their duties are interrupted,
  and they focus their attacks on the characters they feel most personify the
  interruption. This is likely the PC who attempted a Diplomacy or Intimidate
  check, but could just as easily be the first character to attack in the
  combat. They prefer  to fight with their halberds, using Intimidating Prowess
  on their first attack and then Power Attack for the rest of the fight.
Morale: >-
  If one of their number is slain, the dottari guards realize things are getting
  out of hand and attempt a fighting retreat to the Holding House, using their
  longbows and moving back each round. If two are slain, the remaining dottari
  make a full retreat.
