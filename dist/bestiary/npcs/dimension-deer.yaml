    description: >-
      If the dimension deer is reduced below 10 hp in combat and no enemies are
      within 5 feet, it spends each turn using dimension door to appear right
      next to the closest foe. It does not do so intelligently and simply
      attempts to use the spell to travel in a direct line to its foe. If this
      square is unavailable (because the foe is up a tree or hiding behind an
      object), the spell fails as per its description
