      The Aldori swordlord can add her Dexterity bonus on damage rolls made with
      an Aldori dueling sword instead of using her Strength bonus. This bonus on

      or two-handed, though she does not apply 1-1/2 times her Dexterity bonus
      on damage rolls while fighting two-handed. She cannot use this ability if
      she is wielding a shield or an off-hand weapon, including armor spikes,
      unarmed strikes, or natural weapons.
