SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Demon Ichor (Su)
    description: >-
      A slimy red ichor coats the xenarth's armored plates. Any weapon that
      touches a xenarth takes 3d8 points of acid damage from the corrosive demon
      essence, and the weapon's hardness does not reduce this damage. A magic
      weapon may attempt a DC 23 Reflex save to avoid taking this damage. A
      creature that strikes a xenarth with an unarmed attack, unarmed strike,
      melee touch spell, or natural weapon takes this damage unless the attacker
      succeeds at a DC 23 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3
      Con damage; cure 2 saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Savage Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A xenarth's bite is particularly dangerous. It applies 1-1/2 times its
      Strength modifier to damage inflicted with its bite attack, and it
      threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.
