BeforeCombat: >-
  Doc Hellbroth drinks an extract of false life and an extract of freedom of
  movement, then uses his mutagen to enhance his abilities before combat (these
  additions are calculated into his statistics).
DuringCombat: >-
  Hellbroth lets his golem engage foes in melee while he uses his bombs. If he
  sees Saoria fighting against him on the PCs' side, he shrieks in rage and
  focuses his attacks on her. He's fond of using his dart gun to dose victims
  with Numerian fluids, eagerly observing the strange random effects the fluids
  have. If you don't have access to Pathfinder Campaign Setting Numeria: Land of
  Fallen Stars to randomly roll Numerian fluid effects, replace the fluids with
  an equal amount of doses of shadow essence poison instead.
Morale: >-
  Doc Hellbroth uses an extract of sending to send a word of warning to Ozmyn
  Zaidow if his hit points are reduced to fewer than 30, then attempts to escape
  the Red Reaver to seek shelter at the Technic League compound (increase the
  PCs' Notoriety by 5 if he successfully warns Zaidow). If cornered, he fights
  to the death.
