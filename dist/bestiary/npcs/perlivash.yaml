SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      5-foot cone, euphoria for 1d6 rounds, DC 12 Fortitude negates. Affected
      creatures are staggered, sickened, and immune to fear effects for the
      duration of the euphoria. A faerie dragon can use this breath weapon once
      every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: Perlivash casts greater invisibility before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The faerie dragon prefers to defeat foes by using his spell-like abilities and
  breath weapon to confuse and disorient creatures, hopefully causing them to
  flee the area or giving Perlivash himself a chance to flee. He only resorts to
  his bite when he fears that letting a foe live would lead to a greater evil.
Morale: >-
  Perlivash flees if brought below 10 hit points, unless a friend is in peril,
  in which case he only flees if he can bring his friend with
  him&#8211;otherwise, he fights to the death.
