SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Double Hexes (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever Gurragurra uses a hex as a standard action, her second head can
      use an additional hex as a swift action.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Gurragurra casts shield of faith when she hears movement from the steps up to
  area B.
DuringCombat: >-
  Gurragurra initiates combat with both an evil eye hex and a slumber hex using
  her double hexes ability. The ettin prefers to fight with her magic, but if
  her opponents seem mostly unaffected by her spells, Gurragurra reluctantly
  pulls out her weapons and fights hand to hand.
Morale: >-
  Gurragurra has no wish to fail Jadrenka a second time, so if she is reduced to
  fewer than 20 hit points and it looks like she won't be able to stop
  intruders, she drinks her potion of reduce person and attempts to flee up the
  stairs and out the entrance with her familiar.
Gear: potion of reduce person, wand of levitate (19 charges)
OtherGear: javelins (4), mwk sickles (2), spell component pouch, 12 gp
