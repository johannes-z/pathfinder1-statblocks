    description: >-
      The shrill shriek of a hieracosphinx deafens nonsphinxes within a
      60-foot-radius spread for 2d4 rounds (DC 16 Fortitude negates). Once a
      creature successfully saves against this effect, it is immune to the
      hieracosphinx's shriek for 24 hours. Using this ability is a standard
      action. The save DC is Constitution-based.
