  Once he has dealt with the hostage, Umagro uses Dazzling Display to demoralize
  his opponents and impress the crowd below. Once his foes reach him, he attacks
  wildly, using Power Attack and attempting to reduce the number of his
  opponents by using his knockback rage power to push them off the roof.
Morale: Umagro is a martyr and eagerly fights to the death.
