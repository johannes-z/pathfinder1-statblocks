BeforeCombat: >-
  If the PCs trigger the alarm in area C9, Eshen Theba is warned of their
  approach and uses alter self to take on her gruesome but clearly human
  appearance. She then casts mage armor on herself and drinks her potion of
  undetectable alignment.
DuringCombat: >-
  Eshen casts eruptive pustules, then concentrates physical attacks on those
  nearest to her. She uses black tentacles and her sorcerer spells against those
  who remain at a distance.
Morale: >-
  If Eshen is reduced to 100 hit points or fewer, she uses enthrall or charm
  monster to gain some respite from the PCs' assault. However, if the handmaiden
  devil has someone trapped in her tentacle cage, she uses greater teleport to
  reach area C3, where she can dispatch this lone foe or hold him for ransom.
  She then drinks a potion of invisibility before the others arrive. She makes
  her last stand there, fighting to the death.
Gear: >-
  potions of cure serious wounds (2), potion of undetectable alignment, scroll
  of displacement

  headband of alluring charisma +6, major ring of electricity resistance,
  bejeweled skirt (worth 8,000 gp)
