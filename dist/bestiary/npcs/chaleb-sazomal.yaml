DuringCombat: >-
  Chaleb lost his mount during the initial disaster, so he's forced to fight on
  foot, something he finds distasteful. He prefers to attack obvious worshipers
  of Iomedae or other good deities, figuring that each paladin or priest slain
  is one more triumph to attract a demon's attention.
Morale: >-
  Chaleb is, among other things, a coward&#8211;he begs for his life if reduced
  to fewer than 10 hit points, but if taken prisoner, he does his best to escape
  at the earliest opportunity. If he can take out one of his captors in the
  process, so much the better.
