BeforeCombat: >-
  The Gardener casts stoneskin, mage armor, shield, fly, and false life before
  combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Gardener favors area-effect spells in combat, and tries to stay at range,
  moving between attacks to minimize the number of full attacks made against
  her. She casts  quickened mirror image on the first round of the fight, then
  quickened spectral hand on the second round, saving a 6th-level slot for chain
  lightning. She uses vampiric touch often once her spectral hand is active.
Morale: >-
  The Gardener fights until reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, at which point
  she surrenders and offers to join the PCs. She honors her word and fights with
  them until they encounter Barzillai, at which point she betrays the PCs and
  attacks them once more, this time fighting to the death.
