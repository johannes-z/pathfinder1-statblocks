    description: >-
      When Slavish is destroyed, his phylactery (see below) immediately begins
      to rebuild his body nearby. This process takes 1d10 days - if the body is
      destroyed before that time passes, the phylactery merely starts the
      process anew. After this time passes, Slavish wakens fully healed (albeit
      without any gear it left behind on its old body), with a burning need for
      revenge against those who previously destroyed it.
