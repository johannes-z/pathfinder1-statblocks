BeforeCombat: Abroziel spends 3 rounds studying Ofarah before striking.
DuringCombat: >-
  Abroziel surprises Ofarah with his death attack to paralyze her, and works
  with his servant assassin allies to flank any foe that opposes them beyond the
  surprise round. As long as he has flanking allies, Abroziel relies on his
  sneak attack damage to injure foes with unarmed strikes, but if cornered or if
  his allies fall, he draws his rapier to continue the battle fully armed.
Morale: Abroziel is dedicated to his job and fights to the death.
