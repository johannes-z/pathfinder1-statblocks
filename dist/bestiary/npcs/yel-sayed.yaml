SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Smite Good (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a knight gaunt can smite good. As a swift action, the knight
      gaunt chooses one target within sight. If this target is good, the knight
      gaunt adds its Charisma bonus on its attack rolls and adds its Hit Dice on
      all damage rolls made against that target. If the target is an outsider
      with the good subtype or a good-aligned creature with levels of cleric of
      paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack is doubled.
      Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR
      the creature might possess. Additionally, the knight gaunt gains a
      deflection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus to AC against attacks made by
      the target of the smite. The smite good remains in effect until the target
      of the smite is dead or until 24 hours have passed.
  - name: Weapon Attunement (Su)
    description: >-
      A knight gaunt gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with any
      melee weapon it wields. Additionally, it gains the bleed special attack
      with any melee weapon it wields.
