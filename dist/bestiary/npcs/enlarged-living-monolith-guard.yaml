SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ka Stone (Su)
    description: >-
      During his induction, a living monolith receives an engraved scarab stone
      in his forehead. This stone is inscribed on its inner side with the
      monolith's true name and oaths to the gods and pharaohs. It cannot be
      removed without his permission, cannot be dispelled (though it ceases
      functioning in areas where magic does not work), and does not use a magic
      item slot. The ka stone tightly binds the monolith's mind and spirit to
      his body, providing him with a +2 bonus on saves against negative levels,
      negative energy, death effects, and mind-affecting effects. A living
      monolith can also invoke the power of his ka stone three times per day as
      a swift action, enabling him to grow in size as if using enlarge person
      (even if he is not a humanoid).
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Each living monolith drinks a potion of darkvision and a potion of false life

DuringCombat: >-
  At the first sign of trouble, the living monoliths invoke their enlarge person
  ability to grow to Large size, then wade into melee, wielding their falchions
  two-handed for maximum cleaving power.
Morale: >-
  The living monoliths fight to the death, trusting in Zuberi to raise them once
  more if they prove themselves worthy.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of darkvision (already drank), potion
  of false life (already drank)
OtherGear: +1 breastplate, javelins (3), masterwork falchion
