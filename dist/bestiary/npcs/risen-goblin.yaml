SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Ghoul Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 15; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC
      is Charisma-based. A humanoid that dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at
      the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none
      of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of any
      other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like
      a normal ghoul in all respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as
      a ghast.
  - name: Paralysis (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures damaged by a ghast's natural attacks must make a successful DC
      15 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. Paralyzed creatures
      cannot move, speak, or take any physical actions. The creature is rooted
      to the spot, frozen and helpless. Unlike ghouls, A ghast's paralysis even
      affects elves. Unlike hold person and similar effects, a paralysis effect
      does not allow a new save each round. A winged creature flying in the air
      at the time that it is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A
      swimmer can't swim and may drown.
  - name: Stench (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ghast's exude an overwhelming stink of death and corruption in a 10-foot
      radius. Those within the stench must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save, or
      be sickened for 1d6+4 minutes.
