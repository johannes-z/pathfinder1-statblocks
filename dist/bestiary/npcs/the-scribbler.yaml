  - name: Sacred Site (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Scribbler is bound to the shrine of Lamashtu (areas A1-A10), and has
      been charged by the goddess of nightmares herself with keeping the site
      sacred and free from intruders and heretics. Should the Scribbler ever
      move beyond these areas, he loses the divine guardian template and his
      spellcasting ability until he atones and reenters the site within 1 week.
      Otherwise, he loses the template permanently and takes 6d6 points of
      Constitution drain as his body adjusts to the loss.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Every day, the Scribbler wards the complex by casting alarm and guards and
  wards. He also casts nondetection, extended magic vestment, and extended
  greater magic weapon every day after finishing his daily prayers to Lamashtu.
  If he has time just before combat begins, he casts stoneskin, spell
  resistance, freedom of movement, bull's strength, and bear's endurance.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Scribbler starts combat by casting summon monster VI to summon 1d3 babaus.
  While these summoned monsters engage his foes, he casts righteous might and
  quickened divine favor. He then enters combat, casting a quickened spiritual
  weapon on that round to attack a spellcaster or healer.
Morale: >-
  The Scribbler uses dimension door to retreat to the hallway outside of area
  A10 if brought below 10 hit points, then hides inside his lair and heals his
  wounds before returning to continue a fight with intruders. If confronted in
  area A10, he fights to the death.
