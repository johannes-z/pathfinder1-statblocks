DuringCombat: >-
  The Lion Blade initiates try to keep the PCs from fleeing by blocking escape
  routes, casting spells, and throwing tanglefoot bags as one initiate uses
  bardic performance to inspire courage. They deal nonlethal damage to heavily
  injured targets so as to capture prisoners for questioning. If the PCs defeat
  one or more Lion Blades, the remaining initiates switch to dealing only lethal
  damage.
Morale: >-

  They fight until defeated.
