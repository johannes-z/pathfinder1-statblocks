BeforeCombat: >-
  The Keeper can change size at will from Small to Huge, but is Large when the
  PCs first arrive in the Soul.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Keeper begins combat by activating their agonized wail. The Keeper prefers
  to fight in melee with their flaming longsword, but makes use of their
  spell-like abilities to augment their attacks. As the Keeper nears the PCs,
  they are subject to the archon's baleful gaze. If the PCs gang up on the
  Keeper, the guardian uses hold monster to reduce the number of simultaneous
  attackers. The Keeper is immune to fire,  and thus doesn't hesitate to cast
  fireball while in the area of effect.
Morale: Insane and enraged, the Keeper fights to the death.
