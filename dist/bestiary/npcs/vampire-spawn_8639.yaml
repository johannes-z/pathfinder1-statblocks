DuringCombat: >-
  The vampire spawn do not coordinate their attacks well, and tend to bicker and
  snap at each other over meals. As a result, each vampire spawn seeks out its
  own PC to attack, teaming up with others against a single target only if no
  other options are available. When two vampire spawn fight one PC, they each
  take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, as they are distracted by the other's
  actions. They won't bother with dominating prey unless they find themselves
  alone, fighting a single victim.
Morale: The vampire spawn fight until destroyed.
