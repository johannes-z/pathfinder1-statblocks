BeforeCombat: >-
  If Urlgryber becomes aware of the PCs, he tries to hide so he can surprise the
  PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  Urlgryber prioritizes attacking spellcasters first, but if he is unable to
  pick and choose his targets, he focuses his attacks to bring down one target
  at a time before advancing to another.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, he evaluates the benefits of fleeing.

  rally Rayland and Eliza for a joint defense.
