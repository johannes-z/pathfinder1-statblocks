DuringCombat: >-
  Jiro prefers to fight honorably, issuing a challenge to an honorable foe and
  facing that opponent in single combat. Experience in battle has taught Jiro
  about the value of self-preservation over honor, however, and he is more than
  willing to do whatever is necessary to attain victory, even if his tactics
  might be considered dishonorable or underhanded by more "respectable" samurai.
  If hard pressed or outnumbered, Jiro drinks his potion of heroism.
Morale: >-
  With no lord to serve, Jiro withdraws from combat if reduced to fewer than 50
  hit points. If defending the innocent peasants under his charge, however, Jiro
  fights to the death.
Gear: potion of heroism, restorative ointment
