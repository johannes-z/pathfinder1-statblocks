SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Confessing Catatonia (Su)
    description: >-
      If a creature would be killed by the Secret Shade's Strength damage, the
      shadow can instead leave the creature helpless, barely conscious, and in a
      highly suggestible state. For 6 hours the target must answer any questions
      as if subject to an elixir of truth (Will DC 26), though it can gain a +4
      bonus on such a saving throw by choosing to take 1 point of Strength
      drain. This effect ends early if the target is healed of all of its
      Strength damage.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      A humanoid creature killed by the Secret Shade's Strength damage becomes a
      shadow (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 245) under its control 1d4 rounds later.
      If the humanoid slain had 9 or more Hit Dice, it instead becomes a greater
      shadow.
  - name: Easy to Summon (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Secret Shade can be summoned with gate or greater planar ally despite
      its type and Hit Dice.
  - name: Shadow Tethers (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, the Secret Shade can weave a network of delicate
      shadowstuff throughout a 20-foot-cube area. So long as it is on the same
      plane, the Secret Shade can sense creatures (including incorporeal ones)
      passing through this area as if with blindsense, and it can target any
      suitable object in the area with enter image. As a standard action, the
      Secret Shade can travel to any space within one of its shadow tether areas
      within 400 feet, as dimension door. The Secret Shade can maintain up to 20
      such areas at a time. Any shadow tether area is nearly imperceptible but
      can be detected as a trap and disabled as though it were a magic trap.
  - name: Shadow Trap (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, the Secret Shade can lay a trap within a shadow
      tether area, affecting a single 5-foot square. Each shadow tether area can
      only contain a single trap, and the Secret Shade can sustain only a number
      of shadow traps equal to its Charisma modifier.
  - name: Strength Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      The Secret Shade's touch deals 1d8 points of Strength damage to a living
      creature. Half of this damage is treated as a negative energy effect, and
      a creature immune to such effects (such as by death ward) takes only 1d4
      Strength damage. A creature dies if this Strength damage equals or exceeds
      its actual Strength score.
