  - name: Aura of the Grave (Su)
    description: >-
      A Seal-Breaker is constantly surrounded by the chill of death. Mindless
      undead within 10 feet of the Seal-Breaker will not attack him unless
      directly ordered to, and even then only after succeeding at a DC 17 Will
      save. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Corpse Rider (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as the weapon bond of an antipaladin's fiendish
      boon ability.
DuringCombat: >-
  The knights use smite good against their enemies as soon as possible, as they
  expect nearly anyone they fight in Vigil to be good. One of the knights hangs
  back to cast hold person and command against the most effective enemies, while
  the others approach in melee, bolstering their blows with Channel Smite. If
  hard pressed in melee, they step back to cast protection from good and drink
  their potions of barkskin before resuming the fight.
Morale: Dedicated and fanatical, the knights fight to the death.
Gear: potion of barkskin
