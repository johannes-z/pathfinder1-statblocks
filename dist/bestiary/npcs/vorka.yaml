BeforeCombat: >-
  Vorka drinks a potion of barkskin as soon as she realizes her home is under
  attack, then casts spider climb and produce flame before venturing forth to
  confront the intruders.
DuringCombat: >-
  As Vorka fights, she periodically threatens goblin enemies by describing how
  she thinks they'll taste, or preselecting choice cuts by saying things like,
  "Those ears might taste fine stuffed with eyes." She begins combat by using
  her first action to light her Desnan candle to fire at the PCs. She uses
  spider climb if possible to retain range on the PCs so she can summon swarms
  or other creatures (she's fond of using summon nature's ally I to summon
  dogs), leaving the task of melee combat to her animal companion, Lord
  Longtung.
Morale: Vorka is too proud and crazed to admit defeat&#8211;she fights to the death.
Gear: potions of cure light wounds (3), potions of barkskin +2 (2), Desnan candle
OtherGear: leather armor, scimitar, and 6 darts
