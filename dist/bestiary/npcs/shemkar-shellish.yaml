BeforeCombat: >-
  If Shemkar hears outsiders approaching the temple, he casts divine favor on
  himself. The cultists working alongside him know Shemkar's tactics, and cast
  resist energy (fire) on themselves as combat begins.
DuringCombat: >-
  Shemkar begins by surrounding the battlefield in a wall of fire, then
  unleashes a fireball and scorching ray, and turns to blade barrier and slay
  living if his fire spells seem ineffective. He still considers himself a good
  parish priest, and heals his cultists as needed.
Morale: >-
  Shemkar is convinced that he is Sarenrae's prophet on Golarion and cannot be
  slain. He fights to the death.
