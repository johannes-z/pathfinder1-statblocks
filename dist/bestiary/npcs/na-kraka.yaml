SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ink Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per hour as a standard action, a cecaelia can emit a 10-foot-radius
      sphere of ink while underwater. This ink cloud provides total concealment
      and persists for 1 minute.
  - name: Tentacle Sense (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a swift action while swimming and while it is not grappled or
      grappling, the cecaelia can spread its tentacles wide to form a sensory
      net around it. This grants blindsight to a range of 10 feet and lasts as
      long as the cecaelia concentrates. While this effect lasts, the creature
      cannot attack with its tentacles or move.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  The Sea Witch is a capable melee opponent, but he knows he fights best when in
  the water. He tries to make his way to the antechamber, grappling and dragging
  opponents along the way. When he reaches the water, he dives in, pulling his
  grappled foes along with him, and uses his ink cloud ability while he rests
  along the floor waiting for his prey to drown. If a foe escapes or dies,
  Na-Kraka swims back to the surface to grab another victim until his lair is
  free of intruders.
Morale: >-
  Despite thinking himself superior to humans, Na- Kraka is not completely
  reckless. If reduced to 10 or fewer hit points, the Sea Witch begs for his
  life, offering to serve the PCs (a lie of desperation), surrendering the
  Celestial Song, and doing anything else he can think of to get the PCs to
  spare his life. If during negotiations the sealed tunnel doors in the
  antechamber open and release the water, Na- Kraka races to the other room,
  using his jet ability to escape down the tunnels with the draining water.
