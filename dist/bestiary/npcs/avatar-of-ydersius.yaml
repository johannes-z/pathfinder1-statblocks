SQ: bound to Material Plane

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bound to Material Plane (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although he is an extraplanar creature, Ydersius is bound to the Material
      Plane until he has fully regenerated and is completely restored. As a
      result, spells such as banishment, dismissal, and the like have no effect
      on him.
  - name: Fast Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ydersius strikes with unnatural speed and precision, allowing him one
      extra bite attack at his full base attack bonus. This effect is not
      cumulative with similar effects such as haste, and does not actually grant
      a second action.
  - name: Noxious Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Ydersius can exhale a venomous cloud of mind-numbing pheromones in a
      30-foot spread every 1d4 rounds. Breath-inhaled; save Fort DC 30;
      frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Wis; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite&#8211;injury; save Fort DC 30; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
      1d6 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Powerful Bite (Ex)
    description: Ydersius applies twice his Strength modifier to bite damage.
  - name: Regeneration (Ex)
    description: >-
      No form of attack can suppress Ydersius's regeneration&#8211;the snake-god
      regenerates even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If Ydersius
      fails a save against an effect that would kill him instantly, he rises
      from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is
      inflicted upon his remains.
  - name: Toxic Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ydersius's blood is both acidic and poisonous to those it contacts. A
      creature that strikes Ydersius with a slashing or piercing melee weapon,
      an unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 2d8 points of acid damage and
      exposes itself to a contact poison. Touch&#8211;contact; save Fort DC 30;
      frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Vulnerable to Decapitation (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ydersius can only be defeated by severing his head from his body, either
      with a vorpal weapon or by reducing him to fewer than 0 hit points, then
      decapitating him with a coup de grace attack. Even then, both Ydersius's
      head and body live on. His head immediately decays into an inert skull,
      while his body is blind, deaf, mindless, and limited to claw and tail slap
      attacks. If the head is held to the body, it reattaches, eventually
      restoring the snake-god.
BeforeCombat: Ydersius casts freedom of movement before climbing from the chasm.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ydersius attacks with the savagery of a constrictor and the speed of a viper.
  He attempts to subject as many foes as possible to his poisonous attacks,
  using Awesome Blow to knock opponents into the Chasm of Retreat, if possible.
  He uses his tail to constrict spellcasters, and casts baleful polymorph on
  dangerous warriors to take them out of the fight.
Morale: >-
  Ydersius fights until his head is severed from his body, at which point his
  headless body thrashes mindlessly around the cavern before once more fleeing
  into the Chasm of Retreat.
