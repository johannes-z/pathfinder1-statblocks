BeforeCombat: >-
  Zaine casts alarm on the house's two entrances (area F1) every day, as well as
  false life and mage armor. When alerted to intruders, he uses his scroll of
  stoneskin and casts mirror image.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zaine prefers to use his spells or wand of magic missile against foes unless
  he has no other choice. If forced into melee, Zaine uses his scroll of
  dimension door as a +2 scroll shield, then activates his scroll of fly as a +1
  scroll blade, using his hand of the apprentice ability to attack with it as
  needed.
Morale: >-
  Not willing to risk the Narikopolus relics falling into the hands of
  evildoers, Zaine stays to fight until reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, at
  which point he attempts to flee to Valor's Fastness (area H), using his 
  scroll of dimension door or scroll of fly if necessary to escape the manor.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds, scroll of dimension door, scroll of fly,
  scroll of resist energy, scroll of stoneskin, scroll of summon monster V, wand
  of magic missile (CL 5th, 45 charges)
