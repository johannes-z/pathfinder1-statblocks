BeforeCombat: >-
  If Hildr is aware of the PCs' approach, she spends a full round putting on her
  cleats to give her better mobility on the ice and drinks her potion of shield
  of faith. Otherwise, she wears normal cold-weather boots that provide no
  additional traction.
DuringCombat: >-
  Hildr enters a rage and charges at the first target in sight. She is a
  whirlwind in a fight, moving from target to target unless doing so will open
  her to excessive attacks of opportunity. She and Skell are competitive and do
  not aid one another in battle, though if her brother falls, she focuses all
  her attention on the enemy who dealt the killing blow.
Morale: >-
  While raging, Hildr fights to the death. She only flees or surrenders if her
  brother is somehow forced to do the same.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds, potion of shield of faith, alchemist's fire (2)
