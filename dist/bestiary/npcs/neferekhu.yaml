SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature struck by Neferekhu's bite attack must succeed at a DC 16
      Will save or take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability
      checks, and skill checks. This curse remains until removed. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Gilded Cage (Ex)
    description: >-
      Neferekhu is housed within a small golden cage etched with mystic sigils
      and soaked in alchemical reagents. The cage has hardness 10 and 10 hit
      points and provides Neferekhu with a +4 armor bonus to her AC. Small or
      larger creatures can carry Neferekhu in their space without penalty. A
      short length of chain is affixed to the cage, allowing a creature to wield
      her in combat as an improvised flail; doing so allows Neferekhu to make a
      free bite against the target on a successful hit. Alternatively, Neferekhu
      can cast spells while being wielded in this way, but this is considered
      violent motion while casting. While being wielded, Neferekhu can be
      attacked only with disarm or sunder combat maneuvers against the creature
      wielding her. When not carried by another character, Neferekhu can only
      roll around clumsily with a speed of 5 feet.
  - name: Hateful Glare (Su)
    description: >-
      Neferekhu's transformation into a hate-fueled severed head has amplified
      her disquieting presence. Any living creature within 30 feet must roll
      twice on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks and take the worse
      result. A successful DC 16 Will save negates this effect. Spells Neferekhu
      casts spells as a 6th-level oracle.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Neferekhu targets her opponents with ranged spells, particularly
  blindness/deafness, dread bolt, hold person, and ray of sickening. She casts
  murderous command on healthy young warriors while encouraging her skeletal
  overseers to engage enemy spellcasters.
Morale: Neferekhu craves the oblivion of death and fights until destroyed.
