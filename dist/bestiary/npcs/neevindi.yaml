  Neevindi gives Cathixia some room, moving forward toward the PCs to eliminate
  threats before they can reach the wizard. If someone gets past her, Neevindi
  moves to flank with Cathixia to more quickly take down those who present the
  largest threat to her charge. Unless forced to fight from range, Neevindi
  prefers knocking her foes out with her sap with the intention of interrogating
  them later.
Morale: Neevindi defends Cathixia to the death.
