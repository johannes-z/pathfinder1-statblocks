SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A rope golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature. Disintegrate affects it normally. Rope
      trick or animate rope deals 1d6 points of damage per 3 caster levels.
      Mending heals the rope golem 2d6 hit points. It is not immune to any
      fire-based effects or spells at all.
  - name: Strangle (Ex)
    description: >-
      A rope golem has an unerring talent for seizing its victims by the neck. A
      creature that is grappled by a rope golem cannot speak or cast spells with
      verbal components.
DuringCombat: >-
  The rope golem attacks the closest target each round; if two targets are
  equally close, it alternates its slams between those foes. Once it grapples a
  foe, it continues to constrict and strangle that foe while using its second
  slam to attack nearby foes (though it cannot grapple a second foe). If no
  secondary target is in reach, it uses its second slam attack against the poor
  victim it's currently strangling.
Morale: >-
  The rope golem fights until destroyed, but does not pursue foes from this
  room.
