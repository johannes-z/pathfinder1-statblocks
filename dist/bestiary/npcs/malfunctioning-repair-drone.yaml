    description: >-
      With its current damage and partial charge, the repair drone is
      effectively staggered, suffers a reduction to its Strength and Dexterity
      scores, and does not gain its bonus hit points for being a construct.
      Furthermore, three standard features to a repair drone (fast healing, the
      ability to repair robots, and its net) are missing-see page 24 for the
      statistics for a fully functional repair drone.
DuringCombat: >-
  The drone ignores the PCs and continues to tear the building apart, one stone
  at a time, but turns its wrath on any character who attempts to hurt it or
  even simply stands in its way. Unfortunately for the PCs, there are few ways
  to stop the thing from rampaging other than taking it out&#8211;if they ignore
  the robot, it continues to dismantle the building until several townsfolk team
  up to take it down (resulting, most likely, in several wounded citizens along
  the way).
Morale: Once it attacks, the drone fights until destroyed.
