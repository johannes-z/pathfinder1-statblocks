SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Law (Ex)
    description: >-
      The power of Lictor Ountor's aura of law (see the detect law spell) is
      equal to that of a cleric of his total character level (10th level).
  - name: Detect Chaos (Sp)
    description: >-
      This ability functions like a paladin's detect evil class feature, save
      that it detects chaos.
  - name: Force of Will (Ex)
    description: >-
      Lictor Ountor gains a+2 bonus on Will saves against spells with the
      compulsion descriptor.
  - name: Hellknight Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      When Lictor Ountor wears Hellknight armor, he reduces its armor check
      penalty by 1, increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by 1, and
      moves at full speed.
  - name: Pentamic Faith (Ex)
    description: >-
      This Hellknight discipline allows Lictor Ountor to gain the granted powers
      (but not domain spells) of the Strength domain as a 4th-level cleric.
  - name: Smite Chaos (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as the paladin's smite evil class feature, but
      against chaotic-aligned creatures. This ability is twice as effective
      against outsiders with the chaotic subtype, chaotic-aligned aberrations,
      and fey.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Lictor Ountor is eager to get revenge on the Glorious Reclamation, but having
  been defeated once before, he fights with more caution against these foes,
  assuming he manages to get hold of replacement armor and weapons. He takes
  every opportunity he can to sunder the weapons of his enemies and is hesitant
  to use Power Attack unless he finds that he's hitting his foes each round
  without worry. He saves shield of faith for use against the most powerful
  foes, and when he does so, casts it on the first round of combat-assuming he
  can find an unholy symbol to use!
Morale: >-
  Lictor Ountor fights to the death, but if captured alive, bides his time as a
  prisoner for another chance at revenge.
