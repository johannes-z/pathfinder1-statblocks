DuringCombat: >-
  Isiah lurches up to attack the closest creature at the start of combat, and he
  doesn't switch targets. If he knocks out or kills someone, he stops fighting
  to try to eat the corpse, automatically dealing 1d6 points of slashing damage
  with his jagged teeth each round to an unconscious victim.
Morale: >-
  While he otherwise fights to the death, Isiah stops fighting as soon as he
  gets something to eat. If attacked while feeding, he fights to the death to
  defend his meal.
