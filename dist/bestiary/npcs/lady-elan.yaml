SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blinding Beauty (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability affects all humanoids within 30 ft. of a nymph. Those who
      look directly at Lady Elan must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or be
      blinded permanently. She can suppress or resume this ability as a free
      action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Inspiration (Su)
    description: >-
      A nymph can choose an intelligent creature to inspire and serve as a muse
      by giving that creature some token of her affection (typically a lock of
      her hair). As long as the nymph retains her favor for this creature and as
      long as the creature carries the nymph's token, the creature gains a +4
      insight bonus on all Will saving throws, Craft checks, and Perform checks.
      A bard who has a nymph for a muse in this way can use his bardic
      performance for an additional number of rounds per day equal to his nymph
      muse's Charisma modifier. The nymph retains a link to her token and its
      carrier as if she had cast a status spell on the carrier. The nymph can
      end this effect at any time as a free action. A single nymph may only
      inspire one creature at a time in this manner.
  - name: Stunning Glance (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Lady Elan can stun a creature within 30 ft. with a
      look. The target must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or be stunned for
      2d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Unearthly Grace (Su)
    description: >-
      A nymph adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on all her saving
      throws, and as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.
