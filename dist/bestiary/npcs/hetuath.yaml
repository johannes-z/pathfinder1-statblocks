SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Deathlink (Su)
    description: >-
      Hetuath possesses a unique ability that allows him to see through the eye
      sockets of any of his seven undead tribesmen and to give simple commands
      to them while doing so. This ability has a maximum range of 1 mile, and as
      long as he's looking through the eye sockets of a skeleton, he remains
      fully aware of his own surroundings but can take no other action. He can
      end a link with a skeleton instantaneously.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Ex)
    description: >-
      Even if completely destroyed, an undead kasatha rejuvenates after a period
      of 26 hours passes, its bones reconstituting from nothing if need be to
      carry on its undead existence. This perpetual cycle of eternal unlife
      persists until the habitat module's sky is reactivated or the remains of a
      defeated kasatha are put in an area where the rays of the rising sun can
      strike them.
