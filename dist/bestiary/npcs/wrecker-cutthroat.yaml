  The wrecker cutthroats wait for Vakarla to cast haste on them, then rage and
  leap in among the ship's crew to prevent an organized defense. They gang up on
  opponents, flanking when possible and slaying everyone aboard, even those who
  surrender.
Morale: The bloodthirsty cutthroats fight to the death.
