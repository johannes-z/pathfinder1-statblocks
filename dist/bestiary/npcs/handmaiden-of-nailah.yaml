SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Desecrating Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      The phantasm has a 30-foot-radius emanation equivalent to a desecrate
      spell centered on a shrine of evil power. Undead within this radius
      (including the phantasm) gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage
      rolls, and saving throws; they also gain 2 hit points per Hit Die (these
      adjustments are included in the phantasm's stat block), and the save DC of
      channeled negative energy increases by 6. This aura can be negated by
      dispel evil, but a phantasm can reactivate the aura on its turn as a free
      action. A desecrating aura suppresses and is suppressed by consecrate or
      hallow; both effects are negated within any overlapping area of effect.
      When the phantasm is possessing a creature, its aura remains active,
      emanating from the host.
  - name: Possession (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round, by making a successful incorporeal touch attack, a
      phantasm can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This
      ability is similar to a magic jar spell, except that it doesn't require a
      receptacle. If the attack succeeds, the phantasm's body vanishes into the
      opponent's body. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 23
      Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that phantasm's
      possession ability for 1 day. A possessing phantasm automatically imposes
      1 negative level (from its energy drain ability) each round. A possessed
      creature can attempt a DC 23 Will save each round to force the phantasm
      out of its body. If the host succeeds, the phantasm is ejected and cannot
      attempt to possess the same host for 1 minute. If turned or subjected to a
      dismissal spell while possessing a host, the phantasm is likewise ejected.
      The save DCs are Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  Upon their release, two handmaidens fly to aid their mistress with their
  desecrating auras and incorporeal touch attacks, while the others attempt to
  possess opponents who are farther away from Nailah. If a possessing phantasm
  imposes so many negative levels on a possessed creature that it dies, the
  phantasm immediately leaves the body and attempts to find a new host to
  possess.
Morale: >-
  Free to roam the entire Water Crypt, the handmaidens pursue any who flee the
  chamber, but they immediately return to aid Nailah if the battle goes poorly
  for her. The handmaidens fight until destroyed.
