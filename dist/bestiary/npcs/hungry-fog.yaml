SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bewitching Brume (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature that ventures within 10 feet of a hungry fog or that is
      currently being affected by its enveloping mists must succeed at a DC 8
      Will save at the start of that creature's turn or become shaken for 1
      round at the half-glimpsed shapes of phantoms floating within the fog.
      This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Enveloping Mists (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hungry fog can engulf foes. A creature engulfed by a hungry fog does not
      gain the pinned condition and may move normally-such a creature is not in
      danger of suffocating, but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, it is
      staggered in addition to the damage the attack causes. The save DC to
      avoid the enveloping mists is Constitution-based.
  - name: Gaseous (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hungry fog has a body composed of eerie mist. It can pass through small
      holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, but cannot enter water or
      other liquid. It has no Strength score, and cannot manipulate objects as a
      result.
  - name: Vulnerable to Wind (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hungry fog is treated as a Tiny creature for the purposes of determining
      the effects high wind has upon it.
