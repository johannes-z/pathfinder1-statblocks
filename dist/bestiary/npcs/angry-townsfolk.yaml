DuringCombat: >-
  Though the townsfolk are very angry, they're not out to kill anyone in cold
  blood. They break off attacking any target who is staggered or drops, and warn
  their fellows to do likewise. They're proficient with swords because the town
  charter demands it, but they're still primarily fishermen and foresters.
Morale: >-
  If a townsperson takes 3 or more points of damage, he drops his sword and
  flees. If flight is impossible, he drops to his knees and begs for mercy.
