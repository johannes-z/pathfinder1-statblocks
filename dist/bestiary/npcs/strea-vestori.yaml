DuringCombat: >-
  Strea drinks a potion of barkskin on the first round of combat, then uses
  Quick Draw to retrieve her second dagger. She uses Improved Feint to maximize
  her sneak attacks unless she's fighting with allies, in which case she prefers
  to flank and make full attacks. If reduced to 30 or fewer hit points, she
  casts vanish and then retreats to Natsiel's side in area A4.
Morale: >-
  As long as she remains charmed, Strea fights to the death. If the charm is
  dispelled, she immediately surrenders&#8211;see Development below.
