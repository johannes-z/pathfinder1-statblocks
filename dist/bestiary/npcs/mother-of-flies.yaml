BeforeCombat: >-
  The mother of flies casts mage armor and nondetection on herself every morning
  and every evening. Before entering combat, she always takes the time to also
  cast cat's grace, fly, and shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Mother of Flies directs any swarms available to her to distract foes while
  she tries to remain out of range with flight, using her spells against foes.
  She'll retreat to the Maggot Tree core to use the tree's attacks against
  attackers if possible. In melee, she uses Arcane Strike, Power Attack, and
  usually Vital Strike to maximize damage while allowing her to move out of
  melee after each attack.
Morale: >-
  The Mother of Flies uses teleport to flee to the Court of Ether if reduced to
  fewer than 40 hit points, but harbors a grudge if she's forced to do so. She
  might even throw aside her hatred of the Council of Thieves if the PCs force
  her to flee in this manner, and could show up in the final adventure as an
  additional foe in this case.
