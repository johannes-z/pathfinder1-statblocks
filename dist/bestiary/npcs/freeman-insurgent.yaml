  Both of the insurgents hold flasks of alchemist's fire, and if interrupted,
  they turn and throw them at the nearest target. After hurling their flasks,
  the insurgents draw their clubs and bash their way through the crowd in a
  desperate attempt to join their allies at the South Arcadian Whaling Company.
Morale: If cornered, the insurgents fight to the death.
