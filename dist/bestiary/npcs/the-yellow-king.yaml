SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dream Spellcasting (Su)
    description: >-
      The Yellow King's effective caster level for figment, glamer, and pattern
      spells increases by 2. This ability is cumulative; for example, if the
      Yellow King casts a spell that is both a figment and a glamer, he casts it
      at a +4 caster level.
  - name: Lulling Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature within 20 feet must succeed at a DC 13 Will saving throw or
      take a -5 penalty on Perception checks and a -2 penalty on Will saving
      throws against sleep effects for as long as it remains within range. A new
      saving throw is required each round until the creature fails or is no
      longer within range. The Yellow King can suppress or resume this ability
      as a free action. This is a gaze effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Sleep Song (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full round action, the Yellow King can sing a lullaby that puts
      nearby creatures to sleep. Any creature within 100 feet of the Yellow King
      that can hear his song must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = the
      Yellow King's Perform [sing] check result), or fall asleep as per sleep
      for 4 rounds. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the
      Yellow King's sleep song again for 24 hours. Dream creatures are immune to
      their own and other dream creatures' sleep songs. Sleep song is a sonic,
      mind-affecting sleep effect.
  - name: Sleep Vulnerability (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Yellow King takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against sleep effects.
      Furthermore, he counts as a creature with 2 fewer Hit Dice than he
      actually has for the purpose of determining the number and Hit Dice of
      creatures a sleep spell can affect.
  - name: Waking Dreams (Su)
    description: >-
      At will as a standard action, the Yellow King can cause the area within
      100 feet of his position to become hazy and dreamlike. This effect
      penetrates solid objects and even crosses the boundary with the Ethereal
      Plane. Distances and speeds in the affected area become hard to judge.
      Bright areas seem dark, and dark areas appear to have some hazy
      illumination. Colors blend into one another in strange and unpredictable
      ways, and creatures seem to take on the features of other creatures or
      objects. Every creature in the affected area takes a -4 penalty on all
      attack rolls, checks, and saving throws as long as it remains in the area.
      A creature outside the area taking any action that would affect creatures
      within or on the other side of the area also takes a -4 penalty on any
      associated roll or check. Waking dreams is an illusion (figment) effect
      with no saving throw, but creatures that are immune to illusion effects
      are immune to this effect. True seeing and similar effects allow a
      creature to act in the affected area without taking the penalty. Dream
      creatures are immune to the penalties caused by their own waking dreams
      and by those of other dream creatures.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  It takes a great deal of provocation for the Yellow King to strike first, but
  he defends himself if attacked. On the first round of combat, he activates his
  waking dreams ability to hinder his foes and then uses lulling gaze on enemies
  before incapacitating them with his sleep song ability.
Morale: The Yellow King flees if reduced to half his hit points.
