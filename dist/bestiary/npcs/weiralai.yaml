SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Touch of the Blot (Su)
    description: >-
      Weiralai has manifested a unique ability as a servant of Carcosa. Three
      times per day as a standard action, Weiralai can make a touch attack
      against a creature and infect it with a horrible affliction that withers
      the creature's flesh. The struck creature must succeed at a DC 25
      Fortitude save or take 2 points of Constitution drain. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. In addition, Weiralai gains the ability to
      telepathically communicate with seeded creatures within 100 feet as if she
      herself was a seeded creature.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  After preparing her spells each day, Weiralai infuses her unique armor, The
  Forbidden Name, with one blast rune and a spell rune containing bestow curse.
  With her extraordinary senses, Weiralai is capable of detecting approaching
  danger with ease. She uses the forewarning to cast aura of doom, divine favor,
  freedom of movement, shield of faith, true seeing, and resist energy against
  whichever energy type she knows the PCs use most.
DuringCombat: >-
  Weiralai greater dispel magic to soften up her opposition before wading into
  melee. She uses her rapier's conductive special ability to activate her touch
  of chaos domain ability without slowing her attacks, and she activates her
  armor's runes to debilitate a key target.
Morale: >-
  Weiralai must destroy the PCs, but she is willing to retreat from an
  unbeatable fight in order to attack later when the PCs are more vulnerable. If
  she cannot reliably retreat, she fights until destroyed.
Gear: potion of fly, potion of invisibility
OtherGear: >-
  The Forbidden Name (see page 42), +1 conductive rapier, headband of mental
  prowess +2 (Wis, Cha), Leng rubies (8, worth 500 gp each), tins of eye
  ointment (2, worth 250 gp each)
