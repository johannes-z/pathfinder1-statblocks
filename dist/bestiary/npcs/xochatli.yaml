SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Deep Dweller (Ex)
    description: Xochatli is immune to cold and damage from water pressure.
  - name: Enhanced Senses (Ex)
    description: >-
      Xochatli has more efficient clusters of visual, tactile, and olfactory
      clusters than most other clockwork creatures. Xochatli has blindsense out
      to 60 feet and a +8 racial bonus on Perception checks.
  - name: Ink Reservoir (Ex)
    description: >-
      Xochatli carries a reservoir of greasy, poisonous ink distilled from
      kraken ink. Xochatli can emit a cloud of this ink in an 80-foot spread
      once per minute as a free action while underwater. This cloud provides
      total concealment. Creatures within the cloud are considered to be in
      darkness. In addition, the ink is toxic, functioning as contact poison
      against all creatures caught within it. The ink cloud persists for 1
      minute before dispersing. Xochatli's reservoir contains enough ink to use
      this ability three times; once expended, Xochatli cannot use this ability
      again until its ink reservoir is refilled. Kraken Ink: Ink cloud-contact;
      save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 1 Str damage plus
      nauseated; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Jet (Ex)
    description: >-
      Xochatli can jet backward as a full-round action at a speed of 240 feet.
      It must move in a straight line, but it does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity while jetting.
  - name: Reflective Shell (Su)
    description: >-
      Xochatli's curved shell resists magical ray attacks. Ray spells or effects
      targeting Xochatli are harmlessly deflected and have no effect.
  - name: Rend Ship (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, Xochatli can attempt to use its tentacles to
      grapple a ship of its size or smaller. It attempts a combat maneuver check
      opposed by the ship's captain's Profession (sailor) check, but Xochatli
      gets a cumulative +4 bonus on the check for each size category smaller
      than Gargantuan the ship is. If Xochatli grapples the ship, it holds the
      ship motionless; it can attack foes on deck with its free arms and can't
      attack foes at all with its beak. Each round it maintains its hold on the
      ship, it automatically deals bite damage to the ship's hull.
  - name: Tenacious Grappler (Ex)
    description: >-
      Xochatli does not gain the grappled condition if it grapples a foe with
      its tentacles.
BeforeCombat: Xochatli shores up its vulnerability by casting resist energy (electricity).
DuringCombat: >-
  Xochatli grabs as many foes as possible with its tentacles and crushes them to
  death, swiping at opponents that remain out of reach with its arms.
Morale: >-
  Xochatli has been a fearless terror of the seas for millennia. It doesn't
  retreat and attacks until destroyed.
