SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Superior Climbing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A carrion claw need not make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or
      horizontal surface (even upside down). It retains its Dexterity bonus to
      Armor Class while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their
      attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.
  - name: Vulnerable to Magical Light (Ex)
    description: >-
      A carrion claw that is the target of a spell with the light descriptor
      must succeed on a Will save or be dazed for 1 round. The Will save DC is
      equal to 10 + the spell level + the caster's key ability.
