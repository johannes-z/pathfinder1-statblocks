SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Burst (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a clockwork golem is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it explodes in
      a shower of razor-sharp gears and debris. All creatures within a 10-foot
      burst take 12d6 points of slashing damage-a DC 18 Reflex save results in
      half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Grind (Ex)
    description: >-
      A clockwork golem deals an additional 2d10+12 points of slashing damage
      when it makes a successful grapple check as razor-sharp gears and blades
      emerge from its body to grind and slice its foe.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A clockwork golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against a clockwork golem, as noted below. &#8226; A grease
      spell cast on the golem causes it to move quickly for 1d6 rounds, as if
      under the effects of haste. &#8226; A rusting grasp spell deals damage to
      a clockwork golem normally, and makes the golem staggered for 1d6 rounds
      (no save).
  - name: Wall of Gears (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a clockwork golem can fold into a whirling wall of
      grinding gears measuring 10 feet by 10 feet or 5 feet by 20 feet. Anyone
      passing through the wall takes 15d6 points of slashing damage. If the wall
      appears in a creature's space, that creature can attempt a DC 18 Reflex
      save to leap to one side and avoid the damage entirely. The clockwork
      golem can take no actions while in this form except to resume its normal
      form as a move action. A clockwork golem's AC and immunities remain the
      same while it is in this form.
