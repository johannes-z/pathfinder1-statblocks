SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Boiling Blood (Su)
    description: >-
      A brimorak's blood is boiling hot. A brimorak can cough out a hideous
      amount of this scorching fluid as a breath weapon, but the blood also
      serves the demon as a defensive ability. Any creature that damages a
      brimorak with a slashing or piercing melee weapon is sprayed by boiling
      blood, and takes 1d4 points of fire damage with each successful hit with
      such a weapon. Creatures using reach weapons are not subject to this
      damage.
  - name: Burning Hooves (Su)
    description: >-
      A brimorak's hooves burn with fire, leaving scorched hoofprints on wood,
      stone, and most every other solid surface, yet this supernatural fire does
      not set alight surfaces the demon treads upon. It does make it easier to
      track a brimorak, though-Survival checks made to track a brimorak gain a
      +8 circumstance bonus. Brimoraks use their air walk ability to throw
      creatures off their trail, or to leave their prints in strange places
      (like atop roofs) so as to spread fear and terror. Against a prone foe, a
      brimorak can make two hoof attacks rather than just one.
  - name: Flaming Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a brimorak can infuse a wielded melee weapon (including
      a two-handed weapon, but not a second weapon held in the off-hand) with
      its fiery nature, allowing it to inflict an additional 1d6 points of fire
      damage with the weapon. This fire damage stacks with any additional fire
      damage that the weapon might also inflict. The weapon loses this ability
      if it leaves the demon's grasp.
  - name: Smoke Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      A brimorak's breath manifests as clouds of foul-smelling smoke when it
      exhales. This breath surrounds the brimorak out to a radius of 5
      feet&#8211;while the smoke isn't thick enough to obscure vision or choke
      foes, it is enough to sicken breathing foes who are not immune to poison.
      A successful DC 17 Fortitude save grants immunity to a particular
      brimorak's breath for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  Savash stands his ground, using his breath weapon and spell-like abilities
  while waiting for his enemies to approach. He cackles every time one of his
  underlings slays a prisoner. If his opponents keep their distance, Savash
  closes to melee range and attack the weakest-looking PC first.
Morale: >-
  Savash has other ambitions, and uses greater teleport to flee if reduced to 10
  or fewer hit points.
