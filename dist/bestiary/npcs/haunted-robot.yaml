SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Combined Arms (Ex)
    description: >-
      As part of a full-attack action, a warden robot can attack with both its
      melee and ranged integrated weapons.
  - name: Dazzler (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a warden robot can target a single creature with a
      beam of strobing light that functions as a gaze attack with a range of 60
      feet. The target must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be blinded for
      2d4 rounds. Creatures that successfully save are instead dazzled for 1d4
      rounds. Creatures with light blindness or light sensitivity take a -4
      penalty on the saving throw. This is a light effect; the save DC is
      Intelligence-based.
  - name: Force Field (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shimmering field of energy encases this robot, granting it 75 bonus hit
      points. All damage dealt to this robot is deducted from these hit points
      first. As long as the force field is active, the robot is immune to
      critical hits. This force field has fast healing 15, but once its hit
      points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and doesn't reactivate
      for 24 hours.
  - name: Haunted (Su)
    description: >-
      The unquiet spirit of the gnome druid Jarin Sogron haunts this robot. As a
      result, the robot takes damage from positive energy as if it were an
      undead creature and can be detected by detect undead.
  - name: Infested (Ex)
    description: >-
      This robot is infested with yellow mold. Every round the robot takes an
      action or takes damage, the mold fills a 10-foot radius around the robot
      with poison spores (Core Rulebook 416). Sunlight renders the mold dormant,
      and once the robot takes a total of 25 points of fire damage, the mold
      growing on it is burned away.
  - name: Infrasonic Field (Ex)
    description: >-
      Warden robots constantly emit powerful sound waves at a frequency below
      normal hearing. These vibrations can debilitate living beings within 30
      feet. Such creatures must succeed at DC 17 Fortitude save or fall prone
      and be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. A warden robot can suppress or resume
      this ability as a free action. This is a sonic effect, and the save DC is
      Intelligence-based.
  - name: Integrated Sonic Disruptor (Ex)
    description: >-
      A warden robot's arms contain built-in ranged weapons that emit focused
      sound waves in 100-foot rays that deal 2d8 points of sonic damage.
  - name: Reactive Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      A warden robot is covered in a special shell that reacts explosively to
      powerful strikes. Due to this covering, a warden robot gains light
      fortification (25% chance to negate critical hits and sneak attacks). When
      the armor negates a critical hit from a melee weapon, the attacker takes
      an amount of fire damage equal to half of the damage dealt to the robot.
      Attackers using reach or ranged weapons avoid this damage.
  - name: Resilient (Ex)
    description: Warden robots receive a +3 racial bonus on all saving throws.
DuringCombat: >-
  The robot follows Jarin's impulses and has assumed the druid's alignment, and
  as it attacks it proclaims the PCs to be fit only for fertilizer. The robot is
  entangled on the first round of the fight, but automatically rips free from
  its roots at the start of the second round&#8211;it doesn't pursue foes from
  this room. If the positioning is right, the robot tries to bull rush foes over
  the edge of the pit into area G4.
