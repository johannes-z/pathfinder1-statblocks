BeforeCombat: >-
  Deepti drinks a potion of mage armor when she becomes aware of intruders. When
  she hears the PCs nearby, she drinks her potion of bear's endurance. (Already
  included in her statistics.)
DuringCombat: >-
  Deepti stays at range and either pelts the PCs with chakrams or uses Spring
  Attack and then leaps away, luring the PCs into chasing her onto the narrow
  pillars above the pit. She takes advantage of any shadows in the room, using
  her slippers of spider climbing to move along the wall of the pit, in and out
  of shadows cast by the columns, should PCs illuminate the room beyond its
  initial levels.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 25 hit points or fewer, Deepti fakes a fall into the deep pit in
  the training hall's center. Using her slow fall ability and a conveniently
  placed net, she makes her escape via the hidden tunnel to the fighting arena
  (B11).
