BeforeCombat: >-
  If alerted to the PCs' presence, Mifra readies her scroll of summon monster II
  and hides behind one of the tubs.
DuringCombat: >-
  Mifra stays out of melee while using darkness, speed, and stealth to bait the
  PCs into chasing her through the hazardous room. She uses her scroll to summon
  a fiendish centipede and uses her spells to neutralize other threats.
Morale: >-
  Mifra is viciously territorial, but she would rather live to torment her
  enemies than die by their hands. If Xarmigash is killed and Mifra is reduced
  to 5 hit points or fewer, she flees.
