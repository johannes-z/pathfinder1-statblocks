Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  While it revels in having a material body, Arastrax knows it lacks the
  proficiency to be truly effective in combat with its host's chosen weapons. It
  thus uses its offensive spell-like abilities as long as it can avoid direct
  contact. It relies on the babaus to distract foes and keep them at a distance,
  resorting to melee only as a last resort.
Morale: >-
  Arastrax is unconcerned about the ultimate safety of its host, and shows no
  quarter in battle even when its host is at death's door.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds
OtherGear: full plate, javelin, mwk guisarme, nets (2), sap
