DuringCombat: >-
  Valeros always attempts to attack with both his longsword and short sword each
  round. He uses the longsword alone if he cannot take a full attack action.
  Unless he absolutely must wield a weapon in two hands to gain the additional
  damage potential, he wields both swords to take advantage of his Two-Weapon
  Defense feat.
