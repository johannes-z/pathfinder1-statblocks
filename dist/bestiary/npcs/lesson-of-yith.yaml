    description: >-
      Each of the three Lessons of Yith represents a core Yithian value
      represented by a single divine domain. So long as a Lesson of Yith begins
      its turn within a 120-foot emanation of another active Lesson, it gains
      the benefits of that construct's domain until the beginning of its next
      turn.
