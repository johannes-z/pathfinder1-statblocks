    description: >-
      A bone warrior is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points, but it returns
      to unlife 1 hour later at 1 hit point, allowing its fast healing
      thereafter to resume healing it. A bone warrior can be permanently
      destroyed only if the Bloodwraith is destroyed. Fighter's
  - name: Legacy (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although they are mindless undead, the power of the Bloodwraith is such
      that, when created, the bone warriors retain their fighter feats, special
      abilities, and favored class hit points. They do not keep any feats from
      other sources such as hit dice, nor do they retain any skill ranks.
Gear: >-
  chainmail, heavy steel shield, half wield masterwork falcatas, and the rest
  wield masterwork dwarven waraxes, all but one has a golden circlet set with a
  ruby (250 gp)
