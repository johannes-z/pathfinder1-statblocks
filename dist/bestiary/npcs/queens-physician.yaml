DuringCombat: >-
  The Queen's Physicians work together in combat, seeking to team up and flank
  foes with their clubs to make sneak attacks. They fight with an eerie silence,
  coordinating their attacks with a series of hand gestures and speaking only
  when forced to.
Morale: >-
  In the presence of a superior, the physicians follow orders to the letter out
  of fear and fight to the death. On their own, they attempt to flee into hiding
  if reduced to fewer than 3 hit points.
