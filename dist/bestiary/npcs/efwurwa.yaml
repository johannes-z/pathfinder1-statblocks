    description: Efwurwa's invisibility extends to her gear.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  If any PC indicates that he can see invisible creatures, Efwurwa barks an
  order in Auran for all the Furies to gang up on that one person. Otherwise,
  she positions herself to flank multiple PCs, if possible, maximizing the
  benefits of her teamwork feats and menacing sword.
Morale: >-
  Efwurwa fights as long as there is an elemental left alive. If all her minions
  have fallen, she flees. In either case, she plays no further role in the
  scenario.
