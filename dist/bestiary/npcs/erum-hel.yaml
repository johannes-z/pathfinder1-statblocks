SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blightburn Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Erum-Hel radiates a green-white aura of blightburn radiation from his
      seething innards and the blightstone gems embedded in his skeleton. Living
      creatures within 10 feet take 2d6 points of fire damage per round and risk
      contracting blightburn sickness (see page 15). Additionally, spellcasters
      casting teleportation subschool spells either to or from within 60 feet of
      Erum-Hel must succeed at a DC 30 caster level check or the spell fails.
  - name: Create Advanced Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Humanoid creatures killed by Erum-Hel rise as mohrgs in 1d4 rounds. Mohrgs
      created in this manner are under Erum-Hel's control, as are any spawn that
      they create, and they remain enslaved until Erum-Hel is destroyed, at
      which point they become free-willed (and their fast zombie spawn fall
      under their control). The sudden surge of negative energy released when a
      mohrg is created in this manner flows through Erum- Hel-whenever the Lord
      of Mohrgs creates a spawn in this manner, he is healed of 1d6 hit points
      of damage per Hit Die possessed by the slain creature, and he acts as if
      hasted for the round immediately following the spawn's creation.
