SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Amorphous (Ex)
    description: >-
      Trappers are immune to precision damage (like sneak attacks) and critical
      hits, and can move through an area as small as one-quarter their space
      without squeezing or one-eighth their space when squeezing.
  - name: Smother (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a trapper grapples a target, it forms an airtight seal around its
      prey. A grappled target cannot speak or cast spells with verbal
      components, and must hold its breath (see Suffocation, Core Rulebook 445).
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  The Great Mother lies in wait until someone ventures into reach, then she
  grabs and smothers and constricts her victim while fending off any would-be
  rescuers with her slam attack.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, the Great Mother releases any remaining
  victims and flees north, squeezing past the rubble to reach the relative
  safety of area G19 before slipping back into the Darklands.
