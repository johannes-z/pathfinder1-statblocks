BeforeCombat: >-
  The giant constrictor snakes race toward the boat from opposite sides. It
  takes a DC 21 Perception check to see them before they explode from the water
  in the surprise round.
DuringCombat: >-
  Each snake attempts to grab the nearest PC and make a combat maneuver check
  the next round to move him and drop him in the water. Remember that PCs get a
  free combat maneuver check with a +4 bonus when grappled and moved into a
  dangerous situation (such as an icy cold lake).
Morale: >-
  The snakes fight until reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, at which point
  they flee back into the depths.
