    description: >-
      A year ago, Uktak wished to be the mightiest warrior in Crystalcrag, and
      Tygora granted him the ability to use several unique abilities up to three
      times a day in any combination. This power increases his challenge rating
      by 1. Champion's Surge: When Uktak fails a skill check or saving throw
      against an effect, he can reroll the required check with a +5 bonus to his
      roll. He may reroll this check even after the results have been announced.
      Death's Defiance: As a swift action, Uktak can call upon his extraordinary
      stamina to heal himself as though he had cast quickened cure serious
      wounds (CL 11th). Fury of Battle: As a swift action, Uktak gains the
      benefits of divine power for 1 round (CL 11th).
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Uktak waits at his master's obsidian throne as Tygora parleys with the
  Pathfinders. At the first sign of combat, Uktak wades into combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Uktak viciously attacks any foe that threatens his queen. He uses Power Attack
  liberally, though he reconsiders this tactic if he is having difficulty
  hitting.
Morale: Uktak protects Tygora at all costs and fights to the death.
OtherGear: >-
  +2 full plate, +1 heavy steel shield, +1 flaming scimitar, belt of giant
  strength +2, cloak of resistance +2
