BeforeCombat: >-
  Melkorka casts shield of faith and divine favor before stepping out to face
  the PCs; both effects are already included in her stats. If she has time, she
  also casts her scroll of entropic shield to protect her against ranged
  attacks.
DuringCombat: >-
  Melkorka uses true strike and readies her hand of the acolyte domain power to
  interrupt an enemy spellcaster on the first round or to attack the most
  heavily armored PC. After that she attacks any character who presents a
  religious symbol in an effort to cut the PCs off from healing magic. If
  surrounded, she repeatedly channels negative energy, trusting her selective
  channeling feat to shield her allies.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 5 or fewer hit points, Melkorka drinks her potion of cure
  moderate wounds. If reduced to 5 or fewer hit points a second time, she casts
  cure light wounds on herself, abandons her minions, and flees. If caught, she
  tries to use her knowledge of the Shadow Lodge to bargain for her life.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds, scroll of comprehend languages, scroll of
  entropic shield
