BeforeCombat: >-
  Lareecan casts good hope on herself and her warbirds, then casts greater
  invisibility on one of her warbirds. Lareecan then readies her scroll of wall
  of stone and stays out of sight until the party responds to her warbird's
  song.
DuringCombat: >-
  If the PCs are lured to area E by her warbird, Lareecan uses her scroll of
  wall of stone (Use Magic Device DC 25) to wall off the southern cavern, then
  casts haste on herself and her warbirds and uses inspire courage as a move
  action to boost her warbirds' attacks. She uses blindness/deafness to blind
  PCs with flight or ranged weapons. Should any PCs close with her, she casts
  hideous laughter or uses grease to disarm them. If one of her warbirds is
  seriously injured, Lareecan uses the scroll of heal to restore her subject.
  Once she has expended most of her spells, Lareecan uses her captivating song
  to lure PCs out of the fray, or switches to her bow.
Morale: If her warbirds are slain and she is clearly beaten, Lareecan flees.
