SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burn (Ex)
    description: >-
      A magma elemental's burn DC includes a -2 racial penalty, as their fires
      don't burn quite as hot as true elemental flames.
  - name: Earth Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A burrowing magma elemental can pass through stone, dirt, lava, or almost
      any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through
      water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create
      any ripple, though the area it passes through feels warm for 1 round
      afterward and often retains a strangely smooth texture, as if the stone
      had been polished. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a
      burrowing magma elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the
      creature for 1 round unless it succeeds at a DC 15 Fortitude save.
  - name: Lava Puddle (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a full-round action, a magma elemental can vomit forth a
      puddle of lava that fills its space to a depth of 2-3 inches and counts as
      difficult terrain. Any creature that moves through this puddle of lava
      takes 2d6 points of fire damage. This damage continues for 1d3 rounds
      after the creature leaves the lava pool, although then it only inflicts
      1d6 points of fire damage per round. The lava puddle solidifies and is
      safe to touch after 8 rounds. At the GM's discretion, this puddle of lava
      could start secondary fires.
