SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bloodless (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sister Perversion is immune to bleed effects and to attacks that utilize
      blood drain to function.
  - name: Compelling Domination (Su)
    description: >-
      When Sister Perversion uses dominate person (as a spell or spell-like
      ability), its victims do not actively resist the control and do not gain a
      new saving throw when ordered to take actions against their nature unless
      those actions are obviously self-destructive, in which case the victim
      does get a new saving throw with a +2 bonus to escape the effects of the
      domination.
  - name: Gaze of Despair (Su)
    description: >-
      Sister Perversion's gaze fills the minds of those within 30 feet with
      overwhelming and soul-crushing despair. Anyone who fails a DC 27 Will save
      upon being exposed to her gaze immediately takes 1d6 points of Charisma
      drain and is staggered for 1d6 rounds. If the Charisma drain would
      normally reduce a creature's Charisma to 0, that creature instead succumbs
      to overwhelming suicidal urges and attempts to end its life by the most
      convenient method at hand, subject to GM discretion. (In most cases, this
      effect causes a creature to make a coup de grace attempt on itself, but if
      a more dramatic method of self-destruction is available, the creature
      takes that action.) Once a creature reaches this suicidal state of
      despair, it remains in that state until its Charisma score is restored to
      its normal maximum-if methods of restoring lost Charisma are not
      available, the suicidal victim must be restrained at all times to prevent
      attempts to kill itself. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Grab (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sister Perversion gains a cumulative +4 bonus on grapple attempts for each
      successive claw attack that hits in a single round, provided the claw
      attacks all hit the same target. If she grabs a foe, she can use her
      ravenous embrace.
  - name: Ravenous Embrace (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round, a creature grappling or grappled by Sister Perversion can
      be attacked by the ravenous, toothed wounds that decorate her arms. These
      teeth bite and chew, automatically dealing 4d6+12 points of damage each
      round&#8211;in addition, the wounds caused by the ravenous embrace cause
      2d6 points of bleed damage and 1d4 points of Strength drain as the
      seraptis drinks away the victim's blood and other vital fluids. As long as
      the seraptis is within 30 feet of a foe suffering bleed damage from her
      ravenous embrace, the blood that flows from the victim writhes through the
      air into the seraptis's arm maws, healing the seraptis by an amount equal
      to the amount caused by that round's bleed effect.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Sister Perversion casts a mental alarm three times per day on the balcony
  outside the door to her room, and undetectable alignment on herself every day.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once released from Nocticula's control, Sister Perversion is stunned for the
  first round of combat. After this, she immediately teleports elsewhere in Iz
  to prepare for combat by casting fly and invisibility, then uses demand to
  contact a PC to suggest that PC should undress and cast aside all of his or
  her equipment. Sister Perversion then casts mythic invisibility on herself and
  returns to attack, starting the fight with dominate person and mythic
  confusion and switching to melee attacks once her foes are scattered and
  distracted by her mind-controlling magic (or sooner if it becomes apparent her
  enemies are resistant or immune to these tactics).
Morale: >-
  Sister Perversion fights to the death rather than face punishment for failure
  from Mistress Anemora.
Gear: >-
  +5 mithral chain shirt, +5 keen scythe, dimensional shackles, ring of evasion,
  assorted jewelry worth a total of 4,400 gp
