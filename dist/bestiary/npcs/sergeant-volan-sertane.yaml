DuringCombat: >-
  Volan attacks with his sword and spiked shield, targeting humans when possible
  to take advantage of his favored enemy bonus. Against heavily armored
  opponents, he switches to single attacks with his longsword instead, pausing
  only to drink a potion of cure light wounds to keep going.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, Volan realizes the battle has turned
  against him. He takes the total defense action and uses a move action to
  retrieve his attentive mirror to warn Radosek about the danger the PCs pose
  before they can overwhelm him (see Development, below).
Gear: >-
  potions of cure light wounds (2), potion of endure elements, potion of
  interrogationUM (CL 4th), screaming bolts (2)
OtherGear: >-
  chain shirt, spiked light steel shield, dagger, mwk cold iron longsword, mwk
  light crossbow with 10 bolts, attentive mirror (see page 60), cold-weather
