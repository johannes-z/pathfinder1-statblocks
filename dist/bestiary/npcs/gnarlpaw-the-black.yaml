  If Gnarlpaw believes he will soon face combat, he casts magic weapon on his
  falchion and drinks his potion of barkskin. He then casts invisibility in
  order to get the jump on foes.
DuringCombat: >-
  Gnarlpaw casts his 4th-level spells first to deal maximum damage, and he keeps
  his falchion ready for melee attacks. He relies on magic to hinder foes while
  he hacks through them with his blade.
