SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, the squealing cythnigot can adopt a hideous stance
      that causes any creature within 10 feet to become sickened for 1 round if
      it fails a DC 10 Will save. This is a mind-affecting gaze attack. The save
      DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Spores (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature bitten by a cythnigot must make a DC 12 Fortitude save or
      become infested by quickly growing, semi-animate tangles of fungal
      growths-doing so causes the victim to become entangled. As a standard
      action, an entangled character can try to rip the tendrils free; this
      requires a DC 12 Fortitude save. Plant creatures take a &#8211;4 penalty
      on saves against this effect. The effects of multiple bites do not stack.
      This is a disease effect; the save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The cythnigot attacks whoever is closest&#8211;be that target a PC or a
  villager&#8211;unless a creature attacks it, in which case it attacks the foe
  that seems to be able to do the most damage to it.
Morale: >-
  Once reduced below 11 hit points, the cythnigot flees by flying away into the
  southern swamps.
