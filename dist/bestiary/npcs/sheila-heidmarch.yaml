    description: >-
      Sheila Heidmarch's ability scores use a 20-point build, and she has the
      wealth of a PC rather than an NPC. These advantages increase her CR by 1.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Sheila drinks a potion of haste on the first round of combat. She always
  fights with the +1 bonus from her quarterstaff allocated to her Armor Class
  (these modifiers are built into the stats above). Sheila also uses Combat
  Expertise to further increase her AC by +2, at the cost of a &#8211;2 penalty
  on attack rolls. Note that since her quarterstaff always deals nonlethal
  damage, she can make an Intimidate check to demoralize a target as a free
  action when she damages a foe in that way, thanks to her Enforcer feat.
Morale: >-
  Sheila never flees combat if allies remain in danger. Otherwise, if reduced to
  fewer than 15 hit points she makes a fighting retreat or flees.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, potions of haste (2)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 merciful defending quarterstaff, headband of inspired wisdom +2, ring of
  protection +1, wayfinder, 23 pp
