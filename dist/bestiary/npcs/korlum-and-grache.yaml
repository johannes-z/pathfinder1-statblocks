BeforeCombat: >-
  If they're alerted to the PCs, Korlum and Grache each drink a potion of
  enlarge person to increase their damage output. This hasn't been factored into
  their statistics.
DuringCombat: >-
  Despite their crude intellects, Korlum and Grache are experts at fighting
  alongside one another, and make clever use of flanking and other combat
  tactics. They use their martial flexibility to gain feats that allow them to
  control the battlefield (such as Improved Bull Rush or Step Up) or feats that
  allow them to damage multiple opponents (such as Cleave).
Morale: >-
  If one of the brothers falls unconscious, the other fights until reduced to 10
  or fewer hit points, at which point he surrenders, knowing that they've been
  beaten.
