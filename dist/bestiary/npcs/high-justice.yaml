DuringCombat: >-
  The High Justice remains seated on his throne as the battle begins, casting
  his spell-like abilities at range against the PCs. On the first round of
  combat, he sends Karzoug's soul to the holding cell in area B7 as a free
  action and roars in anger-a howl that immediately calls the daemons from area
  B5, the undead from area B4, and the sphinxes from area B2 to come and join
  the battle if they haven't already been defeated. Once confronted in melee, or
  once all four thanadaemons are slain, the High Justice stands up to make melee
  attacks. He consigns Xanderghul's soul to the harvest pit to heal himself if
  he's reduced to 100 or fewer hit points, but he can only do so while seated in
  the throne.
Morale: The High Justice fights to the death.
