SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Object of Desire (Su)
    description: >-
      While using its detect thoughts ability, an erodaemon can see into the
      mind of a humanoid and identify the person the target most desires,
      whether it be a lost loved one or an object of lust. As a full-round
      action, the erodaemon can change into the form of this desired person as
      long as the target is a Small, Medium, or Large humanoid. The erodaemon
      gains a +20 bonus on its Disguise and Bluff checks to impersonate that
      person and avoid being detected as a fraud, but spells like true seeing
      negate this effect as normal. This effect ends if the erodaemon attacks
      any creature. Actions that could reveal the erodaemon as a fraud (such as
      performing an action that the imitated person would obviously not do, like
      cast a spell or speak Infernal) require the erodaemon to attempt an
      immediate Bluff check to continue the impersonation, with the erodaemon
      losing some or all of its bonus depending on the severity of the breach
      (GM's discretion).
  - name: Wilting Kiss (Su)
    description: >-
      An erodaemon can draw a mortal into a state of obsession with its kiss. An
      unwilling victim must be grappled before the erodaemon can use this
      ability. A creature affected by this kiss must succeed at a DC 25 Will
      save or become obsessed with the erodaemon, an obsession the erodaemon
      feeds on. Each round the target is more than 30 feet away from the
      erodaemon, it must attempt an additional DC 25 Will save. Failing the save
      means that the sheer pain of her absence deals 1 point of Charisma drain
      to the subject that round. Succeeding at the Will save two consecutive
      times ends the effects of this ability. Spells such as dispel magic and
      break enchantment end this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Unable to summon ceustodaemon allies inside the chapel's forbiddance effect,
  Serafina casts quickened crushing despair and unnatural lust on her foes, then
  attempts to grapple an unaffected character to give it a wilting kiss. If hard
  pressed, she defends herself with enervation, her claws, and snake-tail bite.
Morale: >-
  Serafina attempts to flee to Rasputin's side in area H6 if reduced to fewer
  than 90 hit points. If cornered, however, she fights to the death.
