SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Curse of Lycanthropy (Su)
    description: >-
      A natural lycanthrope's bite attack in animal or hybrid form infects a
      humanoid target with lycanthropy (Fortitude DC 15 negates). If the
      victim's size is not within one size category of the lycanthrope, this
      ability has no effect.
  - name: Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      In any form, natural lycanthropes can communicate and empathize with
      animals related to their animal form. They can use Diplomacy to alter such
      an animal's attitude, and when so doing gain a +4 racial bonus on the
      check. Afflicted lycanthropes only gain this ability in animal or hybrid
      form.
