BeforeCombat: >-
  If alerted to enemies approaching, the cultists wait until they can hear the
  PCs on the stairs, and cast magic circle against evil, aid, and entropic
  shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  To begin, two cultists take positions facing the stairs and engage the PCs in
  combat with their crossbows. The other two position themselves along the wall
  on either side of the staircase exit and lay down blast runes in the four
  squares directly in front of the stairs, renewing them as needed if the party
  does not take the bait and rush into action. Once the PCs are in the room, all
  four cultists cast divine favor and engage the party in melee,   using Channel
  Smite until out of channeling uses. They use their attack spells as needed to
  hinder the party.
Morale: >-
  After losing half their hit points, the cultists cast cure light wounds on
  themselves. If reduced to 20 or fewer hit points, they drink their potions.
  Otherwise, the cultists fight to the death in defense of their goddess's holy
  site.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds
OtherGear: >-
  +1 breastplate, masterwork heavy steel shield, +1 flail, masterwork light
  crossbow, silver holy symbol, spell component pouch
