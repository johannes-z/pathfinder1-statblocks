SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Water Child (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because of his aquatic elf ancestry, Mase gains a +4 racial bonus on Swim
      checks and can always take 10 while swimming. This alternate racial trait
      replaces the adaptability and multitalented racial traits.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Mase casts barkskin, bull's strength, and protection from energy (fire) on
  himself ahead of any battle. If he anticipates fighting in the water or close
  quarters combat, he casts freedom of movement as well.
DuringCombat: >-
  Initially, Mase prefers to use air walk or wild shape into a Medium air
  elemental to rise above the battlefield. From that vantage point, he pelts
  anyone under him with ball lightning, call lightning, sleet storm, or his
  lightning lord domain ability, utilizing his Natural Spell feat if necessary.
  He casts warp wood to render the ranged weapons of attackers useless. After
  softening up his opposition with these tactics, Mase returns to the ground,
  targeting humans whenever possible with his scimitar.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 25 hit points or fewer, Mase attempts to withdraw, screening
  himself with fog cloud or obscuring mist so he can wild shape into an
  elemental and move away at maximum speed.
Gear: elemental gem (water)
OtherGear: >-
  +2 brine dragonhide breastplate, +1 human bane scimitar, +1 trident, belt of
  mighty constitution +2, ring of protection +1, silver holy symbol of Gozreh,
  spell component pouch
