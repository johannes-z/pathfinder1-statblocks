BeforeCombat: >-
  Mueritt hears the commotion in the hallways, and knows that there are
  intruders in the fortress. She casts bull's strength, freedom of movement,
  shield of faith, and wrathful mantle on herself, and weapon of awe on her
  warhammer. The benefits of all of these spells are already calculated in to
  her statistics.
DuringCombat: >-
  Mueritt uses copycat to make herself more difficult to hit. She casts blessing
  of fervor when Xixel and Xemaki are in the room, then targets PCs with her
  spells. She does not use her channel negative energy when both xorns are in
  the room, because she can only exclude one of them.
Morale: >-
  Mueritt is a religious zealot who fights in Droskar's name. She fights to the
  death to defend her forge.
Gear: wand of cure light wounds
OtherGear: >-
