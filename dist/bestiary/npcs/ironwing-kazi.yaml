SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Barrowood Senses (Su)
    description: >-
      As a dedicated defender of the Barrowood, Ironwing Kazi has the
      greensightMA ability and detect evil as a constant spell-like ability.
  - name: Deflect Attacks (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per round, when Ironwing Kazi or her rider is hit by a melee or
      ranged attack, she can attempt a melee attack with a +16 attack bonus to
      deflect the attack with one of her wings. If the result equals or exceeds
      the result from the opponent's attack roll, Kazi or her rider is
      unaffected by the attack (as if the attack had missed).
  - name: Legendary Talons (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ironwing Kazi's talons are as sharp as the most masterfully forged sword,
      and have a critical threat range of 18-20.
  - name: Power Dive (Ex)
    description: >-
      When flying, Ironwing Kazi can move up to four times her speed when she
      charges. If her charge begins 40 or more feet above her target, her first
      attack deals double the normal amount of damage. Kazi must be flying
      downward at an angle of 45 degrees or steeper to use this ability.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Vlasko casts greater magic fang on Kazi every day, and freedom of movement and
  resist energy (fire) before they enter combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kazi loves to power dive at her opponents, especially pesky spellcasters and
  ranged combatants. Preferring hit-and-run tactics, she settles only when she
  has the tactical advantage or as part of some desperate gambit to defeat a
  spellcaster.
Morale: >-
  Kazi is nearly fearless, and would not hesitate to fight to the death, but she
  has sworn an oath to protect and defend Vlasko, so she retreats if he is
  reduced to 20 hit points or fewer.
