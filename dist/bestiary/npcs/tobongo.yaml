SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animate Trees (Sp)
    description: >-
      A tobongo can animate any trees within 180 feet at will, controlling up to
      two trees at a time. It takes 1 full round for a tree to uproot itself,
      after which it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a standard treant
      (Pathfinder Bestiary 266), gaining the treant's vulnerability to fire
      (although it has only one slam attack and lacks the treant's animation and
      rock-throwing abilities). If the tobongo that animated it terminates the
      animation, moves out of range, or is incapacitated, the tree immediately
      takes root wherever it is and returns to its normal state.
  - name: Curse of Barkflesh (Su)
    description: >-
      Following a successful grapple, a tobongo can dig its spiky branches into
      its victim, infecting it with a foul and potent curse. Unless the victim
      succeeds at a DC 20 Fortitude save, its flesh immediately begins to harden
      and grow uncontrollably like tree bark, and it takes 1d4 points of
      Dexterity damage per day until his Dexterity reaches 0. At this point, the
      victim turns entirely stiff, grows roots, and transforms into a new,
      unintelligent tree, preventing any form of resurrection short of wish or
      miracle. The effect can be slowed by pruning the victim once per hour,
      slicing off the strange growths. Pruning deals 1d6 points of damage to the
      victim, but it negates the need to make a new Fortitude save. If the
      victim goes without pruning for more than an hour, the barkflesh takes
      over and the victim must immediately succeed at the Fortitude save for the
      day or take the Dexterity damage. The save DC is Wisdom-based. Curse of
      Barkflesh: Grapple-injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/ day; effect 1d4
      Dex damage, when Dex reaches 0, target transforms into a tree.
  - name: Double Damage Against Objects (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tobongo or animated tree that makes a full attack against an object or
      structure deals double damage.
  - name: Shake the Earth (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a rooted tobongo can uproot itself, buckling the
      surrounding earth in a 60-foot radius. Living creatures within the radius
      must succeed at a DC 29 Reflex save or fall prone and take 1d6 points of
      damage. Manmade structures within the area of effect must succeed at a DC
      29 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of structural damage. Once uprooted,
      the tobongo cannot use this action again until it re-roots itself. It
      takes the creature at least 1 hour to root effectively. The save DC is
      Strength-based.
  - name: Treespeech (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tobongo has the ability to converse with plants as if subject to a
      continual speak with plants spell, and most plants greet it with an
      attitude of friendly or helpful.
