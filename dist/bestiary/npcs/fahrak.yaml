  Fahrak is a straightforward and blunt warrior, respected more for his social
  cunning than his tactical acumen. He prefers to battle astride his dire wolf
  mount, using Power Attack and Ride-By Attack to their fullest benefit. If
  dismounted, he instead keeps his distance, hurling axes and alchemist's fire
  as long as possible.
Morale: Fahrak fights to the death.
