  domain, she casts bear's endurance, mage armor, and resist energy (selecting
  an energy type she sees the intruders rely on) on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zanathura the Second casts black tentacles on her enemies before using vanish
  to hide and allow her bodyguards to confront intruders. Finally, she casts
  elemental aura on herself (preferring acid) and closes to melee, using
  vampiric touch as often as possible.

  With nowhere to go, Zanathura the Second fights to the death. If reduced below
  0 hit points, she reverts back to the snow and ice from which she was formed.
