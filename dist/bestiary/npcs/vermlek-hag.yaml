  The vermleks telepathically command the two armed humans to attack the PCs.
  The disguised vermleks then use their spells and spell-like abilities to
  cripple and harry the PCs. A vermlek uses evil eye on any PC who approaches
  within 30 feet.
Morale: >-
  The vermleks use the abandon flesh ability to revert to their natural form if

  burrows to safety.
