    description: >-
      Each night, Kalkamedes suffers from magically induced form of sleepwalking
      from which he cannot be roused. While sleepwalking, his Speed is reduced
      to 20 feet and he is considered flat-footed at all times. Already asleep,
      he is immune to sleep and nonlethal damage.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Kalkamedes ignores most foes, obliviously walking straight past them. If
  someone blocks his path, he throws a sudden punch and then attempts to keep
  moving. He also fights vigorously if grappled or pinned. Once free, he ignores
  the grappler and continues his march.
Morale: >-
  Regardless of what punishment he endures, Kalkamedes marches for the Black
  Edifice, crawling if he must. Although he cannot fall unconscious, he
  collapses and cannot act if reduced to a negative hit point total.
