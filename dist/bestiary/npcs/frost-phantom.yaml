    description: >-
      As a move action, a frost phantom can turn invisible as if using greater
      invisibility (caster level 7th). A moment after it attacks invisibly, the
      creature appears briefly as a transparent version of its normal self. This
      allows any viewer with line of sight to the frost phantom to pinpoint its
      location at the time of the attack (though if the creature moves after it
      attacks, opponents have to pinpoint it again). An opponent can ready an
      action to strike at the fungus when it momentarily appears, in which case
      the creature only has concealment instead of invisibility (20% miss
      chance). The fungus can turn completely visible as a move action, though
      it normally remains invisible all the time. If killed while invisible, it
      becomes visible 1d4 minutes later.
