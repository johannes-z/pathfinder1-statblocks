    description: >-
      Twice per day, a war wisp can transform into lightning as a standard
      action and instantly travel in a straight line to a distance of up to 50
      feet, rematerializing in the new location as a free action. This movement
      does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures in this line take 7d6
      points of electrical damage and are staggered for 1 round (a successful DC
      16 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the staggered condition). The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The war wisps are immune to the various glyphs and traps in the room and try
  to lure the PCs into triggering them.
