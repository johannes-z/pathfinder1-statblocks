BeforeCombat: Ithanothaur casts mage armor before entering combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ithanothaur opens combat by blasting the party with his shadow breath. He then
  takes to the air for a few rounds while he casts invisibility and mirror
  image, before swooping down to make a few Flyby Attacks (using Arcane Strike
  with his bite attack) while his breath weapon recharges. He then blasts the
  party again with his shadow breath before landing amid them to fight in melee,
  using Arcane Strike to bolster his attacks. If reduced to 100 or fewer hit
  points, he uses dimension door to retreat to area C4a, then uses his inflict
  wounds spells to heal his damage before returning to combat above. The dragon
  would prefer to defeat the PCs without killing them if possible, so that he
  can interrogate them after they recover, but if the PCs attack a second time,
  he won't hesitate to kill.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 50 or fewer hp, Ithanothaur flees, preferably by using shadow
  walk to return to his lair in the mountains to the south. Whether or not the
  umbral dragon seeks revenge on the PCs at a later date is left to you to
  decide.
