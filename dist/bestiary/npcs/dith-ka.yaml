BeforeCombat: >-
  Dith-ka loads three doses of sassone leaf residue into his poisoned sand tube,
  applies blue whinnis to his five shuriken and a dose of bloodroot to his
  wakizashi, then drinks his potion of spider climb. He climbs up to a window to
  enter the suite, using Disable Device if the PCs latched the window (this also
  requires a Stealth check from the bugbear, opposed by the PCs within the
  suite, to avoid alerting the PCs to his presence).
DuringCombat: >-
  If he gets into the PCs' suite undetected, Dith-ka attempts a coup de grace on
  a sleeping target, hoping to assassinate as many PCs as possible before they
  wake. Once the PCs are awake, Dith-ka stays mobile, using his ranged attacks
  to poison the PCs for several rounds (he saves his sand tube for the best
  chance to get at least two or more PCs in its area of effect). In melee, he
  uses his swift poison ability to reapply bloodroot to his wakizashi each
  round.
Morale: >-
  Dith-ka fights until reduced to fewer than 20 hp, at which point he attempts
  to escape. If captured, he attempts to end his life with one of his most
  potent poisons rather than divulge his employers (in this case, the cult of
  the Peacock Spirit), but if forced to comply, he can reveal little more than
  what's contained in his note from Hira.
