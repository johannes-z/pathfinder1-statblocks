SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ceaseless Performance (Su)
    description: >-
      Zann can continue to take a free action to maintain his bardic performance
      even while confused, cowering in fear, dazed, nauseated, panicked,
      paralyzed, petrified, silenced, staggered, stunned, or unconscious. Even
      if he is killed, he can continue to take a free action to maintain his
      performance as long as he has rounds remaining. Only the utter destruction
      of the Zann's body (such as via destruction or disintegrate or reducing
      the bard to -70 hit points) causes the performance to end.
  - name: Maddening Harmonics (Su)
    description: >-
      Zann can create a performance so baffling and discordant that it usurps
      all thought within a 30-foot radius with chaos and entropy. Zann can
      select which creatures in this area are affected by the maddening
      harmonics and which are not. All targeted creatures within this area must
      succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 23) or be confused for as long as they
      can hear the performance. If a creature succeeds at its saving throw, it
      is immune to this ability for 24 hours. This performance relies on audible
      components.
  - name: Symphony of Silence (Su)
    description: >-
      Zann's music muffles all other sounds within a 30-foot radius. All
      creatures in the area of effect gain a +5 bonus on all saving throws
      against sonic attacks or language-dependent effects. Symphony of silence
      relies on audible components.
  - name: Dulled Horror (Ex)
    description: >-
      Zann gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against confusion, fear, insanity
      effects, and the supernatural abilities of aberrations.
  - name: Eldritch Caesura (Su)
    description: >-
      Zann can insert unsettling silences into his otherworldly music by
      spending 1 additional round of bardic performance per round. This
      supernatural technique impossibly blurs the line between music and light,
      transmitting audible performances and sonic bard spells through most
      barriers save lead. This allows the music and sonic spells to affect
      creatures across planar boundaries (including creatures on the Ethereal
      Plane or Shadow Plane), vacuums, and areas of magical silence.
  - name: Mute (Ex)
    description: >-
      Erich Zann is unable to speak. Language-dependent effects (including
      Perform [oratory]) require him to be able to use telepathy, nonverbal
      languages, or writing to communicate. He can't use Perform (sing) or speak
      languages, though he can still create audible bardic performances by means
      of a musical instrument. Zann can provide verbal and somatic components
      for spells he casts via his violin.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-

  them from the horrors of Carcosa.
Morale: >-
  Erich is timid when personally confronted with combat. His actions are largely
  based on how his companions fare in the fight.
