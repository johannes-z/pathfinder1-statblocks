  - name: Gourd Vessel (Ex)
    description: >-
      The gourd that surrounds the malevolent spirit provides it some
      protection, granting the spirit channel resistance. However, it also
      renders the creature vulnerable to additional spells and effects. A
      possessed gourd counts as either a plant or an undead, whichever is worse,
      but it still does not count as a living creature.
DuringCombat: >-
  The possessed gourds attack the nearest conscious creature that is not the
  jack-o'-lantern.
Morale: The possessed gourds fight until destroyed.
