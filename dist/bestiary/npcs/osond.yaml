BeforeCombat: Osond casts barkskin before entering combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Osond lets his hunters engage foes while he hangs back to cast defensive
  spells like bear's endurance, bull's strength, and protection from energy. He
  interrupts these spells to cast supporting spells into a battle to aid his
  allies or to provide additional summoned monsters as allies. Once half his
  hunters have fallen, Osond steps in to join in melee, using wild shape to
  assume the form of a Medium air elemental to fight.
Morale: Osond fights to the death.

  (feathered cloak that functions as wings of flying), ring of protection +1,
