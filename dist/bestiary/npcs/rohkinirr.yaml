BeforeCombat: >-
  Rohkinirr casts mage armor and shield of faith before combat. He also has an
  unseen servant to assist him from approximately noon to dusk.
DuringCombat: >-
  Rohkinirr activates his fly hex on the first round of combat to avoid being
  pinned down in melee combat, to move behind cover from ranged weapons, and to
  bull rush opponents off the catwalks. He commands his unseen servant to open a
  spigot on one of the vats, making the brewery floor slippery, difficult
  terrain. Rohkinirr targets dangerous opponents with his slumber hex,
  interspersed with quickened spells. His Accursed Hex feat allows him to reuse
  his slumber hex on enemies who successfully save against the hex. He attempts
  to deafen spellcasters with blindness/ deafness, and casts glitterdust, ice
  slick, or vomit swarm against foes who engage him in melee combat.
Morale: >-
  Rohkinirr attempts to flee using his flight hex to when reduced to fewer than
  50 hit points, casting glitterdust or stinking cloud to cover his escape if
  necessary.
