BeforeCombat: Corla applies a dose of blue whinnis to her kukri.
DuringCombat: >-
  Corla focuses her attacks on Baraket's carrier, hoping to incapacitate that PC
  long enough to liberate the sword and hand it over to her mistress. If
  successful, the first round the halfling claims the weapon, she must attempt a
  DC 15 Will save to avoid being stunned for 1 round as the sword, sensing a
  change of ownership to someone who might not have the protection afforded by
  runewarded gauntlets, momentarily lashes out. If Corla fails this save, she
  drops the sword, giving the PCs a last chance to reclaim it. Baraket can lash
  out in this way only once, the power it has built up over the last few weeks
  expended.
Morale: >-
  Corla fights to the death to protect Viralane and carry out her orders, but
  once the woman abandons her, the halfling immediately surrenders, overcome
  with grief and despair at the betrayal.
