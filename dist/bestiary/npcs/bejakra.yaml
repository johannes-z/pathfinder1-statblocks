BeforeCombat: >-
  Bejakra maintains her guise as Corrgin using her ring of chameleon power; she
  donned her reaper's mask days ago and has already recovered from the Charisma
  damage it dealt to her. She uses a dose of dust of disappearance just before
  combat, then drinks a potion of barkskin and a potion of shield of faith.
DuringCombat: >-
  Bejakra starts with a death attack. She uses her swift death ability if denied
  this time to prepare, or in the round immediately after making her opening
  death attack. As long as she remains unseen via dust of disappearance, she
  continues making sneak attacks, focusing on healers and spellcasters first
  unless one of the PCs has established himself as a zealous opponent of the
  church of Norgorber. She uses her reaper's mask's confusion effect if
  surrounded. If her invisibility is compromised, she starts calling in jorogumo
  allies while attempting to flee, hide, and apply a second dose of dust. If she
  fights with Balgorrah, the kukri uses fear as soon as she becomes visible so
  she can take advantage of her shatter defenses ability to make sneak attacks
  against frightened foes.
Morale: >-
  Bejakra flees if reduced to fewer than 30 hp, using a dose of dust of
  disappearance if possible. She is unlikely to attempt a second assassination
  attempt on the PCs and certainly doesn't bother going after Nereza once the
  negotiations conclude. She may return at a later date with more allies
  (perhaps even significant worshipers of Norgorber from Vyre) to attempt to
  visit Father Skinsaw's wrath upon the party.

  faith +5 (2)
