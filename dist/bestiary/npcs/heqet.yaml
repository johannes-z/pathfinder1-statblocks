  - name: Lost Soul Bond (Su)
    description: >-
      Heqet is magically bound to the bodaks in area K26 and can sense their
      presence and general condition as if she were casting a status spell. By
      concentrating, Heqet can see through the eyes of any of the bodaks. In
      addition, she is empowered whenever one of the bodaks is destroyed,
      gaining 10 temporary hit points, a +2 profane bonus to her Strength score,
      and a +1 profane bonus to her channel resistance. Currently, one of the
      bodaks has been destroyed (the bonuses she received from that bodak's
      destruction are already included in her statistics). If the other five
      bodaks are destroyed, she gains 50 additional temporary hit points, an
      additional +10 bonus to her Strength (giving her a +5 profane bonus on her
      melee attack rolls and damage rolls), and an additional +5 profane bonus
      to her channel resistance.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Heqet can sense what the bodaks in area K26 experience and see through their
  eyes. As soon as they fall under attack, she casts magic vestment on her
  shield and freedom of movement. Based on the PCs' tactics, she also casts
  resist energy against a suitable energy type and spell immunity against
  appropriate spells (such as holy smite, searing light, and undeath to death).
  Once all of the bodaks have been destroyed or the PCs appear to be heading
  toward her tomb, Heqet casts shield of faith, spell resistance, and wrathful
  mantle.
DuringCombat: >-
  Heqet casts summon monster VI just before breaking through the secret door (or
  on the first round of combat) to summon 1d3 babau allies. She immediately
  targets the nearest enemy (or anyone openly displaying the holy symbol of a
  good-aligned deity) with destruction, followed by her most powerful spells,
  including blasphemy, chain lightning, and unholy blight. If pressed into melee
  combat, Heqet casts divine power and transforms her rod of the viper into a
  serpent.
Morale: Heqet fights until destroyed.
Gear: scroll of blade barrier
OtherGear: >-
  +2 breastplate, mwk heavy steel shield, rod of the viper, adamantine and
  platinum unholy symbol of Areshkagal (worth 500 gp)
