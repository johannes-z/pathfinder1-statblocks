    description: >-
      Balimar and Balio spent millennia bound together by puppet strings. They
      cannot move more than 5 feet away from one another, but may occupy the
      same square without penalty. Consequently, Balimar benefits from his
      shield ally class ability at all times (already figured into his stats).
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Balimar leaves physical combat to Balio, using his spells to buff and heal his
  eidolon as needed and flinging fireballs from his wand.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to less than half his total hit points, Balimar apologizes for
  antagonizing the PCs and offers to write them a new play to accentuate their
  individual talents.
Gear: wand of fireball (CL 10th, 13 charges)
OtherGear: +2 chain shirt, +1 dagger, 348 gp
