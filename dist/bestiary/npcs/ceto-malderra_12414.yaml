BeforeCombat: >-
  Ceto casts freedom of movement and activates her sacred armor ability to grant
  her banded mail the energy resistance (fire) special ability. As soon as Ceto
  is aware she isn't alone in the Ossuaries of the Fallen, she casts bull's
  strength, divine favor, and shield of faith.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ceto targets arcane spellcasters or the weakest opponent she can see. As she
  attacks with Lion's Paw, she uses her first two swift actions to gain the
  battle lust power of the War blessing and to add +3 to her weapon's
  enhancement bonus with her sacred weapon ability.
Morale: >-
  Ceto knows that she has been caught in a cowardly act and that her reputation
  would never recover even if Vigil does. If reduced to fewer than 30 hit
  points, she drinks her potion of gaseous form and retreats somewhere to
  recover her strength. She then hunts down the PCs and fights to the death.
Gear: potion of gaseous form
OtherGear: >-
  banded mail of luck, Lion's Paw (Large +1 distractingACG mithral longsword),
  mwk composite longbow (+4 Str) with 20 arrows, belt of mighty constitution +4,
  circlet of persuasion, cloak of resistance +4
