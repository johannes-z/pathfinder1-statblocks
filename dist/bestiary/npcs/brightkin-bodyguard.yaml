DuringCombat: >-
  The bodyguards attempt to keep their foes at reach and disarm them with their
  bills if possible. If forced into close quarters, the bodyguards use shield
  bashes. As much as possible they stay adjacent to each other to best gain  the
  benefits of their feats (the benefits of their teamwork feats are not included
  in this stat block). Furthermore, the bodyguards keep themselves between Singe
  and the majority of their enemies. They use Power Attack only if they are
  easily hitting their foes.
Morale: >-
  While Singe Brightkin lives, these bodyguards fight until destroyed. They
  immediately surrender if Singe is slain and they're reduced below 5 hit
  points. Finally, if Singe surrenders, they do as well.
Gear: breastplate, heavy steel shield, billUE, javelins (4)
