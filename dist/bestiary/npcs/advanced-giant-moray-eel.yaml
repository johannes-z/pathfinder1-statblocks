    description: >-
      If a giant moray begins a round with a grabbed foe, it inflicts automatic
      bite damage (2d6+9 points of damage). A giant moray eel possesses a second
      set of jaws in its throat that aid in swallowing-it can make a second bite
      attack (+11 attack, 1d6+4) against a foe it has already grabbed.
  - name: Grab (Ex)
    description: >-
      If the giant moray eel hits with its bite, it deals normal damage and
      attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack
      of opportunity. Grab works only against opponents at least one size
      category smaller than the creature. The creature has the option to conduct
      the grapple normally, or simply use the part of its body it used in the
      grab to hold the opponent. If it chooses to do the latter, it takes a -20
      penalty on its CMB check to make and maintain the grapple, but does not
      gain the grappled condition itself. Each successful grapple check it makes
      during successive rounds automatically deals the damage indicated for the
      attack that established the hold.
DuringCombat: The eels attack whomever the skum tell them to.
Morale: The eels flee if brought below 5 hit points.
