DuringCombat: >-
  While scouting at night, a Lastwall border scout is sure to imbibe her potion
  of darkvision and stay close to her allies. In combat, she uses her bow to
  strike down foes from a great distance, taking to melee only as a last resort.
  Smokesticks allow the rangers to send signals to one another while split up,
  and alchemist's fire ensures that they can make short work of any trolls or
  other nasty foes they encounter.
Morale: >-
  If pressed by a force they cannot hope to defeat alone, Lastwall border scouts
  do their best to evade and lose any enemies following them before returning to
  Castle Everstand or another nearby Lastwall border fort.
