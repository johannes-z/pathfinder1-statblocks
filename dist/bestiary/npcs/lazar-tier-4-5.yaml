BeforeCombat: >-
  Lazar cast mage armor from a scroll before he and Hjort's other companions
  raided the armory. As soon as Hjort begins slinging insults at the PCs, Lazar
  casts shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Lazar stays in the back, hitting the toughest PCs with scorching ray, magic
  missile, and flaming sphere to capitalize on the +2 damage from intense
  spells. He then switches to his wand of magic missile. He casts burning hands
  and invisibility should any PCs close on him, and moves back out of range and
  resorts to force missiles if out of other options.
Morale: Lazar fights until reduced to below 7 hit points, at which point he flees.
Gear: >-
  scroll of grease, scroll of mage armor, scrolls of sleep (2), wand of magic
  missile (15 charges)
