SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Shaking Bellow (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, Lokansir can loose an earth-shaking bellow that
      functions like an earthquake spell, affecting a 40-foot-cone.
  - name: Meld Into Earth (Su)
    description: >-
      At will, Lokansir can meld into earth (not solid stone) as if using the
      meld into stone spell, except that he may remain in the earth as long as
      he wishes. A move earth spell cast upon his location causes him to be
      expelled from the earth and take 5d6 points of damage. While melded with
      earth, he gains fast healing 1.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Lokansir isn't too bright, and his combat tactics reflect that. He rarely
  bothers moving around much in combat except to get in reach of enemies to
  crush them with his favorite club. He avoids using his earth-shaking bellow
  while underground, but if brought below 50 hit points and unable to merge with
  earth, he'll use this ability in desperation.
Morale: >-
  Lokansir melds into earth if reduced below 50 hit points and waits for his
  fast healing to heal him completely before emerging. If somehow prevented from
  using this tactic, the desperate giant tries to flee out of the caves up into
  Jorgenfist to find more earth to hide in. If he manages to heal back to his
  full hit points, he tracks down the PCs for revenge.
