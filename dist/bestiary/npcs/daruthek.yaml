  - name: Air Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls
      against Daruthek.
  - name: Elemental Body (Ex)
    description: >-
      Each time Daruthek is subject to bleed damage, precision damage, poison,
      paralysis, sleep, or a stunning effect, there is a 25% chance that the
      effect or additional damage is negated.
  - name: Wind Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, Daruthek can breathe a 60-foot cone of wind. Every
      creature within this area that is not flying must succeed at a DC 14
      Acrobatics or Strength check or fall prone. A flying creature that fails
      is instead blown away from Daruthek, moving a distance equal to 5 feet per
      point by which it failed the check. If the creature encounters a large
      object during this movement, it takes 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet the
      object prevented it from moving. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Daruthek casts protection from good and drinks a potion of bull's strength
  once the storm seeds are destroyed and the storm engine's barrier falls.
DuringCombat: >-
  Daruthek uses his lightning breath early to target opponents before his
  cultists close to melee, then relies on sound burst and flyby attacks with his
  spear to harry small groups of enemies. If his cultists die, he uses obscuring
  mist to blind opponents, relying on his blindsight to target them with
  attacks. The oracle keeps a cause fear spell in his +1 spell-storing
  breastplate, and targets the first creature who strikes him in melee.
Morale: Daruthek and his minions fight to the death.
