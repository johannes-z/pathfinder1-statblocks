  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bronze golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow
      spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against
      it, as noted below. A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows a
      bronze golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A
      magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the golem
      and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would
      otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed
      its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A
      bronze golem gets no saving throw against fire effects.
  - name: Petrifying Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Turn to stone permanently, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 17 negates. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
  - name: Shattering Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bronze golem instinctively detects weak points in the structure of a
      victim turned to stone by its petrifying gaze. Its attacks against its
      petrified victims ignore the stone's hardness.
