SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      Unlike most androids, Malin knows the highs and lows of human emotion. He
      is affected normally by fear and mind-affecting effects, and can gain
      morale bonuses normally.
  - name: Powerful (Ex)
    description: >-
      Malin is built from a 20-point buy, and possesses equipment suitable for a
      PC of his level. These changes make him considerably more powerful than
      the average NPC, increasing his CR by 1.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Malin prefers to avoid direct confrontation, stalking his quarry and picking
  off stragglers one or two at a time. Before entering combat, Malin expands his
  smart armor.
DuringCombat: >-
  If forced into direct combat, Malin throws a grenade, then plunges into melee,
  swiping at enemies using Great Cleave and Power Attack, and immobilizing
  outliers with his zero pistol and tangling attack hunter trick. He prioritizes
  divine casters, staying close with his surprise shift trick and leaning
  heavily on Improved Sunder, hateful attack, and upending strike.
Morale: >-
  Malin doesn't believe in a cozy afterlife and has no delusions about glorious
  self-sacrifice. He flees if reduced to fewer than 30 hit points.
Gear: >-
  potions of protection from technology* (3), arc grenades* (2), concussion
  grenades* (2)

  +3 warding smart armor (expanded form)*, +2 buckler, adamantine heavy pick,
