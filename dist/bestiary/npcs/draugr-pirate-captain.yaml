DuringCombat: >-
  The draugr pirate captains fill the crypt with obscuring mist at the beginning
  of combat. The captains' failed mutiny was the last time they worked together.
  Now, they fight individually, taking out their rage on the closest creature
  within reach and using their Blind-Fight feat to attack foes in the mist.
Morale: The draugr captains fight until destroyed.
