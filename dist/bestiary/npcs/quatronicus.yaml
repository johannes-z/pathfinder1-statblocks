SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dismantling Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round as a swift action, a yarahkut can concentrate its gaze on
      any item within 100 feet and damage that item. An attended item must
      succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or lose half its hit points and gain the
      broken condition. Items that already have the broken condition and fail
      this save are destroyed. Items that successfully save against this effect
      are immune to that yarahkut's dismantling gaze for 24 hours. Unattended
      nonmagical items don't receive a saving throw. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Malfunctioning Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A yarahkut radiates a disruptive aura that is harmful to ranged weapons
      within 100 feet. Mechanical projectile weapons-such as crossbows,
      firearms, siege weapons, and many technological weapons-have a 20% chance
      of not firing on each attack made within the aura's area. If a weapon in
      this aura has a misfire value, its misfire value increases by 2.
  - name: Wings (Ex)
    description: A yarahkut's wings are primary attacks.
