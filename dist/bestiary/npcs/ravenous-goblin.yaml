  - name: Primal Scream (Ex)
    description: >-
      A ravenous creature can, as a standard action, emit a powerful howl of
      savage fury that can be heard to a distance of two miles. Any animal that
      hears this scream tries to move out of the area using the quickest and
      most direct means possible. A successful Handle Animal check (DC 10 + 1/2
      the ravenous creature's HD + the ravenous creature's Charisma modifier)
      calms the animal. Intelligent creatures with fewer HD than the ravenous
      creature that are within 300 feet must make a successful Will save (DC 10
      + 1/2 the ravenous creature's HD + the ravenous creature's Charisma
      modifier) or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic-mind
      affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected
      creature is immune to the primal scream of that ravenous for one day. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Rage (Ex)
    description: >-
      A ravenous creature that suffers damage in combat has a 50% chance of
      flying into a berserk rage in the next round, attacking until either it or
      its opponent is dead. While raging, a ravenous gains Str +4, Con +4, and
      AC -2. It cannot end its rage voluntarily. It does not suffer any ill
      effects when its rage is ended.
