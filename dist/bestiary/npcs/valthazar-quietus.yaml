DuringCombat: >-
  Valthazar uses his agony hex on a spellcaster, the retribution hex on an
  obvious melee combatant, and the misfortune hex on a third PC. He uses cackle
  to extend this hex for as long as he can and in the meantime casts  spectral
  hand to deliver inflict spells at range. When it becomes clear that the PCs
  are protected from negative energy, he falls back on spells like phantasmal
  killer, lightning bolt, and burning gaze.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, Valthazar casts dimension door to
  escape to the lower floor of the temple. He uses any remaining inflict spells
  to heal himself and then seeks out the PCs again, casting any damaging spells
  he hasn't already used. This time he fights to the death, secretly hoping the
  hate in his heart will cause him to eventually rise again as some form of
  undead.
