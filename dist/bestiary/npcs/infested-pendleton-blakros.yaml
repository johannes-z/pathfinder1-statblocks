DuringCombat: >-
  The cyberplasm stays to the back of the fight as much as possible and allows
  the gearsman to engage in melee. If Pendleton is killed while the cyberplasm
  infests him, the cyberplasm is ejected in its true form and attempts to catch
  as many opponents as possible in its swarm attacks. If one or two opponents
  still live, the cyberplasm tries to infest one of them after using its
  deconstruct ability on any dead PCs, turning them into hungry fleshes.
Morale: >-
  The cyberplasm lacks a strong sense of self-preservation and overestimates its
  own abilities, thus it fights until destroyed.
Gear: breastplate
