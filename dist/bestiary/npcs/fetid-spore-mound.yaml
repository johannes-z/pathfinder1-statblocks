SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Compressible Form (Ex)
    description: >-
      A fetid spore mound is difficult to harm with piercing and bludgeoning
      attacks, gaining DR 10/slashing and taking half damage from falls. It also
      never takes penalties for squeezing into a 5-foot-wide space and gains a
      +10 racial bonus on Escape Artist checks (+20 when squeezing through tight
      spaces).
  - name: Spore Discharge (Ex)
    description: >-
      If struck in combat, a fetid spore mound discharges a cloud of yellow mold
      spores in a 10-foot radius. Exposure to direct sunlight renders the spore
      mound's yellow mold dormant, and it does not discharge. Its spore
      discharge is suppressed for 1 round if the creature is struck by a fire
      attack that overcomes its fire resistance. Yellow mold spores: inhaled;
      save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 5 rounds; effect 1d3 Con damage;
      cure 1 save.
DuringCombat: >-
  The fetid spore mound attempts to grab and constrict any targets that come
  within reach.
Morale: The fetid spore mound fights to the death.
