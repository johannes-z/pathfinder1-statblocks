SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ghostly Form (Su)
    description: >-
      Nezirrius can become incorporeal (including all of her gear) for 14 rounds
      per day as a swift action- returning to solid form is a free action. The
      rounds per day need not be consecutive. This ability cannot be activated
      in areas of bright light, a
BeforeCombat: Nezirrius activates true seeing and blur.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nezirrius begins combat with a sneak attack delivered via her crossbow, then
  focuses her following attacks on the same target, making rapid shots if she
  can. As soon as a group of enemies are in the right formation, she uses
  prismatic spray on them. She saves blasphemy for when she's surrounded by
  foes, then switches to melee attacks thereafter. If she's aiding the PCs in a
  fight against Minagho, Nezirrius uses dimensional anchor to prevent the lilitu
  from fleeing before moving in to flank with a PC to make a full attack on her
  ex-employer. For her part, Minagho focuses her attacks on Nezirrius in this
  case, so enraged is she at this betrayal.
Morale: >-
  Nezirrius teleports away to safety if reduced to fewer than 40 hit points.
  Each time after she recovers, she attempts to slay her enemy again and again,
  using discern location to find out where they are.
Gear: 10 +1 human-bane bolts, 10 +1 elf-bane arrows, 10 +1 good-outsider-bane arrows
OtherGear: >-
  stalker's crossbow with 20 bolts, amulet of mighty fists +2, ring of spell
  storing (cure critical wounds, cure light wounds)
