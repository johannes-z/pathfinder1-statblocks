SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Abysium Pulse (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a free action, the two adamantine spheres atop
      the clockwork reliquary's body can bloom like metal flowers to reveal
      highly refined abysium rods that immediately pulse with energy. All
      creatures within a 30-foot-radius spread must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude
      save or suffer 1d6 points of Constitution drain and become nauseated for 1
      round. On a successful save, creatures in the area suffer only 1 point of
      Constitution drain and are staggered for 1 round. The reliquary cannot
      create an abysium pulse in the same round it lashes out with its djezet
      blood. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Alloyed Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      The clockwork reliquary's claws are crafted from a strange alloy of
      adamantine and siccatite. These claws threaten a critical hit on a result
      of 19-20 and deal x4 damage on a successful critical hit. They always add
      1-1/2 times the reliquary's Strength modifier on damage rolls. The claws
      bypass hardness and damage reduction as if they were made of adamantine,
      and on a hit, the reliquary can decide to deal +1d6 points of fire damage
      or +1d6 points of cold damage as a free action.
  - name: Conquer Construct (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, the clockwork reliquary can target a single mindless
      construct within 120 feet and attempt to seize control of it. The
      construct can attempt to resist this control with a DC 33 Will save, but
      on a failure, it permanently falls under the clockwork reliquary's
      command. If the reliquary targets a dormant construct (such as an unwound
      clockwork, or any of the dormant constructs on the risen island of Xin),
      the construct fails the save automatically and is immediately activated at
      the start of the next round. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Djezet Blood (Su)
    description: >-
      The clockwork reliquary's "blood" is composed of djezet. Once every 1d4
      rounds as a free action, the reliquary may lash out at a single creature
      within 30 feet with a tendril of this blood. The reliquary must attempt a
      +36 touch attack; if it hits, the target must succeed at a DC 22 Will save
      or become more susceptible to the reliquary's supernatural attacks and
      spell-like abilities, taking a &#8211;10 penalty on all saving throws
      against these attacks for 24 hours. The reliquary cannot use its blood in
      this way during the same round it creates an abysium pulse. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Haunted (Ex)
    description: >-
      The reliquary gains its Charisma bonus (+11) to its AC as a deflection
      bonus and on Fortitude saves as a resistance bonus. It gains its Charisma
      bonus (+11) to each of its Hit Dice as bonus hit points.
  - name: Inubrix Darts (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, the clockwork reliquary may fire six inubrix darts
      from its upper body, or one dart as a standard action. These darts have a
      range increment of 90 feet and ignore any armor or shield bonus granted by
      metal armor or shields. The reliquary can fire 100 darts before it must
      craft replacements.
  - name: Sihedron Vulnerability (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature equipped with the Sihedron can penetrate the clockwork
      reliquary's damage reduction with any attack, and automatically succeeds
      at all checks to penetrate its spell resistance. If the Sihedron's user
      transfers the Sihedron to an ally while the clockwork reliquary is within
      30 feet, the reliquary must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be
      staggered for 1 round.
  - name: Skymetal Plating (Su)
    description: >-
      Plates of horacalcum and noqual are incorporated into the reliquary's
      body. These plates rotate and realign every round so that one of the two
      materials is visible, while the other side of the plate faces inward. On
      even-numbered rounds, its horacalcum plates are visible and the clockwork
      reliquary functions as if hasted. On odd-numbered rounds, its noqual
      plates are visible and its spell resistance increases to 37.
  - name: Susceptible to Positive Energy (Ex)
    description: >-
      The reliquary is vulnerable to damage from positive energy as if it were
      an undead creature. It is not affected by negative energy.
  - name: Unstable Mind (Ex)
    description: >-
      The clockwork reliquary's animating spirit carries with it all of Xin's
      madness. At the start of every round, there's a cumulative 1% chance that
      it malfunctions in that round&#8211;if the reliquary malfunctions, it
      functions for that round as if confused. Presenting evidence of Xin's
      failure (such as a portion of the homunculus mass&#8211;other elements may
      work at your discretion) increases the next malfunction check by 20%. Once
      the reliquary malfunctions, the malfunction chance resets to 1% for the
      next round.
DuringCombat: >-
  The clockwork reliquary lashes at the closest target with its djezet blood on
  the 1st round of combat, then triggers its abysium pulse in the 2nd round. It
  uses these abilities as often as it can. The construct uses telekinesis to try
  to wrench the Sihedron away from its controller (treat this as a disarm combat
  maneuver, but grant the defender a +10 bonus to its CMD), mixing melee and
  ranged attacks as appropriate in a round (it prefers attacking with its
  claws). If reduced to fewer than 150 hit points, it casts repulsion and uses
  chain lightning to keep foes at range while using its fast healing. On the
  fifth round of combat, the reliquary attempts to use mage's disjunction to
  destroy the Sihedron. It has a 20% chance to affect the artifact, at which
  point the item's controller can attempt to resist the effect with a DC 29 Will
  save made at a &#8211;5 penalty. If the clockwork reliquary is successful, it
  must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or immediately and permanently lose its
  spell resistance, fast healing, damage reduction, and all of its spell-like
  abilities and supernatural special abilities. If it succeeds at this save, the
  loss of these abilities is only temporary, lasting for 5 rounds.
