SpecialAbilities:
  - name: False Attacker (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever Jaelli strikes a foe from hiding, she can attempt a Bluff check
      as an immediate action before rolling damage to convince the foe that
      another creature was the attacker. She attempts to convince the PCs that
      her attacks emerge from within the crowds. This Bluff check is opposed by
      the target's Perception or Sense Motive check, whichever has a higher
      bonus. It applies the normal modifiers for convincing a creature of a
      falsehood, but can be accomplished with just physical trickery (a shared
      language is not required). For example, she does not take a penalty on
      this Bluff check if the markets are still full of crowds, as there is
      another plausible origin for the attack. The GM should use her discretion
      to apply increasing penalties based on how little of the crowd remains in
      the Green Market. If the Bluff check is successful, and Jaelli maintains
      concealment or cover, her stealth does not end. This rogue talent appears
      in Pathfinder Player Companion: Heroes of the Streets.
  - name: Let Fate Decide (Ex)
    description: >-
      Jaelli can declare two different actions that rely on different types of
      rolls or checks, such as attacking a creature (an attack roll) or sneaking
      past the same creature (a Stealth check). As a standard action, she can
      use a random method to choose one of the declared activities, such as
      flipping a coin, rolling a die, or drawing a harrow card. If she performs
      the chosen activity by the end of the next round (most likely, on her next
      turn), she gains a +2 luck bonus on the roll type required for that
      activity-attack rolls with a specific weapon, a specific skill check, a
      specific ability check, or a specific saving throw-for 1 minute. If the
      swindler does not perform this action in the round after using this
      ability, she becomes shaken for 1 minute instead. She can use this ability
      three times per day.
  - name: Poker Face (Ex)
    description: >-
      Jaelli gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Profession (gambler), and Sense Motive
      checks. She can also attempt to feint against non-humanoid targets without
      penalty, though she still takes a -8 penalty on feint attempts against
      creatures with animal intelligence and she cannot feint against mindless
      creatures.
  - name: Quicker Than the Eye (Ex)
    description: >-
      When Jaelli uses Sleight of Hand, creatures take a -2 penalty on their
      Perception checks to notice the attempt. She also reduces the normal -20
      penalty when attempting a Sleight of Hand check as a move action instead
      of as a standard action to -16. Lastly, she can draw hidden weapons or
      objects from her person as a move action instead of the usual standard
      action.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Goldtooth has already anointed her sword with giant wasp poison and three of
  her harrow cards with shadow essence. As soon as the PCs spot her, she
  activates her let fate decide ability. GMs can determine the outcome by
  flipping a coin, or by having the PCs randomly select one of two harrow cards
  (see below).
DuringCombat: >-
  If she draws the Avalanche, Goldtooth gains a +2 luck bonus on her Climb
  checks for 1 minute. She moves to the eastern wall and attempts to scale a
  ladder to one of the open skylights. She then launches poisoned harrow cards
  at the PCs using her card sharp rogue talent and Distance Thrower feat. If any
  PCs climb the ladder, she  shatters the skylight from above, delivering 1d4
  points of slashing damage to anyone directly below (Reflex DC 15 half).
  Finally, she draws her short sword and readies a sneak attack against the
  first PC up the ladder.  If she draws the Uprising, Goldtooth gains a +2 luck
  bonus on her Bluff checks for 1 minute. With a cry of "Qadira shall dance on
  your ashes!" she throws her flame fountain firework 10 feet onto the nearest
  market stall. This action also serves as a diversion to hide from the PCs. If
  Goldtooth succeeds at a Bluff check opposed by the PCs' Sense Motive checks,
  she gains the opportunity to attempt a Stealth check hide among the crowd.
  Every round thereafter, the panicked crowd kicks the hissing, blazing tube an
  additional 10 feet in a random direction. Any time the firework lands on a
  square occupied by a stall, it sets the stall on fire. If the fire is not
  doused, it spreads to nearby stalls. See the Hazard section for rules on the
  fire's spread and the ways the PCs can douse it. The firework itself winks out
  after 10 rounds. Meanwhile, Goldtooth sneaks up on the PCs and uses her false
  attacker rogue ability to maintain cover and total concealment while striking
  the PCs with her short sword.
Morale: >-
  If brought to fewer than 10 hit points, Goldtooth surrenders, offering to lay
  her "cards on the table" about Madreki Gael's plot, provided the PCs promise
  to be merciful.
