  - name: Cursed Bite (Su)
    description: >-
      A coral capuchin can deliver a bite that bestows some of the creature's
      benefits and weaknesses upon the victim. The curse delivered by this bite
      persists for 1d6 hours, and cannot affect the same creature more than once
      in a 24-hour period. Affected creatures begin drying out when exposed to
      air, but can hold their breath for double the normal amount of time.
      Targets of this cursed bite take 1d6 points of damage for every 10 minutes
      they are out of water, though spending a full-round action to bathe the
      victim in any sort of water halts this damage. Victims must succeed at a
      DC 12 Constitution check to avoid this effect. Remove curse ends this
      curse's effect as normal. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Moisture Dependency (Ex)
    description: >-
      A coral capuchin can breathe both air and water and survive indefinitely
      on land, but the creature must regularly be either submerged in water or
      thoroughly wetted down, or else it dries out in the air. A coral capuchin
      can survive out of water for a number of hours of equal to its
      Constitution score before it takes any negative effects. After this time,
      the creature takes 1d6 points of damage for every hour it remains dry.
      Bathing the creature in water of any sort resets this time frame.
