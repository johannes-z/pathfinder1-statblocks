    description: >-
      A dark plasma ooze's plasma arcs function the same as a normal plasma
      ooze's rays, but can arc around corners (ignoring line of sight
      restrictions and negating concealment modifiers) if the target wears any
      metal.
DuringCombat: >-
  When one or more intruders possessing metallic belongings comes within 15 feet
  of the chamber, the ooze starts using its magnetic pulse ability, and fires
  plasma arcs from its hiding place. It keeps using its ranged attacks until at
  least one creature is in the room below it. The ooze then switches to melee
  attacks with the intention of engulfing its prey. If the PCs retreat from the
  beast, it descends from its perch and starts making its way down the hall
  toward the party, continuing to make ranged attacks until it is close enough
  to engage the PCs in melee combat.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, the ooze attempts to retreat, though its
  options are limited (it can't open the secret door to area E9, nor can it open
  the stone block to area E12.)
