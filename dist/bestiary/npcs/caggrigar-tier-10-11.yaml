SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Damned (Ex)
    description: >-
      When Caggrigar dies, his soul is instantly claimed by the Abyss, where it
      transforms into a demon. Any character attempting to resurrect him must
      succeed at a caster level check equal to 24 or the spell fails. That
      character cannot attempt to resurrect Caggrigar again until the following
      day, though other characters can attempt to do so if they please.
  - name: Demonic Mark (Ex)
    description: >-
      Caggrigar bears the sign of Deskari as a tattoolike brand on the back of
      his left hand. Once per day, he can call upon the profane power of this
      mark to power a spell as he casts it. Doing so causes the spell to gain
      the chaotic and evil descriptors, and causes the spell not be expended as
      it is cast, allowing Caggrigar to cast the spell again at a later point in
      the day.
  - name: Energumen (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Caggrigar can open his soul to a demonic spirit as a free
      action. This spirit possesses him for 7 rounds, granting a +6 profane
      bonus to one ability score of the demoniac's choice and immunity to
      electricity and poison. When the energumen ends, Caggrigar becomes
      confused for 4 rounds as the demonic spirit has its way with his mind. At
      the start of each round of confusion, he can make a DC 25 Will save to end
      the confusion effect immediately. Energumen is a possession effect, and is
      negated by protection from evil or protection from chaos. Caggrigar can
      prevent or end the confusion side effect by having one of these spells
      cast upon him when (or before) the energumen ends, but being affected by
      such a spell before the energumen has run its course also causes the
      benefits granted to end prematurely.
  - name: Obedience (Ex)
    description: >-
      Each day, as part of preparing his spells, Caggrigar must meditate while
      allowing insects or worms of any type to crawl upon his body-he generally
      uses his scorpion familiar. In return, he gains a +4 profane bonus on all
      saving throws against disease and against effects caused by vermin. If he
      should ever fail to perform this ritual, Caggrigar loses all abilities
      granted through his demoniac prestige class until he next performs the
      obedience.
  - name: Swarm Walker (Su)
    description: >-
      Caggrigar can walk through any swarm without fear of taking damage or
      suffering any ill effects&#8211;swarms recognize him as one of their own.
      As long as he stands within a swarm, he gain a +4 profane bonus on
      Initiative checks and on all saving throws. Damned, Vol. 2.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Caggrigar cast threefold aspect on himself this morning and now appears as a
  young adult. Before leaving the safe house, he also cast spite with the
  vampiric touch effect. Once Caggrigar becomes aware of the PCs, he summons 1d3
  babaus to aid him in battle, and false life should time permit. If he has
  further time, he summons a swarm of spiders that covers him, granting him
  bonuses to initiative and all saves.
DuringCombat: >-
  Caggrigar sends his demonic servants to fight melee and ranged combatants,
  using his offensive spells against casters, beginning with his highest-level
  spells. If attacked directly, Caggrigar casts swarm skin on his next turn,
  taking the form of an army ant swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 16).
Morale: >-
  Caggrigar fears death, knowing that he will suffer eternal torment at
  Deskari's hands. If reduced to fewer than 40 hp, he uses his energumen ability
  as a free action to boost his Constitution by +6 for 7 rounds, thus increasing
  his hit points by 42, and attempts to flee or parlay.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds, scroll of baleful polymorph
OtherGear: >-
  +1 scythe, amulet of natural armor +1, cloak of resistance +3, headband of
  vast intelligence +2, ring of protection +2, 55 pp, 57 gp
