Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Before revealing himself, Hyrix spends an arcane pool point to grant his
  masterwork rapier the abilities of a +1 keen rapier (this adjustment is
  reflected above).
DuringCombat: >-
  Hyrix uses glitterdust if he can catch three or more foes in the area, if a
  ranged foe harms him, or if he believes an invisible foe is present. He keeps
  his back against a solid surface to deter flanking, and combines his ray
  spells with spell combat and spellstrike, starting with his two scorching
  rays. If he takes more than 10 points of damage, he uses spell combat to
  attack and cast shield. If a foe is particularly effective in melee, Hyrix
  uses spell combat and spellstrike to attack and cast ray of enfeeblement.
Morale: Hyrix is overconfident, and fights to the death.
Gear: potions of cure moderate wounds (2), tanglefoot bag, thunderstone

  +1 chain shirt, mwk rapier, bag of holding (type I), cloak of resistance +1,
