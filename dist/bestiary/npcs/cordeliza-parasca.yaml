Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Cordeliza is not a fighter. She calls for help at the first hint of danger.
  When possible, she tries to head off an impending battle by using her social
  skills or casting charm person.
DuringCombat: >-
  Cordeliza screams for her family, local guards, or anyone in the area who
  might be able to help her. She uses pyrotechnics to cover an escape attempt
  and hideous laughter and sleep to disable her opponents.
Morale: >-
  Time spent gazing into the great beyond has left Cordeliza with a certain
  calmness about death. However, she has no wish to die just yet and tries
  everything at her disposal to flee when in danger. She bargains her services
  or possessions for her life but dies rather than betray her family.
Gear: potion of invisibility, wand of cure light wounds (5 charges)
