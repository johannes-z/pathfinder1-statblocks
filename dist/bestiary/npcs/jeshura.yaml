SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Accustomed to Awfulness (Ex)
    description: >-
      Jeshura is immune to the sickened condition and gains a +4 bonus on all
      saving throws against effects that cause nausea or disease.
  - name: Infected Arrows (Su)
    description: >-
      Any arrows Jeshura fires carry with them bubonic plague, similarly to her
      claw attacks. Pestilence Bloodline This rare sorcerer bloodline was first
      detailed on page 29 of Pathfinder Adventure Path #29. It grants Heal as a
      bonus class skill, and Jeshura's level is high enough that she gains charm
      animal and summon swarm as bonus spells. Vermin are susceptible to her
      mind-affecting spells, and are treated as animals for the purposes of
      determining which mind-affecting spells can affect them. Plague's
  - name: Caress (Sp)
    description: >-
      Jeshura can make a melee touch attack as a standard action that causes a
      living creature's flesh to break out into rancid-smelling pustules and
      sores for 3 rounds. These sores cause the victim to become sickened for
      these 3 rounds-this is a disease effect.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: Pestilence
DuringCombat: >-
  Jeshura has no time to prepare for combat initially, so she casts mirror image
  on the first round of battle to get herself some time to cast mage armor and
  gravity bow before she begins firing her longbow at foes. If she's surrounded,
  she tries to sow confusion by using darkness or glitterdust to make it even
  more difficult for her enemies to see. If reduced to fewer than 120 hit
  points, Jeshura attempts to flee via dimension door&#8211;this, of course,
  likely results in her being redirected by the vault's teleport trap into
  another prison, area H8.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 30 or fewer hit points and prevented from attempting to escape
  by dimension door, Jeshura does something that may surprise the PCs&#8211;she
  drops to her knees and begs for mercy. Although she has the powers and shape
  of a pairaka div, she remains a human at heart and still fears death. See
  Development, below, for what comes of granting mercy to the Plague Queen of
  Kho.
