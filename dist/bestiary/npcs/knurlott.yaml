  Knurlott prefers fighting in melee with his greatsword, and uses Power Attack
  with Greater Sunder when he must move to reach a foe. Otherwise, he makes full
  attacks with Power Attack, focusing his wrath on heavily armored foes first
  and trusting to his spell resistance and other immunities to protect him from
  magic attacks. He relies entirely on his channel destruction and devastating
  blast for ranged combat, and faced with a foe against whom these tactics are
  not viable, Knurlott retreats into Scarwall to recruit allies or to lure the
  enemy into an area where he can fight them more efficiently.
Morale: Knurlott fights until destroyed.
Gear: +3 full plate with armor spikes, +2 cold iron greatsword
