Source: PFS S5-03
BeforeCombat: >-
  Before performing an infiltration, Samivashti applies an oil of magic aura to
  her ring of mind shielding.
DuringCombat: >-
  Samivashti begins combat by using her vanishing trick, transforming back into
  her succubus form, and then flying to a safe location&#8211;gaining height,
  seeking cover, or sneaking up on a spellcaster as appropriate to mitigate any
  of the PCs' known strengths. She then employs her spell-like abilities to
  manipulate her foes, summon help, or strike at her foes directly, favoring
  vampiric touch to slay troublesome spellcasters who try to avoid the melee.
Morale: >-
  If Faelyn breaks free of her charm monster spell and runs for help, the
  succubus realizes she might soon be overwhelmed and only fights for 4 more
  rounds before fleeing via greater teleport. If Samivashti is reduced to 25 hit
  points or fewer, she also flees. If the succubus flees, she abandons Zruuka
  without a second thought.
