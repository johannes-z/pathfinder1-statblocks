SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Creeping Dark (Su)
    description: >-
      The nightprowlers' natural attacks leave a stain of dark shadows that
      linger in and around the wound, known as the creeping dark-this condition
      can be resisted with a successful DC 23 Fortitude save. If the victim
      fails, it becomes staggered for 1 round, after which the creeping dark
      affects the victim further by preventing healing and hampering vision. A
      character attempting to use magical healing on a creature damaged by a
      nightprowler's creeping dark must succeed at a DC 26 caster level check,
      or the healing has no effect on the injured creature. As long as a
      creature suffers the creeping dark, its vision is obscured with shadows as
      well-all creatures gain a 20% miss chance from attacks by the victim. The
      creeping dark is a curse effect that lasts until removed or until all
      damage to the victim is healed. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Shadowpounce (Su)
    description: >-
      Nightprowlers have the pounce ability, and when they use this ability,
      they can also make rake attacks. Up to three times per day when a
      nightprowler pounces from an area of dim illumination, it generates a
      shimmering aura of false images that grants it a 50% miss chance, as if
      under the effects of a displacement spell, for 1d4 rounds.
BeforeCombat: The nightprowlers cast invisibility if they suspect intruders.
DuringCombat: >-
  One nightprowler casts haste on itself and its allies while the others attack
  with their shadowpounce. They thereafter alternate using their channeled
  negative energy, spell-like abilities, and physical attacks to keep their foes
  off-balance.
Morale: Relentlessly fierce and bloodthirsty, the nightprowlers fight until destroyed.
