SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Black Star Mote (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity,
      Cassilda flings a black hole with a corona of light shining around it at a
      target as a ranged touch attack. If her mote hits the target, she can do
      one of three things: deal 10d6 points of force and negative energy damage,
      affect the target with the equivalent of a violent thrust use of
      telekinesis (15 objects, +39 attack roll), or affect the target with the
      equivalent of reverse gravity (DC 33 negates). The save DC is
      Charisma-based. Breach Reality's
  - name: Fabric (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, Cassilda may select a point within 60 feet. A black
      sphere with a corona of light opens like a hole in reality. The squares in
      a 40-foot burst around this point become difficult to move in, but only
      when a creature is moving away from the point. When a creature is moving
      away from the point, each square of movement counts as three squares.
      Every round that a creature is within the area of the burst, it is drawn
      toward the point at the start of its turn. A DC 33 Reflex save halts this
      movement for 1 round; if this save fails, the creature is automatically
      pulled into the hole and takes 10d6 points of negative energy damage
      (Fortitude DC 33 half). A creature in the hole takes the same amount of
      damage at the start of its turn. A creature in the hole no longer occupies
      a square but instead occupies an extradimensional space. A successful DC
      33 Reflex save allows a creature to exit the hole. Cassilda is unaffected
      by this ability but must maintain concentration on the effect or it ends
      at the start of her next turn. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Force of Will (Su)
    description: >-
      Cassilda adds her Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to her Armor
      Class.
  - name: Immortal (Su)
    description: >-
      Cassilda is immune to all aging effects. Furthermore, she is difficult to
      destroy, even for Hastur. Upon her death, she is painfully reborn in her
      palace at the heart of Carcosa in 1d6 days. She can be permanently
      destroyed only by the destruction of her Imperial Diadem.
  - name: Spells (Sp)
    description: >-
      Cassilda has a limited selection of spells known, but she casts spells as
      a 20th-level psychic. The save DCs for her spells are Charisma-based.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Cassilda cannot work directly against Hastur, but she can provide aid to the
  PCs in their quest. She uses her abilities to assist them where she can.
Morale: >-
  Cassilda knows that, if destroyed, she will continue to reform in Carcosa
  until Hastur's destruction.
