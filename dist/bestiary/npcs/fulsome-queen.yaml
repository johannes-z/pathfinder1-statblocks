SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Balefire (Su)
    description: >-
      The Fulsome Queen's balefire oracle revelation allows her to burn her foes
      with eldritch fires drawn from the Abyss itself once per day. As a
      standard action, she causes one target within 30 feet to become wreathed
      in flames, taking 6d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 19 half).
  - name: Demonhide (Su)
    description: >-
      The Fulsome Queen's demonhide oracle revelation grants her a +4 armor
      bonus.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  The Fulsome Queen casts shield of faith and bull's strength before combat if
  she has the chance.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Fulsome Queen attempts to summon demonic aid on the first round of combat,
  then uses her various cloud spells to try to exert control over the
  battlefield. She prefers to use her magic at range, and if she is forced into
  melee, she casts sanctuary. Once in melee, she uses her slam attacks instead
  of her spells.
Morale: >-
  The Fulsome Queen teleports to the far side of Colyphyr to recover from her
  wounds if reduced to 30 hit points or fewer. About 16 hours later, she returns
  to stealthily explore the mines, hoping to find them now emptied of enemies,
  but she avoids engaging any who nearly slew her if she can.
