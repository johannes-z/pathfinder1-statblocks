SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Ghoul Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 15; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC
      is Charisma-based. A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at
      the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none
      of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of any
      other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like
      a normal ghoul in all respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as
      a ghast.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  As if he hears the PCs outside of his chamber, Tholrist prepares for battle by
  casting divine favor and resist energy on himself, and casts aid, rage, and
  shield of faith on one of his ghoul minions before hiding behind the altar.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once combat begins, Tholrist uses cause fear on the most obvious martial
  character, and targets any obvious casters with blindness/deafness, following
  up by casting command or hold person to hinder the PCs' approach. If PCs get
  close enough for melee, he attacks with his claws and bite, augmented by his
  fury of the Abyss domain ability. He uses spells when appropriate&#8211;such
  as to hinder a strong PC with bestow curse or to target casters with silence.
  Tholrist uses his channel energy ability, augmented with Quick Channel, to
  quickly heal himself and his minions rather than attacking the party unless he
  is surrounded by three or more PCs. Tholrist ignores any creatures he
  successfully paralyzes until the battle is over.
Morale: >-
  Knowing he is cursed to remain in this chamber forever and clearly insane
  after all the intervening years, Tholrist fights until destroyed.
