BeforeCombat: >-
  Xan prefers to strike from invisibility after spending time observing and
  evaluating his foes. He resumes his natural form and summons his scythe, if
  necessary, before attacking.
DuringCombat: >-
  Xan prefers misdirection in combat, using quickened invisibility and moving to
  strike from unexpected directions using Power Attack and Vital Strike. He
  despises foes that use the same tricks against him, relying on true seeing to
  counter such tactics.
Morale: Fanatical in his work, Xan fights until slain.
