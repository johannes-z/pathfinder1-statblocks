DuringCombat: >-
  The enforcer gives the hyena a kick and commands it to attack the PCs. Once
  the enforcer is in striking range, he attacks foes with his axe, uses
  Intimidate to demoralize tough-looking targets, and pushes heavily armored
  enemies into the river.
Morale: >-
  The enforcer has his reputation to maintain, so he flees or surrenders only
  once the battle has truly turned against him and most of his subordinates have
  fallen or fled.
Gear: potion of bear's endurance
