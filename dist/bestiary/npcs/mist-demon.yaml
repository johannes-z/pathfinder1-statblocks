SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Mist (Su)
    description: >-
      If near a body of water, a mist demon can, as a full round action,
      generate a cloud of mist. This vaporous cloud is similar in all ways to
      the spell obscuring mist except that the mist demon can see normally while
      within it, and it remains for as long as the mist demon wishes it to,
      although it can be dispelled or dispersed by the normal magical means. The
      mist evaporates immediately once the mist demon is slain.
  - name: Invisible in Mist (Su)
    description: >-
      While within the mist, a mist demon is considered invisible as per the
      spell. Like the spell, the mist demon becomes visible whenever it casts a
      spell or attacks. However, as a standard action, the mist demon may blend
      back into the mist at any point, becoming invisible once again. An
      opponent notices the invisible mist demon with a successful DC 25
      Perception check.
  - name: Mist Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A mist demon can switch from its normal form to one of pure mist or back
      again a swift action. It can spend up to 20 rounds per day in mist form.
      In mist form, the mist demon acts as if under the effects of a gaseous
      form spell, except that it retains its natural fly speed of 30 feet
      (good).
