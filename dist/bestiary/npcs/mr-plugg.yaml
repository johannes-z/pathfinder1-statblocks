DuringCombat: >-
  Mr. Plugg always enters combat with his cutlass and cat drawn, and has no
  compunctions about fighting dirty. He regularly uses Combat Expertise
  (&#8211;2 on attack rolls, +2 AC) to increase his AC, and if he finds that he
  is unable to hit opponents, Plugg drops his cat-o'-nine-tails and attacks with
  only his tidewater cutlass.
Morale: >-
  Plugg fights bravely, but if reduced to fewer than 25 hit points, he backs
  away. If reduced to 12 hit points or fewer, he attempts to flee, hoping to
  fight another day. He has no loyalty to his captain, crew, or allies, and
  abandons them without a second thought if it means saving his own skin.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, screaming bolts (3)
OtherGear: >-
  tidewater cutlass (+1 cutlass; see page 59), masterwork cat-o'-nine-tails*,
  light crossbow with 10 bolts, amulet of natural armor +1, bracers of armor +1,
