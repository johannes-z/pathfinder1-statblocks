SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Battleflower (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because of her training as an ukara, Cesseer is proficient with all
      weapons with the performance weapon quality and treats all such weapons as
      monk weapons for the purposes of feats and the flurry of blows special
      ability. This replaces the normal monk weapon proficiencies.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Cesseer activates her barkskin ki power before combat or before entering the
  fighting pit. If in an area of difficult terrain (such as ice), she also
  activates her feather step ki power.
DuringCombat: >-
  In a nonlethal or exhibition combat, Cesseer uses Dazzling Display in the
  first round to demoralize her opponent, allowing her to use Shatter Defenses
  and make extra attacks with Medusa's Wrath. She uses Stage Combatant to make
  nonlethal attacks with her shotel and Perfect Strike to ensure success, and
  uses Punishing Kick, Stunning Fist, and trip combat maneuvers to keep her
  opponent at a disadvantage. In a real (lethal) fight, Cesseer spends a ki
  point each round to gain an extra attack if she can make a full attack, or to
  improve her AC (if she can't).
Morale: >-
  Honor is fundamental to Cesseer, and if fighting in a nonlethal duel, she
  yields when reduced to 20 hit points or fewer. In a lethal combat against
  honorable foes, Cesseer fights to the end. If revived afterward, she
  surrenders and allows herself be taken prisoner. If the PCs shamefully
  interrupt or interfere in a one-on-one combat, Cesseer uses her abundant step
  ability to retreat to Yrax's sanctum (area D20) and fights at his side.
Gear: >-

  ring of protection +2, Ningese ukara entertainer's outfit
