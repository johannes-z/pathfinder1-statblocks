  Once the PCs attack, all pretense of delivering the PCs alive to their
  commander vanishes&#8211;General Isatemkhebet wants the PCs dead as an
  offering to Hakotep, but isn't particularly concerned with being the one to
  deliver the death blow. The harpies are fond of using their captivating song
  to lure PCs deeper into the tomb to stagger into the killing box (area A2) or
  in the other direction, off the ledge outside the pyramid's entrance,
  resulting in a 500-foot fall to the city below.
