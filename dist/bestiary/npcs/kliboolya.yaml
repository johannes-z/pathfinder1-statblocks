SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Russet Mold (Ex)
    description: >-
      Kliboolya infects any creature it hits with its natural weapons with
      russet mold spores. The victim must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or the
      spores take root, inflicting 2 points of Constitution damage per round. A
      new Fortitude save can be attempted each round to halt the growth.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kliboolya moves to flank foes with its fellow vegepygmies, using multiple
  claws for the first few rounds so as to spread more spores around, and then
  switching to use its dagger in one hand once it has infested at least two
  enemies with spores.
Morale: Kliboolya fights to the death, but does not pursue foes off its ziggurat.
