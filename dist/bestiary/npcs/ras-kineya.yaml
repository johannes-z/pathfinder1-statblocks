SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Astral Gloom (Sp)
    description: >-
      Raskineya can expend one use of mythic power to cast deeper darkness. Her
      caster level for this ability is equal to her Hit Dice. This darkness
      doesn't interfere with her alien presence or gaze of the void abilities.
  - name: Dual Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Raskineya can expend one use of mythic power to use both her breath weapon
      and her suffocating breath simultaneously as a standard action. Both
      breath weapons affect the same 50-foot cone, and creatures caught in the
      cone must save separately against each effect.
  - name: Suffocating Void (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures swallowed whole by Raskineya are exposed to the cold vacuum of
      space. In addition to the listed damage, the first time a creature begins
      its turn swallowed whole by Raskineya, it must succeed at a Fortitude save
      or begin to suffocate (as her suffocating breath ability). Even if it
      succeeds at this save, the creature can't breathe, speak, or cast spells
      with verbal components while it remains swallowed.
