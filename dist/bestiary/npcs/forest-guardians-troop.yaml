SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Favored Enemy (Ex)
    description: >-
      See the Nirmathi skirmishers troop stat block above. The bonus on damage
      rolls also applies to the forest guardians troop's volley attack.
  - name: Volley (Ex)
    description: >-
      A forest guardians troop can fire a volley of arrows as a standard action.
      This attack takes the form of up to four lines with a range of 100 feet.
      These lines can each start from the corner of any square in the troop's
      space. Each creature in any of these lines takes 3d6 points of piercing
      damage per line that hits it (Reflex DC 21 half). The save DC is
      Dexterity-based.
  - name: Wild Allies (Ex)
    description: >-
      A forest guardians troop is made up of individuals who have a tight
      connection to the forest and the creatures that inhabit it. As a standard
      action while in forest terrain, the troop's members can call upon their
      animal allies to frighten and harry enemy troops. If the forest guardians
      troop succeeds at a Handle Animal check with a DC equal to 10 + the enemy
      troop's Hit Dice + its Wisdom modifier, the enemy troop is shaken and its
      Armor Class (including touch and flat-footed AC) decreases by 2 for 1
      round. For every 5 by which the check exceeds this DC, this effect lasts
      for 1 additional round. The forest guardians troop can use this ability
      only against enemy troops that they can see within 30 feet. Using this
      ability again on the same enemy troop, or using the Intimidate skill to
      demoralize the same enemy troop, simply extends the effect's duration (and
      does not create a stronger fear effect). The troop can use this ability
      against an enemy troop multiple times, but each subsequent check beyond
      the first increases the DC by 5. This increase resets after 1 hour has
      passed.
