  physical conflict. She drinks a potion of barkskin +5 if combat seems
  inevitable.

  Once a fight begins, Sabina is merciless. She prefers to strike with her
  falchion, using Power Attack to hit hard, but almost always grants mercy to
  foes when it is asked for.

  Sabina fights to the death to defend Queen Ileosa until she finally realizes
