BeforeCombat: >-
  Koriantu casts greater magic weapon on her sabre and magic vestment twice (on
  her armor and buckler); just before combat begins she casts air walk and
  shield of faith.
DuringCombat: >-
  Koriantu hangs back in combat, casting quickened sanctuary on the first round
  of combat and using her spells to control the battlefield or to harry foes
  while minions fight for her. She devotes her +3 bonus from her defending sabre
  to her Armor Class. She moves in quickly to use healing magic as needed. Air
  walk helps her to stay away from ground-based melee foes. Once she decides to
  fight, she abandons defensive casting to cast blasphemy and quickened divine
  favor, then blade barrier the next round, following with additional damaging
  spells as needed. If she sees that Cinnabar has succumbed to her previous weak
  personality, she focuses her actions on attempts to kill her before the fallen
  assassin can reveal too much to the enemy.
Morale: >-
  If she is reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, suffers a debilitating condition,
  or is outnumbered, Koriantu casts word of recall to return to the Crimson
  Citadel on distant Mediogalti Island. If she escapes in this way, she can be
  encountered again at Mistress Kayltanya's side in Chapter 6. If she fails to
  escape via word of recall, she uses invisibility to hide her flight and
  abandons the complex. If she can escape to safety on foot, she uses word of
  recall as soon as she prepares spells the next day.
