SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Enshrouding Caster (Ex)
    description: >-
      Since he is unable to speak, Masimo cannot cast spells with verbal
      components. However, when Masimo successfully uses his enshroud ability on
      a humanoid creature capable of speech, he can, instead of constricting the
      creature, apply pressure on the creature's vocal cords as a free action to
      enable him to cast spells normally.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Masimo attempts to enshroud the target who appears to be weakest physically.
  If successful, he immediately uses his enshrouding caster ability to cast
  obscuring mist, then alternates between channeling negative energy and
  spellcasting as appropriate.
Morale: >-
  Masimo fights until destroyed in his attempt to find a host body to control.
  If one of his foes dies, Masimo immediately enshrouds the corpse and moves
  toward the exit, eager to confront his daughter with his new body.
Gear: spell component pouch, platinum unholy symbol of Zon-Kuthon (worth 500 gp)
