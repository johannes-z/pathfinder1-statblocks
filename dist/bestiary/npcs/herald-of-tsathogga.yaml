SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bellow (Su)
    description: >-
      A herald of Tsathogga has two distinct bellows, each usable once every 1d4
      rounds. The first is a trilling croak like that of a frog. All opponents
      with 30 feet hearing this trilling must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save
      or be deafened for 1d6+4 rounds. Opponents within 10 feet must make a DC
      22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Alternately, a herald can
      focus its bellow attack against a single opponent within 100 feet. The
      opponent takes 5d6 points of sonic damage. A successful DC 22 Reflex save
      reduces the damage by half. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Bloated (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because of its bloated, heavy body, a herald of Tsathogga that attacks
      with more than 5 tentacles in one round cannot move that round.
  - name: Regeneration (Ex)
    description: >-
      A herald of Tsathogga takes normal damage from fire and good-aligned
      weapons, and from spells or effects with the good descriptor.
