BeforeCombat: The graven guardians cast haste on themselves on the first round of combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  These graven guardians do not attack any foe that openly displays Hakotep's
  badge of office or something they recognize as carrying the mark of the Sky
  Pharaoh, even if such a creature attacks them. The Mask of the Forgotten
  Pharaoh counts as just such an item as long as it is worn. The graven
  guardians know the location of the pits into the cavern below, and avoid
  entering these areas in combat.
Morale: >-
  Once they spot intruders, the graven guardians fight until destroyed. They do
  not pursue foes beyond this room.
