DuringCombat: >-
  Xoxl keeps Tannaris's defensive effect active at all times to augment his AC
  (note that this does not reduce the weapon's attack and damage modifiers, due
  to the artifact's nature). He stays at Belimarius's side and works to prevent
  anyone from engaging her in melee, focusing his attacks on those who have
  harmed or insulted his mistress.
Morale: >-
  Xoxl normally fights to the death, but if the PCs confront him with his
  frustrations over Belimarius's failure to grant him the transformation she
  promised long ago, they can cause him to turn against her in a fit of envious
  anger. To do this, a PC must either succeed at a Bluff check to convince Xoxl
  they will help him transform into a human or a DC 39 Diplomacy check made as a
  full-round action. If Xoxl turns on Belimarius, Tannaris immediately attempts
  to control him, forcing him to continue to act as Belimarius's champion; if
  successful, the sword compels Xoxl to attack the PC who convinced him to
  betray her, while a shocked and enraged Belimarius also seeks to destroy that
  PC.
