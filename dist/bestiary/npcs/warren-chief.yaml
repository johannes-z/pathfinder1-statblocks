BeforeCombat: >-
  The monk drinks his potions of barkskin and protection from energy (fire) if
  he has had time to study his foes' weaknesses. When fighting in cramped or
  narrow areas, he instead drinks his potion of invisibility and coats an area
  of the floor with his salve of slipperiness. He then waits for foes to enter
  the greased area before attacking.
DuringCombat: >-
  The monk uses his kama in conjunction with Spring Attack and Improved Trip to
  knock foes prone, potentially using the kama's ki focus special ability to
  channel his Stunning Fist. If he has successfully tripped foes with his salve
  of slipperiness, he activates his slippers of spider climbing so he doesn't
  have to cross the slippery floor, and uses flurry of blows with his shuriken.
  If outnumbered, he uses his elemental gem and flanks with the earth elemental.
Gear: >-
  elemental gem (earth), potion of barkskin, potion of cure moderate wounds,
  potion of cure serious wounds, potion of invisibility, potion of protection
