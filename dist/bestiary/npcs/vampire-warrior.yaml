SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Drain Chi (Su)
    description: >-
      Instead of draining blood, a jiang-shi vampire drains "chi," or life
      energy, from a victim's breath. When a jiang-shi makes a successful
      grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful
      check, including additional damage), the jiang-shi can attempt to drain
      chi by drinking the victim's breath. The victim can resist this attack by
      succeeding at a DC 17 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim gains 1
      negative level and is staggered for 1d4 rounds.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Vishkanya Venom: Weapon- injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6
      rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save.
  - name: Prayer Scroll (Su)
    description: >-
      The scroll attached to the brow of a jiang-shi grants immunity to any
      effects generated by spell-completion or spell-trigger magic items, such
      as scrolls and wands. Such magical effects treat the jiang-shi as if she
      had unbeatable spell resistance. A jiang-shi's prayer scroll can be
      removed with a successful steal combat maneuver (Pathfinder RPG Advanced
      Player's Guide 322), which immediately ends the jiang-shi's immunity to
      these effects. If a jiang-shi's prayer scroll is destroyed (a standard
      action), the vampire also loses her fast healing ability. A jiang-shi can
      create a replacement prayer scroll by using any strip of parchment and a
      writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted
      work.
  - name: Toxic (Ex)
    description: >-
      Four times per day as a swift action, a vishkanya can envenom a weapon
      that she wields with her toxic saliva or blood.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The warrior vampire uses her oil of keen edge on her katana and applies a dose
  of her racial poison to it.
DuringCombat: >-
  The warrior vampire uses her scabbard of vigor to grant her katana a +3
  enhancement bonus for 3 rounds. Once that expires, or if her katana attacks
  are ineffective, she resorts to natural attacks, grappling, and her drain chi
  ability.
Gear: >-
  oil of keen edge, potion of bull's strength, potion of fly, potion of haste,
  potion of inflict moderate wounds, potion of invisibility
OtherGear: >-
  o-yoroiUE, mwk katana, shuriken (20), brooch of shielding (50 points),
  scabbard of vigorUE, 46 gp
