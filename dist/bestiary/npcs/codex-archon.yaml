  - name: Codex (Su)
    description: >-
      Each codex archon is also an actual codex. Within its pages, the codex
      archon details all that the archon has ever learned on its chosen topic.
      When a favored enemy of the codex archon is forced to attempt a saving
      throw against the archon's spells, the foe takes a penalty on the saving
      throw equal to half the codex archon's favored enemy bonus (-2 for most
      codex archons).
  - name: Favored Enemy (Ex)
    description: A codex archon selects one favored enemy, as per the ranger class feature.
  - name: Light Ray (Ex)
    description: >-
      A codex archon can fire a beam of light to damage foes. This light ray has
      a maximum range of 60 feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of any
      type.
Description:
  - Environment any (Heaven)
  - Organization solitary, pair, or team (2-8)
  - Treasure standard
  - >-
    A codex archon embodies Heavenly knowledge and the refinement of the mind.
    It serves in the libraries and archives of Heaven, and as keeper and carrier
    of records for Heaven's field armies. Codex archons seek out any opportunity
    to add to their formidable collections of information with zealous
    dedication, although they do not neglect to offer their insights to those
    they encounter who might use such knowledge for the greater good or for
    personal growth.
  - >-
    Most codex archons specialize in a single subject, such as one plane of
    existence, one type of creature, or one aspect of mortal life. In general,
    each codex archon chooses a favored enemy and Knowledge skill closely linked
    to each other, such as humanoid (human) and Knowledge (local) or Knowledge
    (nobility). Although a codex archon's expertise allows it to more easily
    slay creatures of the type it studies, it usually prefers to avoid violence
    and uses its knowledge to coax more information out of creatures it meets. A
    spellcaster who calls or summons a codex archon can generally conjure one
    with whatever specialization she seeks unless the foe or topic is one that
    is little known to the forces of Heaven or an unorthodox combination (GM's
    discretion). Though they prefer their heavenly homes to the chaotic Material
    Plane, summoned codex archons may deign to serve for a time as assistants or
    even instructors in mortal libraries, academies, and temples.
