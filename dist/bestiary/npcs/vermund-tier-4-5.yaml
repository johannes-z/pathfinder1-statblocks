BeforeCombat: >-
  If Vermund knows the PCs are coming, he casts barkskin on himself (not figured
  into his stats), summons a dire rat, and then hides behind the westernmost
  bookshelf.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vermund lets the agents fight in melee and tries to stay back, casting summon
  swarm to summon spider swarms and using his magic stones and sling to hit PCs
  who are out of melee combat. He also casts cure light wounds if one of his
  agents looks seriously hurt. If there are particularly tough PCs, he activates
  his feather token and directs it after that PC, then hits him with flare
  whenever it makes sense to do so. If reduced to fewer than 5 hit points,
  Vermund attempts to drink his potion of cure moderate wounds on his next
  action.
Morale: Vermund fights to the death.
Gear: feather token (whip), potion of cure moderate wounds
OtherGear: +1 hide armor, masterwork scythe, sling with 10 bullets, 339 gp
