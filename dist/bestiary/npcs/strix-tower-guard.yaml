    description: >-
      Strix receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the
      human subtype due to special training against these hated foes.
BeforeCombat: The strix hide among the ruins of the abandoned tower.
DuringCombat: >-
  The strix want to humiliate the PCs, especially any human PCs. They try to
  entangle a human PC in a snag net. If they succeed, the strix with the net
  tries to trip the entangled PC, while the other strix uses his Flyby Attack
  feat to strike that PC with a longspear. If both strix miss with their nets,
  they may try to fly away to refold the nets, or fight with their longspears.
  If the PCs knock a strix unconscious, the other strix screeches at them and
  takes to the air, attacking with her longbow from point-blank range.
Morale: >-
  A strix attempts to flee if she believes that the PCs are likely to knock her
  unconscious before she has another  opportunity to escape. If one strix is
  unconscious or dead, the other strix fights to the death to protect her ally.
