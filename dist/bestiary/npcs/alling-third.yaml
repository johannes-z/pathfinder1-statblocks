SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Combined Arms (Ex)
    description: >-
      When taking a full-attack action, Alling Third can simultaneously attack
      with melee and ranged integrated weapons. He does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity with his integrated gravity rifle when using combined arms.
  - name: Force Field (Ex)
    description: >-
      Alling Third incorporated a force field generator into his mechanical
      body. Alling is sheathed in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants
      him 200 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to the lich while his force
      field is active is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the
      force field is active, Alling is immune to critical hits. Alling's force
      field has fast healing 20, but once these bonus hit points are reduced to
      0, the force field shuts down and doesn't reactivate for 24 hours.
  - name: Integrated Gravity Rifle (Ex)
    description: >-
      Alling Third has a built-in gravity rifle. This weapon uses a focused beam
      of gravitons to create a bolt of force. The integrated gravity rifle has
      two settings-switching between settings is a swift action. On its pulse
      setting, it can be used as a typical beam weapon that deals 4d6 points of
      force damage; on its sustained setting, the weapon creates a stable beam
      of gravitons rather than a short, destructive burst. In sustained mode,
      the integrated gravity rifle can be used to move and manipulate objects at
      a distance, similar to a telekinesis spell in its sustained force or
      combat maneuver versions. The graviton beam can move objects weighing no
      more than 350 pounds up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate this
      effect on an object in its possession with a successful DC 27 Reflex save.
      If used to perform a combat maneuver, the beam uses Alling's CMB with a +4
      bonus, and uses his Intelligence modifier in place of his Strength or
      Dexterity modifier. The save DC is Intelligence-based.
  - name: Part Machine (Ex)
    description: >-
      Alling Third is more than just a human with cybernetics installed in his
      body. Most of his current form is machine and his body is undead. In this
      current form, Alling's Strength is increased by +6, and he can use the
      touch attack granted to the lich (along with the paralyzing touch special
      attack) by touching an enemy with his mechanical arms. Alling's current
      form is also well armored; his mechanical body provides hardness 15 until
      he is reduced to 50 or fewer hit points. At that point, Alling's channel
      resistance drops from +8 to +4, but his lich defensive abilities also kick
      in, and he receives the benefit of his damage reduction. In addition, the
      cyborg-lich has found ways to incorporate his magic items into his
      mechanical body.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Alling Third casts mage armor every day&#8211;it lasts for 17 hours. During
  the times it's not in effect, he keeps other protections in order. He watches
  the PCs during their journey through his complex to determine the best energy
  resistance to cast on himself, but doesn't bother if the intruders tend to
  deal cold or electricity damage.
DuringCombat: >-
  Alling favors hit-and-run tactics. He uses project image to test and harass
  the PCs, learning their tactics before confronting them in person. When he
  finally faces the PCs, he uses dimension door to escape any conflict that is
  stacked against him, retreating to set up another ambush in his ruins of
  horror.
Morale: >-
  Alling Third is confident in his own abilities, but he always tries to escape
  a bad situation. He believes that his phylactery is brilliant and
  indecipherable, so he's confident that if he is destroyed he will always
  rejuvenate. Alling would never leave his compound; if cornered, he fights
  until destroyed.
OtherGear: >-

  intelligence +6, ring of protection +5, spellbook (contains all 0-level
  spells, all prepared spells, permanency, symbol of death, wish, and 4d12
