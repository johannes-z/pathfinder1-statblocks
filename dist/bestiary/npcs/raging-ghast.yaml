    description: >-
      Ghoul Fever: Bite- injury; save Fort DC 19; onset 1 day; frequency 1 day;
      effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC
      is Charisma-based. A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at
      the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none
      of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of any
      other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like
      a normal ghoul in all respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as
      a ghast.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: The ghast moves to the area marked G and waits.
DuringCombat: >-
  Because of the close quarters, the ghast tries to block in the first PC
  through the door and limit combat to just him and the first PC. Should the PCs
  back out of the room, the ghast hides at the spot marked G again and waits.
Morale: The ghast fights until destroyed.

  tools), 250 gp
