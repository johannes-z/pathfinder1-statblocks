SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Command Stone (Sp)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as dominate monster, equivalent to a 9th-level
      spell, but only on creatures with the earth subtype or constructs made of
      stone. When used against a construct, this ability overcomes any spell
      resistance, but these effects last 1 round per caster level.
  - name: Crystal Burst (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a xiomorn can create an
      explosion of razor-sharp crystals at a range of 120 feet. These crystals
      fill a 30-foot-radius burst and deal 12d6 points of piercing and slashing
      damage (Reflex DC 27 half). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Crystallization (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature struck by a xiomorn's claw must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude
      save or take 1 point of Dexterity drain. On a critical hit, the claw deals
      2 points of Dexterity drain on a failed save. As long as the creature
      suffers any of this drain, portions of its body appear as living green
      crystal and it gains the earth creature subtype. A creature whose
      Dexterity score is drained to 0 in this manner transforms into a green
      crystal statue, as if affected by flesh to stone. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Item Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A xiomorn can always activate spell trigger and spell completion items as
      if the spell were on its class list. For the purposes of crafting magic
      items or constructs, it is treated as though it had all item creation
      feats.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ziguch relies on flesh to stone and its wand of enervation to subdue rather
  than kill, reverting to its claws and crystal burst attack only if
  overwhelmed.
Morale: >-
  Ziguch fights because it is compelled to. If the PCs slay the immortal ichor
  first, or break the dominate monster effect over Ziguch, the xiomorn parleys
  for peace.
