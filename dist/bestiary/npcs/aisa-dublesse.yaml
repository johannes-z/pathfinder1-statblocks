SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Exceptional Resources (Ex)
    description: >-
      Aisa inherited a great many magical resources from her mentor Oothi,
      giving her the wealth of a PC rather than an NPC. This equipment increases
      her CR by 1.
  - name: Permanent Spells (Ex)
    description: >-
      Aisa benefits from the following permanent spells cast on herself: see
      invisibility and telepathic bond (with Oothi).
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Aisa casts extended mage armor every day, and casts vampiric touch into her
  witching gown (activating its spite effect; see page 51). Before combat, she
  drinks a draught of bloodbrew elixir, as well as potions of bull's strength
  and eagle's splendor. She then casts solid fog and hides herself in gaseous
  form near the ceiling.
DuringCombat: >-
  Aisa drifts along the edges of her solid fog cloud in gaseous form until the
  PCs move toward it, at which point she reforms to cast waves of fatigue before
  withdrawing inside the fog for cover. If the PCs pursue her, she activates her
  flight hex to levitate to the ceiling and conjures black tentacles on the
  chamber floor. She targets opponents with her hexes, spells, and wands, making
  touch attacks with spectral hand. In melee combat, Aisa makes slam attacks to
  energy drain her foes, casting twilight knife to flank with her.
Morale: >-
  Aisa fights until reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, using dimension door or
  gaseous form to retreat through the secret door in the southernmost wine vault
  (area F31) into the ossuary (area F24), where she heals herself before
  returning to finish the battle. If reduced to 0 hit points, Aisa assumes
  gaseous form and flees to her coffin in area F27 to recover.
Gear: >-
  bloodbrew elixir (4 doses; see page 35), elemental gems (earth, fire), potions
  of bull's strength (2), potions of eagle's splendor (2), potions of inflict
