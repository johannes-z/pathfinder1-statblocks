BeforeCombat: >-
  Tavariel casts longstrider on Jumblegrin, her crocodile companion, and waits
  out of sight. In her blind, she has total cover and cannot be detected until
  the PCs start across the river. Once a PC triggers the swinging axe trap or
  when a PC reaches the halfway point swimming or climbing across the river,
  Tavariel and Jumblegrin attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tavariel rains arrows upon PCs crossing the river, using silver arrows against
  PCs with the bestial simple template. If she feels confident she can hit a
  given target, she uses both Deadly Aim and Rapid Shot to make twice the number
  of attacks at higher damage. She prefers to avoid melee, but draws her
  scimitar to fight if necessary.
Morale: Extraordinarily confident in her abilities, Tavariel fights until disabled.
Gear: wand of cure light wounds (50 charges), 20 silver arrows

  leather armor, masterwork buckler, masterwork composite longbow (+1 Str) with
  20 arrows, scimitar, cloak of elvenkind, lesser bracers of archery
