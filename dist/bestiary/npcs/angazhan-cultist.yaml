BeforeCombat: >-
  If the lookouts spot the approaching Pathfinders and report their arrival to
  the larger cult, six of them gather their weapons and move to the mouth of the
  cave, while another six climb vines and ready swinging attacks. If unaware of
  the PCs, the cultists are dispersed throughout the room, either sleeping or
  eating.
DuringCombat: >-
  The cultists begin shrieking when they make their first attack and continue
  until killed. The cultists on the vines swing across the cavern on each turn,
  using their Combat Expertise, Mobility, and Spring Attack feats to attack PCs
  as they pass.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 15 or fewer hit points, a cultist attempts to flee into the
  jungle.
