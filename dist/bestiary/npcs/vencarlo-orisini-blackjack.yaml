SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Exceptional Wealth (Ex)
    description: >-
      The value of Vencarlo's gear far exceeds that of most 10th-level NPCs-as a
      result, his CR is 1 higher than normal.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  If confronted with peril in his social guise, Vencarlo does his best to
  retreat to a place of privacy and safety to assume his vigilante guise.
DuringCombat: >-
  In his social guise, Vencarlo fights with his +1 rapier and does not use his
  lethal grace vigilante talent or his hidden strike ability; at these times, he
  fights defensively and attempts to escape to a place of hiding so he can
  become Blackjack. In his vigilante guise, Vencarlo is much more dangerous and
  aggressive. He begins fights with attempts to disarm his foes, but if reduced
  to fewer than 30 hit points, he uses Combat Expertise to bolster his Armor
  Class and focuses on simple attacks to defeat enemies.
Morale: >-
  Vencarlo flees any battle where he's outnumbered more than three to one
  (unless he's attempting to right a great injustice). He also flees combat if
  reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, seeking out a place to hide and recover
  and thus live to fight another day.
Gear: >-
  +2 slick leather armor, +2 keen rapier, +1 rapier, mwk daggers (12), amulet of
  proof against detection and location, bag of holding (type I), boots of
  elvenkind, cloak of elvenkind, gloves of swimming and climbing, noble's
  outfit, gold signet ring (worth 250 gp), 34 pp, 29 gp
