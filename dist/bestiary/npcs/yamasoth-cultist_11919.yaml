BeforeCombat: >-
  The cultists have coated their halberds and daggers with polymorph plague, so
  the first creature they strike with these weapons is exposed to the
  affliction.
DuringCombat: >-
  The cultists each cast divine favor before they begin smashing at doors so
  they'll be able to do a bit more damage, and then cast shield of faith on the
  first round they are attacked. A cultist reduced to 15 or fewer hit points
  uses healing magic on himself. Each cultist carries a length of rope for use
  with animate rope to entangle PCs as needed.
Morale: >-
  These cultists fight to the death until they hear Leptonia's sound burst, at
  which point the survivors flee.
Gear: potion of fly
OtherGear: >-
  +1 studded leather, mwk halberd, dagger, iron holy symbol of Yamasoth,
  masterwork thieves' tools, silk rope (50 ft.)
