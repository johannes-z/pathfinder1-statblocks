SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Avalanche (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action an avalanche legion can move up to twice its speed
      and overrun creatures in its path. This ability is identical to the
      trample universal monster rule, except the damage dealt is equal to the
      avalanche legion's troop attack (and creatures damaged by this ability are
      automatically affected by the avalanche legion's quake aura). Each
      creature occupying the avalanche legion's space or reach when it ends its
      movement takes an additional 2d6+6 points of damage.
  - name: Earth Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A burrowing avalanche legion can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any
      other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water.
      If protected against fire damage, it can even glide through lava. This
      burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple
      or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area
      containing a burrowing avalanche legion flings the elemental back 30 feet,
      stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds at a DC 15 Fortitude
      save.
  - name: Quake Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      An avalanche legion upturns and shatters natural earth or stone terrain
      within its space and in all adjacent spaces. This causes the space an
      avalanche legion occupies and all adjacent spaces to be treated as
      difficult terrain to creatures without the earth glide ability. A creature
      that ends its turn adjacent to an avalanche legion must succeed at a
      Reflex save (DC 23) or fall prone.
  - name: Volley (Ex)
    description: >-
      An avalanche legion troop can hurl a volley of rocks as a standard action.
      This attack takes the form of up to four lines with a range of 100 feet.
      These lines can start from the corner of any square in the troops space.
      All creatures in any of these lines take 4d8 points of bludgeoning damage
      (Reflex DC 19 half). The save DC is Dexterity-based and includes a +2
      racial bonus.
BeforeCombat: >-
  An avalanche legion uses its earth glide ability  to travel below the ground
  and surprises enemies by erupting from below them.
DuringCombat: >-
  An avalanche stays focused on a single opponent, moving only to keep the
  opponent within its space until that foe is dead.
Morale: An avalanche legion is absolutely loyal to Ayrzul and fights to the death.
