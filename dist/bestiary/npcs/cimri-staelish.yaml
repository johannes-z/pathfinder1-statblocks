Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If she has time and the situation calls for it, Cimri applies a dose of blue
  whinnis poison to her kukri before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Cimri has no interest in fighting fair. She prefers to fade into the
  background, letting her foes focus on more obvious threats, while she
  positions herself to make sneak attacks. Whenever possible, she begins combat
  with a sneak attack, then swiftly retreats. Although merciless against
  strangers, Cimri avoids personally killing her neighbors. She uses her sap
  rather than her kukri on any Longacre resident.
Morale: >-
  Cimri has no intention of being buried anywhere near Longacre. She retreats if
  reduced to 5 hit points or fewer, abandoning any allies (such as the PCs) to
  fight for themselves.
Gear: blue whinnis (2), tanglefoot bag

  hook, hooded lantern, mwk thieves' tools, oil, silk rope (50 ft.), 20 gp
