SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A shadow giant's energy drain attack functions through its slam or any
      weapon it wields. This ability triggers only once per round, on the first
      successful hit, regardless of the number of attacks the giant makes.
  - name: Militant (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shadow giant is proficient with all simple weapons, all martial weapons,
      and one exotic weapon of its choice; these giants are proficient with the
      spiked chain.
  - name: Shadow Cloak (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because of shadow giants' connection with the Plane of Shadow, as a move
      action in any illumination other than direct sunlight, a shadow giant can
      cloak itself in moving shadows that act as per the spell blur for 1d6+6
      rounds. A shadow giant can use this ability three times per day.
Gender: Male and Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If they are alerted, the giants turn the table on its side to give themselves
  cover; they activate their shadow cloaks just before combat begins if
  possible.
DuringCombat: >-
  If the giants have upended the table, they use it as cover while throwing
  immense shadowstone bricks at the PCs. When engaged in melee, the giants use
  Power Attack and move to flank foes, using Improved Vital Strike on rounds
  where they can't make full attacks. When they make full attacks, they attempt
  to sunder a foe's weapon with their first attacks each round. If a giant is
  reduced to fewer than 100 hit points, it attempts to enter the pool of liquid
  shadow in area C4c to both heal and gain cover against foes.
Morale: These giants fight to the death.
