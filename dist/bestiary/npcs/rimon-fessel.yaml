SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bellflower Crop (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Rimon can designate up to six allies as part of his
      bellflower crop. These allies must remain within 30 feet of Rimon to gain
      the benefits granted by his other class abilities; if they leave this
      range, Rimon must designate these allies again for them to be included in
      his crop.
  - name: Crop Guardian (Ex)
    description: >-
      Rimon is dedicated to ensuring the safety and success of those he guides.
      Whenever Rimon uses the aid another action for a member of his bellflower
      crop, he grants a +3 bonus instead of the normal +2.
  - name: Favored Barn (Ex)
    description: >-
      Rimon is familiar with and has developed trusted contacts in Egorian.
      While inside the city, he gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and
      Knowledge (local), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks. Any ally
      designated as part of his bellflower crop receives a +1 bonus on these
      skills. Rimon leaves no trail and cannot be tracked while traveling
      through Egorian (although he can leave a trail if he so desires). Provided
      he isn't in immediate danger (such as fleeing from pursuers right on his
      heels), Rimon can always find a safe place in Egorian for him and members
      of his crop to rest, where they are fed, clothed, and provided with basic
      medical attention (as if attended by a character with a total Heal bonus
      of +10).
  - name: Scarecrow (Ex)
    description: >-
      Rimon receives a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls made against
      creatures that threaten members of his bellflower crop.
  - name: Swift Sower (Ex)
    description: >-
      Rimon's base land speed is treated as if it were 10 feet faster when
      determining his overland travel speed while he's traveling long distances
      and outside of combat. Members of his bellflower crop can use either the
      Rimon's overland travel speed or their own, whichever is better.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  If warned of approaching danger, Rimon drinks a potion of barkskin and
  designates the Bellflower rogues and Zsatha as his bellflower crop.
DuringCombat: >-
  Rimon and the rogues stick together, taking advantage of Rimon's bellflower
  crop abilities and teamwork feats to outmaneuver and flank opponents.
Morale: >-
  Rimon fights to the death, choosing death rather than giving up any
  information about the Bellflower Network.
