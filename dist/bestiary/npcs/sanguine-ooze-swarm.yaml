    description: >-
      Sanguine oozes are composed of congealed euphoric toxins. Any living
      creature that begins its turn affected by the swarm's viscous ability must
      succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or erupt into uncontrollable laughter
      and be effectively staggered for that round. This is a mind-affecting
      effect. Creatures immune to poison are immune to this effect.
  - name: Viscous (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a sanguine ooze swarm makes a swarm attack on a Small or larger
      creature, that creature must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be covered
      in patches of sticky ooze globules. Those who fail are entangled until the
      patches of ooze are removed. The ooze can be removed by spending a
      full-round action to fling off the globules- though this action might be
      impeded by the ooze's effects. If a creature affected by this ability
      takes any amount of cold damage, the ooze patches are immediately
      destroyed. The save DC is Constitution-based.
