  Zooif prefers a running fight, using her net and tanglefoot bag to slow down
  opponents. She uses Deadly Aim at all times. The grippli fears dogs and
  similar creatures far more than people, and targets animal companions first,
  but saves her magic arrows for bigger game.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 8 hit points, Zooif tries to flee the fort, using her
