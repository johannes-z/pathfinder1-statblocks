  nature bond (giant bee vermin companion named Fulvid),  nature sense,
  trackless step, wild empathy +9, woodland stride
Source: Realm of the Fellnight Queen
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Fulvid warns Tenzekil of the PCs' approach, he casts bull's strength,
  barkskin, protection from energy (fire), and longstrider on himself, in that
  order.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tenzekil casts air walk on the first round, using his improved speed with
  longstrider to rise well above his swarming bees. From there, his Vermin Heart
  feat enables him to cast greater magic fang on Fulvid, sending the giant bee
  and his swarm after opposing spellcasters. He then casts ranged spells like
  call lightning, flaming sphere, and dispel magic to soften up his opponents.
  He casts stoneskin before closing with his flame blade or shillelagh.
Morale: >-
  Demoralized by his lack of success in stopping the PCs and having grown
  resentful of Rhoswen's cruelty, Tenzekil harbors second thoughts about
  sacrificing himself for her plans. If Fulvid and the bee swarms perish, the
  gnome visibly loses his resolve and curses the fey-queen, blaming her for
  costing him all he ever loved. Savvy PCs may use Diplomacy to convince him to
  abandon the fight. Tenzekil's attitude begins as Unfriendly rather than
  Hostile for such a check. If they persuade him to become Friendly, he
  surrenders. If they make him Helpful, he willingly aids their quest, hoping to
  undo the damage he caused. He tells them about the secret entrance to
  Rhoswen's palace at area H7 and gives them his scroll of antiplant shell and
  scroll of neutralize poison in the hopes they can use them.
