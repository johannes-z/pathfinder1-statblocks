SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Grab and Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A plantoid servitor that succeeds on a grapple check can make a bite
      attack against its opponent as an immediate action. This attack uses the
      plantoid servitor's full attack bonus and deals 1d3+2 damage.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Transformative Poison: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for
      4 rounds; effect special; cure 1 save. On the first failed save, the
      victim is paralyzed for 1d6 rounds. On the second failed saving throw,
      moss rapidly grows on all skin surfaces. The victim gets a +2 bonus on the
      third saving throw, but if the third save fails the victim becomes a
      plantoid servitor under the control of the nearest plantoid. There is a
      25% chance that the victim becomes a new plantoid in a hideous
      transformation that takes 24 hours. If the victim succeeds on his third
      saving throw, the moss that grew on him withers and dies and falls away
      within a few minutes. The save DC is Constitution-based.
