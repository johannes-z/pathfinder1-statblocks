    description: >-
      A bloody skeletal champion is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points, but
      it returns to life 1 hour later at 1 hit point, allowing its fast healing
      to resume healing it thereafter. A bloody skeletal champion can be
      permanently destroyed if it is destroyed by positive energy, if it is
      reduced to 0 hit points in the area of a bless or hallow spell, or if its
      remains are sprinkled with a vial of holy water. Destroying the runes
      inscribed on the wall at area D5 removes the deathless quality from these
      undead.
DuringCombat: >-
  These bloody skeletal champions open combat with their bows and then split
  into two groups as the PCs approach, allowing at least half their number to
  hang back and continue firing arrows while the others engage in melee. They
  always use Deadly Aim and Power Attack when attacking (their statistics above
  reflect this tactic).
Morale: These undead fight until destroyed.
Gear: breastplate, +1 greatsword, +1 composite longbow (+4 Str) with 20 arrows
