  Amiri counts on her high Strength and the sheer size of her blade to defeat
  foes, knowing that her attacks are less accurate because of the sword's size.
  When she has difficulty hitting a target, needs to deal even more damage, or
  needs the extra boost to her Constitution, Amiri rages and uses Power Attack
  to bring enemies to their knees.  Raging Statistics When raging, Amiri's stats
