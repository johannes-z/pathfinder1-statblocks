DuringCombat: >-
  Once on board the keelboat, Tark rages. He concentrates on one foe at a time,
  activating his guarded  stance rage power and slashing his victim using Power
  Attack with his mighty falchion. He resorts to throwing his javelins only if
  he can't close to melee range.
Morale: >-
  Tark fights to the death, but if the fire-scarred orc takes 4 or more points
  of fire damage from a single attack, his fear of fire takes over. If this
  happens, Tark's rage immediately ends and he gains the shaken condition (in
  addition to being fatigued from exiting a rage). If he takes more than 20
  points of fire damage in 1 round, Tark immediately jumps into the river and
  flees in abject terror.
