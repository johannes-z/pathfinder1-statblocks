BeforeCombat: If Ploog expects trouble, he drinks his potion of heroism.
Morale: >-
  During Combat Ploog activates the pit trap if he can catch two or more enemies
  in its area. He then attacks with his falchion, attempting to eliminate any
  clerics or spellcasters first. Ploog typically uses one of his attacks each
  round to perform the dirty trick combat maneuver to hinder a threatening melee
  combatant.  Ploog tries to escape&#8211;either on foot or with his potion of
  fly&#8211;if reduced to 15 hit points or fewer.
Gear: potion of heroism, potion of fly
