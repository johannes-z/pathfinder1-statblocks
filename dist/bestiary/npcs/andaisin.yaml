BeforeCombat: >-
  Every morning, Lady Andaisin casts extended status on a cultist of Urgathoa in
  area G13, Rolth, and Dr. Davaulus. As soon as she realizes the temple is
  invaded (likely because the alarm is raised or because one of the creatures
  she's cast status on is wounded), she casts air walk, greater magic weapon,
  and magic vestment on herself and drinks her potion of barkskin. When she
  hears the sounds of combat in area G13, she casts aid and extended shield of
  faith on herself as well. If enemies do not arrive in area G14 within 4
  minutes, she makes a quick patrol of every room in the temple to seek them out
  (or to determine whether the intruders have been defeated).
DuringCombat: >-
  Andaisin's first act in combat is to cast divine power on herself to gain a +3
  luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, Strength checks, and
  Strength-based skill checks along with 10 temporary hit points (these effects
  have not been included in her statistics above). After that, she uses air walk
  to climb to a point 10 feet off the ground, then spends the following few
  rounds of combat casting spells at the PCs. She generally starts with greater
  command, ordering her enemies to fall prone before her, then follows that by
  casting blindness/deafness on an obvious cleric, dispel magic on a PC who has
  obvious spell effects, or spiritual weapon on a wizard or other frail-looking
  PC. She then casts slay living, holds the charge, and drops down into melee
  with the PCs. If brought to fewer than 30 hit points, she retreats back into
  the air, casting obscuring mist on the ground below to make it difficult for
  non-flying creatures to target her. She spends the next few rounds healing
  herself before returning to battle.
Morale: >-
  Lady Andaisin fights to the death, and is then transformed into a daughter of
  Urgathoa.
