SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, Ismene can issue forth a cone of fire,
      dealing 10d6 points of fire damage to all creatures in a 30-foot cone (DC
      20 Reflex half). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Flash of Insight (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as an immediate action, a cyclops can peer into an occluded
      visual spectrum of possible futures, gaining insight that allows it to
      select the exact result of one die roll before the roll is made. This
      effect can alter an action taken by the cyclops only and cannot be applied
      to the rolls of others.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Ismene uses her breath weapon first and waits for the seeress to enhance her
  weapon before closing in melee combat. She does not use her flash of insight
  on an attack roll, instead reserving it for a saving throw against a
  particularly dangerous spell or effect that would disable her.
Morale: Ismene is fanatical in her beliefs and fights to the death.
