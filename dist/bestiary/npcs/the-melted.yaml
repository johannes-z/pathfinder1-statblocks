SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Digest (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Melted does not do as much acid damage with its digest attack as a
      normal undigested swarm. A target that takes swarm damage from it is
      spattered with acidic slime and must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or
      take 1d6 points of acid damage at the start of its turn for 1d4 rounds. An
      affected creature can attempt a new save as a full-round action. Washing
      off the acid grants a +4 bonus to this save. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Grasping Clutches (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature that takes swarm damage from the Melted is grabbed and held by
      the swarm's dozens of clutching hands, gaining the entangled condition. In
      order to move more than 5 feet away from the Melted, a character entangled
      in this way must succeed at a DC 15 combat maneuver check or Escape Artist
      check as part of the move action taken to try to escape the swarm's
      grasping clutches.
