DuringCombat: >-
  The Back-Alley Boys use stealth and the alleys' dim light to launch one attack
  from range to weaken their targets' resolve, then demand they abandon their
  goods. If their victims refuse, the goblins attack with their horsechoppers,
  using their reach to trip less martial opponents. If an enemy comes inside
  their reach, however, the goblins use Quick Draw to draw their short swords
  and attack.
Morale: >-

  case they scatter.
