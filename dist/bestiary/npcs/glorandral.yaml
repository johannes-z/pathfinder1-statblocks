DuringCombat: >-
  Moving closer to his foes each round, Glorandral attacks with his crossbow
  until the case of bolts is empty or he is within melee range. While fighting
  in melee, the skum makes full attacks with his natural weapons. If any of his
  melee opponents have shorter reach than he does, he uses knockback in place of
  his bite attack each round and takes a 5-foot step at the end of each round to
  put 10 feet between himself and such foes, thus preventing these foes from
  making full attacks against him.
Morale: >-
  Although fiercely loyal to Onthooth, Glorandral thinks he can serve his master
  better when alive and flees if reduced to 20 hit points or fewer.
