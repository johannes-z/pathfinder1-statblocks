SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cannon (Ex)
    description: >-
      Gurstweld grafted a Large siege cannon to his amputated arm years ago, and
      has since perfected its use. This cannon has the same statistics as the
      cannon siege weapon (Ultimate Combat 162), except Gurstweld can wield it
      one-handed and ignores the usual -4 penalty for a Large or larger creature
      wielding a siege firearm. He can aim the weapon as a free action, and he
      can reload it as a standard action as long as he has one hand free (this
      can be further reduced to a move action if an adjacent creature is using
      the aid another action to help Gurstweld reload the cannon). He keeps a
      cannonball in the cannon at all times. In addition, Gurstweld can use the
      cannon to make a slam attack, dealing damage as a creature one size
      larger, though he cannot inflict mana fever with this slam attack.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Slam-injury; save Fort DC 21; onset 1d4 minutes; frequency 1/day; effect
      1d3 Con damage, 1d3 Cha drain. Anyone who lives with mana fever for a week
      straight without dying becomes immune to the disease, but also becomes a
      Mana Wastes mutant; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  If he knows there's trouble in the factory, Gurstweld imbibes his potions of
  haste and barkskin before confronting any potential foes.
DuringCombat: >-
  Gurstweld uses his cannon against foes both near and far, firing cannon balls
  at ranged foes (using his Ricochet Shot Deed if necessary against creatures
  with cover) and targeting up-close groups of enemies with blast shots or melee
  attacks. He calls upon his minions, both clockwork and monstrous, to surround
  and defend him.
Morale: Gurstweld's determination is fierce, and he fights to the death.
