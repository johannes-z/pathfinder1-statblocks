BeforeCombat: >-
  Tycha keeps his longsword coated in purple worm poison. He hides and attempts
  to study the strongest-looking opponent for his death attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tycha prefers to open combat with a death attack, assuming that the poison on
  his blade will incapacitate his foe even if his death attack isn't successful 
  He thereafter flanks with his ghouls when possible to deliver sneak attacks.
Morale: >-
  Tycha is the most practical member of the Council Libertine and wants to be
  sure to return to Geb with information, if not full success. If reduced to
  fewer than 50 hit points, Tycha retreats and plans to return to Geb right
  away. If necessary to make this escape, Tycha might pretend to surrender long
  enough to flee.
Gear: deathblade, nightmare vapor, purple worm poison (2)
