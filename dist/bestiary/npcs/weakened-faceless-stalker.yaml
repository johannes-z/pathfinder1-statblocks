DuringCombat: >-
  The faceless stalkers initially attack with their slams on the first round of
  combat, so as not to raise suspicion by approaching the PCs with drawn swords.
  In later rounds, however, individual faceless stalkers might draw their
  longswords.
Morale: >-
  Though they know that the ruse is up and there's no turning back now, the
  faceless stalkers don't want to die after spending so long in the colony. They
  flee when reduced to 10 hit points or below.
Gear: longsword
Land: 1
TemplatesApplied: degenerate|
BaseStatistics: >-
  If given the chance to feed and have a full day's rest, the faceless stalkers
