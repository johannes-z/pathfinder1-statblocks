  Merisiel's life experiences have taught her to enjoy things to their fullest
  as they occur, since it's impossible to tell when the good times might end.
  Never the sharpest knife in the drawer, Merisiel makes up for this by carrying
  at least a dozen of them on her person. She hasn't met a problem yet that
  can't, in one way or another, be solved with things that slice. While she's
  always on the move and working on her latest batch of plots for easy money, in
  the end it comes down to being faster than everyone elseâ€”either on her feet,
  or with her beloved blades. She wouldn't have it any other way.
Gear: acid, alchemist's fire (2), thunderstone
OtherGear: >-
  leather armor, rapier, daggers (12), backpack, grappling hook, hooded lantern,
  oil (5), rations (3), silk rope, thieves' tools, 25 gp
