BeforeCombat: >-
  Thessene has already activated his ice armor revelation for the day. In
  addition, he casts greater magic weapon on his crossbow and bear's endurance
  and shield of faith on himself before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  When he is within 20 feet of Elissi, Thessene gains a +4 resistance bonus on
  saving throws against attacks made or created by evil creatures from the
  cetaceal's protective aura. Thessene casts divine favor on the first round of
  combat, then attacks with spells or his crossbow (using Deadly Aim), casting
  cold ice strike as a swift action every round to take advantage of his
  freezing spells revelation. Against evil foes, Thessene uses his punitive
  transformation revelation to turn his foes into fish, especially if they are
  on land.
Morale: Thessene fights valiantly to the death.
