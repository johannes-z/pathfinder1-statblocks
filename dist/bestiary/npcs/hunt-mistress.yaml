BeforeCombat: >-
  The hunt mistress uses levitate to hide amid the stalactites, 20 feet above
  the ground. She casts barkskin and bear's endurance once she notices the PCs
  coming toward the beach. She watches the PCs move through the area, and if
  she's not spotted, she drops down to the ground via feather fall once the PCs
  move on, then follows them. She only attacks if they attack first.
DuringCombat: >-
  The hunt mistress casts gravity bow on the first round of combat, then
  levitates back down to the ground if necessary. Once on stable ground, she
  uses her crossbow, Deadly Aim, and Shot on the Run to make a fighting retreat
  to area D9 to rejoin her kin. When fighting with others, the hunt mistress
  instead makes full attacks, taking 5-foot steps as necessary to avoid attacks
  of opportunity.
Morale: >-
  The slave collar worn by the hunt mistress ensure that she fights to the death
  as long as Xaivanshee lives. If Xaivanshee dies, the hunt mistress immediately
  flees back toward area D8, leaps in, and feather falls back down to Sekamina
  to return home.
Gear: >-
  +1 chain shirt, +1 buckler, +2 shock hand crossbow with 10 drow sleep poisoned
  bolts, mwk rapier, slave collar (attuned to Xaivanshee Rasivrein)
