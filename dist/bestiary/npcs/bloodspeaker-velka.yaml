BeforeCombat: Wary of strangers, Velka casts see invisibility before meeting with the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  Velka begins combat by casting haste and beginning her inspire courage bardic
  performance. In following rounds, she uses her magic to impede the PCs, dispel
  their magic, and summon elementals to engage airborne threats. She also heals
  her allies but prefers to save healing for after combat. She doesn't enjoy
  unnecessary slaughter, and offers the PCs the opportunity to surrender
  whenever a PC suffers a critical hit, falls unconscious, or dies; she
  instructs her allies-using magic if necessary-to honor any surrender.
Morale: >-
  Though Velka knows when a fight is lost, so long as Thanock lives, she cannot
  bring herself to surrender-even if it might save her life or the lives of her
  kin. However, if the PCs kill Thanock and Dorok, Velka surrenders and commands
  any surviving Red Winter tribe members to stand down.
