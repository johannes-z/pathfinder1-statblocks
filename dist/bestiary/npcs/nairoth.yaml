SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Cower in fear for 1 round, 30 feet, Will DC 25 negates. This is a
      mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Swift Sundering (Su)
    description: Nairoth can make a sunder attempt as a swift action with one of its claws.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nairoth casts deeper darkness at the start of combat from within the cyclone
  of fire, followed by quickened unholy blight. It then casts haste and emerges
  from the cyclone, targets groups of enemies with cone of cold and individual
  spellcasters that prove to be able to penetrate its spell resistance with
  finger of death on subsequent rounds. If reduced to 120 of fewer hit points,
  Nairoth uses its summon ability to call 4 greater shadows.
