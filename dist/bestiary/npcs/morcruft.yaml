DuringCombat: >-
  Morcruft giggles and capers as he attacks, preferring to lash out at unarmored
  foes since he dislikes chipping teeth and claws on metal armor.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 40 hp, Morcruft shrieks and flees, seeking somewhere
  to hide. If flight isn't an option, he begs for mercy.
