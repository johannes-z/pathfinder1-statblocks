BeforeCombat: >-
  Each morning, Obsik implants himself with the following mesmerist tricks:
  astounding avoidance, free in body, misdirection, psychosomatic surge, and
  spell anticipation tied to an insanity spell. If he expects trouble, he drinks
  his potion of barkskin and casts mirror image and freedom of movement on
  himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Obsik begins a fight by blanketing the area around himself with mind fog to
  make his enemies more vulnerable to his spells, then casts mass hold person.
  He attacks anyone frozen by his spell with his assassin's dagger and painful
  stare, hoping his opponents will be too distracted healing a friend to chase
  him. Afterward, he relies on confusion and cause fear. He reserves his
  5th-level spells to cast foe to friend to deflect attacks.
Morale: >-
  If reduced below 15 hit points, Obsik attempts to use dimension door to flee,
  leaving the sardonyx shard behind. If that fails, he falls to his knees and
  begs for mercy.
