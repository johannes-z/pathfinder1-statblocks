Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  From his vantage point at the top of the summoning pinnacle, Achistem monitors
  the PCs' progress through the ruins. As they approach his perch, he enlarges
  himself with his change size ability and takes flight into the cloud cover
  above.
DuringCombat: >-
  Achistem begins combat with blasphemy or unholy blight to weaken his
  opponents, then varies flyby attacks with ranged full attacks. He prefers to
  stay out of reach of his foes, making them fly out to him for full melee
  combat. If faced with a good cleric or paladin, he uses his smite good ability
  and focuses his attacks on that individual.
Morale: >-
  Achistem is insane and believes himself indestructible regardless of the
  evidence to the contrary. As a result, he fights to the death.
