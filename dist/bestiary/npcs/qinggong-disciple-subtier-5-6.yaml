      In addition to the ki powers normally available to a monk, a qinggong monk
      may access additional abilities by expending ki. In this case, the monk
      can cast barkskin, gaseous form, and scorching ray as spell-like abilities
      (caster level 10th).

  before entering combat.

  ki power to blast foes at range and deflecting missile attacks with her
  Deflect Arrows feat. If forced into melee, she uses Stunning Fist to

  uses gaseous form as a last resort to flee from melee and drink her potion of
  cure moderate wounds.

  point she turns gaseous and wafts away in a cloud of vapor.
