SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Stitched Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      Rasputin's soul is stitched to his body with threads of fate, and he
      clings tenaciously to life. He gains Diehard as a bonus feat. In addition,
      when first reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater
      than his current Con score, Rasputin dies, but he springs back to life 1d4
      rounds later as if the target of a resurrection spell. If killed a second
      time, the Mad Monk again comes back to life 1d6 rounds later, as if the
      target of a raise dead spell (upon his return, he loses 50% of his
      remaining unused spell slots as if they had been used to cast spells).
      Only after Rasputin is slain for a third time do his soul's stitches
      finally unravel from his corpse, releasing his malignant spirit into the
      ether.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Within the Thrice-Tenth presbytery (area H6), Rasputin enjoys the benefits of
  the World Engine's unholy aura and insight bonus to his AC. When faced with
  combat, Rasputin activates his ectoplasmic armor revelation and casts entropic
  shield, freedom of movement, levitate, moment of prescience, and true seeing.
  Once enemies are in sight, he casts antilife shell and spectral hand to enable
  him to use touch attacks beyond the field's perimeter.
DuringCombat: >-
  Under the protection of his antilife shell, Rasputin attempts to hinder
  opponents with reverse gravity and waves of ecstasy and turn foes against each
  other with terrible remorse and murderous command, before laying waste with
  such deadly effects as blade barrier, blasphemy, destruction, harm,
  stormbolts, and unholy blight. If wounded, Rasputin casts quickened cure
  spells while continuing to target enemies with offensive spells.
Morale: >-
  On the precipice of claiming his mother's mythic power, Rasputin relies on his
  stitched soul to preserve his life, and fights to the death again and again
  until slain permanently.
Gear: >-
  mwk dagger, mwk Nagant M1895 revolver (see page 65) with 21 metal cartridges,
  amulet of natural armor +4, belt of physical perfection +2, cassock of the
