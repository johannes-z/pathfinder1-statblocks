SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Android Traits (Ex)
    description: >-
      See the stats for the deformed android on page 17 for details on Seerath's
      constructed, emotionless, and nanite surge abilities (she gains a +12
      bonus when using nanite surge, and prefers to use this ability when making
      a death attack).
  - name: Mutated Limbs (Ex)
    description: >-
      Seerath's flawed creation has shattered her mind but given her
      disconcertingly gangly limbs that allow her to avoid danger with an
      unsettling grace. She gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC as a result.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Seerath attempts to enter a combat undetected, remaining hidden so she can
  study a foe (preferably while they fight the androids in area A3) for 3 rounds
  so she can attempt a death attack. She uses Deadly Aim when she attacks with
  her pistol, firing on semi-automatic mode to gain an additional attack when
  she makes a full attack. If on her own, she tries a fighting retreat to area
  A6 to recruit the other androids there so she has more allies to flank foes
  with, or perhaps to area A8 to desperately open the damaged valve to release
  the monstrosity trapped within. Seerath prefers to save her only point of grit
  to use her reliable deed to prevent her timeworn zero pistol from glitching.
Morale: >-
  As soon as it becomes obvious that she is going to be defeated, Seerath cries
  out (in Androffan), "You won't take my mind! The Dominion can't have my mind!"
  before she triggers one of her concussion grenades to destroy her body in an
  attempt to prevent the PCs from harvesting her body for experiments. This
  should foreshadow the Dominion presence in the next adventure&#8211;if the
  player characters make the connection between her final words and the Dominion
  of the Black, excellent. If not, a character can make this connection, at your
  discretion, with a successful DC 30 Knowledge (arcana or geography) check.
