    description: >-
      Once per round as a standard action, a fungus man can release a cloud of
      noxious spores. All living creatures within 5 ft. must make a DC 16
      Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. This is a poison effect, and once a creature
      successfully saves it is immune to the spore cloud of that particular
      fungus man for 24 hours.
