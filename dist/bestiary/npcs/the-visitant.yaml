SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Deceptive (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mi-go is a master of deception, and gains a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and
      Disguise checks. Bluff and Disguise are always class skills for mi-go.
  - name: Evisceration (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mi-go's claws are capable of swiftly and painfully performing surgical
      operations upon helpless creatures or creatures it has grappled. When a
      mi-go succeeds at a grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused
      by a successful check), it deals its sneak attack damage to the victim. A
      creature that takes this damage must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or
      take an additional 1d4 points of ability damage from the invasive surgery
      (the type of ability damage dealt is chosen by the mi-go at the time the
      evisceration occurs). The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Item Creation (Ex)
    description: >-
      All mi-go possess the ability to create strange items that blur the line
      between magic and technology, given time and resources. But this mi-go
      doesn't have time to take advantage of this ability during this adventure.
  - name: Starflight (Su)
    description: >-
      A mi-go can survive in the void of outer space, and flies through space at
      an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a
      single solar system normally takes 3d20 months, while a trip beyond should
      take 3d20 years (or more, at the GM's discretion)-provided the mi-go knows
      the way to its destination.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Visitant starts combat by using its wand of invisibility (via Use Magic
  Device). It then proceeds to use its summon monster scrolls. Once it has
  summoned several allies, it casts protection from law and moves to a flanking
  position&#8211;PCs with healing capacities are its preferred targets.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, the Visitant attempts to flee, making
  for area C14 so it can escape into the woods to the north. If it manages to do
  so, it can become a harrowing recurring villain.
Gear: >-
  scroll of summon monster III, scroll of summon monster IV, wand of charm
  monster (10 charges), wand of invisibility (15 charges), wand of sound burst
  (15 charges)
