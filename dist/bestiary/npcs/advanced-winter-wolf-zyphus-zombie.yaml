    description: >-
      Zombies have poor reflexes and can only perform a single move action or
      standard action each round. A zombie can move up to its speed and attack
      in the same round as a charge action.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The zombie stands in the northeast hallway of the crypt. Once he hears the
  PCs, he moves down the 10-foot-wide hallway toward A2, but stops at the pit
  (T3). Having already stepped into the pit once, he knows not to try to cross
  it.
DuringCombat: >-
  Should the PCs spot the zombie and ignore him, he wanders north and comes at
  the PCs from another angle (he will not cross T3). He attacks the first PC he
  sees and mindlessly bludgeons her until she's unconscious before shifting to
  the next nearest PC.
Morale: The zombie fights until destroyed.
