SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Pawn of Unity (Ex)
    description: >-
      When Ozmyn Zaidow became Unity's pawn, the AI performed invasive and
      experimental surgical procedures on the man that increased his
      Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores by 6 each. Unity also supplied
      Ozmyn with gear far beyond what one might expect him to possess. Unity can
      observe the world through Ozmyn's senses, and can communicate with him
      telepathically and issue orders at will as if via a demand spell-Ozmyn
      cannot save against this effect. A successful DC 20 Sense Motive check is
      enough to let an observer know that Ozmyn is being controlled by an
      external force, but this control can't be disrupted as long as Unity
      survives. In any event, Ozmyn is a willing pawn of the AI. The benefits
      granted by this special ability increase Ozmyn's CR by 1.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: Ozmyn casts shield before entering combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ozmyn's first act in combat is to cast greater invisibility. He then attacks
  with his arc cannon, using automatic fire to attack in a line or a blast,
  depending on the enemy's positioning. Before he attacks in melee, Ozmyn casts
  haste. On each round while in melee, Ozmyn activates his null blade to enhance
  it to a +2 weapon as a swift action; if he's being hit often in combat,
  though, he instead activates his spell shield each round to gain a +6 shield
  bonus to his AC. Neither of these enhancements is included  in the stats
  above. When he makes a full attack with his null blade, Ozmyn takes a &#8211;2
  penalty with his weapon to use spell combat to also cast spells in combat. If
  reduced to 90 hit points or fewer, Ozmyn casts dimension door to escape to a
  nearby room, then uses his nanite gun to heal before returning to battle.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 30 or fewer hit points, Ozmyn casts teleport to flee the battle.
  He teleports to Silver Mount, then retreats into the structure to dig in and
  prepare to defend it against the PCs, effectively abandoning his position as
  leader of the Technic League. In this event, the PCs will face Ozmyn again in
  "The Divinity Drive"&#8211;see that adventure for further details.
