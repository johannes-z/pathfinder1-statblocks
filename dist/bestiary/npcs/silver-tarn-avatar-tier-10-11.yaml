BeforeCombat: Before breaking the water's surface, the avatar casts unholy aura on itself.
DuringCombat: >-
  The avatar begins combat by casting horrid wilting, followed by blasphemy,
  then focuses on melee combat. If any PC throws or drops a blessed ingot into
  the lake, she uses her daily smite good ability, and focuses all attacks on
  that target. Thanks to her Bull Rush Strike feat, she knocks opponents back
  (and ideally into the water) whenever she confirms a critical hit. When
  reduced below half her normal hit points, she dives underwater and uses her
  vortex ability to toss about any opponents in the water or on the lake's
  surface. If all her opponents are flying, she simply continues her physical
  assault.
Morale: The Silver Tarn avatar fights until destroyed.
