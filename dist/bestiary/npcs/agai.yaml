DuringCombat: >-
  Agai fights from L36 until the blockhouse is breached. Once the enemy gets
  into the blockhouse, he leads his kin from L35 and L36 up to the roof at L37.
  There, he uses the barrel of oil to light the roof of the building on fire
  while they scramble down the building into the courtyard below. Once there, he
  assumes Large form and prepares to attack anyone who flees the burning wooden
  blockhouse.
Morale: >-
  If all of his kin are slain and he is reduced to fewer than 15 hit points,
  Agai flees into the mountains, though he may stalk the PCs to ambush them
  later.
