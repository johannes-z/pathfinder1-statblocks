SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      A baobhan sith can suck blood from a grappled or helpless opponent; if she
      establishes or maintains a pin, she deals bite damage and drains blood,
      dealing 1d4 points of Strength damage and 1d4 points of Constitution
      damage each round.
  - name: Captivating Dance (Su)
    description: >-
      When a baobhan sith dances, all living creatures within 30 feet that view
      the rhythmic swaying and movements of her body must succeed on a DC 19
      Will save or become utterly enthralled and captivated. Creatures that are
      sexually attracted to females who view this dance suffer a -2 penalty on
      their saving throw. A creature that makes its save cannot be affected
      again by the same baobhan sith's captivating dance for one day. A
      captivated creature is dazed (it cannot attack, but can defend normally).
      This continues for as long as the baobhan sith dances. A baobhan sith can
      move and act normally (including using her spell-like abilities) while
      maintaining her dance. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Dying Words (Sp)
    description: >-
      When a baobhan sith is slain, she utters a curse as a free action (whether
      it's her turn or not) that affects her killer as if it were a bestow curse
      spell (caster level 10th). The target can resist the curse with a
      successful DC 19 Will save. If the save fails, the target suffers a
      &#8211;6 decrease to its highest ability score. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  The Dancing Lady begins combat with her captivating dance, hoping to entrance
  all of her attackers. She follows this with entangle to ensnare anyone
  resisting her dance. Once she has captivated at least one victim (preferable a
  male elf or human), she grapples and drains his blood. If necessary, she casts
  suggestion to convince an opponent to defend her or force an attacker to leave
  combat. If forced into melee combat, she focuses her attacks on female
  opponents, attempting to tear them limb from limb with teeth and claws.
Morale: The Dancing Lady fights to the death.
