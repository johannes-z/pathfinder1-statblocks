SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mimic Object (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mimic can assume the general shape of any Medium object, such as a
      massive chest, a stout bed, or a door. The creature cannot substantially
      alter its size, though. A mimic's body is hard and has a rough texture, no
      matter what appearance it might present. A mimic gains a +20 racial bonus
      on Disguise checks when imitating an object in this manner. Disguise is
      always a class skill for a mimic.
