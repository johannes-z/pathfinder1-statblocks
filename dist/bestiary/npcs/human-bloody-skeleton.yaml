    description: >-
      A bloody skeleton is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points, but it
      returns to unlife 1 hour later at 1 hit point, allowing its fast healing
      to thereafter resume healing it. A bloody skeleton can be permanently
      destroyed if it is destroyed by positive energy, if it is reduced to 0 hit
      points in the area of a bless or hallow spell, or if its remains are
      sprinkled with a vial of holy water.
