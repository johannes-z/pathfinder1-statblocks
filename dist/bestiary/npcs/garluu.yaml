DuringCombat: >-
  Garluu only resorts to his crossbow against foes he can't reach in combat, as
  he much prefers to use his falchion. He also prefers to fight in swampy land
  where his ability to move through the difficult terrain gives him an
  advantage.
Morale: >-
  Garluu fights until reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, at which he drops his
  weapon and begs for mercy in a cowardly fashion&#8211;he'll even agree to an
  alliance with the PCs if they spare his life.
