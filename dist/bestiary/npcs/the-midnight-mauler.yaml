    description: >-
      Because of his advanced age, the Midnight Mauler no longer gains any
      benefit from several of his feats (denoted with an asterisk), reducing his
      challenge rating by 1.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: The Midnight Mauler keeps his back to a wall while conversing with the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Mauler prefers to tackle opponents one-on-one, and backs himself into
  corners or leaps onto rooftops to keep from being surrounded and overwhelmed.
  He prefers to use a full attack, but if forced to move to prevent flanking or
  to isolate a foe, he falls back on his Vital Strike feat.
Morale: The Midnight Mauler fights until slain or cured.
