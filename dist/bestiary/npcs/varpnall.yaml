SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Carrier (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although he is immune to the debilitating effects of disease, Varpnall can
      still carry infections and continues to do so regardless of magical
      healing.
  - name: Diseased (Ex)
    description: >-
      Varpnall is swimming in pestilence. His attacks, breath, and flesh all
      carry disease. Any time Varpnall strikes a foe with his bite or a
      tentacle, he exposes the victim to two diseases: filth fever and leprosy.
      The creature struck must make two DC 24 Fortitude saves, one against each
      disease, to resist infection. These diseases function similarly to those
      of the same name listed on page 557 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook.
      The save DCs for all of these diseases is Constitution-based.
  - name: Disease Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      Varpnall's diseased breath fills an invisible 30-foot-radius cloud around
      him. All breathing creatures in this area must make two DC 24 Fortitude
      saves to avoid contracting bubonic plague and mindfire.
  - name: Diseased Flesh (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature that uses a bite attack against Varpnall or consumes any of
      the otyugh's flesh is exposed to blinding sickness. A DC 24 Fortitude save
      negates the infection.
  - name: Quick Incubation (Su)
    description: >-
      Any diseases inflicted by Varpnall have no onset time-the first effects of
      the diseases manifest immediately.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Varpnall is quick to anger, but not quick to attack. If he has to move to
  attack a foe, he uses Vital Strike with his bite attack, then proceeds with
  standard full attacks on following rounds.
Morale: >-
  Varpnall surrenders if brought below 30 hp, waving his tentacles in fear and
  staggering back into a corner as he begs for mercy. He'll give up all of his
  treasure if necessary to purchase his life from the PCs.
