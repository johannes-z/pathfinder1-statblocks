SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Teleporting Burst (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Aaphia can teleport all creatures within 50 ft. of her to
      randomly determined locations. She can only affect creatures she is aware
      of and to which she has line of sight. A successful DC 19 Will save
      negates this effect. An affected creature is teleported into one of the
      sarcophagi in the Crypt of the Damned (Area 1A-10). A creature that
      succeeds on this save is immune to Aaphia's teleporting burst ability for
      24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: Arcane
Gear: >-
  Aaphia wears a magical amulet that allows its wearer to cast inflict serious
  wounds (3d8+15, CL 15th, 3/day) on its wearer as a swift action; she uses this
  heal damage to herself. The amulet also serves as her bonded object (see
  below). Further, the face of the amulet serves as the key to the vault door
  she guards.
