DuringCombat: >-
  Cultists prefer to fight together, focusing on the same target in an attempt
  to overwhelm their foes. They always enter combat with a sickle that's been
  treated with a dose of blue whinnis, and given the chance, they reapply poison
  during combat as the opportunity arises. A cultist who accidentally poisons
  himself drinks antitoxin the next round.
Morale: >-
  Ravenmoor cultists fight to the death as long as they believe their leader,
  the mayor, still lives. If they know he has died, they flee combat as soon as
  they are wounded.
Gear: antitoxin, blue whinnis poison (2 doses)
OtherGear: broken sickle, mosquito mask, white robes, 4 gp
