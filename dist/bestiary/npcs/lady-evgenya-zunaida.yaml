SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mastermind (Su)
    description: >-
      Evgenya can have a number of enslaved spawn totaling four times her total
      Hit Dice. In addition, Evgenya has the telepathy ability, and can
      communicate telepathically with her spawn. Evgenya may exercise or end her
      use of this ability as a standard action and maintain her connection to
      her spawn for as long as she wishes. She may only use this ability with
      one spawn at a time. While using this ability, Evgenya enters a catatonic
      state similar to her daily rest and is treated as helpless, though she is
      alert to any jarring noises, the presence of any visible creature within 5
      feet, or any damage that befalls her body (Pathfinder Campaign Setting:
      Classic Horrors Revisited 50).
Gender: Female
Bloodline: Arcane
BeforeCombat: Evgenya casts extended false life and mage armor on herself every evening.
DuringCombat: >-
  Evgenya casts blink and tries to avoid direct combat while her spawn engage
  opponents. She targets foes with her spells and wands, and uses charm person,
  suggestion, or her dominate ability to gain further allies. If forced into
  melee combat, Evgenya casts twilight knife and uses it to flank while she
  makes slam attacks.
Morale: >-
  Evgenya flees most battles if reduced to fewer than 70 hit points, casting
  quickened dimension door with her metamagic adept power to escape.
Gear: wand of acid arrow (15 charges), wand of magic missile (CL 7th, 25 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  cloak of resistance +2, ring of protection +2, jewelry worth 300 gp, noble's
  outfit, signet ring
