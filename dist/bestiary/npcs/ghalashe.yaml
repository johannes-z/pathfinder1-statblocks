SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Slashing Tail (Su)
    description: >-
      Ghalashe doesn't have limbs where her claws Abyssal bloodline power could
      manifest. As a result, the scales on her tail are slightly raised and
      razor sharp. She gains a tail slap as a secondary natural attack that
      deals slashing damage. This ability otherwise functions as the claws
      Abyssal bloodline power. He uses his bladethirst ability to increase
      Seaspike's enhancement bonus by 1 and to make it ghost touch, so that he
      can wield it in battle. Morale Wavewalker fights until destroyed.

  (this has not been factored into her statistics).

  keep the PCs at bay while she blasts them with her damaging spells.
