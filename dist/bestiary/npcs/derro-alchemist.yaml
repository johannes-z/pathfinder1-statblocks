  move into the open room before using Ride-By Attack to charge them with their
  injection spears. The derros take turns keeping out of melee range so they can
  throw bombs or use extracts. If the PCs are having an easy time hitting them,
  the derros use barkskin or shield to increase their Armor Class.
