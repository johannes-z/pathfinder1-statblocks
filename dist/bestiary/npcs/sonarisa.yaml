Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Although Sonarisa's intellect is a shadow of what it once was, her religious
  habits die hard. Her daily prayers still include a casting of magic vestment,
  and as soon as she fears combat is nearing (as is the case if she notices an
  approaching light source or hears the traps in area C2 activate), she casts
  shield of faith on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  For the first few rounds of combat, Sonarisa casts summon monster spells to
  summon creatures to attack her foes in melee. She switches to her bow once the
  odds are evened, pausing to cast sanctuary if she's brought below 30 hit
  points so she can heal her wounds in peace.
Morale: >-
  Sonarisa fights to the death unless the PCs show her one of the planet spheres
  from the orrery of distant worlds, in which case she stops fighting and reacts
  as detailed under Development, below.
