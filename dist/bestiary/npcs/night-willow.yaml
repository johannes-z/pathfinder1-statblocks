SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Misery (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4+1 rounds as a free action, the night willow can emit a wave
      of negative energy that affects all living creatures within a 10-foot
      radius. Creatures within the area take 1d6 points of Charisma damage if
      they fail a DC 24 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Droning (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round as a standard action, the night willow can emit a droning
      sound audible to a range of 100 feet. Creatures within the area that hear
      it must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or enter a state of lethargy.
      Affected creatures cannot move (as if held by hold monster) and have no
      desire to take any other action or engage in combat (unless attacked
      first, in which case the lethargy effect is broken). The effects last for
      a number of rounds equal to 1/2 of the willow dusk's Hit Dice. When the
      night willow attacks a creature affected by this ability, the night willow
      gains a +4 bonus on its attack roll. A creature that succeeds at its Will
      save is unaffected by the droning from the night willow for 24 hours. This
      is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Fungal Spores (Ex)
    description: >-
      Poison-inhaled; save Fort DC 29; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
      1d2 Con damage and fatigued for 1 minute; cure 2 saves.
  - name: Poisonous Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      Fungal Blood or Flesh: Poison- ingested; save Fort DC 29; frequency
      1/minute for 6 minutes; effect 1 Str damage, 1 Dex damage, and nauseated
      for 1 minute; cure 2 saves.
DuringCombat: >-
  The night willow typically uses its reach to attempt to grapple an opponent
  and swallow that foe. When PCs get close enough for melee combat, the night
  willow uses its aura of misery, droning, and fungal spores abilities.
Morale: The night willow fights to the death.
