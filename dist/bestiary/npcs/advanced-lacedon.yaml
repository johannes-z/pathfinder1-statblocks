    description: >-
      Ghoul Fever-bite, save Fort DC 14, onset 1 day, frequency 1 day, effect
      1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex damage, cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the
      next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none of
      the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of any
      other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like
      a normal ghoul in all respects.
BeforeCombat: If the lacedons hear the PCs approach, they surround the entryway and wait.
DuringCombat: >-
  The lacedons swarm single opponents, changing to another single opponent when
  they've successfully paralyzed their current target.
Morale: The lacedons fight to the death.
