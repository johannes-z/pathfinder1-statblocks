SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hatred (Ex)
    description: >-
      A kithangian gains a +2 bonus on all attack rolls and damage rolls made
      against all creatures of the animal type. In addition, animals take a -2
      penalty on all saving throws against a kithangian's supernatural or
      spell-like abilities.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sting-injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4
      Str plus nauseated; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Rasping Tongues (Su)
    description: >-
      The faces between a kithangian's claws have long rasping tongues covered
      with tiny teeth. Whenever a kithangian successfully grapples a foe with
      its claws, a rasping tongue slithers out from the face within and burrows
      into the creature's body. Each round that the creature is grappled, it
      takes 1d6 points of damage and 1d4 points of Charisma damage as its sense
      of selfidentity is warped and twisted. A successful DC 18 Will saving
      throw negates the Charisma damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Swift Transformation (Su)
    description: A kithangian can use its change shape ability as a swift action.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The kithangian activates air walk then tries to lure the PCs toward the old
  house and into range of the abyssal geysers.
DuringCombat: >-
  The kithangian commands the fiendish animals to charge the PCs-an act that
  likely triggers one or more of the hazards. It then uses its mobility to
  engage one or more PCs in melee, changing into its true form during its turn.
  It uses its melee attacks and spell-like abilities to sow confusion and slay
  its foes, though it endeavors to keep one animal companion or mount alive. It
  does not hesitate to step on a geyser, trusting its resistances to absorb the
  punishment.
Morale: The kithangian fights to the death.
