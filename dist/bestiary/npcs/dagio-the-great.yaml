BeforeCombat: Prior to combat, Dagio casts invisibility and shield on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Dagio prefers to fight at range, using his climb speed to cling to walls while
  unleashing acid arrow and magic missile. Once those spells are depleted, Dagio
  uses his arcane-bonded ring to fire a second acid arrow. If injured, Dagio
  abandons the walls and rushes into combat, using his "regal rod" (his wand of
  shocking grasp) to strike down foes with blasts of electricity. He babbles
  about "circles within circles" and the "immaculate circumference" as he
  battles.
Morale: >-
  Dagio refuses to acknowledge that the commoners who have intruded on his
  domain are superior. He fights to the death.
