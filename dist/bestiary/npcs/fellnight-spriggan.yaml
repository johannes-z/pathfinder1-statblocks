SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Prickle Whip (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a Fellnight spriggan can unravel and detach from its body a
      whip-like strand of thorny bramble, as if it were drawing a weapon. This
      weapon counts as a whip of the spriggan's size, except it deals normal
      (not nonlethal) damage and is effective against creatures with armor or
      natural armor. The spriggan is proficient with this whip. The whip becomes
      brittle and useless after 1 hour.
  - name: Size Alteration (Su)
    description: >-
      A spriggan can change its size from Small to Large or back again as a
      standard action, similar to using enlarge person except increasing or
      decreasing two size categories instead of one (doubling the modifiers to
      Strength, Dexterity, attack rolls, and AC).
  - name: Spriggan Magic (Su)
    description: Spriggans have a +1 racial bonus to their spriggan spell-like ability DCs.
  - name: Thorn Dart (Ex)
    description: >-
      Eight times per day, a Fellnight spriggan can pull a long thorn from its
      body, as if it were drawing ammunition. This thorn functions as a dart of
      the spriggan's size. The spriggan is proficient with this dart.
  - name: Thorn Walk (Sp)
    description: >-
      This ability works like tree stride, except the Fellnight spriggan can
      only travel through thorny trees or pass harmlessly through a wall of
      thorns (or similar thornrelated effect) without harm. The spriggan can use
      this ability once per day.
  - name: Thorny Grasp (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Fellnight spriggan's thorny body deals 1d4 piercing damage (1d8 for a
      Large spriggan) to a grappled opponent on a successful grapple check. A
      creature that grapples, pins, constricts, or swallows the spriggan takes
      this damage automatically on its turn.
  - name: Woodland Stride (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Fellnight spriggan can use woodland stride like a druid, except it can
      also freely pass through areas affected by its own entangle spell-like
      ability.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  The spriggans use woodland stride and their thorn walk ability to pass through
  the hedges and Tenzekil's wall of thorns unimpeded. They also use size
  alteration to grow to Large size.
DuringCombat: >-
  At Tenzekil's command, all three spriggans attack Elyin and the Foresthawks
  with their greenblood oil before attacking the PCs. They start with a volley
  of thorn darts and then grapple or wield prickle whips to snag townsfolk and
  drag them through the wall of thorns.
Morale: The spriggans fight to the death.
