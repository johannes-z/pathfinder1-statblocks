DuringCombat: >-
  The Smilers fire their guns on the first round, focusing their fire on
  flat-footed PCs within 30 feet so they can deal sneak attack damage. They then
  move in to attack with their daggers, flanking foes if they have a numerical
  advantage. If they're evenly matched or outnumbered, the Smilers retreat to
  the fort's walls if they can and try to draw the battle out at range. A Smiler
  takes her dose of soothe once she's wounded by a PC.
Morale: >-
  The Smilers fight to the death until two of them are killed, at which point
  any surviving Smilers attempt to flee if reduced to 10 or fewer hit points. As
  soon as only one Smiler remains standing, the last one surrenders.
