BeforeCombat: >-
  Ironbriar prepares for combat by casting bear's endurance, cat's grace, shield
  of faith, and invisibility.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ironbriar prefers to let his cultists fight in melee, himself hanging back to
  use his spells and channel energy at range. Once he's cast his ranged spells,
  he moves in to flank foes with his magic sword. If fighting on his own, he
  tries to time things so that he casts summon monster III to bring in
  additional allies with which to flank foes&#8211;he prefers to summon 1d3
  lemures with this spell so as to gain more allies with which to flank than a
  single tougher ally. Ironbriar also prefers to fight in larger areas where he
  can take advantage of movement, and as such attempts to escape into area D6 to
  fight as soon as he can.
Morale: >-
  As long as he remains under the effect of Xanesha's charm monster spell,
  Ironbriar fights to the death. If the charm effect ends, he suddenly realizes
  how the lamia matriarch has been using him and immediately offers the PCs a
  deal, as detailed under Development. If the PCs refuse to deal with Ironbriar,
  he does his best to escape into the city&#8211;he abandons his life here and
  attempts to flee back to the city of Vyre to start a new life.
Gear: wand of cure moderate wounds (12 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  mithral chain shirt, +1 buckler, +1 short sword, masterwork hand crossbow with
  10 poisoned bolts (drow poison), reaper's mask, key to area D7
