SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by a thrown object must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or
      flee in terror for 2d6 rounds. A creature that successfully saves is
      immune to the fear effect of the same poltergeist for the remainder of the
      encounter. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Telekinesis (Su)
    description: >-
      A poltergeist can create a telekinetic effect to hurl one object or
      creature within 10 feet a distance of 60 feet (no range increment). This
      ability functions as the telekinesis spell (caster level 6th) with the
      following exceptions: the poltergeist does not have to concentrate to use
      or maintain this ability, the poltergeist can hurl only one object or
      creature per round, and the poltergeist uses its Charisma modifier to
      modify its base attack bonus. A creature targeted by this ability can make
      a DC 12 Will save to avoid being hurled by the poltergeist. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Natural Invisibility (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability is constant, allowing a poltergeist to remain invisible even
      when attacking. This ability is inherent, cannot be dispelled or negated,
      and is not subject to the invisibility purge spell.
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Both wild and domesticated animals can sense the unnatural presence of a
      poltergeist at a distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach
      nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as
      long as they are within that range.
DuringCombat: >-
  The poltergeist spends most of the combat flying above the bridge throwing
  25-pound rocks at the PCs (1d6 damage). Once all or most of all of the PCs are
  on the bridge, he swoops down and triggers the bridge's collapse, sending the
  PCs tumbling into the pit (see bridge collapse trap below). Any PCs not in the
  pit are then targeted with telekinesis (combat maneuver) as the poltergeist
  attempts to push them in. Once all of the PCs are in the pit, he resumes
  throwing rocks at them. To mitigate the difficulty of this encounter, the
  poltergeist's only accessible rocks heavy enough to do damage to the PCs are
  in a single pile near the three corpses in the pit. The poltergeist has to
  swoop down to pick one up and the PCs should get a DC 11 Perception check to
  spot him picking up a rock.
Morale: The poltergeist fights until destroyed.
