BeforeCombat: >-
  The Grandmother drinks a potion of barkskin and potion of darkvision, then
  applies deathblade poison to her gladius and secures it with her cestus of
  security.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Grandmother uses as much time as she can to cast spells on herself,
  including bear's endurance, cat's grace, divine favor, and shield of faith.
  She then studies her mark and applies the vicious weapon special ability to
  her gladius using her sacred weapon ability. When she has taken enough damage
  to merit it, either from her enemy or her vicious weapon, she uses fervor to
  cast cure light wounds on herself as a swift action each round. If her primary
  weapon is embedded due to Impaling Critical, she draws her masterwork gladius
  to continue attacking.
