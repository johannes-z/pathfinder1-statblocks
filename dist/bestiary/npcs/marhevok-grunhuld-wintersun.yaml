DuringCombat: >-
  Marhevok roars for Beverach, his pet frost drake, to join him in the battle
  and rages as soon as a fight begins. He fights with his bare hands and the
  horns that grow from his brow, focusing on the strongest-looking foes first.
  If reduced to fewer than 90 hit points, he calls out for any Wintersun
  barbarians in adjoining rooms to help him fight.
Morale: Marhevok fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  amulet of natural armor +1, bracers of armor +3, decanter of endless water,
  ring of protection +1, unholy symbol of Baphomet with an inscription in
  Abyssal that reads "Jerribeth"
