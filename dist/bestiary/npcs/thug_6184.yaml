BeforeCombat: The thugs apply poison to two of their crossbow bolts.
DuringCombat: >-
  The thugs start combat by firing their poisoned crossbow bolts at the
  least-armored characters in the group, hoping to take down one or two
  characters. If attacked in melee, they drop their crossbows and use their
  clubs instead.
Morale: >-
  The thugs are not interested in a protracted fight. As soon as they feel
  they've made their point or it's become obvious that the tide has turned, they
  shout a final warning and flee.
Gear: medium spider poison (2 doses)
OtherGear: studded leather, club, light crossbow with 20 bolts
