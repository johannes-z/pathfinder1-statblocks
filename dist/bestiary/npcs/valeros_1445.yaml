  Born a farmer's son in the quiet Andoren countryside, Valeros spent his youth
  dreaming of adventure and exploring the world. For the past several years,
  he's been a mercenary with the Band of the Mauler, a guard for the Aspis
  Consortium, a freelance bounty hunter, and hired muscle for a dozen different
  employers. Gone is his youthful naivete, replaced by scars and the resolve of
  a veteran warrior. While noble at heart, Valeros hides this beneath a jaded,
  sometimes crass demeanor, often claiming that there's no better way to end a
  day's adventuring than with “an evening of hard drinking and a night of soft
  company.”
