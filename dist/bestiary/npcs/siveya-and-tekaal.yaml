  If they are on alert, the two sylphs cast barkskin, call lightning, owl's
  wisdom, and shillelagh, and they activate their skymaster ability.
DuringCombat: >-
  The sylphs cast obscuring mist, which their Cloud Gazer feat lets them see
  through. Each sylph casts summon nature's ally III to summon 1d3 small air
  elementals to harass the PCs (see page 27). The sylphs assist from behind
  cloud cover using call lightning (the bolts deal 3d10 points of damage in this
  room) or wind blasts to bull rush PCs into the hurricane. If they are out of
  other options or Grasping Storm commands it, they fly to attack using their
  clubs.
