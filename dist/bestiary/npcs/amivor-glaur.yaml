      Amivor gains a +1 bonus on Disable Device and Perception checks. He can
      disable intricate and complex traps in half the normal amount of time
      (minimum 1 round) and open a lock as a standard action instead of a
      full-round action. He can always take 10 on Disable Device and Stealth
      checks, even if distracted or endangered.
  - name: Surefooted (Ex)
    description: >-
      Amivor can move through nonmagical difficult terrain (such as hills,
      mountains, rubble, ruins, and similar terrain) at his normal speed.
  - name: Thrilling Escape (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Amivor can attempt to delay a trap immediately after
      triggering it by making a Disable Device check as an immediate action
      against the trap's Disable Device DC; if he's successful, the trap's
      activation is delayed until the end of his next turn. He can attempt this
      check even if the trap was triggered by a failed Disable Device check, or
      if it is not his turn.
