  is unable to resist launching himself at the nearest opponent. After a bite or
  two of flesh, however, he comes to his senses and fights more prudently,
  throwing poisoned needles from his robe of needles; using his extracts of fire
  breath, vomit swarm, and true strike; and attempting to make sneak attacks.
