DuringCombat: >-
  The legionnaires employ their bows and scimitars to strike down perceived
  criminals, preferring divine spellcasters and favored enemies as targets and
  using their hateful strike ability. After the first few rounds of combat, they
  begin dealing nonlethal damage so long as they appear to have a clear
  advantage; against powerful enemies, the legionnaires deal lethal damage. They
  try to take at least one prisoner for questioning later.
