Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Trinia prefers to avoid combat if possible, particularly if she's on her own.
  If she acts first in a fight, she casts cat's grace and flees, using minor
  image to misdirect pursuers. When fighting alongside friends, she uses her
  abilities to bolster her allies, using her bardic performance to inspire
  courage on the first round and then casting cat's grace on allies or healing
  their wounds as the battle progresses. She relies on hideous laughter against
  enemy spellcasters, and is always ready to cast saving finale whenever a
  nearby ally fails a critical saving throw.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, Trinia flees combat, but if she
  escapes, she puts all her resources into rescuing those she may have left
  behind. Only if she has built a strong relationship based on mutual respect or
  love with a companion does she remain at an ally's side and fight to the
  death.
