SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Abandon Flesh (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a vermlek can abandon an inhabited body. In so doing,
      it absorbs much of the body's flesh to heal itself, restoring 2d6+3 hit
      points.
  - name: Flesh Armor (Su)
    description: >-
      When a vermlek wears a humanoid body, it treats the dead flesh and muscle
      as armor and gains a +3 armor bonus to its AC.
  - name: Inhabit Body (Su)
    description: >-
      A vermlek can crawl into and control the body of a dead Medium humanoid.
      This process takes 1d4 rounds for the vermlek to complete, during which it
      is considered flat-footed. It loses its own burrow speed while inhabiting
      a body, but gains the ability to wield their scythes.
DuringCombat: >-
  The vermleks start by casting mass inflict light wounds on the PCs. They
  repeat this whenever one of them is reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, as
  the damage heals them. Otherwise, they move in to hack at foes with their
  scythes. A vermlek abandons its flesh as soon as it can after dropping below
  12 hit points-it can no longer attack with its scythe at this point and
  instead relies on its bite and spell-like abilities.
Morale: The vermleks fight to the death.
