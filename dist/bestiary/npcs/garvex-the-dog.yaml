  In combat, Garvex is little more than an animal, knocking foes to the ground
  and pummeling them with his fists. He uses his martial flexibility to gain the
  Combat Reflexes feat and lashes out when foes attempt to right themselves.

  unless Kadu is killed before him, in which case he fights to the death.

  loincloth
