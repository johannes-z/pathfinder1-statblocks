Source: Undead Unleashed
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bound by Betrayal (Su)
    description: >-
      Razinia cannot move farther than 600 feet from the center of the oasis
      where she committed her fatal betrayal; if she is taken beyond this range,
      she can take no actions except move actions in the direction of the oasis.
      As a side effect of the curse holding her to the oasis, she can take the
      form of a living janni that resembles her appearance in life in the same
      way she can change shape into a hyena. When in this form, she does not
      detect as undead, but she retains her hoofed feet as a reminder of her
      treachery, a physical feature she goes to extreme lengths to hide.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: elemental (water)
DuringCombat: >-
  Razinia maintains her hyena or janni form unless she absolutely must drop the
  ruse and expose herself to her enemies. She attempts to sunder held or worn
  magic items, especially those that could damage or expose her, but switches to
  attacking spellcasters directly if this tactic proves ineffectual.
Morale: >-
  If Razinia believes she is in imminent danger of being exposed or falls below
  20 hp, she drinks her potion of invisibility or casts darkness, then flees to
  her tent or the cave (area 7), using her dust of tracelessness to avoid
  leaving footprints since she cannot leave the oasis.
Gear: >-
  potions of inflict serious wounds (2), potion of invisibility, scroll of
  glitterdust, scroll of mage armor, scroll of sculpt corpse, scroll of summon
  swarm, wand of scorching ray (9 charges), wand of charm person (16 charges),
  tanglefoot bag
OtherGear: dagger, dust of tracelessness (2), elemental gem (air), stone of alarm, 23 gp
