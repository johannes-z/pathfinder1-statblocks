BeforeCombat: The coven casts mind blank on the green hag every morning.
DuringCombat: >-
  Orleva fights deliberately, becoming invisible and then moving around the
  battlefield until she can make a sneak attack on a lone foe. She repeats this
  process again and again, not worrying too much about making attacks every
  round or even every other round. Faced with foes who can see through her
  invisibility, she fights defensively and attempts to escape, preferring to
  face such dangerous enemies with her coven sisters.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 or fewer hit points, Orleva flees to her coven. If fighting
  along with her hag sisters, she fights to the death.
