SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Arcane Reinforcement (Ex)
    description: >-
      A wyrwood skulk is made from magically grown material that grants it
      several benefits. The wyrwood gains fast healing 5 and fire resistance 10.
      It can see through all types of fog and smoke, and it is treated as two
      size categories larger when determining bonus hit points based on its
      size.
  - name: Share Space (Ex)
    description: >-
      A wyrwood skulk is specifically designed to fight alongside other skulks.
      Two wyrwood skulks can share the same square without penalty. If two
      wyrwood skulks in the same square attack the same foe, they are considered
      to be flanking that foe. Wyrwood skulks in the same square are also
      considered adjacent to each other for the purpose of any abilities or
      effects.
DuringCombat: >-
  A wyrwood skulk does it best to share a space with a fellow skulk whenever
  possible to make use of its Outflank feat and opportunist talent. It uses a
  bead from its necklace of fireballs when foes are grouped together, even if it
  means catching other wyrwoods or even innocent citizens in the blast.
Morale: A wyrwood skulk fights until destroyed.
Gear: necklace of fireballs (type II)
OtherGear: >-
  +2 leather armor, +1 short swords (2), amulet of natural armor +1, belt of
  incredible dexterity +2, cloak of resistance +2, ring of protection +1
