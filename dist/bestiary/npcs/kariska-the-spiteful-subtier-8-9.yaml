SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Despair (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures within a 30-foot radius that see a mummy must succeed at a
      DC 19 Will save or be paralyzed by fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the
      save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same
      mummy's despair ability for 24 hours. This is a paralysis and
      mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Mummy Rot (Su)
    description: >-
      Curse and disease-slam; save Fort DC 19; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha; cure &#8211;. Mummy rot is both a curse and a
      disease and can only be cured if the curse is first removed, at which
      point the disease can be magically removed. Even after the curse element
      of mummy rot is lifted, a creature suffering from it cannot recover
      naturally over time. Anyone casing a conjuration (healing) spell on the
      afflicted creature must succeed at a DC 20 caster level check, or the
      spell is wasted and the healing has no effect. Anyone who dies from mummy
      rot turns to dust and cannot be raised without resurrection or greater
      magic. The save DC is Charisma-base.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite&#8211;Injury; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
      1d2 Str; cure 2 saves.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: Draconic (green)
DuringCombat: >-
  Kariska begins combat by using her mirror image spell-like ability. She then
  casts dominate person on an obvious spell caster, and uses ray of enfeeblement
  on the strongest looking combatants who are not paralyzed by her despair aura,
  before making other attacks.
Morale: The mummy fights until destroyed.
