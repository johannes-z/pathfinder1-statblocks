BeforeCombat: The thugs remain hidden, waiting for their boss to give the order to attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  The thugs open combat by hurling a throwing axe at the nearest target. Then
  they draw their battleaxes and leap into melee, always striving to pair up and
  flank targets. They save their second throwing axe for fleeing targets. If
  reduced to fewer than 11 hit points, they always use their next action to
  retrieve and drink a potion of cure light wounds.
Morale: >-
  The thugs fight so long as their boss is alive. Should their boss fall, they
  flee if reduced to fewer than 5 hit points.
Gear: potions of cure light wounds (2)
