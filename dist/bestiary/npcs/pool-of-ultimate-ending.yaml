SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Potent Paralysis (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature damaged by the ooze's slam attack must also succeed at a DC 34
      Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds. This paralysis effect can
      even affect those under the protection of freedom of movement, or who are
      normally immune to paralysis effects, although mythic creatures who have
      immunity to paralysis gain a +10 bonus on their saving throws to resist.
      When used to paralyze a creature normally immune to the effect, this is a
      supernatural ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The ooze, despite being unintelligent, can sense the difference between
  chaotic evil outsiders and other creatures. It does not attack chaotic evil
  outsiders, but furiously assaults all other intruders into this chamber with
  its immense acidic pseudopods as long as they remain within 60 feet of the
  acid surface below.
Morale: The vast ooze fights to the death.
