  The ifrit slayers use their studied target ability to study the same PC and
  then team up to eliminate that target quickly. If the PCs are hitting the
  ifrits easily, the slayers wish for obscuring mist from Shyvera and use Combat
  Expertise to increase their Armor Class.
Morale: The ifrit slayers fight to the death.
