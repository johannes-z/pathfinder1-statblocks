  Rayaldach prefers to fight with his nuclear resonator when he can, but
  switches to his implanted laser pistol or to melee as needed (usually just so
  long as it takes to get into position for another good shot with the
  resonator. He doesn't pursue foes from this room, but if the PCs enter and/or
  escape via the restrooms, the gargoyle uses the resonator on that room to
  collapse it, rendering that route to the bridge inaccessible from that point
  on.
Morale: Rayaldach fights to the death.
