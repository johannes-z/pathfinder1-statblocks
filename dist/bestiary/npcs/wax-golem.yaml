  - name: Conditional Sentience (Su)
    description: >-
      While some wax golems constructed to look like a humanoid gain sentience,
      genuinely believing themselves to be living creatures, Catalina's is still
      new enough that it has not yet become intelligent and willful. If allowed
      to persist, however, it would eventually attempt to live the life of a
      chandler's apprentice to the best of its ability.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A wax golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell
      resistance, with the exception of spells and spell-like abilities that
      have the fire descriptor. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. &#8226; A magical attack
      that deals fire damage slows a wax golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6
      rounds (no save). In addition, for 3 rounds after being dealt fire damage,
      every time a wax golem uses its slam attack, it deals an additional 1d4
      points of fire damage due to the molten wax. &#8226; A magical attack that
      deals cold damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of
      damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the
      amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit
      points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A wax golem gets no
      saving throw against cold effects.
