BeforeCombat: >-
  The druid hides with the other goblins, waiting for the full assault before
  she begins casting any spells.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat (or surprise round if the goblins get the jump on
  the PCs), the druid casts produce flame to sheath her hands in fire. She uses
  her fire bolt domain power each round until she has exhausted all daily uses,
  only fighting with her flaming hands if forced into melee. If she feels
  particularly threatened, she casts burning hands, targeting as many creatures
  as she can in the burst, even fellow goblins.

  The druid is fanatical, spurred into a frenzy by her own flames, and fighting
  to the death.
