BeforeCombat: >-
  M'deggog casts false life and mage armor every day. Once the Kaava Bush-Devil
  is slain, M'deggog prepares for combat by casting blur, shield, and see
  invisibility.
DuringCombat: >-
  When not inhabiting a body, M'deggog must cast all of its sorcerer spells
  using the Silent Spell metamagic feat. As a result, it cannot cast any of its
  5th-level spells when it is outside a vessel. Once out of the derhii's body,
  M'deggog uses invisibility to avoid attacks and move around the room casting
  spells. If forced into melee combat, M'deggog uses invisibility to make sneak
  attacks or casts inflict serious wounds using the extended reach of its long
  limbs.
Morale: >-
  Although a genius, M'deggog does not recognize its fallibility and fights to
  the death, confident that it will triumph in the end.
