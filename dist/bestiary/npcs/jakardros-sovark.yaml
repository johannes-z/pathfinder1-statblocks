Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Jakardros's strength lies in his archery. He trusts (and depends) on his
  allies and his animal companion Kibb to hold off foes in melee while he
  provides ranged support. Yet when his allies are in desperate need, he won't
  hesitate to lay down his bow and join them in melee.
Morale: >-
  Jakardros has little concern for his own safety, and is actively looking for a
  foe that can finish him off. He fights to the death as a result. Once he's
  reconciled with Shalelu, though, his outlook shifts dramatically; he devotes
  his life to protecting the elven ranger, doting on her as if she were his own
  daughter. He'll fight to the death to protect her, but otherwise breaks off
  combat and retreats if brought below 20 hit points so he can stay alive to
  defend Shalelu in the future.
