SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Curse of the Deep (Su)
    description: >-
      On a successful grapple check, a mummy of the deep presses its lips
      against an opponent's and regurgitates sea water into the opponent's
      lungs. Each round thereafter, for the next 10 rounds, the victim must
      succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be dazed and take 1d4 points of
      damage that round. Three consecutive successful saves means the victim has
      coughed up enough water to shake off the effects of the attack and takes
      no further damage. When a victim reaches 0 or fewer hit points, it falls
      unconscious. In the next round, it drowns. Holding one's breath does not
      prevent drowning (water is already in the lungs). A remove curse, heal
      spell, or DC 20 Heal check halts the damage if applied before the creature
      reaches 0 or fewer hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Despair (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures within a 30-foot radius that see a mummy of the deep must
      succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds.
      Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected
      again by that mummy of the deep's despair ability for 24 hours. This is a
      paralysis and mind-affecting fear attack. The save DC is Charisma-based.
