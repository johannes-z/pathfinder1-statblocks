BeforeCombat: >-
  If alerted to the PCs' presence by the trap in area D5, Lal Chawda drinks his
  feral mutagen and his protection from energy (acid) and bull's strength
  extracts. Just prior to combat, he drinks an extract of bomber's eye to
  increase his effectiveness in the ensuing battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  Lal Chawda begins combat by overturning the barrel of acid in the center of
  the room to place an obstacle between himself and his foes. He lobs explosive
  bombs at his enemies, switching to acid bombs if the Pathfinders have
  resistance or immunity to fire. He uses his longspear to keep approaching
  enemies at bay, only resorting to his natural attacks when forced to do so.
Morale: >-
  When reduced to half his full normal hit points, Lal Chawda drinks his extract
  of shield, followed by his extract of cure serious wounds. The alchemist is
  bestial in his mutated state and fights to the death.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, bloodroot poison (1 dose)
