DuringCombat: >-
  The roc charges the bulette, after which it focuses its attention on
  incapacitating its meal. If the PCs attack the roc, it tries to split its
  attacks, striking the bulette with one claw and using its other natural
  attacks against other assailants.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 42 hit points or fewer, the roc attempts to escape, carrying any
  grabbed creature with it&#8211;even the bulette. If reduced to 15 hit points
  or fewer, it abandons its prey entirely and tries to escape.
