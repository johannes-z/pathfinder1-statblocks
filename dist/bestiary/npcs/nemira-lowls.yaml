SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Eldritch Abilities (Ex)
    description: >-
      As part of the eldritch creature template, Nemira Lowls gains DR
      10/lawful, a +3 natural armor bonus, and the projection special ability,
      plus her reach for her tentacle attacks increases to 10 feet.
  - name: Projection (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a full-round action, Nemira can enter a trance that
      separates her spirit from her body. This splits her hit points in half
      between her body and her spirit. Nemira's spirit body gains the
      incorporeal subtype and special ability; otherwise, she retains the same
      statistics as her physical self with the following changes: AC 18, touch
      18, flat-footed 14 (+4 deflection, +2 Dex, +1 dodge), and a single
      incorporeal touch attack that deals 1d4 Charisma damage on a hit. Nemira's
      spirit projection can travel no more than 1 mile away from her body. When
      separated in this way, Nemira's body lies unconscious and helpless. If
      Nemira's body is injured while in this state, her separated projection
      immediately returns to her body. If her physical body is slain, her spirit
      body dies as well. If her spirit is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it
      returns to the physical body immediately. Nemira in her spirit body can
      end the effect at any time as a standard action, at which point her spirit
      immediately returns to her body. When her spirit returns to her body, add
      both the spirit body's hit points and the physical body's hit points back
      together to determine her current hit point total.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: aberrant
BeforeCombat: >-
  Nemira Lowls exists in a state of confusion and madness, hardly conscious of
  what is going on around her. If aware of her attackers, Nemira casts mage
  armor before engaging. If unaware, she casts the spell on the first round of
  combat. (This bonus has been calculated into her stat block.)
DuringCombat: >-
  Nemira attacks the PCs with magic missile and her acidic ray while trying to
  keep her distance. When the PCs get closer, Nemira casts shocking grasp and
  uses her long limbs ability to attack targets that are no more than 15 feet
  away. Nemira also moves each round she can in order to keep outside of the
  PCs' reach. If she is pressured by the PCs or needs additional reach,  she
  casts enlarge person on herself. When she does, the floorboards in the attic
  groan under her increased weight.
Morale: >-
  Nemira has little grasp on reality and knows that only death has a chance to
  end her condition.
