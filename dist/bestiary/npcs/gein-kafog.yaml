Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Gein casts magic vestment on his armor every morning, and casts air walk and
  death ward if possible before heading into dangerous territory.
DuringCombat: >-
  Gein's weapon is a +1 merciful spiked chain; as long as its merciful quality
  is active, the spikes retract into the metal&#8211;he would rather defeat a
  foe and leave him alive but humbled than dead. Against undead, he prefers to
  channel energy or cast healing magic. If he's traveling with the PCs, he hangs
  back and focuses on healing the characters, especially once he realizes how
  much more powerful they are than him&#8211;Gein has no issue playing sidekick
  to higher-level heroes.
Morale: >-
  Gein didn't used to fear death, but his experiences of late have changed his
  mind&#8211;he flees combat if reduced to fewer than 15 hit points (using
  deeper darkness to cover his retreat) rather than risk being taken prisoner
  after being rendered unconscious again.
Gear: breastplate, +1 merciful spiked chain
