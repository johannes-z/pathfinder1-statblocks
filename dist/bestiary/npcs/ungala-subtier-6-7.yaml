BeforeCombat: >-
  Ungala applies her black adder venom to one of her +1 shock arrows and then
  drinks her potion of blur and potion of cat's grace. She also casts jump and
  resist fire  on herself, though if the PCs have reached the moderate Awareness
  Point threshold, she instead casts resist energy to protect herself against an
  energy type used by the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ungala doesn't put herself in danger unnecessarily, generally letting her
  allies skirmish in melee while she rains arrows down on her enemies. She stays
  mobile and uses her potion of invisibility and jump in order to evade melee
  threats.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 14 or fewer hit points, hopelessly overwhelmed, or left with no
  allies, Ungala surrenders and tries to parley with the PCs. If the PCs refuse
  to talk, she tries to flee.
