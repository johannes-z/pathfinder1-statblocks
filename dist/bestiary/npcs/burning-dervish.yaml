SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Elemental Endurance (Ex)
    description: >-
      Burning dervishes can survive on the Elemental Planes of Air or Earth for
      up to 48 hours and on the Elemental Plane of Water for up to 12 hours.
      Failure to return to the Elemental Plane of Fire after that time deals 1
      point of damage per hour to a burning dervish until it dies or returns to
      the Elemental Plane of Fire. It is able to survive on other planes
      normally.
  - name: Flame Form (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, as a standard action, a burning dervish can change
      its form to that of a column of fire. In this form it gains two slam
      attacks. The transformation lasts indefinitely; reverting to its humanoid
      form requires another standard action.
