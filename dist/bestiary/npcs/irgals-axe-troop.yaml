    description: >-
      Irgal's Axe troops are made up of scrappy and experienced fighters who can
      recognize when they're about to become the target of an area-of-effect
      ability and react accordingly. If the troop succeeds at a Reflex saving
      throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful
      save, the troop instead takes no damage.

    description: >-
      See the Nirmathi skirmishers troop stat block on page 62. The bonus on
      damage rolls also applies to the Irgal's Axe troop's volley attack.
  - name: Volley (Ex)
    description: >-
      An Irgal's Axe troop can fire a volley of arrows as a standard action.
      This attack takes the form of up to four lines with a range of 100 feet.
      These lines can each start from the corner of any square in the troop's
      space. Each creature in any of these lines takes 4d6 points of piercing
      damage per line that hits it (Reflex DC 21 half). The save DC is
      Dexterity-based.
