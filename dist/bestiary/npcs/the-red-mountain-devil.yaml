    description: >-
      A chupacabra can suck blood from a living victim it has grappled by
      successfully pinning the foe. If it does so, it drains blood, causing 1
      point of Constitution damage each round the pin is maintained. Upon
      draining blood, a chupacabra becomes invigorated, as if under the effects
      of a haste spell. This effect lasts for 10 rounds after the chupacabra
      ceases drinking blood.
DuringCombat: >-
  The chupacabra enjoys tormenting and scaring its prey, but once battle begins,
  it abandons subtlety. It charges the smallest target, attempting to pounce and
  then pin its foe so it can chupar (although if it's surrounded by foes, it
  certainly won't use this tactic). The creature is quite agile, and against
  larger numbers of foes it uses Flyby Attack and Acrobatics to swoop in,
  attack, and deny attacks of opportunity. If it can, it tries to lure victims
  away from allies so it can pounce and feed.
Morale: >-
  The chupacabra fights until it is reduced to 25 hit points or fewer before
  retreating to its nest. Cornered there, the beast fights to the death.
