SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Witchflame (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature damaged by the incorporeal touch or ranged bolt attacks of a
      witchfire must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or become engulfed in sickly
      green flames. While these eerie flames deal no additional damage, the
      affected creature glows as per faerie fire and becomes sickened. While
      under the effects of the witchflame, the victim gains vulnerability to
      fire and takes half again as much damage (+50%) from fire attacks of any
      sort. This effect persists for 10 minutes. The supernatural flames can
      only be extinguished before this duration expires by a break enchantment,
      miracle, remove curse, or wish spell-the effective caster level of the
      witchflame is equal to the witchfire's HD (CL 10th for most witchfires).
      Any creature entering the same square as a witchfire or striking it with a
      melee attack must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or begin burning with
      witchflame, even if the attack would not otherwise harm the witchfire
      because of its incorporeal nature. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
