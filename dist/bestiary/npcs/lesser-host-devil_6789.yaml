SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Noxious Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a gaav can exhale a breath that reeks of pure
      corruption upon a creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed at a DC
      14 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by
      the same gaav's noxious breath for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize
      poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with
      immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison
      receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. Once a gaav uses its
      breath weapon, it can't use it again until 1d4 rounds later.
  - name: Shared Senses (Su)
    description: >-
      All gaavs within 100 feet of one another share the same senses. Thus, if
      one individual perceives something (for example, with a successful
      Perception check), all others within range are immediately aware of it.
      Senses are instantly relayed from one gaav or magaav to the next, allowing
      for the senses of a single devil to potentially spread through and inform
      an entire massive swarm instantly. It is still possible for a gaav to be
      surprised or flat-footed, even if other nearby gaavs are not.
  - name: Superior Grappler (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gaav can wield a weapon and still attempt grapple checks. If it's not
      wielding a weapon, a gaav gains a +4 bonus on grapple checks. In addition,
      it takes up to eight gaavs cooperatively to lift a creature that one or
      more of them is grappling; each gaav can lift up to 50 pounds and still
      fly without being impeded.
  - name: Swarming (Ex)
    description: >-
      Up to two gaavs can share the same space at the same time. If two gaavs in
      the same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking
      that foe as if they were in opposite squares.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once the PCs arrive, the gaavs focus their attacks almost entirely on them.
  The gaavs have already expended their noxious breath attacks and summoned imps
  (which were defeated before the PCs arrived).
Morale: >-
  If one of the gaavs is defeated, the other teleports back to Kelseph's
  encampment on its next turn to report the battle's outcome.
