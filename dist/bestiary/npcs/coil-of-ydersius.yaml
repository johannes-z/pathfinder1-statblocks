BeforeCombat: >-
  The assassins cast mage armor, stoneskin, cat's grace, and shield, and drink
  their potions of bear's endurance. They also cast heroism and nondetection
  from their scrolls. Before meeting the PCs, they apply purple worm poison to
  their daggers.
DuringCombat: >-
  A Coil of Ydersius takes the time to study her target for at least 3 rounds
  while interacting with him before making a death attack. If the death attack
  is unsuccessful, the assassin then casts greater invisibility, silent haste,
  and silent true strike to continue making sneak attacks.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 35 hit points, a Coil of Ydersius uses teleport to
  escape to a prearranged rendezvous point in the jungle, relying on her scroll
  of nondetection to ensure the PCs can't locate her with divination magic.
  Thereafter, the Coils conduct further assassination attempts by employing
  their spells to get close enough to strike again, persuading intermediaries
  with suggestion to poison the PCs or lure them into another ambush, or
  targeting human PCs from range with true strike and their greater slaying
  arrows.
Gear: >-
  greater slaying arrow (human), potion of bear's endurance, potions of cure
  light wounds (2), potion of cure moderate wounds, scrolls of heroism (2),
  scrolls of nondetection (2)

  arrows, belt of the snake king (see sidebar), cloak of resistance +1, dust of
  tracelessness, elixir of hiding, ring of protection +1, serpentine brooch
