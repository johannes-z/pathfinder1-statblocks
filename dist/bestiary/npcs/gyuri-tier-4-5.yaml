BeforeCombat: Quiet and loyal, Gyuri waits to be told to attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  Gyuri follows Hjort, attacking whomever the big Ulfen does. He prefers to use
  flurry when he can, but throws shuriken if no closer targets present
  themselves. He saves stunning fist for any spellcasters he is able to get
  close to. If it starts to look as though the tide is turning against him and
  his companions, Gyuri draws and drinks his potion of owl's wisdom to boost his
  AC, then flings himself back into melee.
Morale: Gyuri fights to the death.
Gear: potion of owl's wisdom
