DuringCombat: >-
  The skeletal owlbear treats the narrow stairs as difficult terrain if it
  clambers up them and must squeeze to press between the pillars. Otherwise it
  attacks the largest nearby target each round.
Morale: >-
  The skeletal owlbear fights until destroyed, but unlike the human skeletons,
  it does not pursue foes out of this room.
