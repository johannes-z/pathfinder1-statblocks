DuringCombat: >-
  Shasthaak steps through the portal on the second round but is staggered by the
  unexpected interactions of magic between the portal and the temporal
  disturbances in the room. On his first round in the room, he moves across the
  room and prepares to strike at Xin. If the PCs intervene, the rune giant
  instead focuses his attention on them, but during any round in which at least
  one PC doesn't distract the giant, he attempts to strike Xin with his sword,
  which causes Xin to trigger the Sihedron's retributive strike, immediately
  sending the PCs back to Stethelos.
Morale: Shasthaak fights to the death.
