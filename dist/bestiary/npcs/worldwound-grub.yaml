SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Rapid Biting (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant demonic rot grub bites with astounding speed; it can make one
      additional bite attack in a round as a swift action.
DuringCombat: >-
  A Worldwound grub generally eschews its spell-like abilities to make bite
  attacks against foes. If faced with a foe that remains in flight out of range,
  the grubs merely dive deep to avoid a fight.
Morale: The Worldwound grubs fight to the death.
