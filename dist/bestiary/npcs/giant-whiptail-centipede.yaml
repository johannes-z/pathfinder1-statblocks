  - name: Compact (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although a giant whiptail centipede is a Huge creature, its compact and
      slender frame allow it to squeeze through areas as if it were a Medium
      creature-it still suffers normal effects for squeezing into small areas.

    description: >-
      Bite&#8211;injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
      1d4 Dex; cure 1 save.
  - name: Tail Slap (Ex)
    description: >-
      A whiptail centipede's tail slap attack inflicts nonlethal damage and
      gains no bonus from its strength score on damage inflicted. The monster's
      reach with its tail slap is 20 feet.
DuringCombat: >-
  The whiptail attacks the closest target, pursuing it throughout the mite lair
  but not out of it. These stats have been modified for the fact that the
  centipede is forced to squeeze in the environs.
Morale: The centipede fights to the death.
