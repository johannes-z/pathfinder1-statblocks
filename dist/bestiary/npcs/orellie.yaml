SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Verminous Insights (Su)
    description: >-
      Orellie's extensive studies and contact with both the Darkblight and
      Dryad's Song have granted her insights into the behavior of vermin. She
      benefits from a permanent control vermin effect. Any vermin she controls
      counts as an ally for the purpose of her solo tactics class ability, and
      any vermin she controls can benefit from morale bonuses from spells she
      casts, such as bless.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Orellie begins combat by activating her judgments of piercing and purity, then
  augmenting herself and her scorpion minions by casting shared wrath (she picks
  a target who has blasphemed against Arlantia or Cyth-V'sug, or simply the most
  goodhearted opponent). She trusts her scorpions to keep opponents busy while
  she casts retribution, hold monster, and chaos hammer, before finally
  activating her bane ability and engaging in combat herself. If all her
  scorpions fall, she casts spiritual weapon as well.
Morale: Orellie is a fanatic and fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  potions of barkskin (2, CL 9th), potions of cure serious wounds (2), potion of
  remove paralysis, strand of prayer beads (lesser), wand of giant vermin (13
  charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +2 breastplate, +2 buckler, +1 icy burst heavy pick, unholy symbol of
  Cyth-V'sug, 127 gp
