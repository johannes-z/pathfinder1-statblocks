DuringCombat: >-
  Khoqarit remains within 50 feet of the PCs' ship while attacking with his
  shortbow. He stays at the front of the raiding party whenever possible, and
  focuses his attacks on whichever PC is driving the ship, hoping to distract or
  disable the driver long enough to get the boat snagged on something. Once the
  ship comes to a stop, he dismounts and charges forward onto the ship's deck to
  fight in melee.
Morale: Khoqarit retreats if reduced to 4 or fewer hit points.
Gear: >-
  horn lamellar*, composite shortbow (+2 Str) with 40 arrows, scimitar, light
  horse (combat trained), military saddle
