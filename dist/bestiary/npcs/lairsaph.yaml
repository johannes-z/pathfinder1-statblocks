  - name: Exceptional Resources (Ex)
    description: >-
      Lairsaph has had a long, successful career in banditry, and his equipment
      is testament to this. The Feign Prince has the wealth of a PC rather than
      an NPC, increasing his CR by 1.
Gender: Male
Bloodline: stormbornAPG
BeforeCombat: >-
  Lairsaph casts false life and uses his wand of mage armor every morning and
  afternoon. If he is alerted to intruders in the encampment, Lairsaph casts
  bear's endurance, bull's strength, and shield on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Lairsaph casts displacement on the first round of combat, then attacks foes
  with his spells, favoring electricity spells. He uses a scroll of fly or
  potion of invisibility to avoid being pinned down in melee combat, and casts
  slow and obscuring mist to hinder opponents, using the blindsense granted by
  his stormchild ability to continue targeting foes in the mist.
Morale: >-
  The Feign Prince is not willing to die to keep the location of his hideout
  secret, and if reduced to 75 hit points or fewer, or if one of his consorts is
  slain, Lairsaph casts teleport and flees into the Whisperwood, having no
  qualms about abandoning any surviving members of his gang.

  invisibility (2), scrolls of dimension door (2), scrolls of dispel magic (2),
