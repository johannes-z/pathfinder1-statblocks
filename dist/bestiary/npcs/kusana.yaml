BeforeCombat: In this strange wilderness, Kusana casts mage armor on herself each day.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kusana takes to the air using her flight hex and unleashes spells like bestow
  curse, poison, suffocation, and her quickened deep slumber spell-like 
  ability, while her minions close to melee. Once those are expended, she closes
  again to fight with her claws and drain enemies' blood.
Morale: >-
  Kusana is vicious but practical. If her fen maulers are slain and she is
  reduced below half 90, she begs for mercy and apologizes for her rudeness,
  promising the PCs use of her magic if they let her live (see Development
  below).
