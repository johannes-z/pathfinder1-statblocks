    description: >-
      Venster's rejuvenation works more swiftly than that of most ghosts. When
      destroyed, he rejuvenates after 2d6 rounds. His method of permanent
      destruction is detailed below, under Development.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  If attacked, Venster is able to focus his undead nature enough to fight back,
  using his telekinesis ability to force intruders out of his abode or lashing
  out with his corrupting touch.
Morale: >-
  Venster fights until destroyed, only to rejuvenate swiftly after such
  destruction. When he rejuvenates, he does not attack again until he is himself
  attacked.
