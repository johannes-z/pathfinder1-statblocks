    description: >-
      Once per night, a tombstone fairy can invoke a ritual to raise any evil
      creature from the dead. The ritual takes 10 minutes to perform and the
      target cannot have been dead longer than 1 day per Hit Die of the
      tombstone fairy. Additionally, the target's body must be present during
      the ritual and its soul must be available for return (if the target's soul
      is trapped, such as by a trap the soul spell, this ritual automatically
      fails). A target unwilling to return to life can try to prevent its
      raising by attempting an opposed Charisma check against the tombstone
      fairy's Charisma check. If the tombstone fairy wins the opposed check, the
      target's soul is forced into its body and it returns to life. If the
      target wins the opposed check, it prevents its raising, and the tombstone
      fairy cannot attempt to raise that target for 1 month. During the ritual,
      a portion of the target's soul transfers to its funeral shroud or cloth.
      The tombstone fairy often retains this shroud so as to force compliance
      from the returned target. Once the target does what the fairy desires, the
      tombstone fairy finishes this ritual and transfers the last bit of the
      target's soul from the shroud into its body. If the funeral shroud is
      destroyed while it contains a part of the target's soul, the target
      instantly dies and can only be returned to life through the use of a
      miracle, resurrection, true resurrection, or wish. This ability otherwise
      resembles a raise dead spell. A tombstone fairy can have only one funeral
      shroud containing a target's soul in its possession at one time.
