BeforeCombat: Dagagal casts mage armor at the start of every day.
DuringCombat: >-
  Dagagal's favorite tactic is to cast fly and then invisibility. He can cast
  major image silently without losing his invisibility to project an image of
  himself, gathering his opponents into formation for a well-placed ice storm or
  lightning bolt spell.
Morale: Dagagal attempts to flee if he is reduced to 16 or fewer hit points.
