BeforeCombat: >-
  Kesoulla keeps greater magic weapon on her bastard sword and magic vestment on
  her armor and shield at all times. If alerted by the symbol of scrying in area
  B6, she also casts entropic shield, freedom of movement, shield of faith, and
  true seeing. These effects are reflected in her stat block.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kesoulla puts up a wind wall to prevent ranged attacks against herself, then
  pounds the party with ranged spells. She cast blasphemy early on, catching as
  many party members as she can, and being especially careful to hit extraplanar
  creatures. She then uses blade barrier or flame strike, attempting to drive
  enemies into an area that can be affected by her symbol of pain. When forced
  into melee, Kesoulla uses greater command (flee) and grace to slip away.
  (Remember that characters who reenter the area need to make the save against
  forbiddance again.) When other choices are exhausted, she casts righteous
  might, then fights defensively.
Morale: >-
  Once her guards are slain and it's clear she is going to lose the fight,
  Kesoulla tries to grab the chest filled with sigil wafers and flee out the
  back exit. Once she reaches the surface, she quaffs her potion of invisibility
  and flees using air walk. If the PCs withdraw from the room even briefly, she
  takes the opportunity to grab the sigil wafers and flee.
Gear: >-
  potion of invisibility, scroll of heal, wand of blessing of fervorAPG (5
  charges)
OtherGear: >-
  mwk breastplate, mwk light steel shield, +1 bastard sword, amulet of natural
  armor +1, belt of physical might +2 (Str, Con), cloak of resistance +2,

BaseStatistics: >-
  If Kesoulla is not alerted by the symbol of scrying in area B6, there is no
  miss chance to hit her with ranged attacks and she lacks true seeing, shield
  of faith, and freedom of movement. Without magic vestment and shield of faith,
  her statistics are AC 19, touch 11, flat-footed 18.
