DuringCombat: >-
  Jarvaxus would prefer to avoid combat and let allies deal with any threats,
  but he is willing to engage foes if he has no other choice. He begins combat

  blade barrier and flame strike, or ones that take enemies out of the fight,
  such as blasphemy and hold monster.

  battle. As such, he surrenders if reduced to fewer than 60 hit points.
