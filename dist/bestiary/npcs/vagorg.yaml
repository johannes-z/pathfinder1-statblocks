BeforeCombat: >-
  When the alarm goes off, Vagorg drinks a potion of invisibility, then casts
  silent mage armor and silent shield on himself while moving to the southern
  nook to wait.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vagorg waits for Anevia to be in sight before he begins his attack. He casts
  silent summon monster I (it takes a sorcerer 2 rounds to do so) to summon a
  fiendish fire beetle to attack Anevia&#8211;he repeats this action every 2
  rounds. Once he's out of 2nd-level spells, he joins the fight, focusing his
  ranseur attacks on Anevia while screaming in Orc, "Your wife will find your
  corpse in bed waiting for her!" If the PCs manage to attack him before he's
  out of 2nd-level spells, he casts bull's strength on himself before attacking
  in return.
Morale: Vagorg fights to the death.
