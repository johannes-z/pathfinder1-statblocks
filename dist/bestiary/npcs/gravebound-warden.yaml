  - name: Alternate Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A gravebound warden can transform itself into a field of gravestones,
      miniature shrines, or stone coffins. While in this form, the warden gains
      a +20 racial bonus on Disguise checks to imitate a crowded cemetery. It
      requires a full-round action to change forms.
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a gravebound warden can exhale a 60-foot cone of
      ash and grave dust. Any creatures within this area must succeed at a DC 21
      Fortitude save or be blinded and sickened for 1d6+1 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Gravebound (Su)
    description: >-
      A gravebound warden is assigned a specific site sacred to the dead to
      guard. This site is always marked by either a permanent hallow or unhallow
      effect, determined at the time of the warden's construction. The warden
      cannot willingly leave this area and defends it against all intruders
      except those named during the casting of the spell. This gravebound warden
      is bound to a 40-foot-radius emanation from a hallow spell (CL 15th).
  - name: Powerful Blows (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gravebound warden adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on damage rolls
      with its slam attacks and threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.
DuringCombat: >-
  The gravebound warden charges into opponents to attack with its slams. It uses
  Bull Rush, Cleave, and Overrun attacks as often as possible, pausing only to
  employ its breath weapon before renewing its assault.
Morale: The gravebound warden fights until destroyed.
