DuringCombat: >-
  When combat starts (or if she has advance warning), Haelvora casts fly and
  rises 30 feet up to keep out of melee range. She casts summon monster III to
  summon 1d3 hell hounds. Next, she casts spike stones on the floor between
  Ascalar and the PCs. She then casts bane before targeting foes with dismissal,
  unholy blight, vision of Hell, murderous command, dread bolt, and hold person.
  If a PC falls and she suspects the PC is dying, Haelvora does not hesitate to
  cast death knell. She only channels negative energy if she can do so without
  harming her allies. Once out of spells and channel energy uses, she enters
  melee with her battleaxe.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 15 hit points or less, Haelvora casts sanctuary and then tries
  to flee to area C1, where she drinks her healing potions and makes her final
  stand. She fights to the death.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, potions of cure serious wounds (2)
OtherGear: >-
  heavy steel shield, mwk full plate, +1 battleaxe, light crossbow with 20
  arrows, headband of inspired wisdom +2, silver holy symbol of Abadar, 162 gp
