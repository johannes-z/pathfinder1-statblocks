BeforeCombat: >-
  If Fethi thinks she is about to confront enemies in lethal combat, she imbibes
  her potion of bull's strength and takes a swig of her hobgoblin war draught.
  The effects of these potables have not been figured into her stat block.
DuringCombat: >-
  Fethi always fights defensively using the crane style, giving her a &#8211;2
  penalty on attack rolls, but her crane style and her ranks in Acrobatics grant
  her a +4 dodge bonus to AC while fighting defensively. She makes all of her
  unarmed strikes with her feet, knees, or head, and uses her Crane Wing and
  Deflect Arrows feats to deflect one melee and one ranged attack per round. She
  mercilessly mocks all those who fail to land a blow on her.
Morale: Fethi is proud to a fault and refuses to back down, even if outmatched.
