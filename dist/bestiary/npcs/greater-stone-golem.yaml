SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A greater stone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that
      allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. A transmute rock to mud
      spell slows a greater stone golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with
      no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit
      points. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the golem's
      structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1
      full round.
  - name: Slow (Su)
    description: >-
      A greater stone golem can use a slow effect, as the spell, as a free
      action once every 2 rounds. The effect has a range of 10 feet in a burst
      centered on the golem and a duration of 7 rounds, requiring a DC 31 Will
      save to negate. The save DC is Constitution-based.
