BeforeCombat: >-
  Embla is wary of the PCs and tries her hardest not to show any signs of
  aggression until combat begins.
DuringCombat: >-
  Embla ferociously attempts to sunder heavily defended PCs' armor, moving from
  one opponent to the next when she succeeds. If she faces no one in undamaged
  medium or heavy armor, she moves to a position to flank with Graukur. Using
  her Furious Focus feat, she Power Attacks every round without the penalty on
  her first attack roll each round.
Morale: >-
  What Embla has in sundering prowess she lacks in tactics. She doesn't realize
  the fight is lost until it's too late.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of bull's strength
OtherGear: >-
  +2 splint mail, +1 adamantine lucerne hammer*, ring of protection +1, cloak of
  resistance +1, 25 gp
