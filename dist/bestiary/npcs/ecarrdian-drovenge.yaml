SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Spawn of Mammon (Ex)
    description: >-
      As the spawn of Mammon, Ecarrdian's base ability score modifiers are +2
      Con, +2 Wis, and -2 Cha. Ecarrdian has the Advanced Creature template, a
      20-point ability score buy, and gear as if he were a PC. In addition,
      while Ecarrdian does not possess the standard darkness spell-like ability
      of a tiefling, he possesses exceptional DR and SR. These benefits increase
      his CR by +2.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ecarrdian uses his bracelet of friends to call Chammady as soon as he fears
  combat with the PCs is imminent.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ecarrdian prefers to attack once per round, using Improved Feint and Improved
  Vital Strike to maximize his damage and (unless he's finding it difficult to
  hit his foes) Combat Expertise to increase his AC. Only if he's surrounded
  does he make full-attack actions.
Morale: Ecarrdian fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  +5 leather armor, rapier of puncturing, amulet of proof against detection and
  location, belt of mighty constitution +4, boots of striding and springing,
  bracelet of friends (keyed to Chammady), cloak of resistance +3, ring of
  freedom of movement, ring of protection +2
