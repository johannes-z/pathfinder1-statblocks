  The warriors use their shortbows from atop the tower until the PCs are at the
  base. At that point, they descend the ladders to ready their attacks pending
  the door being broken down. If the warriors occupy a tower that the PCs are
  ignoring in favor of the other tower, the goblins exit to attack the party on
  the ground from behind.
Morale: The Icetooth goblin warriors fight to the death.
