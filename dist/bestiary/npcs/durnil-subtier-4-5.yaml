BeforeCombat: >-
  Before ambushing the PCs, Durnil uses her wand of mage armor and wand of
  invisibility, drinks her potion of bull's strength, and casts expeditious
  retreat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Durnil uses her scroll of shrink item on the first round of combat, holding
  the charge until she gets close enough to use it on the keg. If she
  successfully shrinks the keg, she attempts to steal it, using her wand of
  invisibility afterward so she can run away. If cornered, Durnil uses her
  offensive spells to confuse and harm the PCs. The twins have taken pains to
  look as similar as possible, and try to keep the fact that there are two of
  them a secret.
Morale: >-
  Durnil imbibes her potion of cure moderate wounds if brought to 9 hit points
  or fewer. She has a long and close relationship with her sister, and neither
  is willing to risk death. If one sister is captured or falls, the other offers
  to surrender the keg to ensure her sister survives. The two are simply trying
  to steal the keg, and fight only if cornered. If death seems like an imminent
  threat, both attempt to flee, whether they have the keg in tow or not.
Gear: >-
  potion of bull's strength, potion of cure moderate wounds, silenced scroll of
  shrink item (CL 7th), wand of invisibility (7 charges), wand of mage armor (23
  charges)
OtherGear: masterwork morningstar, cloak of resistance +1
