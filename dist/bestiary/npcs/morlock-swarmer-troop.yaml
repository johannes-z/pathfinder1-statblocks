  - name: Expert Climber (Ex)
    description: >-
      A morlock swarmer troop can cling to cave walls and even ceilings as long
      as the surface has hand- and footholds. In effect, the troop is treated as
      constantly being under a nonmagical version of the spell spider climb,
      save that it cannot cling to smooth surfaces. This ability doubles the +8
      racial bonus on Climb checks normally afforded creatures that have a climb
      speed.
  - name: Leap Attack (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a morlock swarmer troop that succeeds at an
      Acrobatics check can move as per the results of that check, making either
      a long jump or a high jump as normal. The troop must move horizontally in
      a straight line during its jump. This movement does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity. When using this ability, the morlock swarmer troop can deal
      troop damage to any creature it is adjacent to over the course of the
      jump. This does not allow the morlock swarmer troop to deal troop damage
      to a creature more than once per round.
  - name: Swarming (Ex)
    description: >-
      Much of the morlock swarmer troop's damage comes from sneak attacks made
      by its constituent members as they climb over one another, confusing their
      prey. Against creatures that cannot be flanked or that are immune to
      critical hits, sneak attacks, or precision-based damage, the morlock
      swarmer troop's attack damage is reduced to 2d6.
