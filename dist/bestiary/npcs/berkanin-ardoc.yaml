SQ: arcane bond (clockwork familiar [Petey])

Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  As soon as Berkanin realizes enemies are approaching, he casts mage armor and
  protection from arrows. He uses his wand of false life on himself as well.
DuringCombat: >-
  Berkanin uses his lesser wings of flying to stay aloft and out of melee,
  occasionally perching on the top of his walls or window casements. At the
  start of combat, he casts invisibility, then keeps moving while he casts haste
  and blur the next few rounds. He prefers to lock down opponents with spells
  like black tentacles or web, then hammer them with area of effect spells. He
  may also choose the most imposing foe and target her with dominate, turning
  her against her party. He commands Petey to use its acid spit to the greatest
  effect, and has no problem sacrificing his familiar to save himself. He has
  even less regard for the two clockwork soldiers he keeps here as
  bodyguards&#8211;they're difficult to replace, but if they run interference
  and make the difference between him surviving or even just being able to cast
  a spell without being disrupted, they're serving their purpose.
Morale: >-
  Berkanin knows that he's crossed several lines with his family, and won't
  bother trying to flee to them if things get grim. Instead, he begs for his
  life if brought below 10 hit points. He certainly gives up Augustille if the
  PCs ask, but the troll might not be interested in honoring any surrenders that
  Berkanin establishes with the PCs. If spared, Berkanin is willing to give his
  most valuable possession&#8211;his lesser wings of flying&#8211;to the PCs as
  a bribe for them to take Augustille and leave him alone.
