BeforeCombat: A seer activates ice armor before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The traditional weapon of the seer of Saint Senex is the boarding gaff (see
  Special Abilities  below). A seer casts sanctuary on the first round of
  combat, then divine favor and weapon of awe in the next 2 rounds before
  breaking her sanctuary effect and casting command on foes to force them to lie
  down. In the rounds that follow, the seers focus their attacks on the same
  target. They work to maintain reach with their gaffs, but use their wintry
  touch ability if forced to fight adjacent foes. If either seer is reduced to
  fewer than 10 hit points, the other uses healing magic on the wounded seer.
Morale: The seers fight to the death defending the shrine.
Gear: wand of summon monster II (7 charges), wand of water breathing (8 charges)
