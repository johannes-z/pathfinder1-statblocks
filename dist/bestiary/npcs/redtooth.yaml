DuringCombat: >-
  Redtooth opens combat with a sneak attack from her dart gun, then casts vanish
  to relocate so she can take a second sneak attack shot at the weakest-looking
  foe. She relies on allies to help her fight in melee, so she can swarm with
  fellow ratfolk. She saves her second use of vanish for escape.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 10 or fewer hit points, Redtooth uses vanish and then seeks out
  a hiding place to drink her potions before fleeing into Scrapwall to plot
  revenge. She's had to abandon her tribe before, and she knows she'll need to
  do so again in the future. If cornered, she fights to the death, but as she
  does so, she does her best to take out as many of her foes as she can.
