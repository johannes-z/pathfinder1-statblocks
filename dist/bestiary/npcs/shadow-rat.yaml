  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Filth fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 11, onset 1d3 days, frequency
      1/day, effect 1d3 Dex damage and 1d3 Con damage, cure 2 consecutive saves.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Incorporeal Form (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action a shadow rat can assume an incorporeal form. It can
      maintain this form for up to 1 hour per day. In this form, the shadow rat
      gains the incorporeal subtype and has AC 15, touch 15, flat-footed 13 (+1
      deflection, +2 Dex, +2 size). The shadow rat can still bite corporeal
      opponents while in its incorporeal form, but its attack deals only
      Strength damage and doesn't cause hit point damage or disease.
  - name: Shadow Blend (Su)
    description: >-
      In any condition of illumination other than bright light, a shadow rat can
      disappear into the shadows as a move action, giving it total concealment
      (50% miss chance). Artificial illumination, even a light or continual
      flame spell, does not negate this ability; a daylight spell, however,
      does.
  - name: Strength Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      A shadow rat deals Strength damage to living foes it bites. A creature
      reduced to 0 Strength does not die but cannot move and is unconscious.
