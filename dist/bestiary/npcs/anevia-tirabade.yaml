SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Broken Leg (Ex)
    description: >-
      Anevia's leg was broken in the fall, and as a result she moves at half
      speed and cannot run. She also takes a -4 penalty on all skill checks
      requiring movement (Acrobatics, Climb, many Stealth checks, and Swim) and
      a &#8211;2 penalty to her AC. If the damage she sustained in the fall is
      healed, the penalty on skill checks is reduced to &#8211;2 and the penalty
      to AC is removed, but completely healing her leg requires a regenerate
      spell.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Even before she broke her leg, Anevia preferred to fight with her bow.
  Although only four of her arrows survived the fall, Anevia relies on her
  shortbow for most fights until her leg is healed. Until she can secure at
  least 10 more arrows, she avoids using Rapid Shot, hoping to make every single
  shot count. If forced into melee, she does her best to flank with her sword,
  despite her limited mobility.
Morale: >-
  Unless she is fighting with a good friend or her wife Irabeth, Anevia flees to
  seek out a hiding spot to wait out her enemies if she falls below 5 hit
  points.
Gear: alchemist's fire (2), smokestick (3)
