BeforeCombat: >-
  The Forester keeps two animated trees active in the grove and casts barkskin
  before confronting the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Forester begins combat by creating a wall of thorns between it and as many
  PCs as possible, leaving its animated trees to handle those PCs while it
  focuses on any PCs who are nearby. The Forester attempts to negate ranged
  attackers with blindness/deafness, and it casts thorn body if the PCs attempt
  to crowd or surround it. If faced with highly mobile foes, it relies on its
  hex of lignification or entangle to keep them slowed down. If brought below 50
  hit points, it casts obscuring mist around itself and then uses the
  concealment to cast healing spells on itself before returning to battle.
Morale: A loyal servant of the temple, the Forester fights until it is destroyed.
