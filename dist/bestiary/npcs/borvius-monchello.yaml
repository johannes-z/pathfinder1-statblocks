BeforeCombat: >-
  Borvius throws his flash powder to the floor immediately at the start of
  combat (every character in a 10-foot-radius burst must make a successful DC 13
  Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round) .
DuringCombat: >-
  If the PCs look wounded, Borvius fights back, making a good show so the
  children will think of him as a hero. If the PCs are unscathed or get the
  upper hand, Borvius throws down the rope, scrambles out the window, uses the
  rope to get him within 10 feet of the ground, then drops. If he can't get out
  the window, he draws his weapons and fights.
Morale: Borvius fights to the death if he can't get out the window.
Gear: potions of cure light wounds (2)
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork studded leather, masterwork longsword, masterwork short sword,
  dagger
