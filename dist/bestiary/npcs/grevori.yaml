SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A calikang can choose what kind of energy damage its breath weapon
      inflicts when it uses this ability, choosing from acid, cold, electricity,
      fire, or sonic energy. Calikangs are particularly adept at using
      electricity in this manner, and deal 1 additional point of damage per die
      (+14 for most calikangs) when they elect to inflict electricity damage
      with their breath weapon.
  - name: Defensive Slam (Ex)
    description: >-
      A calikang gains a cumulative +1 shield bonus to its AC for each of its
      arms that does not wield a manufactured weapon, to a maximum of +4 for
      four hands. A calikang can make slam attacks with these arms without
      losing this AC bonus.
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Eidite Sickness: Injection syringe-injury; save Fort DC 20; onset 1d3
      days; frequency 1/day; effect see page 19; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Energy Absorption (Su)
    description: >-
      A spell that inflicts energy damage that is defeated by the calikang's SR
      or immunity to electricity is absorbed into its body, healing it for an
      amount of damage equal to the absorbed spell's caster level and granting
      an additional daily use of its breath weapon.
  - name: Suspend Animation (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a calikang can enter a state of suspended
      animation, freezing in place and becoming motionless. It remains aware of
      its surroundings. In this state, the calikang is immune to disease,
      inhaled toxins, poison, starvation, and thirst, and receives a +4 bonus on
      all Fortitude saves. The calikang can exit this state as an immediate
      action&#8211;if it does so to attack a foe or initiate combat, it gains a
      +4 insight bonus on its initiative check.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Grevori uses the eidite injectors hanging from the ceiling as weapons against
  foes in addition to his warhammers, concentrating on attacking as many nearby
  creatures as he can.
Morale: >-
  Grevori is not foolish, and knows that his association with Gurstweld is one
  of convenience at best. If reduced to fewer than 25 hit points, he lays down
  his arms and surrenders to the PCs.
Gear: warhammers (2), bracers of armor +3
