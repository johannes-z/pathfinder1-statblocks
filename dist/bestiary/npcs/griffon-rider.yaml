BeforeCombat: >-
  Well in advance of battle, the fighter activates her bronze griffon and
  saddles and armors it. Before the fighting starts, she mounts her griffon,
  takes to the air, and quaffs her potion of heroism.
DuringCombat: >-
  The fighter flies above the battlefield taking passes with her lance, never
  flying lower than 10 feet above the ground. If outmatched in melee, she
  retreats to higher altitude and uses her bow. A griffon rider loves to unseat
  other mounted combatants, particularly if they're flying. She keeps a
  plentiful supply of alchemist's fire in case any flammable targets present
  themselves.
Gear: potions of cure light wounds (2), potion of heroism, alchemist's fire (5)
