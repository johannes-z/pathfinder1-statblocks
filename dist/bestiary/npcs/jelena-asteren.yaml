DuringCombat: >-
  Jelena prefers to avoid combat if possible, but not just because she's always
  considered violence to be a tactic of last choice. She's managed for the past
  several weeks to hide the fact that she's lost her faith in hopes of finding
  it again (and thus regaining her powers) before having to admit the shame to
  her fellow knights, and avoiding combat is an important part of that
  deception. If forced to do so, she fights defensively and attempts to retreat
  to the closest area she suspects has allies-with whom she fights, focusing on
  flanking foes.
Morale: >-
  Jelena fights to the death, afraid that surrender or flight would only further
  damn her soul in the afterlife.
Gear: horn of goodness/evil
