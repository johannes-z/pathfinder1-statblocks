BeforeCombat: The guardians form a protective shield wall in front of Adril.
DuringCombat: >-
  The guardians use their Shield Wall* feat to gain +2 AC and then use move
  actions for their shield ally whenever possible (keeping in mind that cover
  bonuses don't stack). When it's the most advantageous for them to do so, they
  use ready pike for extra damage. They fight as one unit, standing side by side
  and always trying to stay between the PCs and the thing they think is Adril
  Hestram.
Morale: >-
  The men fight ferociously to the death so long as Adril is "alive," but the
  moment he's reduced to a puddle of icy water, their devotion wanes and they
  surrender if more than two of their number are killed.
OtherGear: cloak of resistance +1, +1 full plate, +2 glaive-guisarme*, +1 tower shield
