SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Constructed (Ex)
    description: >-
      For the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as a
      ranger's favored enemy and bane weapons), Meyanda counts as a humanoid and
      a construct. She gains a +4 racial bonus on all saving throws against
      mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, and stun effects; she is not
      subject to fatigue or exhaustion, and is immune to disease, emotion-based
      effects, fear, and sleep effects. She can never gain morale bonuses.
  - name: Emotionless (Ex)
    description: >-
      Meyanda has problems processing emotions properly and suffers a -4 penalty
      on Sense Motive checks.
  - name: Nanite Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Meyanda's body is infused with nanites. Once per day as an immediate
      action, she can cause her nanites to surge, granting a +8 bonus on any one
      d20 roll; this ability must be activated before the roll is made. When
      Meyanda uses this power, her circuitry-tattoos glow with light equivalent
      to that of a torch for 1 round.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Meyanda casts bull's strength, magic vestment, and shield of faith before
  combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Meyanda uses her magic in the first few rounds of combat, using searing light,
  sound burst, and lesser confusion to target foes at range while remaining
  mobile, moving from cover to cover and allowing her minions to engage the PCs
  in melee. She switches to using her +1 inferno pistol and keeps her distance
  once she's cast her spells, using Deadly Aim with each shot. She uses healing
  (favoring her spells over her nanite hypogun) on herself whenever she's
  brought below 15 hit points, and enters melee only as a last resort. Given the
  choice, she prefers to attack humans&#8211;more out of a strange instinctual
  reaction and fragmentary urges stemming from her past life, where  the AI
  Unity used many androids as shock troops against Divinity's human crew, than
  out of any conscious hatred.
Morale: Meyanda fights to the death.
Gear: black nanite hypogunTG (5 charges)
