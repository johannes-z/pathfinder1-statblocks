BeforeCombat: >-
  Thulmaga casts shield of faith, freedom of movement, spell resistance, and
  resist energy (fire, or the energy type the PCs favor) on herself. She is
  aware of this energy type only if Dornarnus witnessed them use it while under
  the effects of dominate person.
DuringCombat: >-
  Thulmaga uses her staff's remaining charges to cast greater command (DC 20),
  aiming to cause as many foes as possible to "halt," then casts dominate person
  on the most susceptible-looking PC, or on Dornarnus if the paladin is fighting
  with the PCs. She then targets those who passed their saves with more
  debilitating magic, starting with her most powerful spells. She finishes off
  fallen foes with death knell, but saves it for Dornarnus if he remains
  un-dominated.
Morale: >-
  Thulmaga knows that losing this battle will cause her further disgrace; she
  fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  staff of Droskar's demands (6 charges remaining), wand of remove
  blindness/deafness (7 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 chainmail, mwk light crossbow with 10 bolts, mwk light hammer, cloak of
  resistance +1, diamond dust worth 300 gp, eye ointment worth 250 gp (for true
  seeing)
Land: 1
BaseStatistics: >-
  Without bear's endurance and shield of faith, Thulmaga's statistics are: hp
  108; Saves Fort +11; AC 17, touch 9, flat-footed 17; Con 16.
