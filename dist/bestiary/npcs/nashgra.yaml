DuringCombat: >-
  Nashgra relies heavily on her wand of burning hands and wand of acid arrow,
  assuming that because fire and acid are most dangerous to trolls, they are the
  best weapons in every situation. If reduced to fewer than half her hit points,
  she discards her wands and simply relies on her claws and bite to finish off
  any remaining enemies.
Morale: >-
  Nashgra believes a wizard as powerful as she could never be slain, and fights
  to the death.
