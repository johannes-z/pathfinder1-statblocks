SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Missing Arm (Ex)
    description: >-
      Asmoden is missing his left arm, and thus must drop or sheathe his
      longsword in order to make claw attacks. He can use Still Spell to cast
      spells while wielding his sword. During any round in which Asmoden's
      missing arm is visible to him, the huecuva must succeed at a DC 25 Will
      save to avoid being staggered. If a PC forcefully presents the arm to
      Asmoden (this is a move action), the huecuva takes a -5 penalty on this
      Will save that round. If Asmoden reclaims his arm, it reattaches
      instantly; he not only loses this special weakness, but also is healed of
      4d6+20 points of damage and gains a second claw attack.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Asmoden casts spell resistance, false life, desecrate (the possessed bells
  function as an altar for this spell's effects), bull's strength, and shield of
  faith before combat&#8211;most likely as soon as he sees the wall of force or
  hellfire column below deactivate because one or both infernal engines have
  shut down. He also activates his armor of bones ability before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Asmoden casts quickened divine favor on the first round of combat (these
  effects are included in his statistics above). On following rounds, he uses
  Quicken Spell as needed to cast any other before-combat spells he hasn't yet
  cast. He prefers to hang back to cast spells at range, but if forced into
  melee, he uses Power Attack and focuses his wrath on human foes if possible.
  He casts mass inflict light wounds whenever a herecite is brought below 30 hit
  points to heal his allies or harm intruders. If brought below 50 hit points,
  he casts sanctuary and uses inflict spells to heal himself before returning to
  combat.
Morale: >-
  Asmoden fights until destroyed, confident that the Devil's Bells will
  rejuvenate him (see Development below).
