Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Arastrax uses its shadow conjuration spell-like ability to summon a quasi-real
  dretch to distract its opponents while it threatens the assembled guests. If
  it can do so without interference, the shadow demon repeats this up to three
  times until all its uses of shadow conjuration have been expended. In melee,
  the demon uses its halberd to attack approaching enemies and switches to its
  heavy flail when a foe closes within its reach.
Morale: >-
  Arastrax is unconcerned about the ultimate safety of its host, and it shows no
  quarter in battle even when its host is at death's door.
Gear: potions of cure light wounds (2)
OtherGear: half-plate, halberd, heavy crossbow with 10 bolts, heavy flail, sap, 5 gp
