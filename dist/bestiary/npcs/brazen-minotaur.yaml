  If the minotaur hears the turntable operate in area F1, it moves next to the
  western door in this room. It readies to attack the instant a PC opens the
  door.
DuringCombat: >-
  Klarkosh instructed the minotaur to destroy spellcasters, so the minotaur
  targets such PCs first.

  clockwork servants in area F3 won't attack it.
