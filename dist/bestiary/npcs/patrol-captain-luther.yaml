SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Devastating Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, Patrol Captain Luther may unleash a 30-foot cone of
      energy as a standard action. This blast deals 2d6 points of damage for
      every 3 Hit Dice he has (Reflex for half). This damage is of the energy
      type determined by his ruinous revivification special quality.
  - name: Phantom Mount (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per hour, Patrol Captain Luther can summon a skeletal horse similar
      to a phantom steed. This mount is more real than a typical phantom steed,
      and can carry one additional rider. The mount's powers are based on
      Luther's total Hit Dice rather than caster level. His mount looks
      distinctive and always appears the same each time it is summoned. If the
      mount is destroyed, it can be summoned again with full hit points 1 hour
      later.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      One day after Patrol Captain Luther is destroyed, his armor begins to
      rebuild the undead horror's body. This process takes 1d10 days - if the
      body is destroyed before that time passes, the armor merely starts the
      process anew. After this time has elapsed, Luther wakens fully healed.
  - name: Ruinous Revivification (Su)
    description: >-
      At the time of its creation, a graveknight chooses one of the following
      energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. This energy type should be
      relevant to the graveknight's life or death, defaulting to fire if none
      are especially appropriate. This energy type influences the effects of
      several of a graveknight's special abilities. Patrol Captain Luther's
      chosen energy type is acid.
  - name: Sacrilegious Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Patrol Captain Luther constantly exudes an aura of intense evil and
      negative energy in a 30-foot radius. This aura functions as the spell
      desecrate and uses his armor as an altar of sorts to double the effects
      granted. He constantly gains the benefits of this effect (including the
      bonus hit points, as this aura is part of the graveknight's creation). In
      addition, this miasma of fell energies hinders the channeling of positive
      energy. Any creature that attempts to summon positive energy in this area
      - such as through a cleric's channel energy ability, a paladin's lay on
      hands, or any spell with the healing subtype - must make a concentration
      check with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 Luther's Hit Dice + his Charisma
      modifier. If the character fails, the effect is expended but does not
      function.
  - name: Undead Mastery (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Patrol Captain Luther can attempt to bend any undead
      creature within 50 feet to his will. The targeted undead must succeed at a
      Will save or fall under his control. This control is permanent for
      unintelligent undead; an undead with an Intelligence score is allowed an
      additional save every day to break free from Luther's control. A creature
      that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same graveknight's
      undead mastery for 24 hours. Luther can control 5 Hit Dice of undead
      creatures for every Hit Die he has. If he exceeds this number, the excess
      from earlier uses of the ability becomes uncontrolled, as per animate
      dead.
