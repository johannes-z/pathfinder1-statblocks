    description: >-
      A hiracapath sheds the blinding light of righteous loyalty, which burns
      betrayers and staggers deceivers. Their radiance increases the light level
      within the area of the aura by one step and counts as magical light
      equivalent to a continual light spell for the purposes of dispelling
      magical darkness. Chaotic- or evil-aligned creatures that make a
      successful melee attack against a hiracapath take 1d6 points of nonlethal
      damage. Chaotic evil creatures suffer 2d6 points of nonlethal damage from
      striking the hiracapath while within the aura.
  - name: Nonlethal Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hiracapath can deal nonlethal damage with any of its natural attacks
      without taking a penalty on the attack roll. When making nonlethal
      attacks, the hiracapath increases the critical threat range on all natural
      attacks to 19-20.
DuringCombat: >-
  The hiracapaths engage the PCs using nonlethal tactics, pacifying the PCs and
  then depositing them at the edge of the valley.
Morale: >-
  When Old Man Mountain arrives, the hiracapaths become spooked and plane shift
  away.
