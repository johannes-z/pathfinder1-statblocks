SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear Light (Su)
    description: >-
      A lantern goat can emit an ugly yellow light from the lantern around its
      neck as a free action. All creatures within 60 feet that view this light
      must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be panicked for 1d4+4 rounds. A
      creature that succeeds at its save is immune to the fear light of that
      lantern goat for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Soul Capture (Su)
    description: >-
      Any living creature reduced to fewer than 0 hit points while within 60
      feet of a lantern goat must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or have its soul
      drawn into the lantern goat's lantern. The DC increases by 1 for every hit
      point the character is below 0 (e.g., a character at -3 hit points must
      succeed at a DC 25 save). As long as the lantern contains at least one
      soul, the lantern goat gains channel resistance +4 and fast healing 10.
      Once a soul is captured, the slain creature cannot be returned to life
      through raise dead, reincarnation, resurrection, true resurrection, or
      even wish or miracle. Only by destroying the lantern can the soul be
      freed, at which point such spells work normally. The lantern cannot be
      destroyed or removed until the lantern goat is destroyed. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. The save DC is Charisma-based.
