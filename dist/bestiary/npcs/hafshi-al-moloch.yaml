BeforeCombat: >-
  If Hafshi knows the PCs are coming, she times her summoning spells for their
  arrival. She summons a lemure and a fire beetle. The fire beetle lasts for 3
  rounds after the PCs arrive and the lemure stays for 4 rounds.
DuringCombat: >-
  Hafshi uses her summoned minions to keep the PCs away from her and trips
  heavily-armed PCs as often as she can. Because she gets a single attack with
  her mace and a single trip attack with her whip each round that she can take a
  full attack, she will always move to ensure she can do both whenever possible.
  If any heavily-armed PCs get too close to her, she uses cause fear on that PC.
  Hafshi saves her cure spell (and wand) for herself.
Morale: Hafshi fights to the death.
