BeforeCombat: Amaretos casts fire shield and shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Amaretos begins by casting cloudkill, then uses his hasted assault magus
  arcana to close to melee  with those who obviously honor Iomedae. He casts
  black tentacles and interposing hand to keep other foes at bay. Amaretos
  prefers to channel vampiric touch through his blade, and he unleashes a
  devastating blast or maximized lightning bolt if he can catch several
  opponents.
Morale: Fanatical by design and miserable by nature, Amaretos fights until destroyed.
Gear: boots of escapeUE, scroll of teleport
