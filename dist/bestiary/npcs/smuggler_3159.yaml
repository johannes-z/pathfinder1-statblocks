SpecialAbilities: []
DuringCombat: >-
  The smugglers on the roof use the ballistae against intruders&#8211;they can't
  target foes in area D2, though, so if the PCs move the fight down there or
  into the floor below, they abandon the siege engines to join the fight.
  Smugglers in melee combat work together to surround foes and flank, relying on
  their shortbows only when they can't reach a foe in melee.
Morale: >-
  The smugglers are highly trained Chelish agents&#8211; they fight to the
  death.

  +2 studded leather, +1 short sword, masterwork shortbow with 20 arrows, cloak
  of resistance +1
