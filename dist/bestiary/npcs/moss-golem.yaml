SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Climbing Form (Ex)
    description: >-
      A moss golem can rearrange its constituent plants into an elongated and
      extremely flexible form as a swift action. While in this form, the moss
      golem's reach increases to 30 feet, it gains a 30-foot climb speed, and
      its DR becomes 15/slashing and adamantine. A moss golem in this form can
      also move through any crack or hole in a wall or door, no matter how
      small, without impeding its movement. A moss golem can maintain this form
      for up to 10 rounds per day, but these rounds do not need to be
      consecutive. Reverting to its normal form is a free action.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A moss golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against a moss golem, as noted below. &#8226; A diminish
      plants spell cast on the moss golem causes it to lose its quickness
      ability for 1d6 rounds. &#8226; A plant growth spell restores 1d6 points
      of damage per level of the caster (maximum 10d6) to the moss golem.
      &#8226; Hitting a moss golem in its climbing form with any spell of 6th
      level or higher with the acid descriptor causes the moss golem to take
      10d6 points of acid damage (no save) and lose the use of its climbing form
      ability for 24 hours.
  - name: Quickness (Ex)
    description: >-
      A moss golem is incredibly quick. It can take an extra move action during
      its turn each round. This means it can move up to its speed and still make
      a full attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  The moss golem attacks the nearest non-wyrwood creature it can see, using its
  climbing form  to assault enemies that are hard to reach. The moss golem
  doesn't attack wyrwoods, but it attacks any other creatures, including
  Children of Kumaru.
Morale: The moss golem fights until destroyed.
