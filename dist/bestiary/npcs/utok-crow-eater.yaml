  Utok throws his net on any obvious spell caster and keeps the trailing rope
  secure. He then fights defensively using shield bashes to ward off his
  enemies. Utok favors human targets to benefit from Darik's hunter's bond. If
  Utok takes 10 points of damage, he enters a rage.
Morale: >-
  Utok fights to the death while raging. Otherwise, Utok flees when reduced to
  15 hit points.
