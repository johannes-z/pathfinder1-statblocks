    description: >-
      The animated crane gains 30- foot reach and enhanced damage with its slam
      attack. It is made of glaucite (granting it a +4 increase to natural armor
      and hardness 15), and is reinforced such that it gains additional Hit Dice
      over what a Large construct normally gains. The crane is immobile, and
      cannot move from its position.
DuringCombat: >-
  The animated crane is immobile, but can strike at opponents with the claw at
  the end of its boom from anywhere in its reach. If it successfully grabs a
  creature, the  crane swings its boom over the open space and drops the
  creature into area F23, 30 feet below.
Morale: The animated crane fights until destroyed.
