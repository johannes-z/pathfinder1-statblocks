  - name: Airborne (Ex)
    description: >-
      When in flight, an empyrean behir gains a +1 morale bonus on attack and
      damage rolls with ranged attacks. Air-Infused
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, an empyrean behir can breathe a 60-foot-long cone
      of wind that mimics a terrible windstorm. Every creature within this area
      that is not flying must succeed on a DC 17 Acrobatics or Strength check or
      fall prone. A flying creature that fails a DC 17 Fly check is blown away
      from the empyrean behir, moving a distance equal to 5 feet per point by
      which it failed the check. If the blown creature encounters a large object
      (such as a wall) during this movement, it takes 1d6 points of damage per 5
      feet the object prevented it from moving.
  - name: Elemental Body (Ex)
    description: >-
      Empyrean behirs possess some of the qualities of air elementals. Each time
      an empyrean behir is exposed to a poison, paralysis, sleep, or stun
      effect, it has a 25% chance to avoid it. In addition, there is a 25%
      chance that a sneak attack or critical hit deals no extra damage.
  - name: Grab (Ex)
    description: >-
      An empyrean behir's grab attack works against creatures of any size
      category. It can constrict the same round it establishes a hold. On any
      round thereafter that it maintains its hold, the empyrean behir can choose
      to rake the grappled target or swallow it whole.
DuringCombat: >-
  The behirs immediately take to the air, hitting the PCs with their breath
  weapons whenever possible and swooping in to attack the weakest PCs who attack
  Skelg from range.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to less than 10 hit points, the behirs throw themselves at the
  locked door from which they entered the arena, screeching and thrashing in
  pain and terror.
