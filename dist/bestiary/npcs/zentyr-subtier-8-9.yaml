BeforeCombat: >-
  Zentyr is busy questioning Rand, trying his best to extract every ounce of
  information. Unless the alarm is sounded, he is unprepared for the combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zentyr moves into the shadows or uses his greater invisibility extract before
  distracting the PCs with a bottled gelatinous cube (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary
  138). He then drinks his mutagen (already applied to his statistics). He
  emerges from hiding and applies his best poisons to his blades before placing
  them in the back of a hapless PC.
Morale: Unafraid of failure, Zentyr fights to the death.
