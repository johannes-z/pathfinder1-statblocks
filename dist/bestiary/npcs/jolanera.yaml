SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Soul Conduit (Su)
    description: >-
      Jolanera has learned to weave the souls of her victims into an ectoplasmic
      planar conduit. Whenever she slays a living creature with at least 8 Hit
      Dice, she can activate this ability as an immediate action to create a
      conduit to the Negative Energy Plane that resembles a roiling black sheet
      centered on the victim's space. The area with a 5-foot radius of the
      conduit gains the major negative-dominant planar trait, and the area
      within a 50-foot radius gains the minor negative-dominant planar trait.
      The conduit closes after 1 day per Hit Die the victim possessed or if it
      is included in the area of a dimensional lock spell. As long as two
      conduits create overlapping minor negative-dominant zones, the area of
      overlap is a major negative-dominant zone. A soul affected by this ability
      is impossible to restore to life until the conduit is closed, and even
      then, it can be revived only with resurrection, true resurrection,
      miracle, or wish.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Jolanera summons shadows and casts haste on herself and the shadows before
  facing a potentially dangerous foe. She prefers to lure living foes into the
  area of a soul conduit.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jolanera kills foes as quickly as possible, focusing on physically frail or
  summoned creatures if she feels confident their souls can power a soul
  conduit. If possible, she uses her shadows to mob and distract a single
  dangerous foe or to threaten a vulnerable creature with allies. She favors
  casting dimensional anchor on creatures she has pinned down, particularly
  living foes in a negative-dominant zone.
Morale: Jolanera flees to regroup if reduced to 56 hit points while sickened by light.
