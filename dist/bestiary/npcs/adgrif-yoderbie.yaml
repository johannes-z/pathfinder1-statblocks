SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Natural Invisibility (Ex)
    description: >-
      As Adgrif's invisibility is inherent, it is not subject to invisibility
      purge or dispel magic.
  - name: Madness (Ex)
    description: >-
      At the beginning of any combat round, Adgrif must make a DC 15 Will save
      or be confused for 1 round. Permanent Spells Adgrif benefits from
      permanent darkvision, resistance, and see invisibility spells. In
      addition, he has had permanent invisibility placed on his armor and
      dagger, so that he can wear and wield these tools without becoming
      partially visible.
