Source: PFS S5-23
DuringCombat: >-
  During the first round of combat, Maravan uses his arcane pool to make his
  rapier a +2 frost keen rapier, and casts shield. (The modifiers for this are
  included in his stat block.) If there are already foes in melee range, he does
  this using spell combat and makes a melee attack. As soon as possible
  afterward he casts haste, then mirror image, then displacement. If his
  displacement is dispelled, he casts blur. He uses spell strike to deliver his
  ray spells (with the close range magus arcana), using scorching ray on the
  toughest looking foe in melee, and ray of exhaustion and ray of enfeeblement
  on the melee foe doing the most damage. He uses true strike on heavily armored
  foes he has already missed. When out of other spells he uses spell strike with
  shocking grasp then acid splash to get two melee attacks a round (one with the
  extra spell damage).
