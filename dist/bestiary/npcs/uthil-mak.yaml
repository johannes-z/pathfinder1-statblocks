SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Shadow Blending (Su)
    description: >-
      Attacks against a fetchling in dim light have a 50% miss chance instead of
      the normal 20% miss chance. This ability does not grant total concealment;
      it just increases the miss chance.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Uthil Mak is engaged fully in his ritual and does nothing to prepare for the
  PCs' arrival. If they are exceptionally loud or he is otherwise alerted to
  their presence, he drinks his potion of shield of faith before continuing the
  rite.
DuringCombat: >-
  The fetchling backs against a wall or the Wightir Conjunction to avoid being
  flanked and fights any comers. He uses flurry of blows as often as possible,
  spending ki to add an extra attack when possible. If he takes more than 15
  points of damage, he spends ki to increase his AC instead.
Morale: Uthil Mak fights to the death.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of shield of faith
OtherGear: ceremonial dagger, bracers of armor +1, cloak of resistance +1
