    description: >-
      While underwater, as a free action, a Varisian hagfish can secrete a mucus
      that transforms a 5-foot cube of water into a transparent cloud of viscous
      slime. This slime is the aquatic equivalent of rough terrain, and
      creatures swimming through it expend 2 squares of movement. The slime
      cloud remains for 10 rounds before dissipating. Hagfish are unaffected by
      these slime clouds. The slime also grants the hagfish a +4 bonus on
      grapple checks.
