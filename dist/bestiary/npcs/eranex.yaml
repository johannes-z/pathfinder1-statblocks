Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Should evil intruders threaten her lair, Eranex casts protection from evil on
  herself, then hides in a concealed position behind a crag or in a remote
  cavern chamber. Her various draconic and fey-granted spell-like abilities make
  evasion easy, and she does her best to stay hidden from would-be assassins
  until she can lay them low with a single surprise blow.
DuringCombat: >-
  Eranex is prepared for battle with both undead and humanoid intruders, casting
  spells such as disrupt undead or halt undead to deal with the former and
  breathing gouts of cold against other foes. Fey present more of a problem, but
  Eranex is not afraid to go toe to toe with these capricious enemies by first
  casting bull's strength and then hurling herself into melee.
Morale: >-
  Eranex knows she must attempt to fulfill Shyka's demands, but realizes death
  would be an even worse fate. If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, she
  retreats to plot her retaliatory strike.
