BeforeCombat: >-
  Dahaaka casts barkskin, freedom of movement, and greater magic fang on
  herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Dahaaka fights from behind her allies, using spells such as empowered ball
  lightning and empowered  chill metal to weaken opponents wearing metal armor.
  Against large groups of foes, she prefers area effect spells such as cone of
  cold and ice storm. If her enemies use acid or fire against her, Dahaaka casts
  protection from energy or resist energy to protect herself. Although she has
  some ability to heal her allies if they are injured, Dahaaka prefers to use
  her actions in combat to eliminate enemies and patch up any surviving allies
  afterward.
Morale: >-
  Although smarter than most scrags, Dahaaka is recklessly overconfident in her
  ability to survive combat. If Dahaaka is defeated but later revives due to her
  regeneration, she attempts to flee using wild shape.
Gear: >-

  mistletoe, pouch of exotic shells (worth 410 gp), spell component pouch
