BeforeCombat: >-
  If Toff is threatened with violence, he calls upon several students to him for
  assistance, but in the chaos and in the face of the PCs' accusations, none
  come to the headmaster's aid. If he sees conflict as inevitable or is pushed
  to his breaking point, Toff starts casting spells as
DuringCombat: >-
  outlined in  below.  Toff is no war wizard, but he firmly believes that a mage
  of his stature should have the ability to end any fight with force. He begins
  combat by casting quickened shield, quickened bear's endurance, and quickened
  fireball, bolstering these spells with offensive spells as standard actions.
  He allocates the +4 bonus from his defending quarterstaff to his AC each
  round. While he has prepared several spells with metamagic applied, he may
  also quicken one spell of 4th level or lower or heighten any spell at will
  with his metamagic mastery ability.
Morale: >-
  One doesn't become headmaster of a prestigious arcane academy without some
  sense, and Toff knows when he's beaten. If fighting without any support from
  his colleagues, he surrenders and acquiesces to his attackers' demands when
  reduced below 30 hit points.
Gear: >-
  +4 defending quarterstaff (bonded item), blessed book (contains all 0-level
  spells, all prepared spells and 400 additional spell levels' worth of randomly
  determined spells), bracers of armor +5, ring of protection +3, spell
