    description: >-
      Since a cask creature looks like normal sludge when at rest, a DC 20
      Perception check is required to notice it before it attacks for the first
      time. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (dungeoneering) can use
      either of those skills instead of Perception to notice the ooze.
  - name: Cold Immunity (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cask creature hit by a cold-based attack takes no damage. However, if
      the amount of damage it would have otherwise taken exceeds its
      Constitution score, the cask creature is slowed (as the slow spell) for
      1d6 rounds.
