    description: >-
      Lucretia was given unlife by Asmodeus himself as part of Cadimus's
      desperate plea to "save his sister." She is not required to return to her
      coffin unless she's reduced to 0 hit points. She loses the children of the
      night, change self, and create spawn abilities, but gains slay living as a
      spell-like ability and the ability to summon barbed devils to aid her,
      along with immunity to fire.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Once she attacks, Lucretia uses her infernally granted spell-like abilities,
  first attempting to summon devils and then using slay living on any targets
  that don't look hearty. She attempts to dominate healers, resorting to her
  melee attacks only once these other options are exhausted.
Morale: >-
  Lucretia fights until destroyed, at which point she becomes gaseous and
  retreats to her coffin at area C. If her coffin has been destroyed, she
  perishes soon thereafter.
Gear: >-
  gown of resistance +4 (functions as a cloak of resistance +4 that takes the
  body item slot), ring of protection +3, medusa head amulet (this amulet is one
  of the items needed to attune the teleporter at area H1), funerary baton
