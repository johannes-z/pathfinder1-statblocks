Source: The Midnight Mirror
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bristles (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tenebrous creature's head is covered in many small filaments that inject
      a deadly poison into any living creature that comes into contact with
      them. An opponent attacking a tenebrous creature with natural weapons or
      unarmed attacks must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or contact the many
      bristles that cover the tenebrous creature's head and be subjected to its
      poison. On a failed Reflex save, the opponent is paralyzed for 1d4 rounds.
      Immediately after the paralysis wears off, the opponent must succeed at a
      DC 20 Fortitude save or take 2d6 Str damage. A neutralize poison spell
      removes the effects of the poison and, if cast before an opponent makes
      its Fortitude save, prevents the need for such. Creatures with resistance
      to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws, and creatures
      immune to poison are unaffected by a tenebrous creature's bristles.
  - name: Regeneration (Ex)
    description: >-
      Only damage dealt by a shard of the midnight mirror can suppress the
      Heart's regeneration ability. If the Heart would normally be killed by a
      different effect, it returns to life and full health after 1d4 hours.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The Heart is aware of everything that happens within the midnight mirror and
  cannot be surprised.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Heart is immobile and nearly mindless, so it fights using only rudimentary
  tactics, biting PCs and striking them with its tentacles until they leave its
  courtyard.
Morale: >-
  The Heart is inexorably connected to the demiplane of the midnight mirror and
  has no alternative but to fight until destroyed. If the Heart is reduced to 0
  or fewer hit points while its regeneration ability still functions, it takes
  1d4 hours to regenerate to its full capabilities and does not actively attack
  or waylay the PCs in any way during this time.
