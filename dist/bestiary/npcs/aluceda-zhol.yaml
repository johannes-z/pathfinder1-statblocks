SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Shadow Chains (Sp)
    description: >-
      When Aluceda uses her touch of darkness ability, she manifests shadowy
      chains that increase the reach of her touch attack by 5 feet. A creature
      struck by this attack must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex save or be entangled
      for 1d4 rounds in addition to the normal effects of the ability.
  - name: Shadow Jump (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as the shadowdancer ability of the same name.
      Tenebrous Magic Aluceda receives the Tenebrous Spell feat as a bonus feat
      and can apply its effects without increasing the spell's level (all of her
      spells have been enhanced by this feat). This feat (detailed on page 15 of
      Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic) boosts a spell's effective
      caster level and save DCs by 1 when the spell is cast in darkness or dim
      light, and attempts to dispel such a spell take a -2 penalty (double these
      modifiers if the spell has the darkness or shadow descriptor or is of the
      shadow subschool). She must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + 2
      x spell's level) to cast such a spell in bright light, and attempts to
      dispel such a spell in bright light gain a +4 bonus.
  - name: Umbral Courtier (Ex)
    description: >-
      Aluceda gains a +4 competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Knowledge
      (nobility) checks&#8211; these bonuses are included in her statistics
      above.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Aluceda casts air walk, magic vestment, spell resistance, and shield of faith
  before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Aluceda uses air walk to stay away from melee, then uses ranged spells on
  foes; she starts with a summon monster V and follows with other spells
  thereafter, but tries to stay within 30 feet of at least one PC so she can
  attempt to dominate that PC with her gaze if the opportunity presents itself.
  She uses touch spells in melee, but often holds the charge and then delivers
  them with her slam attack so she can use energy drain  on foes at the same
  time. If Corinstian is defeated, she alerts Barzillai with a sending unless
  the inquisitor has already joined the fight, then retreats to area E9 to join
  her minions there.
Morale: >-
  Aluceda fights until destroyed, then becomes gaseous and retreats to her
  closest coffin (in area E9).
Gear: wand of enervation (9 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +2 glamered studded leather, cloak of fangsUE, glove of storing, headband of
  mental prowess +2 (Wis, Cha)
