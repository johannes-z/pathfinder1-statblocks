    description: >-
      Mparu gains a +1 bonus on Fly and Swim checks and never needs to attempt
      concentration checks because of natural weather. She has electricity and
      sonic resistance 5. Storm-Lashed This feat grants Mparu a +2 bonus on all
      saving throws against electricity effects. In rainy conditions, her
      visibility is reduced only by one-quarter (not by half) and she takes only
      a -2 penalty on Perception checks as a result of these conditions. She is
      treated as Large for the purposes of resolving wind effects, and she
      halves any penalty to Perception caused by high winds.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Mparu has no gear-all of her equipment (including her holy symbol) have been
  taken from her by the skum. This gear can be found in area D6. Without her
  belongings, Mparu is forced to rely upon her domain abilities and attempts to
  flee combat as soon as possible. With her gear, she aids allies with healing
  and protective spells, but she avoids direct confrontation.
Morale: Mparu flees combat via air walk if reduced to fewer than 20 hit points.
