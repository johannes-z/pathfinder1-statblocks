SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Body Blades (Ex)
    description: >-
      Spikes and blades cover the siege serpent's body. When another creature
      attacks it with handheld or natural weapons, the attacker takes 1d8 points
      of slashing and piercing damage. Incorporeal creatures and creatures using
      weapons with exceptional reach do not take this damage. A siege serpent
      also deals 1d8 points of piercing and slashing damage to a grabbed
      opponent with each successful grapple check.
  - name: Enlarged Attacks (Ex)
    description: >-
      Each of the siege serpent's bite attacks deal damage as it were two size
      categories larger.
  - name: Metal Body (Ex)
    description: >-
      Beneath its skin, a siege serpent is largely composed of metal. It counts
      as a ferrous creature for the purposes of rusting grasp and other spells
      that have special effects on metal.
  - name: Sprint (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per hour, a siege serpent can move up to 10 times its normal speed
      when it charges.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3
      Con; cure 1 save.
DuringCombat: >-
  The siege serpents move to protect Nazith- Yol, lashing out at anyone
  attempting to move past them to attack the wizard. They employ bite and
  grapple attacks whenever possible to bring their body blades to bear.
Morale: The siege serpents fight until commanded to stop or until they are destroyed.
