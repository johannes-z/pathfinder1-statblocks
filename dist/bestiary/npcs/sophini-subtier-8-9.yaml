SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blackfire Eruption (Sp)
    description: >-
      Sophini can sacrifice a prepared spell of 4th level or lower to call forth
      a searing ebon vortex that acts like unholy blight, it ignores the
      hardness of objects. A creature slain or an object destroyed by a
      blackfire eruption is reduced to ash as by the disintegrate spell. This is
      a conjuration effect.
  - name: Blackfire Pact (Su)
    description: >-
      Sophini gains a +1 profane bonus on saving throws, caster level checks,
      Charisma checks, and Charisma-based skill checks against divs. She gains a
      +2 profane bonus on such rolls against daemons.
  - name: Blackfire Taint (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Sophini can create a destructive resonance between
      herself and a target within 30 feet. She gains a +2 profane bonus on
      attack rolls and caster level checks against the target, and the target
      takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against Sophini's attacks (&#8211;3 if
      the attack is a conjuration effect). The taint lasts for 6 rounds, though
      a successful DC 16 Will save reduces this to 1 round. The effect ends
      immediately if the target moves more than 30 feet away from Sophini.
  - name: Breaching (Su)
    description: >-
      When Sophini attempts to call or summon a daemon or div into an area where
      summoning is blocked by a magical effect (such as magic circle against
      evil), or when a daemon or div within 30 feet she had summoned would have
      its attacks against a creature blocked by such an effect, as a swift
      action she can sacrifice a prepared spell of the same level as the warding
      effect. If her caster level is higher than the caster level of the warding
      effect, it is immediately negated. If it is the same level or lower, a
      caster level check (DC 11 + the caster level of the warding) is required
      to negate the effect.
  - name: Expanded Summoning List (Su)
    description: >-
      Sophini is able to summon a vargouille with summon monster III, and she
      can summon a yeth hound with summon monster IV. These are in addition to
      her normal options when casting summon monster spells.
Gender: Female
ProhibitedSchools: necromancy, transmutation
BeforeCombat: >-
  Sophini casts mage armor, mirror image, heroism, see invisibility,
  invisibility sphere, and shield when she senses trouble, such as if she sees a
  blackfire candle glowing or hears an alarm. She then continues her
  interrogation of Jahani while both she and the Riftwarden are invisible.
DuringCombat: >-
  Sophini summons allies while invisible and then employs a combination of area
  control spells and offensive spells to divide and strike down her enemies. She
  makes regular use of her shift arcane school ability to stay out of reach.
Morale: >-
  If Sophini is reduced below 40 hit points but believes that she still has many
  allies in the compound, she cast dimension door to rally the ceustodaemons and
  guards to attack while she spends several rounds recuperating. She then renews
  the attack. If Sophini has reason to believe that her allies were defeated,
  she fights until she's reduced to 20 or fewer hit points before using
  dimension door to teleport away.
