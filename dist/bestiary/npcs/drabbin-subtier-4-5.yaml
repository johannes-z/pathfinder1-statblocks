BeforeCombat: >-
  If Drabbin is aware of the PCs' approach from the moat, he spends a full round
  putting on his cleats to allow for better movement on the ice. If he still has
  time to prepare or the PCs approach from another part of the temple, he
  applies his oil of magic weapon to his short sword.
DuringCombat: >-
  Drabbin tries to flank with one of his Ulfen compatriots whenever possible,
  but settles for attacking from range if the PCs are dealing too much damage in
  melee.
Morale: >-
  If either twin falls in combat, Drabbin uses his darkness spell-like ability
  to grant himself concealment and attempts to escape, throwing his thunderstone
  at any PCs giving chase, both to deafen them and to alert his allies in area
  A5 of the Pathfinders' assault.
Gear: oil of magic weapon, potion of cure light wounds, thunderstone
OtherGear: >-
  +1 studded leather, masterwork short sword, daggers (5), cleats*, cold weather
