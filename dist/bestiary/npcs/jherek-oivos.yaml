SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Native Hermean (Ex)
    description: >-
      Generations of selective breeding have given natives of the island of
      Hermea numerous beneficial traits, making them shining examples of their
      races. A native Hermean PC uses the purchase method to determine ability
      scores and the high fantasy point allotment (see Pathfinder RPG Core
      Rulebook 15).
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Jherek rejects the idea of a fair fight, and if he can't talk his way out of
  combat using Diplomacy or charm person, he attempts to hide in order to
  surprise his opponents with a sneak attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  Though he enjoys a friendly duel as much as the next person, Jherek takes his
  mission too seriously to risk himself needlessly and uses spring attack to
  stay out of reach, sneak attacking surprised or flanked foes. Against nongood
  foes, his natural prejudice shows through, and he has no qualms about using
  lethal force against "inferior specimens."
Morale: >-
  Jherek retreats if brought below 10 hit points, preferring to ambush his prey
  later.
