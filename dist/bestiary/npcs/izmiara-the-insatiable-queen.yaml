IsTemplate: '0'
BeforeCombat: >-
  Given time to prepare, Izmiara mounts Bth-Zgragg and hovers above her bed in
  the center of the chamber. As she waits for the PCs to breach her prismatic 
  wall, she casts protection from law and activates her fiendish boon to add the
  anarchic and keen special abilities to Iron Lash.
DuringCombat: >-
  Izmiara begins combat by using her sword's finger of death attack at range,
  then directs her mount into combat. She hurls herself into battle with all her
  might, releasing her best powers as soon as she can. Aura of vengeance is
  followed by cruelties and her touch of corruption. She only uses her kiss
  attack on those who have fallen but whom she wishes to keep alive, intending
  to make them pay over long decades for any blemish upon her perfect body.
Morale: >-
  Confident in her abilities, the Insatiable Queen does not sully herself by
  surrendering to mortals. She knows that her plans are still far from complete
  and teleports away to another location in the Moonscar should she be reduced
  to fewer than 50 hit points, sacrificing her pride for the ability to continue
  working her sinister machinations to herald Nocticula's apotheosis.
Gear: >-
  +4 unrighteous full plate*, +2 heavy steel shield, Iron Lash (see sidebar),
  belt of physical perfection +4, helm of abhorrent charisma +2 (as headband of
  alluring charisma), ring of freedom of movement
