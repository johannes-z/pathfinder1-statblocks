BeforeCombat: >-
  Prior to infiltrating the Pathfinder Lodge, each cultist uses a scroll of
  magic vestment to protect himself and a scroll of status to remain aware of
  one another's condition. They also use death knell against the servants and
  guards they slay. Once alerted by the activation of the glyph of warding at
  the gate (or after observing anyone bypassing it), they cast deathwatch,
  eagle's splendor, and shield of faith on themselves and place blast runes in
  the squares around them, preparing for an attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  With the power of deathwatch to aid them, the cultists fire poisoned bolts at
  any PC that avoided damage from the sound burst. Then, they continue sniping
  at intruders to draw them to the blast runes in front of them. Thereafter,
  they draw their scimitars and channel negative energy to wear down opponents,
  trusting in their status effect to warn their colleagues inside the lodge.
Morale: >-
  The cultists retreat to area 3 after falling below 20 hit points so they can
  cast meld into stone and buy time to heal themselves before renewing the
  attack.
