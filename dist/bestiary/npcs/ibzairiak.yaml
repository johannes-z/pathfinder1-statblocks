    description: >-
      Ibzairiak is faster and leaner than most young adult black dragons,
      increasing his Dexterity score by 2 but lowering his Strength score by an
      equal amount.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ibzairiak loves guile and misdirection. He casts alarm each day on the stairs
  leading up to his lair. If alerted to a trespasser, he bellows a threat but
  quietly hides in one corner of the room, out of view of the stairs, and casts
  silent image to create an illusion of himself sitting in his pool. He hopes
  intruders will waste resources attacking this illusion before he strikes.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ibzairiak hates a fair fight. He begins any confrontation by unleashing his
  breath weapon and then casting darkness to confuse and terrify his opponents.
  He takes advantage of his speed and reach to strike with a powerful bite and
  then fall back, even dragging  a fight with especially tenacious foes into the
  courtyard. If he injures an opponent so badly that it seems a single melee
  attack might drop her, he ceases attacks against that foe and bellows, "Flee,
  whelp, to nurse the wounds the Scar-Maker gave you." If a gravely injured foe
  chooses to fight on, the dragon shows no mercy.
Morale: Ibzairiak arrogantly fights to the death.
