DuringCombat: >-
  Dolland fights defensively, drinking a shield extract on the first round of
  combat and then using fire breath on the second round while trying to make his
  way to allies. If reduced to 15 hit points or less, he drinks an extract of
  invisibility and then attempts to retreat, heal, and regroup after gathering
  allies. If no allies remain to be found, he'll cut his losses entirely and
  flee the area to join Corstela at Peacock Manor.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 7 or fewer hit points, Dolland drops his weapon and begs for
  mercy, promising to tell the PCs what they need to know if they let him live.
  He tries to escape as soon as he can, though, fleeing to Peacock Manor if he
  gets away.
