  - name: Split (Ex)
    description: >-
      An amphisbaena functions normally even if cut in half. If dealt a critical
      hit with a slashing weapon, the creature is cut in half but continues to
      function as two separate creatures, each with half the original
      amphisbaena's current hit points (rounded down). Once split, an
      amphisbaena cannot be split again. If left alone for 1 minute, the split
      amphisbaena can rejoin its two halves and become a single whole creature
      again (add the two creatures' hit points together). If one of the split
      creatures is slain, the amphisbaena can regrow the lost portion over the
      course of a few weeks.
DuringCombat: >-
  The amphisbaena ignores anyone who comes even to the very edge of this vast
  pool, but swiftly moves to attack anything that enters the water&#8211;it
  prefers larger targets over smaller ones, given the option.
Morale: The amphisbaena fights to the death.
