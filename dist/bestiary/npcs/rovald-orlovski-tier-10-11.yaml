BeforeCombat: >-
  Rovald begins every adventuring day by casting mage armor and false life (both
  are reflected in his stat block). If he is aware of the PCs, he casts shield,
  stoneskin, and, if time permits, bless. If he has the opportunity without
  tipping his hand, he casts dominate person or suggestion on a PC to gain an
  ally among his possible foes.
DuringCombat: >-
  Rovald casts haste in the first round of combat, then stays out of melee at
  all costs. He prefers confusion, hold person, and hideous laughter as his
  primary combat spells, but uses burning hands, scorching ray, and touch of
  idiocy when prompted by the situation.
Morale: >-
  Rovald is extremely sure of himself, and despite his frailty and weakness,
  believes the PCs to be only a minor threat. He fights to the death, refusing
  to believe the PCs could best one of his social and arcane standing.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure serious wounds, scroll of alter self, scroll of make whole,
  wand of false life (20 charges), wand of stoneskin (6 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork darkwood quarterstaff, masterwork light crossbow with 20 bolts,
  cloak of resistance +2, elixir of truth, ring of protection +1, noble's
  outfit, everburning torch, 50 gp
