Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  The trolls fight with their +2 ranseurs through the narrow windows as long as
  they can, gaining a +4 cover bonus to their AC and on Reflex saves against
  foes attacking them from the central passageway. As soon as anyone manages to
  get into one of the side caves, they drop their ranseurs and continue the
  fight with their claws and teeth. The trolls do not coordinate their attacks
  in any way, simply fighting as long as they can.
Morale: >-
  These brutish trolls trust their regeneration implicitly to keep them alive.
  They fight to the death, even in the face of foes who use acid and fire.
