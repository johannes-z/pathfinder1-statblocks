SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Thick Hide (Ex)
    description: >-
      The abominable snowmen of the Kodars have thicker fur and hides than most
      yetis-their base natural armor bonus is +14 and they possess damage
      reduction 10/ piercing as a result.
DuringCombat: >-
  The abominable snowmen lack subtlety in combat&#8211;their roars and bellowing
  charges are as close as they get to organized tactics. Each snowman picks one
  target to attack, doubling up only if there aren't enough victims to go
  around.
Morale: >-
  The snowmen fight to the death to protect their lair but do not pursue foes
  farther than 500 feet from its edge.
