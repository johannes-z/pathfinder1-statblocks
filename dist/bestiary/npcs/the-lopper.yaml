SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Siphoning (Su)
    description: >-
      The Lopper's incorporeal touch attacks deal negative energy damage, but
      the wounds thus created manifest as deep, bloody cuts, as if dealt by a
      razor-sharp hatchet. These wounds cause 1d6 bleed-any damage caused by
      this bleed effect heals the Lopper of an equal amount of damage as the
      blood running from the wound turns to smoke and drifts over to the
      Lopper's body to merge with his form, provided that the bleeding victim is
      within 30 feet of the Lopper. Hit points gained in excess of his maximum
      are lost.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures slain by the Lopper become ectoplasmic undead 1d4 rounds after
      death, with draining blood forming the bulk of the new undead's body.
      Ectoplasmic undead created in this manner are under the Lopper's command;
      if the Lopper is destroyed, the ectoplasmic undead become free-willed.
  - name: Decapitation (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature slain by the Lopper's incorporeal touch is always decapitated.
      The resulting gout of blood created by this grisly triumph heals the
      Lopper of 2d6 points of damage.
  - name: Fear of Fire (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although the Lopper is normally immune to fear effects as a result of his
      undead state, he remembers the terror of the great fire vividly. If he is
      successfully damaged by any fire-based attack, he is staggered for 1
      round.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  The Lopper moves with a calm grace, never staying still and drifting from
  target to target each round, using Acrobatics to avoid attacks of opportunity.
  He attempts to keep as many victims wounded and bleeding as possible, since he
  can only gain 1d6 points of healing per bleeding victim.
Morale: >-
  The Lopper fights to the death, pursuing foes as far as Harrowstone's
  boundaries if necessary (although he won't pursue fleeing PCs outside during
  the day).
