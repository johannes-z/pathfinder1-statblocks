BeforeCombat: >-
  Prowlers prefer to attack from ambush, often sending one of their own out
  alone to play at being lost and provoke victims into chasing him back to his
  concealed allies.
DuringCombat: >-
  Prowlers pepper their foes with arrows, ideally from cover, but are adept
  melee fighters once  their prey closes in. They always use Power Attack in
  melee. They reserve their potions of bull's strength for fights against larger
  dangers or superior numbers.
Morale: These forest prowlers fight to the death.
