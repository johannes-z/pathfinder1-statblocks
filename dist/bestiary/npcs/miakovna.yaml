SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Wisdom Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A lamia matriarch drains 1d4 points of Wisdom each time she hits with her
      melee touch attack. The first time each round that she strikes a foe with
      a melee weapon, she also drains 1 point of Wisdom. A DC 23 Will save
      negates the Wisdom drain. Unlike with other kinds of ability drain
      attacks, a lamia matriarch does not heal damage when she uses her Wisdom
      drain. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: Arcane
BeforeCombat: >-
  Miakovna casts mage armor daily. As soon as she is warned by one of her alarm
  spells going off, she casts invisibility and slithers up to the top of the
  north-central pillar. She then casts the following spells in order: stoneskin,
  shield of faith, bull's strength, mirror image, extended divine favor, and
  extended haste. If she hears the PCs attempting to enter the chamber before
  she is prepared, she creates a major image as described above and continues
  preparing, using her ventrilloquism spell-like ability to throw her voice
  elsewhere in the room as she casts spells, and recasting major image as needed
  to keep the distraction going.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once all her spells are in place, she draws her whip and drops down to attack
  with both weapons, using the whip to trip opponents at range while slashing at
  closer foes with her scimitar. She stays in melee until she loses 50 or more
  hit points, at which point she climbs a pillar, recasts invisibility, and
  slithers around interlocking wings of Lissala's idols to keep her position
  hidden while healing and recasting protective spells. If presented with one
  particularly formidable opponent, Miakovna uses charm monster or suggestion to
  try and get the PC to leave combat.
Morale: >-
  When reduced to 30 or fewer hit points, Miakovna attempts to flee, swimming
  straight across the pool and racing up through the levels of the temple
  complex. As soon as she is out of sight of the PCs, she uses her change  shape
  ability, hoping that if the PCs catch her in this form, they'll assume it is
  another distraction and leave her alone.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds
OtherGear: >-
  +1 scimitar, +1 whip, ring of counterspells (invisibility purge), silver holy
  symbol, 700 gp worth of diamond dust
