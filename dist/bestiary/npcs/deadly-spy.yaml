BeforeCombat: >-
  The rogue understands that fighting and killing raises too many questions, and
  thus uses Diplomacy and Bluff to avoid combat and maintain his cover if at all
  possible.
DuringCombat: >-
  The rogue prefers to use sneak attacks and disarm combat maneuvers against his
  opponents, and flees if he can get away safely. If any who are present can
  identify him as a spy&#8211;or if their continued existence is against the
  interests of his shadowy paymasters&#8211;he strikes to kill.
