BeforeCombat: >-
  The Horned Hunter casts greater magic fang on his horns every day. Before
  entering battle, he casts barkskin and cat's grace on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Horned Hunter always uses Deadly Aim in battle, and prefers to use Rapid
  Shot as often as he can. On the first round of combat, he grants his favored
  enemy bonus to his ettins via his hunter's bond. Although his natural
  inclination is to fire upon humans before any other target, if it's obvious
  who's carrying Briar, he and his ettins focus their attacks on that target.
  The Horned Hunter's not really interested in slaying the entire party as much
  as he is in capturing Briar. If the person carrying Briar is defeated, the
  Horned Hunter claims the sword as soon as he can, teleporting to the Castle of
  Knives after claiming the sword (or the body of the PC he suspects carries
  it), and then stepping through the portal that has opened at the castle and
  into Thousandbreaths, at which point he makes his way to the House at the Edge
  of Time to present the sword to his mistress. See Part Three for details on
  what happens if Nyrissa reclaims Briar.
Morale: >-
  The Horned Hunter fights to the death in his pursuit of Briar, but once he has
  the sword, he flees as detailed above.
Gear: >-
  +3 leather armor, +3 seeking composite longbow with 20 arrows, greater bracers
  of archery, helm of teleportation
