    description: >-
      Rima's advanced pregnancy affects her encumbrance as if she were carrying
      a medium load.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Rima's Reflex save bonus, Improved Lightning Reflexes, and evasion help her
  endure Aeteperax's breath weapon, but she remains in danger as long as the
  dragon lives&#8211;unless the PCs keep the dragon's attention focused
  elsewhere. As the combat continues, she attacks the dragon if she gets the
  chance. The first time she does so, treat Aeteperax as flat-footed against
  this unexpected attack&#8211;if she hits, she deals sneak attack damage. Even
  after Rima's strike, though, the dragon focuses his attacks on the PCs as long
  as they still live.
Morale: >-
  Rima fights bravely, but if she's reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, she
  attempts to escape combat.
