SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alignment Variation (Ex)
    description: >-
      Soulbound dolls have an alignment-dependent spell-like ability usable once
      per day; those of neutral evil alignment can cast inflict serious wounds.
  - name: Bloodline Arcana (Su)
    description: >-
      When you cast a spell with the cold descriptor, increase the spell's save
      DC by 1.
  - name: Cold Steel (Sp)
    description: >-
      You can touch a weapon or up to 50 pieces of ammunition as a standard
      action, giving the weapon or ammunition the frost special ability for a
      number of rounds equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level (minimum 1).
  - name: Icewalker (Ex)
    description: >-
      You gain cold resistance 5 and can move across snow and icy surfaces
      without penalty and without leaving tracks.
  - name: Soul Focus (Su)
    description: >-
      The soul bound to the doll lives within a focus integrated into the
      doll-in this case, a gem embedded into its chest. As long as this soul
      focus remains intact, it can be used to animate another doll, using the
      same cost as creating a new construct. Once bound into the soul focus, the
      soul continues to learn, and so if later it is put into a new doll body,
      the soul retains its personality and memories from its previous body or
      bodies. A soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break DC of 20.
      Susceptible to Mind-Affecting
  - name: Effects (Ex)
    description: >-
      The weakened conviction of a soulbound doll's soul makes it susceptible to
      mind-affecting effects, despite the fact that it is a construct
Bloodline: Boreal*
BeforeCombat: >-
  If the doll has time to prepare while the PCs aren't aware it's alive, it
  casts shield. Then just before combat, it uses its cold steel ability to grant
  its dagger the frost special ability for 2 rounds.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Irrisen Guardian Doll initiates combat by casting inflict serious wounds
  on whichever PC the doll sees as the largest threat, which is generally the PC
  who attacked it or investigated it first. The doll then uses its levitate
  spell-like ability to move out of melee range, hoping its connection to the
  jadwiga will bring reinforcements while it uses ranged magical attacks to
  bring down the PCs.
Morale: >-
  The Irrisen Guardian Doll is tasked with a single duty&#8211;to watch and
  protect the nation's borders&#8211;and it fights until destroyed to uphold
  that order.
