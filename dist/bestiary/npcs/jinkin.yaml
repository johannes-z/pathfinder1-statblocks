SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Tinkering (Su)
    description: >-
      A group of 6 jinkins, working together over the course of an hour, can
      create an effect identical to bestow curse (CL 6th; target must either be
      willing or helpless). The save DC is set by the jinkin with the highest
      Charisma score, and is equal to 14 plus that Charisma modifier (DC 16 for
      most groups of jinkins). Alternatively, the six jinkins can attempt to
      infuse a magic item with a curse-the nature of the curse is determined
      randomly. Half the time the curse simply makes the magic item unreliable
      so that there's a 20% chance each time it's used that it simply doesn't
      work, but the remainder of the time the curse creates a randomly
      determined drawback (see page 538 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). A
      jinkin can take part in a tinkering only once per day, and may only tinker
      with a creature or object that isn't already cursed. Once a tinkering
      curse is in place, it is permanent until removed.
DuringCombat: >-
  The jinkins rely on flanking PCs (with each other or the Deathgorger) so they
  can make sneak attacks in combat. If the PCs have used compost on themselves,
  the canny jinkins can use prestidigitation to clean the filth off of the PCs.
  (A PC can resist this unusual use of prestidigitation by making a DC 12 Reflex
  save-and swift-thinking PCs can use this tactic against the jinkins in
  return!)
Morale: >-
  A wounded jinkin immediately flees from the cave and into the surrounding
  wilds.
