BeforeCombat: >-
  The monk drinks his potions of mage armor and bear's endurance and tries to
  find a choke point where he can stand fast and hold off his enemies.
DuringCombat: >-
  If he can control an opening such as a doorway, the monk does his best not to
  move or let others past. He uses Vital Strike whenever he cannot use flurry of
  blows. He uses Improved Bull Rush on any opponent that has failed its saving
  throw versus Scorpion Style, trying to remove it from direct combat. He trips
  those adjacent to him so he can make attacks of opportunity when they stand up
  from prone. Against a single opponent, the steadfast defender uses his ki pool
  to add extra attacks to his flurry of blows; against multiple opponents he
  uses it to improve his Armor Class.
