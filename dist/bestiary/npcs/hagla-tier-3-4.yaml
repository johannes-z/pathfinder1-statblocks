  If the captives are in the gallows, Hagla first kicks out the bench from
  underneath them. He then moves to block PCs from rescuing them using his Stand
  Still feat and making liberal use of Lunge and Power Attack. If the PCs catch
  Hagla unaware, he stands his ground unless the PCs all attack from a distance.
  If reduced to half his hit points, he threatens to coup de grace Greudemoffit
  or Ramenophesa, following through 1 round later.
Morale: >-

  avenge him.
