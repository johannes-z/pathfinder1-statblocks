    description: >-
      Morlocks dwell and fight in cramped quarters every day of their lives, and
      as such are quite adept at swarming foes. Up to two morlocks can share the
      same space at the same time. If two morlocks in the same space attack the
      same foe, they are considered to be flanking that foe as if they were in
      two opposite squares.
