BeforeCombat: >-
  Lareecan casts good hope on herself and her warbirds, and casts invisibility
  on one of her warbirds. Lareecan then readies her scroll of wall of stone and
  stays out of sight until the party responds to her warbird's song.
DuringCombat: >-
  If the PCs are lured into area E by her invisible warbird, Lareecan uses her
  scroll of wall of stone (Use Magic Device DC 25) to wall off the southern
  cavern, then casts haste on herself and her warbirds and uses inspire courage
  as a move action to boost her warbirds' attacks. She uses blindness/deafness
  to blind PCs with flight or ranged weapons. Should any PCs close with her, she
  casts hideous laughter or uses grease to disarm them. If one of her warbirds
  is seriously injured, Lareecan uses the scroll of heal to restore her subject.
  Once she has expended most of her spells, Lareecan either uses her captivating
  song to lure the PCs out of the fray, or switches to her bow.
Morale: If her warbirds are slain and she is clearly beaten, Lareecan flees.
