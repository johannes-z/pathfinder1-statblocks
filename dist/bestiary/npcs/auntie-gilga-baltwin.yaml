BeforeCombat: >-
  Not expecting a visitor, Auntie Baltwin casts guidance before answering the
  door. More likely than not, she expends the spell on her first Diplomacy or
  Bluff check. Not looking for a fight, Auntie Baltwin uses her social skills to
  negotiate this encounter, hoping to avoid detection, arrest, or violence.
DuringCombat: >-
  If pushed to fight, Auntie Baltwin uses her spells to incapacitate the PCs,
  starting with sleep. She uses command on any PC trying to attack or grab her.
  Otherwise, she screams for help while whacking the aggressive PCs with her
  cane or throwing a shoe at them, in hopes of stalling long enough for the
  district guard to come investigate. She can also have Pickles, her cat
  familiar, deliver touch of fatigue by brushing up against the PCs, then
  blending in with the dozen other cats in the room.
Morale: >-
  Auntie Gilga has no interest in dying and tries to escape using her potion of
  invisibility if the PCs become too violent. She immediately surrenders if
  reduced to fewer than half her hit points. Even after giving up, she still
  claims the PCs "started the whole thing."
Gear: >-
  potion of cure light wounds, potion of invisibility, scroll of cure light
  wounds, scroll of remove disease
