SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Black Cloud (Su)
    description: >-
      An achaierai can exhale a cloud of choking, toxic smoke three times per
      day. Any non-achaierai within 10 feet of the achaierai immediately takes
      2d6 points of damage as its tissues burn and melt and rot away. The cloud
      erodes sanity as well as flesh, and anyone who takes damage from the black
      cloud must also make a DC 15 Fortitude save or become confused. Every
      round, the victim may attempt another DC 15 Fortitude save to recover from
      the confusion; otherwise it persists, lasting indefinitely until the
      condition is removed or the victim eventually makes his saving throw. The
      confusion element of a black cloud is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The achaierais open combat with their black clouds, then close to engage the
  PCs in melee. They are smart enough to try to pin down foes within the
  confines of the razor sharp thorns when they can.
Morale: The achaierais fight to the death.
