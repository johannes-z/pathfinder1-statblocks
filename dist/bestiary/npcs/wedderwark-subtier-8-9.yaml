BeforeCombat: >-
  Wedderwark casts mage armor as soon as she hears the elevator moving, hides,
  and commands her minions to do the same. Finally, she casts shield as the
  elevator arrives.
DuringCombat: >-
  Wedderwark first casts silent glitterdust to confound as many foes as possible
  without revealing her position. She then uses confusion, deep slumber, or fear
  before wading into melee with frigid touch and natural attacks. She uses her
  trip ability to keep spellcasters prone and favors casting touch spells when
  she cannot manage a full attack.
Morale: >-
  Wedderwark attempts to parley in Undercommon if reduced to fewer than 30 hit
  points, and she casts vanish to flee if she fails to negotiate her peaceful
  surrender.

  potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of remove fear, scroll of shrink item,
  scroll of haste, wand of fear (4 charges), alchemist's fire, tanglefoot bag
OtherGear: >-
