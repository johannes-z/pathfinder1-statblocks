SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Integrated Stun Gun (Ex)
    description: >-
      A riot suppressor has a stun gun integrated into its left eye. It treats
      attacks with this weapon as natural attacks, and cannot make iterative
      attacks with it. An integrated stun gun can still be targeted by effects
      that target manufactured weapons, but cannot be harvested for use outside
      of the robot's body. An integrated stun gun does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity when it is fired. It deals 1d8 nonlethal damage on a hit, and
      can be fired as a semi-automatic weapon. On a successful critical hit, the
      robot can attempt a free trip combat maneuver check against the target;
      this attempt doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
  - name: Merciful Weapon (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any metal melee weapon wielded by a riot suppressor becomes charged with
      energy that deals an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage on a hit. A
      riot suppressor takes no penalty on attack rolls when it uses a melee
      weapon to deal nonlethal damage.
DuringCombat: >-
  Riot suppressors move directly into melee, attacking foes with their
  warhammers to deal nonlethal damage. When they make a full attack, they attack
  with the warhammer and the stun gun on semi-automatic fire, but the stun gun
  attacks resolve as secondary attacks and thus take a &#8211;5 penalty on
  attack rolls (this penalty is not included in the stats above).
Morale: Riot suppressors fight until destroyed.
