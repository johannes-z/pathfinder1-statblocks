SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Constructed (Ex)
    description: >-
      For the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as a
      ranger's favored enemy and bane weapons), androids count as both humanoids
      and constructs. Androids gain a +4 racial bonus on all saving throws
      against mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, and stun effects, are
      not subject to fatigue or exhaustion, and are immune to disease and sleep
      effects. Androids can never gain morale bonuses, and are immune to fear
      effects and all emotion-based effects.
  - name: Emotionless (Ex)
    description: >-
      Androids have problems processing emotions properly, and thus take a -4
      penalty on Sense Motive checks.
  - name: Nanite Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      An android's body is infused with nanites. Once per day as an immediate
      action, an android can cause his nanites to surge, granting a bonus equal
      to 3 + the android's character level on any one d20 roll; this ability
      must be activated before the roll is made. When an android uses this
      power, his circuitry-tattoos glow with light equivalent to that of a torch
      in illumination for 1 round.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Meleren avoids melee if possible, preferring to rely upon his alchemical gear
  and crossbow before resorting to his morningstar.
Morale: >-
  Meleren is not a bold combatant, and he attempts to surrender or flee the
  first time he takes damage. If Meleren has a positive Epiphany Point total
  (see Moments of Epiphany below), he fights until he has taken damage equal to
  more than twice his current number of Epiphany Point, at which point he
  surrenders or attempts to flee.
Gear: acid, alchemist's fire, tanglefoot bags (2), thunderstone
OtherGear: >-
  leather armor, +1 morningstar, heavy crossbow with 10 bolts, mwk thieves'
  tools, sunrod, tin amulet from area A5
