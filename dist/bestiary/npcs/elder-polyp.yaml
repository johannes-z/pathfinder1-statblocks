SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per hour, an elder polyp can eject the contents of its stomach,
      including any creatures it has swallowed. This action creates a 30-foot
      cone of acid that deals 12d6 points of acid damage (DC 23 Reflex save for
      half ). Once a polyp uses this attack, it must wait 1 hour before using it
      again. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Gnashing Maw (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a free action, an elder polyp can transfer a creature grappled by its
      tentacles to its toothed mouth and attempt to swallow that creature whole.
      Creatures in the polyp's mouth take 2d6+12 points of damage from the
      polyp's bite.
