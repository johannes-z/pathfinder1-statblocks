BeforeCombat: >-
  The monk attempts to get close to an opponent through Bluff or Diplomacy, then
  drinks her potions of bear's endurance and bull's strength.
DuringCombat: >-
  Against a single foe, the monk opens with Stunning Fist augmented with
  Improved Vital Strike, then tries to grapple the stunned foe. Against multiple
  opponents, she uses flurry of blows to attempt trip and disarm maneuvers,
  making as many foes prone or weaponless as possible, then strikes when those
  opponents provoke attacks of opportunity. Against foes too large to grapple or
  immune to stunning, she uses her ki pool to boost her movement, then Spring
  Attack with Improved Vital Strike to make hit and run attacks.
