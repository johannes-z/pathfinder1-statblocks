SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Glaistig Pretender (Su)
    description: >-
      Arlantia has performed numerous rituals on herself using Gendowyn's blood,
      trying to invest her with the glaistig's godlike nature. While her efforts
      have yet to grant her mythic power, she has gained a permanent +6 bonus to
      Charisma and a +2 natural armor bonus to her AC.
  - name: Harbinger of the Blight (Su)
    description: >-
      The Darkblight came to Golarion through Arlantia's infected body, and she
      retains a near-divine mastery over the fungal matter. She can cast
      quickened dominate monster, but only on creatures with the blighted fey
      template. She can also use scry and sending at will as spell-like
      abilities, but only in landscapes infested with the Darkblight. In any
      area infused with the Darkblight, she can command the fungus to carry her
      aloft, granting her a fly speed of 40 feet (perfect).
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Arlantia watches the PCs' approach through her hive mind and scrying, and
  casts protection from energy on herself to resist their preferred spells. She
  casts shield of faith once the PCs enter her domain.
DuringCombat: >-
  Arlantia attacks without mercy, casting greater dispel magic to shut down any
  preparations, then mass inflict critical wounds, blasphemy, and harm. If her
  enemies manage to engage her in melee as she flies throughout Arhlantu, she
  uses her scythe of evil ability to add the unholy special ability to her
  scimitar before attacking. She casts heal on herself whenever she drops below
  150 hit points. Arlantia knows her aura of decay will destroy the mindslaver
  mold controlling Taurgreth, so she activates it only if he dies or is freed
  from her control.
Morale: Arlantia fights to the death.
