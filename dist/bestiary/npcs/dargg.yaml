DuringCombat: >-
  Dargg begins by charging the nearest enemy, then uses his challenge ability on
  an enemy warrior. Once his troop joins the fray, he takes a moment to activate
  his for the king ability-exclaiming "for the Ironfangs and Kosseruk!"-to grant
  his mount and the Ironfang troop he leads a +2 bonus on attack rolls and
  damage rolls for 1 round.
Morale: Dargg fights to the death rather than retreat to Kosseruk in failure.
