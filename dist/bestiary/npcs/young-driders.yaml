SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2
      Str; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based. Spells A drider casts
      spells as a 6th-level cleric, sorcerer, or wizard, but does not gain any
      other class abilities.
  - name: Web (Ex)
    description: >-
      Driders can use webs to support themselves and up to one additional
      creature of the same size. In addition, such creatures can throw a web up
      to eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a
      maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is
      effective against targets up to one size category larger than the drider.
      An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check or
      burst it with a Strength check. Both are standard actions with a DC equal
      to 10 + 1/2 creature's HD + creature's Con modifier. Attempts to burst a
      web by those caught in it suffer a &#8211;4 penalty. Driders can create
      sheets of sticky webbing up to three times their size. They usually
      position these sheets to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap
      prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20
      Perception check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and
      become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or
      burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to
      walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot section of webs has a
      number of hit points equal to the Hit Dice of the creature that created
      it, and sheet webs have damage reduction 5/&#8211;. A drider can move
      across its own web at its climb speed and can pinpoint the location of any
      creature touching its web.
  - name: Undersized Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      A drider wields weapons as if it were one size category smaller than its
      actual size (Medium weapons for most driders).
BeforeCombat: >-
  If the driders are warned about the PCs by the demons in the previous area,
  they cast mage armor (giving them AC 22, touch 12, flat-footed 19),
  invisibility, and (if there is time) target several stalactites around the
  cavern with darkness (not deeper darkness), then wait for the PCs to arrive.
DuringCombat: >-
  The driders break their invisibility by casting lightning bolt and follow up
  with magic missile or bow attacks. They remain in the air. They may cast
  invisibility again and move to another location (such as an area of darkness)
  to make attacks that can't be traced to them (such as suggestion or firing
  arrows, as lightning bolt and magic missile leave a visible trail that reveals
  the caster's location). If the PCs look like they're going to try to enter the
  pyramid, one drider casts web over the entrance. Remember that the ambient
  light in this room is dim light except right next to the pyramid, and the
  darkness spell reduces the light level by one step, so if the driders use
  darkness anywhere else in the cavern, normal-sighted PCs are effectively blind
  attacking targets in that area, while the driders can see perfectly well with
  their superior darkvision.
Morale: >-
  If things go poorly for the driders, they turn invisible and use distractions
  such as ghost sound and silent image to distract and confuse the PCs, giving
  the driders time to retreat into the pyramid and warn their allies. Because
  these driders have the young template, they are Medium size rather than Large
  and do not need to squeeze to move through the 5-foot-wide passages in the
  pyramid.
