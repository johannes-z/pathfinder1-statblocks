BeforeCombat: >-
  The monk prefers to challenge foes openly. He spends a point from his ki pool
  to increase his speed.
DuringCombat: >-
  The monk uses Great Cleave and Lunge in tandem, normally spending a point from
  his ki pool to offset the Armor Class penalty of these two feats. The monk
  makes unarmed strikes, attempting to stun or stagger with Stunning Fist and
  then use Improved Bull Rush to push the enemy away. If overwhelmed, the monk
  drinks a potion of mirror image to confuse attackers, uses Spring Attack or
  Great Cleave to attack multiple opponents as a standard action, then moves
  away quickly. The monk always leaves 2 points in his ki pool so he can use
  abundant step if he's severely threatened.
