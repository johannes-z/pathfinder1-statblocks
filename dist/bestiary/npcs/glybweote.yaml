Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Glybweote only prepares for combat by casting haste when she hears the PCs
  returning from areas C2 and C3. Her statistics reflect her abilities in sphinx
  form.
DuringCombat: >-
  Glybweote attempts to catch a PC off guard with a sneak attack and her form's
  pounce ability before using her androsphinx form's roar ability to disable as
  many PCs as possible. She either continues to roar or attacks any active PCs.
  If reduced to 40 hp or less, the protean reverts back to her natural form as a
  free action, benefiting from a CL 13th heal effect in the process, before
  resuming the fight.
Morale: >-
  Krune bound Glybweote to the Runevault with the task of protecting the true
  adamantine rune plates until his return. As a result, she fights to the death.
