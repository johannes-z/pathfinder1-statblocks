  - name: Overhand Chop (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a two-handed fighter makes a single attack (with the attack action or
      a charge) with a two-handed weapon, it adds double its Strength bonus on
      damage rolls. This bonus is already calculated into the juju zombie's
      stats above.
  - name: Shattering Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      A two-handed fighter gains a +1 bonus to CMB and CMD on sunder attempts
      and damage rolls made against objects.
DuringCombat: >-
  These skilled fighters enter melee as soon as possible. If a doorway is
  obstructed so that melee is impossible, they exit through the other door
  (breaking down the door to the garden, if necessary) to surround the PCs.
Morale: >-
  Relishing a challenge after years in torpor, these zombies fight until
  destroyed.
