SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Boundless Reach (Su)
    description: >-
      Vipostix's claws can slice through reality, allowing him to make melee
      attacks against any creature he is aware of (typically creatures within
      100 feet). Vipostix threatens only the 10-foot area around him and cannot
      make attacks of opportunity against creatures farther away. This ability
      can span miles or even planes if Vipostix uses greater scrying to pinpoint
      a certain creature. Spells that prevent planar travel, such as
      forbiddance, also protect against Vipostix's boundless reach. Dimensional
      anchor prevents Vipostix from using this ability for the duration of that
      spell. An attacked creature can retaliate that round, striking at
      Vipostix's claws with weapons or spells as if his entire body were
      present, but cannot grapple or otherwise prevent the claws from vanishing
      out of reach at the end of the round. Once per day as a move action, when
      Vipostix deals damage with this ability, he can appear within 10 feet of
      the creature attacked, even if it's on a different plane. Vipostix must
      return to his original location within 10 minutes. If he does not, he is
      immediately shunted back there as if via greater teleport or a one-way
      gate. When Vipostix returns this way, he can take up to one Medium or
      smaller creature with him as long as he is in contact with it (Will DC 28
      negates). The hole in reality is invisible to all other creatures and
      functions for no one other than Vipostix.
  - name: Indomitable Oration (Su)
    description: >-
      Vipostix's speech is always perfectly clear and cannot be silenced or
      warped through mundane or magical means. In areas of incredible noise,
      through water or airless voids, and even in areas of magical silence,
      Vipostix's voice can still be heard and understood normally. All beings
      understand Vipostix, as if he constantly speaks in all tongues at once.
  - name: Malleable Form (Su)
    description: >-
      Vipostix has complete control over his physical form, and if transformed
      into another shape against his will, he can revert back to his own form as
      a free action.
  - name: Ohrwurm (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a standard action, Vipostix can whisper a
      fundamental and terrifying truth to one creature within 5 feet. The target
      must succeed at a DC 28 Will saving throw or have Vipostix's words take
      root in its psyche. Outsiders and elementals receive a +2 bonus on their
      saving throws to resist this ability. Initially, this seems to have no
      effect. Anytime the victim tries to rest, however, it must succeed at an
      additional DC 28 Will saving throw or be affected as per the spell
      nightmare. Afterward, the victim must succeed at another DC 28 Will saving
      throw or have its alignment shift one step toward lawful evil. Only by
      unlearning what Vipostix told it can a victim be free of this effect; this
      requires a spell such as miracle, modify memory, or wish. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Summon Devil (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Vipostix can attempt to summon 1d6 bone devils or 2d4
      bearded devils with a 50% chance of success, or one ice devil with a 20%
      chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.
  - name: Wisdom Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      Vipostix drains 1d6 points of Wisdom each time he hits with his claw
      attack. He does not heal any damage through his regeneration ability
      during any round that he uses his Wisdom drain.
