BeforeCombat: >-
  If the druids in act 5 spent at least one round shouting, Dalirio is aware
  that the PCs are coming and casts bull's strength and rage on himself (these
  spells are not figured into his stats).
DuringCombat: >-
  Dalirio lets his heucuvas do most of the fighting, preferring to hit melee PCs
  with confusion, deeper darkness, and hold person. If any of the PCs happen to
  mention that Luscilia is dead (whether or not she really is), Dalirio howls in
  anger and charges that PC. Dalirio uses Channel Energy to heal his heucuva
  servant or harm the PCs whenever appropriate.
Morale: Dalirio is a fanatic and fights to the death.
