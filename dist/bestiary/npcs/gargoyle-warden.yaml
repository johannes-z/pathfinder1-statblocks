  One gargoyle charges at a target on the ground and attempts to knock that foe
  into the trench by using its knockback and strength surge rage powers. The
  other hurls a statue at the smallest foe before joining the melee. The
  gargoyles thereafter fight with their natural attacks, pushing foes toward
  other foes (such as the wight troop) or over the bridge into the trench.
Morale: The gargoyles fight to the death.
