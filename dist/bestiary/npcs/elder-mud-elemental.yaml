SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Earth Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A burrowing mud elemental can pass through dirt, gravel, or other loose or
      porous solid matter as easily as a fish swims through water. It cannot use
      this ability to pass through a solid barrier such as a stone or brick
      wall. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create
      any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an
      area containing a burrowing mud elemental flings the elemental back 30
      feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15
      Fortitude save.
  - name: Entrap (Ex)
    description: >-
      On a successful melee attack, a mud elemental can entrap an opponent in
      hardened mud. The target must make a DC 22 Fortitude save or become
      entangled. If a target is already entangled by this ability, a second
      entrap attack means the target must make another Fortitude save or become
      helpless. The save DCs are Constitution-based. A target made helpless by
      this ability is conscious but can take no physical actions (except
      attempting to break free) until the mud is removed. The target can use
      spells with only verbal components or spell-like abilities if it can make
      a DC 20 concentration check. An entangled creature can make a DC 22
      Strength check as a full-round action to break free; a helpless creature
      must make a DC 27 Strength check to break free. Destroying the hardened
      mud frees the creature, or it can be washed away in 1d3 rounds if a large
      amount of water is used.
  - name: Mudsliding (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mud elemental ignores difficult terrain unless the cause is obstacles
      equal to or greater than its height. It ignores obstacles that cause
      creatures to slip or fall (such as a grease spell).
DuringCombat: >-
  The elemental pummels its opponents with its slams, trying to entrap them and
  prevent them from reaching the Argental Font.
Morale: The elemental fights until destroyed.
