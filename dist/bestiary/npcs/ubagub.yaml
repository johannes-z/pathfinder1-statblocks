SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Back Slime (Ex)
    description: >-
      A slurk's back is crusted with thick, dry slime and dozens of nodules. As
      a standard action at will, a slurk can squirt a jet of this slime from one
      of these nodules, making a +4 ranged touch attack against any target
      within 30 feet. The slime quickly hardens to the texture of cold tar,
      imparting a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, Reflex saves, and skill
      checks&#8211;the slime also reduces the creature's base speed by 10 feet.
      Anyone the slurk successfully bull rushes or overruns is exposed to the
      creature's back slime as well. The slime can be removed as a full-round
      action requiring a DC 15 Strength check. The slurk's back slime grants a
      creature riding it a +8 bonus on Ride checks made to stay in the saddle,
      but a &#8211;8 penalty on Ride checks to dismount.
  - name: Belly Grease (Ex)
    description: >-
      The slurk exudes a slippery grease from its belly that grants it a +4
      bonus on Escape Artist skill checks and to its CMD versus grapple. A slurk
      may wallow on a solid surface as a full-round action to coat the area
      within a 5-foot radius with its grease up to once per minute. The grease
      smear created functions as a grease spell (CL 3rd); but it is not a
      magical effect and thus cannot be dispelled.
  - name: Hunker (Ex)
    description: >-
      The slurk gains a +4 bonus to its CMD to avoid bull rush or overrun
      attempts.
