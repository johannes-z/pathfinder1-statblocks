DuringCombat: >-
  The reefclaw knows the barge and pier belong to its Arkona allies, and does
  its best not to damage them. The same gentle touch is not extended to the PCs,
  as the monster attacks anyone it regards as an intruder with a ferocious rage.
Morale: >-
  The enormous reefclaw gives up the fight if reduced to fewer than 20 hit
  points, swimming swiftly out to sea to seek new allies. It does not return.
