BeforeCombat: >-
  Hei-Fen casts shield of faith and air walk on herself just before combat, and
  greater magic weapon on her short sword and magic vestment on her chain shirt
  before combat. She poisons her sword with a dose of purple worm poison before
  combat. She always fights in hybrid form to offset her age penalties and to
  gain a bite attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  Hei-Fen uses her ranged spells in the first few rounds of combat to soften
  foes up or to sow discord. When three of her cultists fall, she casts harm,
  holds the charge, and steps up to deliver the spell to a PC, following up on
  the next rounds with melee attacks while flanking with surviving cultist
  allies. She wants to see the PCs die, and resists the urge to use plane shift
  to send one of them away to Abaddon, but uses this tactic on dangerous
  conjured foes or non-PC allies. If reduced to 40 or fewer hit points, she
  casts mislead and then seeks a hiding place to cast healing spells; she then
  casts poison, holds the charge, and seeks to return to combat with the spell
  as a touch attack.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 hp or fewer, Hei-Fen casts word of recall to flee back to
  Vyre. She may return to attack the PCs one last time, preferably during the
  celebrations on the bridge (see From Hell's Heart on page 62).
Gear: purple worm poison (3)
