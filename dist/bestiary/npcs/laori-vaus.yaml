BeforeCombat: >-
  Every morning, Laori casts greater magic weapon and magic vestment on her
  spiked chain and armor. If she has a chance before combat begins, she also
  casts the following spells as well: air walk, bear's endurance, bull's
  strength, and spell resistance.
DuringCombat: >-
  Laori's first act in combat is to cast sadomasochism on herself (see the
  sidebar on page 451). Next, she summons 1d3 shadows with summon monster V; on
  the second round, as her shadows appear, she hits the thickest concentration
  of her enemies with blade barrier or flame strike. She moves into melee
  against foes on the third  round, using her destructive smite and unleashing
  the inflict serious wounds from her spell-storing spiked chain on her first
  attack. As she fights, she hums or whistles as if she were merely doing some
  pleasant chore, periodically punctuating a particularly solid blow with a
  giggle or wink.
Morale: >-
  Laori enjoys pain, but would rather not give up her life before she has a
  chance to see Kazavon's relics recovered. If brought to fewer than 20 hit
  points, she flees (via shadow walk if possible), returning at her convenience
  to finish unresolved business.
Gear: >-
  wand of cure moderate wounds (11 charges), wand of sending (6 charges), wand
  of sound burst (19 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +2 spiked chainmail, +2 spell-storing spiked chain (currently contains inflict
  serious wounds), amulet of natural armor +3, headband of inspired wisdom +2,
  scrap of Neolandus's uniform, silver holy symbol of Zon-Kuthon, 31 gp, 6 sp, 7
