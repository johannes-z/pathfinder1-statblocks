  longstrider, and magic fang.
DuringCombat: >-
  Mathus attempts to intimidate and demoralize anyone who dares to enter
  Highthrone. Then he draws his weapons and attacks any foes brave enough to
  face him. If Cybrisa turns on him, he douses his blade with silversheen and
  shows her no mercy or quarter, and expects none in return.
Morale: Mathus must hold on to Highthrone at all costs, and fights to the death.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds, silversheen (4)
