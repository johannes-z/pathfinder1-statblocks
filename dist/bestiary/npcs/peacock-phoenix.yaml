SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      The peacock phoenix can exhale a 60- foot line of fire as a standard
      action once every minute. This breath weapon inflicts 5d6 points of fire
      damage to all creatures in the area of effect-a successful DC 24 Reflex
      save halves the damage. Element-Infused Abilities As an element-infused
      creature, the peacock phoenix possesses several potent abilities-its fiery
      breath weapon, its evasion defensive ability, its fiery blood (see below),
      and a supernatural quickness that increases its speed and grants it a
      bonus to its initiative checks (these adjustments have been built in to
      the stat block above).
  - name: Fiery Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature that damages the peacock phoenix with a slashing or piercing
      melee weapon is sprayed with boiling blood that deals 3d4 points of fire
      damage. Creatures using reach weapons are not subject to this damage.
DuringCombat: >-
  The peacock phoenix seeks out Sorshen and tries to attack her at first, using
  its breath weapon or thunderbolt ability before closing to attack in melee. If
  a PC attacks the creature, it instead focuses its wrath on that target.
Morale: The peacock phoenix fights to the death.
