SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Special Arrows (Su)
    description: >-
      When Malignant Nolly fires an arrow from any bow, she can decide to change
      the arrow's properties by sprinkling it with corrupted pixie dust. Doing
      so is a free action as long as she is the one to fire the arrow. Malignant
      Nolly can generate 18 uses of dust each day, but the dust is useless to
      other creatures. Once pixie dust is applied to an arrow, the chosen effect
      persists on the arrow for only 1 round. As long as an arrow is altered in
      this way, it does not deal damage when it hits-it only causes its new
      effect. Malignant Nolly can choose any one of the following three effects
      when dusting an arrow. The save DCs are Charisma-based. Blossoming Rot:
      The target must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be affected as if by
      a fungal infestationUM spell. This arrow consumes two uses of Nolly's
      pixie dust. Fitful Sleep: The target must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or
      fall asleep for 1 minute. Its sleep is haunted by nightmares of trees
      draped in greasy black tendrils of rot; when the target awakens, it is
      shaken for the following minute. Tainted Shot: The target is immediately
      affected by Nolly's unnatural toxins as if it had bitten her; see the
      tainted blood ability below.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: Nolly casts shield on herself before firing at the corpse.
DuringCombat: >-
  During the surprise round, Malignant Nolly shoots the infested corpse with a
  single arrow to trigger the rot grub explosion. She thereafter fires her bow
  from a distance while invisible, using her special arrows to incapacitate or
  infect her opponents. Being so far from the Blight of the central Fangwood,
  her fungal rejuvenation power doesn't function.
Morale: >-
  Compelled to infect and murder others, Malignant Nolly fights to the death.
  She doesn't bother pursuing foes that flee as long as she was able to infect
  them; otherwise, she pursues her opponents until at least one victim is
  infected.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, wand of snare (14 charges)
OtherGear: mwk longbow with 20 mwk arrows, punching dagger
