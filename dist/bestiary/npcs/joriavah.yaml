Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Joriavah tries to dominate one of the PCs on the first round of combat
  (preferring to select a heavily armored character or an obvious healer) and
  orders that character to attack his friends. She then teleports away to an
  abandoned house elsewhere in Westcrown (one of many such locations she's
  already explored), where she takes the time to try to summon a babau and cast
  bear's endurance, cat's grace, and shield of faith before she teleports back
  to area F10 to attack the PCs with her crossbow at range (using Shot on the
  Run, Vital Strike, and Deadly Aim to full effect to maintain ranged
  superiority). In melee, she relies on vampiric touch each round.
Morale: >-
  If brought below 30 hit points, Joriavah teleports to one of her abandoned
  houses to recover; once she's healed up, she returns to the Nessian Spiral,
  becomes ethereal, and seeks out the PCs for revenge, repeating her
  fight-and-retreat tactics until the PCs are dead or they prevent her escape
  and kill her.
Gear: +1 studded leather armor, +1 frost hand crossbow with 20 bolts
