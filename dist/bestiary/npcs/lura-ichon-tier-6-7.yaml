BeforeCombat: >-
  If Ichon knows the PCs are coming, her spotters in the street outside have
  message cast on them and warn her when the PCs approach. At this point, she
  casts magic fang (twice, once on each hand for both slam attacks),
  displacement (from a scroll), mage armor, and resist energy (electricity) on
  Bellu (these spells are already figured into her stat block), and palms her
  scroll of greater invisibility, reading it as soon as the PCs start to cause
  trouble.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once the fight begins, Ichon activates her whip feather token, ordering it to
  attack obvious arcane casters, and then reads her scroll of greater
  invisibility, leaving the bulk of the combat to Bellu. After going invisible,
  she uses her remaining spell slots to cast defensive spells on her and her
  eidolon, staying close to receive the shield ally bonuses. When her scroll
  wears off or opponents otherwise locate her, she targets their weapons with
  grease and groups of PCs with charm monster and glitterdust, and only fights
  in melee if there is no other option.
Morale: >-
  Born and bred on the mean streets of Bloodcove, Lura Ichon would sooner die
  that publicly show weakness.
Gear: >-
  feather token (whip), potions of cure serious wounds (2), scroll of
  displacement, scroll of greater invisibility, wand of reduce person (9
  charges)
