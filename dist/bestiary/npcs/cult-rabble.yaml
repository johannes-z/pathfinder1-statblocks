SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Chant (Ex)
    description: >-
      The rabble chants ominously as a free action while attacking. The effect
      of this chanting grants the troop the benefits of a bless spell. Opponents
      within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or take a -1 penalty on
      attack rolls and a &#8211;1 penalty on saving throws against fear effects
      for 1 minute. The save DC is Wisdom-based and includes the bonus from the
      troop's Ability Focus feat.
  - name: Dart Barrage (Ex)
    description: >-
      The rabble can unleash a fusillade of sharp darts as a standard action.
      This attack takes the form of up to two lines with a range increment of 20
      feet. These lines can start from the corner of any square in the troop's
      space. All creatures in each of the lines are hit by 1d4 darts and take
      1d3+4 points of piercing damage for each dart (Reflex DC 18 half). The
      save DC is Dexterity-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The rabble begins chanting as a free action and unleashing dart barrages
  before closing in to melee combat with the PCs.
Morale: The ecstatic initiates fight to the death.
