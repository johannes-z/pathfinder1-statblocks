BeforeCombat: >-
  Atga casts false life, mage armor, and protection from energy (cold) on
  herself, and casts protection from energy (cold) on Formoch.
DuringCombat: >-
  Atga casts black tentacles to disable as many enemies as possible, then casts
  wall of force to separate the PCs, prevent them from attacking Formoch, and
  contain them in the area with the black tentacles. She casts dimension door to
  move herself and Formoch out of a dangerous area or to an enemy spellcaster.
  She casts  scorching ray and fireball to finish off enemies who are clearly
  weakened. Because Formoch is protected against cold by her spell, she doesn't
  care if she includes him in the area of her cold attacks.
Morale: Atga fights to the death.
