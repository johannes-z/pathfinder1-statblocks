BeforeCombat: >-
  Bax imbibes her potion of cat's grace (included in her statistics) if she
  expects combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Bax fires her hand crossbows on the first round of combat, then uses her
  potion of invisibility or  smokesticks before finding cover and reloading.
  Once she has expended her ranged options (or if she finds herself trapped in
  melee), she relies on her allies to provide a flanking bonus while she stabs
  at the nearest PC with her daggers and frightens anyone who comes near with
  her mask.
Morale: >-
  Bax has no place to run to, and she ultimately would rather perish than face
  her mother's punishment for failure. She fights to the death.

  potion of invisibility, adamantine weapon blanchUE, cold iron weapon blanchUE,
