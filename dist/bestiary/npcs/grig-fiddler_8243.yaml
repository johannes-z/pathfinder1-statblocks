    description: >-
      Grigs are capable of rubbing their legs together like a cricket to create
      a surprisingly pleasant sound not unlike that of a tiny fiddle. As a
      standard action, a grig can create a catchy tune that compels any creature
      within a 20 ft. spread to dance and caper. A creature can resist this
      compulsion by making a DC 12 Will save. Creatures that fail are compelled
      to dance and shuffle their feet, and are effectively staggered as long as
      the grig continues to fiddle. A grig can maintain this effect for up to 10
      rounds per day by concentrating. Once a creature makes the save against a
      grig's fiddle, it is immune to further fiddle effects from that grig for
      24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
