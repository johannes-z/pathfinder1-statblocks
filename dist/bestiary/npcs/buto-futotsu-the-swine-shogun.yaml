Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Buto assumes that Munasukaru is watching him, so he tends to be flashy in
  combat, using his Dazzling  Display feat before entering combat or when there
  is a lull in the fighting.
Morale: >-
  Buto drinks his potion of cure serious wounds when reduced to fewer than 30
  hit points, but if he then reaches 10 hit points or fewer, the Swine Shogun
  screams an oath to Munasukaru's glory and commits seppuku (ritual suicide by
  performing a self-inflicted coup de grace with his dagger).
