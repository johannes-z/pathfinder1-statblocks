    description: >-
      Any living creature damaged by a raven swarm must make a DC 14 Reflex save
      or be blinded as the swarm scratches and tears at the victim's eyes. The
      blindness lasts for 1d4 days until the eyes naturally heal, or until they
      are healed (with remove blindness or a DC 15 Heal check). The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
