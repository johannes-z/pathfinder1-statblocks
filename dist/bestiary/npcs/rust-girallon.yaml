SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Air Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any airborne creature takes a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls
      against a dust creature.
  - name: Airborne (Su)
    description: >-
      A rust girallon can walk on air as with the air walk spell. In addition,
      it always falls as if affected by a feather fall spell.
  - name: Exude Dust (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a rust girallon can exude a cloud of dust that functions
      like an obscuring mist spell, except that all rust girallons can see
      through it normally. Any other creature caught within the cloud must
      succeed on a DC 20 Reflex save or be blinded by the stinging dust. A
      creature that enters the dust cloud with its eyes closed or covered need
      not make a save against blindness unless it opens its eyes while within
      the dust cloud. A creature blinded by a rust girallon's cloud of dust
      regains its sight 1d4 rounds after its last exposure to a dust cloud with
      its eyes open. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Sand Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a rust girallon can emit an abrasive jet of
      dust-filled wind that damages objects and other creatures. This wind takes
      the form of a 5-foot-wide, 20-foot-long line that causes 9d4 points of
      slashing damage. Any creature caught within the line of effect may attempt
      a DC 20 Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The rust girallons split into two groups of two. One group uses its airborne
  ability and walks up over the heads of the PCs, using exude dust to blind
  them. The other two girallons then fire off their sand blast breath weapon,
  hitting as many PCs as possible. Then they attack in melee and ruthlessly tear
  at the closest PC.
Morale: >-
  The girallons know Adril will slay them should they disobey him-so they fight
  to the death.
