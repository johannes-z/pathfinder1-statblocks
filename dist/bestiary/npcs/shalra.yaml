DuringCombat: >-
  Shalra attempts a coup de grace against sleeping or helpless foes. Should the
  encounter become a fight, she uses her oil of darkness on a silver piece, then
  uses hit-and-run tactics to inflict bleeding attacks before falling back. If
  confronted or pursued by multiple foes, she drinks a potion of cat's grace.
Morale: >-
  When Shalra drops beneath 10 hit points, she tries to escape by using the
  magically created darkness or bluffing to create a distraction. She'd rather
  receive a minor reward for locating the fugitives than die in a fool's fight.
Gear: oil of darkness, potion of cat's grace (2)
