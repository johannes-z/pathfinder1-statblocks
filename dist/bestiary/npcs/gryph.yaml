  - name: Attach (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a gryph hits with its legs, its six talons latch tightly onto the
      target, anchoring it in place. An attached gryph is effectively grappling
      its prey. The gryph loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 11,
      but holds on with great tenacity and gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls with
      its bite. Alternatively, an attached gryph can attempt to implant eggs in
      the target. An attached gryph has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its
      grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached gryph can be struck with
      a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or
      Escape Artist check against it, the gryph is removed.
  - name: Implant Eggs (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a gryph can implant eggs into a helpless target or a target
      that it is currently attached to as a full-round action by extending an
      ovipositor from its abdomen and penetrating the victim's flesh by making a
      successful +4 melee attack. On a hit, the ovipositor inflicts 1 damage and
      implants 1d4 eggs into the victim's body. As long as a victim has gryph
      eggs implanted in his body, he is sickened as the eggs draw nutrients from
      his blood and flesh. The eggs grow swiftly, hatching in a mere 1d4 minutes
      into ravenous baby gryphs that immediately burrow out of the victim's
      body. This inflicts 2 points of Constitution damage per baby gryph, after
      which the hatchlings immediately take wing and fly away. Treat a gryph
      hatchling as a bat if statistics are needed. Gryph eggs can be cut out of
      a victim's body with a successful DC 20 Heal check made as a full-round
      action that inflicts 1 point of damage per attempt. Although immunity to
      disease offers no special protection against gryph egg implantation,
      remove disease or heal immediately destroys any implanted gryph eggs.
DuringCombat: >-
  A gryph tries to attach itself to a foe to lay its eggs, then flees once it
  does so.
Morale: >-
  A wounded gryph immediately flees back to its nest up in the Maggot Tree-if
  confronted there, it fights to the death.
