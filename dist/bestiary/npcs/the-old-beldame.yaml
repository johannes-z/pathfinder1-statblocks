BeforeCombat: The Old Beldame casts false life, mage armor, and shield on herself every day.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Old Beldame first casts scare to frighten away intruders. If they remain,
  she follows with slow, deep slumber, and hideous laughter spells, while her
  scarecrow attacks as outlined below. She targets fighters with scare, uses
  touch of idiocy against spellcasters, and targets clustered opponents with her
  wand. The first person to engage her in melee combat is hit with hideous
  laughter from her staff.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 15 hit points or fewer, the Old Beldame casts beast shape I to
  change into a raven and flies out the door into the swamp, hoping to return
  later after her tormentors have departed.
Gear: wand of burning hands (CL 5th, 10 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 spell storing quarterstaff (holds hideous laughter), hand of the mage,
  shawl of resistance +1 (as cloak), spell component pouch, spellbook
