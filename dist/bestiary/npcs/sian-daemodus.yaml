SpecialAbilities: []
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  As soon as she realizes the PCs are entering the area (by hearing them or
  noticing their light sources), Sian drinks her potion of invisibility and her
  potion of levitate, then sneaks toward the PCs' location. Once she's in the
  same room as them, she drinks her potion of shield of faith, moves into
  position, and takes a shot at a PC with her hand crossbow, hoping to score a
  sneak attack in the surprise round.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once combat begins, Sian uses her hand crossbow again to take an attack
  against a foe who remains flat-footed; otherwise she makes use of spring
  attack to keep her distance, periodically using hide in plain sight to set up
  additional sneak attack opportunities if possible. She's not afraid to change
  the layout of the area by moving up or down through a "loop" via levitation,
  and knows this area well enough so that when she sees which archways open and
  close, she'll know the fastest route to strike at a PC who might be cut off
  from the rest.
Morale: >-
  Sian fights until brought below 15 hit points, at which point she drinks her
  second potion of invisibility and then her potion of gaseous form and attempts
  to escape back to area B1 and thence back to Aberian's Folly. In this case,
  she decides picking up the bonus isn't worth the risk and returns to the
  Council of Thieves to report her success in sabotaging the manor's infernal
  power supply. Sian could return at a later point in the Adventure Path,
  perhaps after she's gained a few more levels of shadowdancer, to become a
  regular and recurring villain-just because she didn't kill the PCs in their
  first encounter shouldn't mean she won't try again as often as she can!
Gear: >-
  Medium spider venom (5), potion of cure moderate wounds (2), potion of gaseous
  form, potion of invisibility (2), potion of levitate, potion of shield of
  faith
OtherGear: >-
  +1 leather armor, +1 short sword, masterwork hand crossbow with 20 bolts, hat
  of disguise, bejeweled bust of Asmodeus worth 800 gp
