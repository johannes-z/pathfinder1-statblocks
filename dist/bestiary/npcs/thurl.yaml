BeforeCombat: >-
  While in his stone prison, Thurl has cast the following spells on himself:
  barkskin, bear's endurance, eagle's splendor, heroism, and stoneskin before
  breaking out. He also cast greater magic fang and evolution surge, adding a +1
  to all of Inaz's natural attacks and making him Large.
DuringCombat: >-
  Thurl casts haste on the first round of combat, including all of his allies in
  the effect. He then stays within Inhaz's reach, gaining the benefit of his
  shield ally ability. He first casts summon monster IV to summon a fiendish
  dire boar, then uses grease, ray of sickening and glitterdust to weaken foes.
  He uses life conduit or resist energy to help Inhaz. If Inhaz is killed, Thurl
  uses his summon monster IV ability to conjure another fiendish dire boar or
  1d3 dretches.
Morale: >-
  Thurl knows he will find no mercy at the hands of the Decemvirate. He fights
  to the death.
