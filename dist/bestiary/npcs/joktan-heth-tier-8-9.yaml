SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Discorporate (Su)
    description: >-
      A worm that walks can collapse into a shapeless swarm of worms as a free
      action. All held, worn, and carried items fall and its Strength score
      drops to 1. The worm that walks functions as a true swarm while
      discorporated, with a reach of 0 feet (its space remains unchanged). While
      discorporated, the worm that walks loses all of its defensive abilities
      and gains all of the standard swarm traits. It loses its slam attacks and
      all special abilities and special attacks, but can make a swarm attack
      that deals damage equal to its engulf attack. A worm that walks can reform
      into its true form (including equipping all gear in reach) as a full-round
      action as long as it has at least 1 hit point.
  - name: Squirming Embrace (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a worm that walks grapples a foe, as a swift action, it can cause a
      swarm of worms to squirm over the grappled creature. These worms deal
      automatic swarm damage with no attack roll needed. If a creature takes
      damage from the swarm, it is also subject to the swarm's distraction
      ability, and must make a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. A
      worm that walks can only have one embraced target at a time, but it does
      not have to continue grappling in order to maintain the embrace. If the
      worm that walks moves more than 5 feet from the swarm or dismisses the
      swarm (a free action), the swarm dies. Any area attack that damages the
      swarm or any severe or stronger wind effect that affects the swarm's
      target kills it.
  - name: Tenacious (Ex)
    description: >-
      A worm that walks gains a +8 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks made
      to grapple and a +4 racial bonus to its CMD. Worm that Walks Traits: A
      worm that walks has no discernible anatomy, and is not subject to critical
      hits or flanking. Reducing a worm that walks to 0 hit points causes it to
      discorporate (see above)-a worm that walks at 0 hit points is staggered,
      and one at negative hit points is dying. Worms that walk are immune to any
      physical spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures
      (including singletarget spells such as disintegrate), with the exception
      of such spells and effects generated by the worm that walks itself, which
      treat the worm that walks as one single creature if it so chooses.
      Mind-affecting effects that target single creatures function normally
      against a worm that walks, since the creature's individual components
      share a hive mind. A worm that walks takes half again as much damage
      (+50%) from damaging area effects, such as fireball and splash weapons.
      Worms that walk are susceptible to high winds&#8211;treat a worm that
      walks as a Fine creature for the purposes of determining wind effects.
ProhibitedSchools: Abjuration, Divination
BeforeCombat: >-
  Before the PCs arrive, Joktan uses his wand to cast mage armor on himself and
  casts false life and fly (all of these effects are factored in above).
DuringCombat: >-
  At the start of combat, Joktan casts haste on himself and his undead minions,
  before opening up to attack the PCs with spells like fear, empowered vampiric
  touch, and hold monster. When reduced to fewer than half his total hit points,
  he casts displacement. He uses wall of fire to divide the PCs when convenient,
  and enervation to cripple any spellcasters that bother him.
Morale: Joktan is supremely confident in his abilities and fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure serious wounds, scroll of blindness/ deafness, scroll of false
  life, wand of mage armor (50 charges), wand of ray of exhaustion (7 charges)
