BeforeCombat: >-
  Vadoma casts mage armor most mornings, especially if she expects a dangerous
  expedition or confrontation.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vadoma uses wall of force to divide opponents and cut off easy access to her
  position. Against a single opponent, Vadoma uses charm monster to stop a fight
  before it begins. If pressed to attack, she uses fireball against crowds or
  scorching ray and telekinesis against single targets, relying on calcific
  touch if an opponent gets too close.
Morale: Vadoma uses dimension door and fly to escape a combat as quickly as she can.
