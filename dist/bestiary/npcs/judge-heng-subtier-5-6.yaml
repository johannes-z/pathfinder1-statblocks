  Judge Heng's primary task is to guard the gong and then alcove c, and he
  attempts to keep himself between the PCs and their goal at all costs. Should
  Judge Heng knock an opponent unconscious, on his next turn he picks up the
  fallen creature and then throws it into the nearest alcove (other than alcove
  c). The creature disappears into the illusionary wall of blades, triggering
  the trap within, which imprisons it.  Moral Once reduced to 25 hit points, the
  judge surrenders, conceding to the PCs as his victors.
