    description: >-
      As a commander in the Ironfang Legion, Taurgreth has access to the
      hobgoblin army's deepest pockets. Therefore, he has gear and equipment
      equivalent to that of a 15th-level PC. This increases Taurgreth's
      Challenge Rating by 1.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Taurgreth watches intruders from hiding, marking four of them as studied
  targets.
DuringCombat: >-
  Taurgreth becomes a whirl of flashing blades when roused to combat. He
  single-mindedly attacks a single target at a time, relying on his cloak of
  displacement and the defense bonuses his sword Obedience provides to protect
  him from his target's allies.
Morale: >-
  So long as he is enchanted by the mindslaver mold, Taurgreth fights to the
  death. If freed, however, he turns his rage against Arlantia, and flees if the
  PCs continue to attack him or he is reduced below 40 hit points.

  tindertwigs (20)
