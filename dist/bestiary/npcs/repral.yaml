  If she hears enemy activity (such as a loud battle with the gorgons in area
  M5), Repral casts animal growth and greater magic fang on Tikik, casts bull's
  strength and freedom of movement on herself, and activates her animal focus
  for both of them to gain +4 Constitution and evasion.
DuringCombat: >-
  Repral keeps Tikik close at hand in combat to defend her. She begins by
  casting chill metal on the most heavily armored foe, then casts poison and
  whip of spiders while her snake deals with anyone drawing close.
Morale: Repral is a fanatic and fights to the death.
