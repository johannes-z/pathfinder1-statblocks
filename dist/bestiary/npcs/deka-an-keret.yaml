BeforeCombat: Deka casts shield of faith and spell resistance before any audience or combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Deka tries to avoid conflict, leaving her defense to her priests and temple
  guards while she casts sanctuary and withdraws from combat. She is conscious
  of her frailty, and if forced to fight, she uses her spells wisely, casting
  order's wrath, spiritual ally, and if necessary, flame strike. After that, she
  uses her spells to support her guards. It has been over 20 years since Deka
  raised her mace in anger and more often than not she leaves the heavy weapon
  behind or asks others to bear it for her.
Morale: >-
  Deka is a pivotal and important figure not only in Tephu, but in Osirion as
  well. She chooses escape over death, or failing that, surrender.
