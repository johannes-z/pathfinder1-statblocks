  deck of the Sailswift until he can make a sneak attack with his crossbow,
  which signals the rest of the pirates to attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ruovarn uses his first turn to throw a tanglefoot bag down onto the PCs, then
  fires at them from higher ground until he is forced to enter melee. In melee,
  he fights the first PC to attack him until that PC falls unconscious, and then
  moves on to fight the PC with the highest Charisma.
