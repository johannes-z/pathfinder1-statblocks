BeforeCombat: The avatar has no interest in subtlety, and attacks swiftly and inelegantly.
DuringCombat: >-
  The avatar begins combat by casting unholy blight, followed by blasphemy, then
  focuses on melee combat. Thanks to her Bull Rush Strike feat, she knocks
  opponents back (and ideally into the water) whenever she confirms a critical
  hit. When reduced below half her normal hit points, she dives underwater and
  uses her vortex ability to toss about any opponents in the water or on the
  lake's surface. If all her opponents are flying, she simply continues her
  physical assault.
Morale: The Silver Tarn avatar fights until destroyed.
