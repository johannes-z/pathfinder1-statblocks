BeforeCombat: The shaman casts mage armor, invisibility, and fly on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  The shaman remains invisible until he's flown far enough away to be out of the
  PCs' melee reach, then he unleashes his ranged attack spells. If the PCs enter
  the water, he uses beast shape II to take the form of a crocodile and attacks.
Morale: >-
  The shaman fights until reduced to 8 hit points or less, at which point he
  assumes his crocodile form (if he hasn't done so already) and retreats into
  the shallows, leaving his followers to finish the job.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds

  crocodile skull headdress (+1 amulet of natural armor), +1 shortspear,
  masterwork club
Fly: 1
