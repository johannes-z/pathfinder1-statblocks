SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Tree of Ages (Su)
    description: >-
      Henbane can restore life to wooden objects, transforming them into
      constructs of living wood that serve as her allies. Up to three times per
      day as a swift action, she can create up to three wooden allies (see stat
      block below). Each of these allies remains animated for one minute, until
      she uses this ability again, or until it is reduced to 0 hit points.
  - name: Tree Meld (Su)
    description: >-
      A dryad can meld with any tree, similar to how the spell meld into stone
      functions. She can remain melded with a tree as long as she wishes.
  - name: Tree Dependent (Su)
    description: >-
      Henbane must stay within 300 yards of locations and times that are
      connected to the strange tree of branching paths of time to which she is
      bound. If she strays more than 300 yards away from such a location, she is
      sickened. Every hour thereafter, she must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to
      resist becoming nauseated for an hour. Henbane carries four soothe syrups
      to stave off these effects, which she does not need to use during this
      scenario.
  - name: Woodcraft (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dryad has a +6 racial bonus to Craft checks involving wood, and is
      always treated as if she had masterwork artisan's woodworking tools when
      making such checks.
BeforeCombat: Henbane casts resist energy (fire) on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Henbane prefers to avoid confrontation by frightening potential foes into
  seeing matters from her perspective. If combat becomes unavoidable, she uses
  her animate wood ability to create allies out of the surrounding tower and
  uses her wooden allies for her teamwork feats. She combines spells and archery
  to hamper her foes and pick them off one at a time.
Morale: >-
  If reduced below 20 hit points, Henbane casts invisibility on herself and
  sneaks down the tower with the temporal essence she has collected so far.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, soothe syrupUE (4)
OtherGear: >-
  mwk darkleaf clothUE studded leather, mwk composite longbow (+2 Str), mwk
  living steelUE heavy mace, cloak of elvenkind, efficient quiver, empty vial
  (10), 103 gp
