SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Coven Familiar (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because of their unity in a coven, the three hags have pooled their
      ability and knowledge to share a single more powerful familiar than any
      can control alone. The abilities of the familiar are based on the
      highestlevel witch's witch level, plus half the witch levels of the other
      coven members (rounded down). Because of their hag affinity for witch
      magic, their racial hit dice also count toward these totals. The
      familiar's hit points are determined from the hit points of all three
      hags, and it uses whichever skill bonus is best. The familiar stores the
      spells of all three hags, and all three can share in each other's spell
      lists. The trade-off: should their familiar Marty the Imp be captured or
      slain, the spellcasting of all three hags will be crippled.
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    description: >-
      The sight of a sea hag is so revolting that anyone within 60 ft. (other
      than another hag) who sets eyes upon one must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude
      save (DC 16 for Shralynn) or be instantly weakened, taking 1d6 points of
      Strength damage. Creatures that are affected by this power or that
      successfully save against it cannot be affected again by the same hag's
      horrific appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Hag Coven (Sp)
    description: >-
      When all three hags are within 10 ft. of one another, they can work
      together as a group to generate one of the following spell-like abilities
      as a full-round action. All coven spell-like abilities function at CL 9th
      (or at the highest CL available to the most powerful hag in the coven).
      The save DCs are Charisma-based, and function as if with a Charisma score
      of 18. Coven Spells: At will-animate dead, baleful polymorph (DC 19),
      blight (DC 18), bestow curse (DC 18), clairaudience/clairvoyance, charm
      monster (DC 18), commune, control weather, dream, forcecage, mind blank,
      mirage arcana (DC 19), reincarnate, speak with dead, veil (DC 20), vision.
