SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Tumor Infestation: Injury; save Fort DC 19; onset 1 minute; frequency
      1/day; effect 1d2 Con and 1d2 Cha; cure 2 consecutive saves. Anyone who
      dies from tumor infestation turns into a hungry flesh 1d4 hours later.
  - name: Mutated Infestation (Ex)
    description: >-
      Dalva's tumor infestation has caused her body to begin producing its own
      mutagen, allowing her to "consume" her mutagen as a swift action without
      actually drinking it or provoking an attack of opportunity. It takes 4
      hours for her body to create a new reserve of mutagen, and Dalva's present
      reserve is a Strength mutagen.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Dalva hides under the operating table to escape the ghastly haunts she thinks
  are flitting about the room. If she hears combat in area C1, she consumes her
  extracts of barkskin, haste, spider climb, invisibility, jump, and shield in
  that order.   Dalva activates her mutagen at the beginning of combat and
  viciously attacks anyone in sight. She uses her exceptional mobility to leap
  from combat to rain bombs upon the PCs. Despite her altered mental state, she
  maintains knowledge of her equipment and class abilities along with
  considerable cunning.
Morale: Dalva fights until killed or subdued.
