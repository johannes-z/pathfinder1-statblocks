SpecialAbilities: []
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Chammady casts all of her spells before entering combat, using resist energy
  to gain resistance to fire.
DuringCombat: >-
  Chammady has rarely met a foe that could match her grace and deadly skill in
  combat, with the exception of her brother and perhaps the devil Melavengian.
  This has left her somewhat proud and arrogant&#8211;once combat begins, she
  makes a death attack against a foe if she has the chance, but she prefers
  straight-up combat so she can "show off." She fights with her two deadly
  daggers, focusing on human foes if possible and using Improved Vital Strike
  and Two-Weapon Rend to maximize damage.
Morale: >-
  Chammady is no coward, yet neither are her convictions as overwhelming as her
  brother's. If reduced to 30 or fewer hit points, she tries to escape.

  +4 glamered mithral chain shirt, +3 returning human bane dagger, assassin's
  dagger, belt of physical perfection +2, ring of chameleon power, ring of
  protection +3, sandals of elvenkind, well of many worlds, wings of flying,
  gold signet ring worth 1,200 gp, mithral earrings worth 800 gp
