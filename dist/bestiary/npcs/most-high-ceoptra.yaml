Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ceoptra activates her spirit shield and casts greater magic weapon on her
  dagger. She also casts endure elements on herself every morning. Once she
  realizes the PCs are in the Pinnacle, she casts air walk and death ward on
  herself. If possible, just before combat begins, she casts sending to warn
  Karzoug his enemies are near.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ceoptra prefers to let her giant minions engage the PCs at first while she
  hangs back and uses her attack spells at range. As soon as one warden of wind
  dies, she abandons this tactic and enters melee as well. She is fond of using
  Quicken Spell to augment her melee attacks, adding quickened
  blindness/deafness, contagion, hold person, and sound burst to full attacks.
  She uses quickened healing spells on herself each round she has fewer than 150
  hit points. Remember that quickened spells do not provoke attacks of
  opportunity, so she doesn't need to cast defensively when utilizing this
  tactic in combat.
Morale: Ceoptra fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  +1 unholy dagger, headband of alluring charisma +4, necklace of adaptation,
  ring of force shield, Sihedron ring, 4 golden ankle bands worth 2,000 gp each,
  gold and sapphire choker worth 6,000 gp
