BeforeCombat: >-
  Kulgara activates her +1 chainsawTG, unless she has a compelling reason to
  attempt stealth.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kulgara revels in the art of butchery with her chainsaw at close range, and as
  she attacks with it, she roars and howls in glee. She always Power Attacks,
  and if faced with a foe that's proving hard to hit, she prefers to switch to a
  different target rather than abandon the Power Attack tactic. She saves her
  plasma grenade for a special occasion (see Morale, below), but uses her
  inferno and zero grenades against foes who cluster at range, or if she feels
  she can take out multiple foes at once. Her bow is a weapon of last resort,
  since killing at range is so unsatisfying.
Morale: >-
  Kulgara is fanatic in her devotion to Hellion and fights to the death. She
  saves her plasma grenade for when she's reduced to negative hit points; using
  her ferocity ability, she activates the grenade after moving into a position
  such that when it explodes, she takes as many of her foes as possible with her
  when she dies.
