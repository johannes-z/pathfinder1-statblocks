BeforeCombat: >-
  The barbarian uses his warhorse for transportation, but if expecting combat,
  he retrieves an animal from his bag of tricks and rides it instead.
DuringCombat: >-
  The barbarian charges whenever possible, whether mounted or on foot, using
  Mounted Combat and his +1 arrow catching buckler to divert attacks made
  against his mount. If his mount is slain, he draws a replacement from his bag
  of tricks and makes a fast mount. He uses guarded stance and rolling dodge as
  needed, often using them or renewed vigor after a ride-by charge while
  circling around into position for another charge.
