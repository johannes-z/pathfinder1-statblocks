  - name: Death Burst (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a plague zombie dies, it explodes in a burst of rotting, infected
      flesh. All creatures adjacent to the plague zombie are exposed to its
      plague (just as if they had been struck by its slam attack) and must make
      a Fortitude save or contract zombie rot.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      A plague zombie's slam attack carries the zombie rot disease. Zombie rot:
      slam; save Fort DC 11; onset 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Con,
      this damage cannot be healed while the creature is infected; cure 2
      consecutive saves. Anyone who dies while infected with the rotting plague
      rises as a plague zombie in 2d6 hours.
  - name: Staggered (Ex)
    description: >-
      Plague zombies have poor reflexes and can only perform a single move
      action or standard action each round (so they could move or attack but not
      both). As a charge action, a zombie can move up to its speed and still
      make an attack in the same round.
