  The choker brutes lurk in the shadows in the rafters up above, watching
  observantly if they notice anyone attempting to move through the room. They
  swiftly move to attack as soon as they notice anyone outside trying to open
  the door, or 3 rounds after intruders from the south have already opened the
  door and are moving about inside the room.
Morale: The choker brutes fight to the death.
