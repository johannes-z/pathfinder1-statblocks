DuringCombat: >-
  Lottie wields the frying pan she grabbed from the Paddlefoots' kitchen with
  surprising skill, shrieking very unladylike curses and threats against the
  goblins.
Morale: >-
  Lottie tries to flee back to Sandpoint if reduced to 4 or fewer hit points,
  unless Mitzen can't accompany her. If Mitzen is killed, captured, or
  incapacitated, she fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  frying pan, courtier's outfit, perfume (tastes like minty licorice), bottle of
  fine wine (tastes even better than the perfume)
