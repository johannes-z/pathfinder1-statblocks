SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Steal Voice (Su)
    description: >-
      Up to three times per day, but no more than once per target, a yamabushi
      tengu can attempt to steal a victim's voice as part of its bite attack.
      When it does so, the creature bitten must make a DC 17 Will save or lose
      the ability to speak aloud. This prevents the use of any spell with verbal
      components and the use of command-word-activated magic items, among other
      difficulties. The yamabushi tengu's voice changes to match the one stolen.
      The victim's voice remains stolen until the oni steals another voice,
      until the oni agrees to give the stolen voice back (a standard action
      requiring the oni to touch the victim), or until the next sunrise. Any
      effect that removes curses (such as remove curse or break enchantment) can
      restore a stolen voice (DC 17), as does the death of the oni who stole the
      voice in the first place. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Susceptible to Patterns (Ex)
    description: >-
      A yamabushi tengu takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws made against
      illusion spells of the pattern subschool. For 1 round after a yamabushi
      tengu either makes a successful save against a pattern or recovers from
      the effects of a pattern, it is dazzled.
  - name: Yamabushi Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      A yamabushi tengu is proficient with all monk weapons and all swordlike
      weapons (including katanas and wakizashi), and gains a +1 bonus on attack
      rolls and damage rolls with such weapons.
BeforeCombat: The yamabushi tengus cast blur before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The oni attack foes with their spell-like abilities as they close to melee
  range, using flight or dimension door to position themselves for sneak
  attacks. Against spellcasters, the yamabushi tengus use their steal voice
  ability to take such foes out of the fray.
Morale: >-
  The yamabushi tengus are cowards at heart. If half their number are slain, the
  rest abandon Sennaka and flee the lodge.
Gear: thunderstones (2)
OtherGear: leather armor, katana*, composite longbow (+4 Str) with 20 arrows, wakizashi*
