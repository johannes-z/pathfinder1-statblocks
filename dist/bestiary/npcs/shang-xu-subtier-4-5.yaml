SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Lesser Hurling (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action while raging, Shang Xu can lift and hurl an object
      up to one size category smaller than himself with both hands or two size
      categories smaller with one hand as an improvised weapon with a range
      increment of 10 feet. This deals damage as a falling object (Core Rulebook
      443) plus Shang Xu's Strength bonus (+8). This damage is halved if the
      object is not made of stone, metal, or similar material. This is a ranged
      touch attack, and the target may attempt a Reflex save (DC 19) for half
      damage. Shang Xu may apply Power Attack to this attack as a one- or
      two-handed weapon, as appropriate.
  - name: Skilled Thrower (Ex)
    description: >-
      Shang Xu is skilled at throwing objects in combat. Increase the range
      increment of any thrown weapon or object by 10 feet.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Shang Xu uses his frightful gaze attack to paralyze as many foes as possible
  at the beginning of the battle, then enters a rage and charges the nearest
  foe. There is enough rubble within the monastery for Shang Xu to use as
  ammunition with his lesser hurling rage power. Shang Xu uses thrown rubble to
  target foes either fleeing combat or those attacking with fire-based ranged
  attacks. Unless otherwise noted in an area description, treat any thrown chunk
  of rubble as a small object.
Morale: >-
  Unless he has the obvious advantage, Shang Xu flees combat once he can no
  longer sustain his rage or if he falls below 20 hit points. He then attempts
  to hide, until he recovers from any fatigue, before trying to ambush his foes
  again; otherwise, Shang Xu fights to the death.
