BeforeCombat: >-
  Before ambushing the PCs, Tersula uses her wand of mage armor and wand of
  invisibility, and casts expeditious retreat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tersula casts entangle and hideous laughter to hinder the PCs as much as
  possible while her sister rushes in to steal the keg. She continues to use her
  wand of invisibility to further confuse the PCs as the heist unfolds, and
  casts offensive spells if need be. The sisters have taken pains to look as
  similar as possible, and try to keep the fact that there are two of them a
  secret.
Morale: >-
  Tersula imbibes her potion of cure moderate wounds if brought to 9 hit points
  or fewer. She has a long and close relationship with her sister, and neither
  is willing to risk death. If one sister is captured or falls, the other offers
  to surrender the keg to ensure her sister survives. The two are simply trying
  to steal the keg, and fight only if cornered. If death seems like an imminent
  threat, both attempt to flee, whether they have the keg in tow or not.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds, wand of invisibility (11 charges), wand of
  mage armor (50 charges)
OtherGear: masterwork quarterstaff, cloak of resistance +1
