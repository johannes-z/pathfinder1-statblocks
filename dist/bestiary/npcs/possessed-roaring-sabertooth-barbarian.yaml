    description: >-
      These barbarians have the Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points,
      natural abilities, and automatic abilities of 6th-level barbarians, and
      the Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, base attack bonus, base saves,
      alignment, and mental abilities of a shadow demon. The shadow demons
      possessing the barbarians can't use or activate their hosts' extraordinary
      or supernatural abilities.
Gender: Male or Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Before engaging Thurl and his minions, each barbarian consumes a potion of
  barkskin and a potion of rage.
DuringCombat: >-
  The barbarians focus their attacks on Thurl's minions, allowing the PCs to
  fight the dwarf directly. Once they turn on the PCs, they focus their attacks
  on other melee combatants. The shadow demons ride within their hosts and
  direct them to fight recklessly with no care for the hosts' bodies. To help
  maintain their ruse, the shadow demons don't make use of their spell-like
  abilities.
Morale: >-
  As soon as the host bodies are slain, two of the shadow demons flee by sinking
  into the ground to hide from the sunlight. Only Arastrax continues to fight
  the PCs. After his host is slain, Arastrax casts' deeper darkness to protect
  himself from direct sunlight.
