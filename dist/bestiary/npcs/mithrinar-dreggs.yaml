BeforeCombat: >-
  Before starting the siege, the oracle casts shield of faith on himself, which
  has already been calculated into his statistics. He utilizes locate object to
  guide the Technic League agents through the lodge.
DuringCombat: >-
  Mithrinar serves as support for the rest of the Technic League squad, using
  his wands of stone shape and wand of detect secret doors to help them search
  the Pathfinder lodge, providing healing as needed, and casting bless if he is
  in accompanied by at least two other agents. He is singularly focused on
  reaching and destroying the copy of A Thread of Silver, and he presses ever
  forward, despite resistance, even abandoning his allies or using them as a
  diversion as he continues to seek out his target.
Morale: >-
  Mithrinar knows the penalty for failing his Technic League masters is worse
  than death, and thus fights until utterly defeated.

  potions of cure light wounds (3), potion of gaseous form, wand of detect
  secret doors (14 charges), wand of stone shape (5 charges)
