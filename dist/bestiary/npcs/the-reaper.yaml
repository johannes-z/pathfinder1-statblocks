BeforeCombat: >-
  The Reaper casts entropic shield, communal resist energy, resist energy,
  resistance, spell resistance,  and spell immunity on herself and magic
  vestment on her armor. She adjusts her energy resistances based on the energy
  types she knows her foes use. She casts either spell immunity against a spell
  she knows her foes often use or command undead .
DuringCombat: >-
  The Reaper uses contagion to spread as much disease as possible and fights to
  the death, knowing she will rejuvenate. She makes free use of her malevolence
  ability to cause confusion and hesitation, confident that heroes are highly
  unlikely to strike down their own just to reach her.
