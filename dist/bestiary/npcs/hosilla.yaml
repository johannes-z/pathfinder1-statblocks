BeforeCombat: >-
  Hosilla prepares for combat by casting magic weapon, shield of faith, and
  virtue.
DuringCombat: >-
  Hosilla favors attacks against foes who are obviously worshipers of good
  deities. She uses her wand of spiritual weapon at range, but prefers to fight
  with her glaive. She prefers to attack humans, to make use of her Favored
  Judgment feat and judgment of destruction ability. Once reduced to 6 or fewer
  hit points, she switches to judgment of healing.
Morale: >-
  Hosilla tries to escape if brought below 6 hit points, trying to escape to the
  surface to make her way out of Kenabres to Drezen. If she escapes, feel free
  to have her appear again (with a few more levels, of course) as an enemy in
  the next adventure.

  weapon (8 charges), alchemist's fire (2), tanglefoot bag
