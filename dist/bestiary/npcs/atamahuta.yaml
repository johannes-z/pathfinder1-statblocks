SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Double Weapon Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      An atamahuta fights with an orc double axe. While making a full attack, an
      atamahuta controls its arms with both heads and does not take a penalty on
      attack or damage rolls for attacking with a double weapon.
  - name: Spellstrike (Su)
    description: >-
      An atamahuta can imbue its weapon with magical properties using its
      spell-like abilities. Whenever an atamahuta casts a spell with a range of
      "touch" from its spell-like abilities, it can deliver the spell through
      any weapon it is holding as part of a free melee attack at its highest
      base attack bonus as part of casting its spell. If successful, this melee
      attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. This
      attack uses the weapon's critical threat range, but the spell effect only
      deals double damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage
      uses its own critical multiplier. An atamahuta cannot make a full attack
      during the same round that it uses a spell-like ability unless another
      effect would allow it to do so.
  - name: Ward Off Distractions (Ex)
    description: >-
      An atamahuta uses one of its heads to defend against attacks while the
      other is using a spell-like ability, giving it a +4 bonus to AC against
      attacks of opportunity while casting.
