BeforeCombat: >-
  If alerted to the PCs' presence, Hestrig casts mage armor and magic weapon
  from her scroll to prepare for battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  If she has enough room, Hestrig casts enlarge person during a fight, sweeping
  her greatsword in giant arcs with her improved reach to use Power Attack and
  Cleave against her opponents, alternating attacks with spells such as snowball
  or magic missile. If faced with a formidable foe, she changes strategy and
  uses her Shield of Swings feat to increase her AC. Hestrig is loathe to use
  her elixir of fire breath, as she acquired it as an insurance policy against
  treachery from the ice troll Bordegga (see area Q2) or the cold fey in the
  tower.
Morale: Hestrig lacks the wisdom to flee or surrender. She fights to the death.
