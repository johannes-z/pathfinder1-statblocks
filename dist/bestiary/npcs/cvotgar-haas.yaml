SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Clockwork Augmentations (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because of the various mechanical parts fused to Cvotgar's body, his
      ability scores are built using 20 points. In addition, these augmentations
      grant him a number of unique abilities. Altogether, these augmentations
      increase Cvotgar's CR by 1. Mechanical Jaw: Cvotgar's metal jaw grants him
      a powerful bite attack that deals 2d6 points of damage and threatens a
      critical hit on rolls of 19-20. Special tubes that run the length of his
      throat allow Cvotgar to use blood drain as a free action on a successful
      critical hit with his bite attack, regardless of whether he has
      established or is maintaining a pin that round. Mithral Legs: Cvotgar's
      mechanical legs increase his base speed by 10 feet. Once per minute,
      Cvotgar can sprint up to two times his base speed as a move action, and
      doesn't need to move in a straight line when sprinting. Tri-Scythe Blades:
      Whenever Cvotgar attacks with a flurry of blows, he can use the adamantine
      blades jutting from his forearms to deal an additional 1d6 points of
      slashing damage as long as he hits with at least one attack from his
      flurry. This extra damage is not multiplied on a critical hit. In
      addition, the blades grant him a +4 bonus on combat maneuvers to disarm
      opponents.
