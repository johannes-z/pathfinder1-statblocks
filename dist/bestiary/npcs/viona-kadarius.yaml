SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mount (Ex)
    description: >-
      Viona's original mount died several months ago in a battle against Chelish
      soldiers, and the cavalier has not finished mourning her fallen partner.
      Currently, the half-celestial unicorn Laissis allows Viona to ride it, but
      it does not function as a mount for purposes of the cavalier's mount class
      feature.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Viona uses her Inheritor's breastplate to cast bless weapon on her lance
  before entering battle.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Viona uses her tactician class feature to grant
  the Shake It Off feat to her unicorn and lammasu allies and challenges one
  opponent as a swift action. She fights from the back of her unicorn mount as
  long as possible, focusing on the target of her challenge and using her
  cavalier's charge ability and Spirited Charge feat. Once both she and her
  allies are engaged in combat, Viona uses her for the faith ability to grant
  them all bonuses on attack rolls. In close-quarters combat, she resorts to her
  longsword and dismounts from Laissis to allow the unicorn to fight beside her.
Morale: >-
  Viona fights to the death to uphold her oath, refusing to flee or surrender to
  the forces of Hell or House Thrune.
