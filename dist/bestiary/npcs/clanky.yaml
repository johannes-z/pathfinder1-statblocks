    description: >-
      Once Clanky is reduced to half its hit points or fewer, it crackles and
      fizzles for 1 round (while continuing to fight) before exploding. Each
      non-construct creature within 10 feet takes 1d10 points of electricity
      damage (Reflex DC 11 negates). The save DC is Constitution-based.
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Skizzertz hears fighting in area A9 or A11, he directs Clanky to interpose
  itself between Skizzertz and danger.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once combat ensues, Clanky positions itself in whatever way best protects
  Skizzertz.
Morale: Clanky fights until destroyed.
