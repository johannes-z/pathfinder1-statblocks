SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Enslave Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      A kalavakus can attempt to enslave the soul of any mortal creature within
      60 feet as a swift action. The kalavakus must have line of sight to the
      target. The target can resist this special attack with a DC 19 Will save,
      but is staggered for 1 round even if the save is successful. If the save
      is successful, the creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If the
      save is a failure, the target's soul is enslaved- this creature takes a
      &#8211;6 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws against that
      kalavakus. If a creature with an enslaved soul is slain by that kalavakus,
      the soul immediately infuses the demon's body, affecting it with a heal
      spell (CL 12th). A kalavakus can have only one mortal soul enslaved at a
      time&#8211; if it enslaves a second soul, the first is released. This is a
      mind-affecting death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Horns (Ex)
    description: >-
      The kalavakus's numerous horns can easily catch weapons and yank them away
      from opponents. The demon gains a +4 racial bonus on all disarm attempts
      as a result.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Before the PCs have an opportunity to fight him, Yealek-Vor studies their
  tactics, identifies the most dangerous threat, uses his ring of foe focus on
  that target, and casts either shield of faith or divine favor just before
  combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Yealek-Vor is an intelligent combatant who alternates between spellcasting and
  brutal natural attacks as necessary. He favors debilitating his foes with trip
  an disarm attacks before killing them.
Morale: >-
  Yealek-Vor is not willing to surrender his rulership of Jormurdun, and he
  fights to the death.
