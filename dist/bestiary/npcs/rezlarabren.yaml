BeforeCombat: >-
  In an effort to keep the exact location of her lair hidden from outsiders,
  Rezlarabren often patrols its outskirts, hoping to preemptively strike against
  enemies. If she sees a viking ship or detects the presence of a dragonslayer,
  she casts invisibility to approach undetected.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once she has initially wounded her quarries with an initial attack using
  aqueous orb, sleet storm, or her breath weapon (if her foes were lined up for
  such an attack), Rezlarabren fights with a furious vengeance, targeting a
  single opponent at a time until all her enemies are dead, only relenting if
  surrounded. She prefers to fight while hovering to make such brief retreats
  possible, but isn't afraid to alight on a ship's deck if it means she can more
  quickly dispatch her foes.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than half of her hit points, Rezlarabren attempts to
  escape and return to her lair. However, if fighting vikings from the Lands of
  the Linnorm Kings, she becomes more enraged with each successive wound and
  fights fiercely to the death if necessary.
