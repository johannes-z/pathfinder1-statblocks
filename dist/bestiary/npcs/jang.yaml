BeforeCombat: >-
  Jang casts bear's endurance, bull's strength, and freedom of movement on
  herself, and barkskin and greater magic fang on her cougar companion, Ruanni.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jang opens up fights by casting flame strike. She casts aqueous orb to trap
  and gather up enemies, and casts call lightning if she encases multiple
  opponents in the orb, striking it to electrocute everyone trapped within. She
  targets any animal companions with dominate animal, and uses her wild shape
  ability to transform into a dire lion for melee.
Morale: >-
  Jang fights until reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, at which point she
  attempts to flee with Ruanni. If Ruanni is dead or trapped, Jang fights to the
  death.
