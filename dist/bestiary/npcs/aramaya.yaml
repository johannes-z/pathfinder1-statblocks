  At the beginning of her round, if there are no opponents adjacent to her,
  Aramaya uses the Combat Patrol and Combat Reflexes feats to make attacks of
  opportunity with her longspear (she gets a +1 bonus on these attacks of
  opportunity from her steadfast pike class ability). She tries to finish her
  turn without any PCs adjacent to her, either by moving with the Gliding Steps
  feat or by pushing the PCs back&#8211;ideally off the platform&#8211;with the
  Pushing Assault feat.
Morale: Aramaya fights until incapacitated or otherwise clearly defeated.
