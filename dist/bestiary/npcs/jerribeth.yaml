    description: >-
      Jerribeth can use this ability as an immediate action to either assume
      humanoid form or return to her true form.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: Jerribeth casts air walk, bull's strength, and eagle's splendor on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jerribeth opens combat by reverting to her true form as an immediate action
  and then using power word stun on a party healer. On the following rounds, she
  casts her spells and uses her spell-like abilities at range. Her first act in
  melee is to cast mirror image. She avoids full attacks against enemies like
  paladins or rangers who are quite strong in melee against demons, instead
  using Power Attack to make a single attack with her rod of the viper before
  moving away to keep her foes from being able to make full attacks against her.
  She casts heal on herself once she's reduced to fewer than 75 hit points.
Morale: >-
  Jerribeth teleports away to safety if reduced to fewer than 50 hit points
  after she's already used heal. She does not immediately return, but should
  eventually seek revenge against the PCs&#8211;likely after fleeing back to the
  Abyss to join Hepzamirah in the Midnight Isles.
Gear: >-
  rod of the viper, jailer's dungeon ringUE, prisoner's dungeon ringUE (4), iron
  key (opens all doors in the Ivory Sanctum except those to areas Q12a and Q19),
  bejeweled key worth 1,000 gp (opens the secret door into area Q12a), fine
  clothing worth 1,000 gp (automatically destroyed when she reverts to her true
  form), mithral key worth 600 gp (opens the door to area Q5)
