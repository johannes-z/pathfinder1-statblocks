IsTemplate: '0'
BeforeCombat: >-
  Finissario implants the astounding avoidance trick in itself. If intruders are
  obviously approaching, it casts mind fog and mirror image.
DuringCombat: >-
  Finissario blocks the trail by casting wall of thorns. Against a flying or
  particularly dangerous PC, it uses a hypnotic stare just prior to casting hold
  monster. The alraune attempts to snatch a likely PC to feed upon and then uses
  suggestion to convince the rest of the PCs to return to Jolizpan, leaving it
  with its meal.
Morale: If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, Finissario flees.
