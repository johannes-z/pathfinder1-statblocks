SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cold Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Svevenka emits an aura of cold in a 10-foot radius. Any creature in this
      range takes 2d6 points of cold damage per round (DC 28 Fort for half).
      Svevenka can suppress or resume her cold aura as a free action. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Exude Ice (Su)
    description: >-
      At will as a full-round action, Svevenka can exude a circle of slippery
      ice in a 20-foot-diameter spread centered on her. This ice remains in the
      affected area, melting away as normal for the ambient temperature. Moving
      into a square of ice costs two squares of movement, and the DC for
      Acrobatics and Climb checks in the area increases by +5.
  - name: Ice Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Svevenka gains a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls if her foe is
      touching ice. She never slips or slides on ice unless she wishes, and can
      climb icy surfaces as though affected by a spider climb spell.
  - name: Icy Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      Svevenka's touch deals 1d6 points of cold damage. Attacks she makes with
      metallic weapons deal +1d6 points of cold damage as well. Anyone who takes
      this additional cold damage must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or be
      paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Svevenka casts barkskin, bear's endurance, and cat's grace on herself before
  revealing herself to the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  Svevenka's first action in combat is to cast antilife shell. She relies on
  this spell to keep enemies from engaging her in melee while she summons
  creatures and uses ranged spells against foes. If her foes manage to engage
  her in melee, she wild shapes into a dire bear to continue the battle.
Morale: >-
  Svevenka fights until brought below 25 hit points, at which point she flees
  using transport via plants to escape to the opposite side of the Icemists; she
  does not seek another confrontation with the PCs.
Gear: >-
  +3 dagger, headband of inspired wisdom +2, ring of force shield, ring of major
  fire resistance
