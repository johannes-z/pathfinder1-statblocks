    description: >-
      As a full-round action, an undead ooze can expel 1d4 skeletons from its
      mass. Skeletons can act in the round they are expelled, and each skeleton
      conforms to the basic statistics for its size (see pages 250-251 of the
      Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). Slain skeletons are engulfed by the undead ooze
      and can be reanimated and expelled again in 1d2 hours. An undead ooze's
      form holds up to 7 skeletons. These skeletons are included in the
      determination of the undead ooze's CR.
