SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Arrow Barrage (Ex)
    description: >-
      A profaned paladin troop can fire a barrage of arrows as a standard
      action. This attack takes the form of up to four lines with ranges of 110
      feet. These lines can start from the corner of any square in the troop's
      space. All creatures in any of these lines takes 4d6 points of piercing
      damage (Reflex DC 22 half). The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Smite Good (Su)
    description: >-
      A profaned paladin troop gains a +5 deflection bonus to AC against good
      creatures and a +20 bonus on troop damage rolls against good creatures.
      Spell-Like
  - name: Abilities (Sp)
    description: >-
      The profaned paladin troop's spell-like abilities come from individuals
      within the troop and are cast as such; since the action of one member does
      not significantly change the troop's overall actions, these spell-like
      abilities are treated as quickened. Variable Genesis The curators of
      Fallowdeep's undead hordes each used their own techniques for preserving
      and reanimating the soldiers. Each troop of profaned paladins gains one of
      the following benefits.
  - name: Alchemical Reanimation (Ex)
    description: >-
      The troop consists largely of Moloum's alchemically animated undead, all
      of which expel toxic chemicals when harmed. The troop is immune to acid
      damage. If a creature damages the troop with a natural attack, unarmed
      strike, or non-reach melee weapon, that creature takes 2d6 acid damage and
      must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Petrified Preservation (Ex)
    description: >-
      The troop consists largely of petrified creatures that Aeonte unpetrified,
      killed, and then animated as undead. The process leaves the creatures'
      bones petrified and durable, giving the troop DR 10/- instead of DR
      5/bludgeoning.
  - name: Unholy Ward (Su)
    description: >-
      The troop consists largely of Klrau's blasphemous creations protected by
      Baalzebul's hellish power. The troop is immune to fire damage and gains a
      +4 resistance bonus on saving throws.
DuringCombat: >-
  The troop favors melee combat, casting silence or blindness to hinder
  spellcasting foes as it marches forward into a good position. Against flying
  or distant foes, the troop fires arrow barrages while maneuvering into a more
  advantageous position.
Morale: >-
  The troop generally fights until destroyed, but if the current situation has
  it at a clear disadvantage, the troop makes a tactical retreat to find a
  better position to continue the fight later.
