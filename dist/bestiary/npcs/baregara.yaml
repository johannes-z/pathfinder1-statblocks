SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Devouring Grapple (Ex)
    description: >-

  - name: Monstrous Challenge (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a baregara can make an Intimidate check to
      demoralize an opponent. If this check is successful, the baregara surges
      with power and gains the effects of bull's strength and bear's endurance.
      The caster level is equal to the baregara's Hit Dice. This ability is
      usable 3 times per day. One-Armed
  - name: Hold (Ex)
    description: >-
      A baregara's huge arms allow it to initiate and maintain a grapple without
      the standard -4 penalty for not having both hands free.
