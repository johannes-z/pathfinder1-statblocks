DuringCombat: >-
  Even though their regeneration doesn't work out of water, the scrags are
  ruthless and aggressive in battle. The scrags do more damage with their axes,
  but if a scrag consistently misses foes, it throws the axes aside in disgust
  to switch to biting and clawing.
Morale: >-
  Although the scrags are charmed, this doesn't make them foolhardy. A scrag
  panics if brought below 25 hit points, and immediately attempts to flee the
  castle and into the ocean to activate its regeneration ability. If a scrag is
  released from a charm monster effect, it immediately realizes it's been
  tricked and flees into the ocean at once, abandoning its duties.
