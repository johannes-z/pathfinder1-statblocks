DuringCombat: >-
  Corax casts resist energy (cold) against Melianse on the first round of
  combat. He then uses hunter's bond to grant half his favored enemy bonus (+1)
  to his men against Melianse while he shoots at her with his longbow or hurls
  alchemist's fire. Against the PCs, Corax orders his men to surround their
  opponents and quaffs his potion of bull's strength. He focuses his attacks on
  a lightly armored PC, hoping to gain a hostage to use for negotiation.
Morale: >-
  Corax is full of swagger, but he has no desire to give up his life for lumber
  in a forest full of it. If reduced to 15 hit points or fewer, he retreats
  (surrendering if necessary), vowing to practice his trade "some place where
  the damned fairies don't run the show!"
Gear: alchemist's fire (2), potion of bull's strength, potion of cure light wounds
OtherGear: >-
  +1 studded leather, masterwork cold iron woodsman's axe, masterwork composite
  longbow with 20 cold iron arrows, 17 gp
