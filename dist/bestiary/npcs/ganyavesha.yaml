BeforeCombat: >-
  In preparation for the battle, Ganyavesha casts the following spells during
  the minute granted: shield of faith, magic vestment, freedom of movement,
  protection from energy (fire), bear's endurance, mass bull's strength, divine
  power, and righteous might. She then activates her iron skin revelation before
  stepping into the ring. The effects of these spells have already been factored
  into her stat block.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ganyavesha activates her ring of blinking and employs her surprising charge
  revelation to move about the battlefield and avoid attacks, drinking her
  potion of haste if she has the chance to increase her movement. She hopes to
  deliver critical hits as often as possible to take advantage of the special
  abilities of her kukri of life drinking.
Morale: >-
  If reduced below 30 hit points, Ganyavesha uses the strongest healing she has
  available, then devotes herself fully to taking down the nearest target at all
  costs, surrendering only when reduced to 5 hit points.
