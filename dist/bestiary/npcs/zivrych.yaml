SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Beard (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a bearded devil hits a single opponent with both claw attacks, it also
      lashes at the same target with its spiky, filthy beard. The victim takes
      1d8+2 points of damage and must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or
      contract devil chills. The save DC is Constitution-based. Devil Chills:
      Disease-injury; save Fort DC 17; onset 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect
      1d4 Str damage; cure 3 consecutive saves.
  - name: Infernal Wound (Su)
    description: >-
      The damage a bearded devil deals with its glaive inflicts persistent
      wounds that cause 2 points of bleed damage. Bleed caused from an infernal
      wound is particularly difficult to stanch-a DC 17 Heal check stops the
      damage, and any attempt to heal a creature suffering from an infernal
      wound must succeed on a DC 16 caster level check or the spell does not
      function. Success indicates the healing works normally and stops all bleed
      effects on the victim. The infernal wounds caused by a bearded devil are a
      supernatural ability of the devil, not of the weapon.
