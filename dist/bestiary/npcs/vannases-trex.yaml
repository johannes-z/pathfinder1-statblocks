DuringCombat: >-
  Vannases mounts her horse Thunderscar and emerges from the stables as soon as
  possible when combat begins (unless delayed, she likely joins the fight at the
  start of the 4th round&#8211;or the 3rd round if the dottari act on the
  surprise round). She hangs back on the far side of the troops from the PCs and
  uses her arrows, starting with sleep arrows but then switching to axiomatic
  arrows against obvious worshipers of chaotic deities. She holds off issuing a
  challenge until she isolates a particularly dangerous foe among the PCs, at
  which point she charges that PC with her lance if she can.
Morale: Vannases fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  +1 chainmail, +1 composite longbow (+1 Str) with 4 +1 axiomatic arrows and 5
  sleep arrows, +1 lance, amulet of natural armor +1, 120 gp
