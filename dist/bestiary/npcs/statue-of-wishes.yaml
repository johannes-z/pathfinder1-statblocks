SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Grant Wish (Su)
    description: >-
      The Statue of Wishes may grant either a raise dead effect or an experience
      bonus to anyone standing in the target circle. There is a 20% chance of
      failure, however, for the spirit inhabiting the statue is somewhat
      capricious. Failure is automatic if a wish is made for anything other than
      reawakening or experience. If a wish attempt for reawakening is made, any
      single dead person on the flagstone is raised from the dead (CL 20th). If
      a wish is made for experience, one person on the flagstone gains enough
      experience points to gain the next level of experience. Note that if a
      wish is made for reawakening and there is no dead person on the flagstone,
      it is as if no wish had been made (i.e., there is no "failure" result and
      the statue is willing to allow another attempt at a wish). If the wish
      fails, however, the statue opens its mouth and the person who made the
      wish is magically pulled into the statue's mouth, which then closes (see
      Consume Wisher).
  - name: Consume Wisher (Su)
    description: >-
      Anytime the Statue of Wishes fails to grant a wishers request, whether
      from a poor wish or the capricious nature of the statue, the target is
      drawn into the statue's open mouth and trapped within the statue. Once the
      moth closes, the target is completely sealed inside the stone statue
      (there are no air gaps). The target dies by suffocation within 1d6 hours
      if not rescued (see the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook,
      "Suffocation," for more details). Rescuing a person who is trapped in the
      statue requires killing the statue.
