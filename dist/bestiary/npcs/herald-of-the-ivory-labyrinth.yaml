SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Glaive Mastery (Su)
    description: >-
      The Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth fights with two Medium glaives, wielding
      each as if it were a one-handed weapon with no penalty for size. These
      weapons do not increase his natural reach. He can cause any unattended
      glaive within 30 feet to teleport into his hand as a free action and gains
      a +2 racial bonus on all attack rolls and damage rolls with glaives.
  - name: Heartless (Ex)
    description: >-
      The herald has no heart, only a gaping hole that drips black ichor.
      Placing the Heart of the Herald in this cavity causes great pain to the
      herald, but to accomplish this, the herald must be willing, helpless, or
      being grappled by the person attempting to place the Heart in his chest.
      To place the heart while grappling, the character must succeed at an
      additional grapple check as if he were attempting to pin the herald. Once
      the Heart of the Herald is placed in his chest, the herald becomes
      staggered. He can rip the heart free from his chest as a standard action
      by making a successful DC 35 Fortitude save. Once he removes the heart,
      prying the heart from his hands to drop it is a second standard action.
      While he is in possession of the heart, the herald cannot use his maze
      gaze, smite Iomedaean, or spell-like abilities. Furthermore, an atonement
      spell that targets the herald while he is in possession of the heart deals
      1d4 negative levels to him (or 2d4+1 negative levels if the heart is still
      in his chest). If the herald succeeds at a DC 35 Will save, the negative
      levels gained are reduced to the minimum possible number (1 or 3,
      depending on the presence or absence of his heart). He takes a -5 penalty
      on saving throws against atonement spells from worshipers of Iomedae. If
      any atonement spell causes him to gain 18 or more negative levels, the
      corruption in him is immediately blasted from his body and he is restored
      as the Herald of Iomedae.
  - name: Infested (Ex)
    description: >-
      Anyone who grapples or is grappled by the Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth
      finds a swarm of wriggling flesh-eating worms burrowing from the herald's
      flesh into its own. This deals 3d6 points of damage per round the grapple
      is maintained and for 1d3 additional rounds after the grapple ends. Remove
      disease or a similar spell destroys these worms, but immunity to disease
      offers no protection. Casting remove disease or a similar spell on the
      herald suppresses this ability for 1 minute.
  - name: Maze Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      The Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth can cast those who meet his gaze into an
      extradimensional maze within his mind. This gaze attack functions as a
      maze spell to a range of 30 feet, save that a creature can resist the
      effects with a successful DC 27 Will save. Only one creature may be
      trapped in the herald's maze at a time. As a swift action, the herald may
      expend a use of mythic power to cause the walls of this maze to shriek and
      run with blood, causing a creature trapped within to attempt a DC 27
      Fortitude save to resist taking 1d4 points of Intelligence drain from
      encroaching madness. The saving throw is Charisma-based.
  - name: Repulsion Field (Su)
    description: >-
      The herald can turn ranged attacks and ranged spells back against their
      source. This ability works against only the first 1d4 ranged attacks each
      round. The attacker rolls or targets himself with the effect, and must
      make an attack roll or save against the effect as normal.
  - name: Smite Iomedaean (Su)
    description: >-
      The first time in a round that the Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth damages a
      worshiper of Iomedae with his glaive, the creature struck takes an
      additional 10 points of damage and must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save
      or be staggered for 1 round by an overwhelming sense of despair. Paladins
      of Iomedae take a &#8211;4 penalty on this saving throw, and are staggered
      for 1d4 rounds if they fail the save. The herald automatically confirms
      all critical hits made against a worshiper of Iomedae. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  The Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth begins combat by casting blade barrier and a
  quickened flame strike, then calls his glaives to his hands and proceeds to
  attack in melee in the following rounds. He waits to use power word stun on a
  foe once he's wounded it, and prefers to save his uses of mythic power to
  drive insane those who succumb to his maze gaze. As he fights, he issues
  curses and vile threats to any obvious Iomedaeans&#8211; he prefers to target
  these foes (paladins and clerics in particular) over all others if possible.
  He does attempt to remain within 15 feet of the tar lake at all times if
  possible so that at the end of each round the lake can attack anyone he's
  lured close enough.
