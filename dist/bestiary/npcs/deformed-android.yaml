SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Constructed (Ex)
    description: >-
      For the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as a
      ranger's favored enemy and bane weapons), androids count as both humanoids
      and constructs. Androids gain a +4 racial bonus on all saving throws
      against mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, and stun effects, are
      not subject to fatigue or exhaustion, and are immune to disease and sleep
      effects. Androids can never gain morale bonuses, and are immune to fear
      effects and all emotion-based effects.
  - name: Deformed (Ex)
    description: >-
      Due to the timeworn nature of the foundry where it was created, this
      android is deformed. Its ability score modifiers are different from normal
      androids as a result: +4 Str, +2 Dex, -6 Int, &#8211;2 Cha.
  - name: Emotionless (Ex)
    description: >-
      Androids have problems processing emotions properly, and thus take a
      &#8211;4 penalty on Sense Motive checks.
  - name: Nanite Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      An android's body is infused with nanites. Once per day as an immediate
      action, a deformed android can cause his nanites to surge, gaining a +7
      bonus on any single d20 roll; this ability must be activated before the
      roll is attempted. When an android uses this power, his circuitry-tattoos
      glow with red light equivalent to the light of a torch for 1 round.
DuringCombat: >-
  The deformed androids aren't much more intelligent than animals, but they are
  smart enough to patiently lie in wait like ambush predators, waiting for foes
  to spread throughout the room before lurching out to attack. In combat, they
  prefer to gang up on foes to flank and gain sneak attack damage. They throw
  grenades when faced with foes who gather close together, but prefer to use
  their morningstars in a fight.
Morale: >-
  The deformed androids fight to the death. A deformed android brought to 5 or
  fewer hit points activates its grenade to kill itself, hoping to take a few
  adjacent foes with it.
