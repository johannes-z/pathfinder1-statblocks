BeforeCombat: >-
  If aware of intruders in the palace, Yrax casts resist energy (acid,
  electricity, and fire) and see invisibility on himself. Once the alarm on the
  antechamber doors goes off, Yrax casts mirror image.
DuringCombat: >-
  Yrax lets out a deafening roar and activates his frightful presence while
  creating a freezing fog around intruders entering the sanctum, followed by a
  blast of his breath weapon. Yrax casts displacement as soon as possible
  thereafter to protect himself against ranged attacks. Depending on the tactics
  of those facing him, Yrax might swoop over opponents and use Flyby Attack and
  Greater Vital Strike with his bite attacks. If brought to fewer than 125 hit
  points, Yrax lands and makes full attacks against his most troublesome foe.
Morale: >-
  Here at the seat of his power, Yrax considers retreat only when reduced to 40
  hit points or fewer, and then only if he has a good chance of getting away.
