DuringCombat: >-
  If Besai has recovered his arcane bonded ring, spellbook, and spell component
  pouch, he assists the PCs as best he can in combat, but knows he's a scholar
  and academic more than a combatant. He uses his arcane bond to cast mage armor
  from his spellbook unprepared, and expeditious retreat to escape direct
  confrontation if he should be engaged in melee.
Morale: >-
  Besai is uninterested in dying in Passad's mansion and attempts to flee as
  soon as he takes damage.
Gear: >-
  (currently in the safe in area A13) dagger, ring of protection +1 (bonded
  item), spell component pouch, spellbook (contains all 0-level spells, prepared
  1st-level spells, and charm person, erase, mage armor, and unseen servant),
  wayfinder.
