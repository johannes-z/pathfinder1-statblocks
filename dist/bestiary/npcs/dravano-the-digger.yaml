    description: >-
      Dravano has claws on both hands, giving him two claw attacks each round.
      These claws afford him a burrowing speed through soil, sand, and gravel-he
      can dig through solid rock at a much reduced rate (about 5 feet per hour).
      This replaces the normal tiefling darkness spell-like ability.
Gender: Male
