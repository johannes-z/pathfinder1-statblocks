DuringCombat: >-
  Once the PCs enter the armory, Dent continues firing the ballista until an
  enemy climbs onto the platform, after which he switches to using his short
  sword. Bo uses the same tactic, helping Dent reload the ballista while firing
  screaming bolts from her heavy crossbow until forced to enter melee.
Morale: >-
  The old folks know their chances of outrunning the PCs are slim, so they stand
  their ground. Neither Bo nor Dent wants to die in the armory, and each
  surrenders if reduced to fewer than 12 hit points, but if one of them is
  killed, the other fights to the death.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, screaming bolt (3)
OtherGear: leather armor, mwk heavy crossbow with 10 bolts, short sword, 28 gp
