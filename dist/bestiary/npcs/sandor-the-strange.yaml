BeforeCombat: >-
  Sandor typically casts false life, prying eyes, overland flight, and
  protection from arrows on himself each day, and all are in effect when the PCs
  arrive. Assuming that the PCs are spotted by his prying eyes, he casts the
  following spells to prepare for their arrival: greater invisibility,
  protection from good, true seeing, and shield. He then hovers invisibly near
  the ceiling in the garret chamber, awaiting the necessity of defending his
  home.
DuringCombat: >-
  When the PCs enter, Sandor uses flight and invisibility to position himself
  before he begins hitting the party with lightning bolts and fear from his
  staff, then switches to ranged spells like disintegrate, cone of cold,
  phantasmal killer and others.
Morale: >-
  If badly wounded, Sandor casts mislead, ducks into a nearby room, then uses
  his scroll of shadow walk and seeks out Chammady and Ecarrdian-if he does so,
  he can appear in the next adventure as an additional enemy, but his report to
  the Drovenges does not encourage them to increase protection at Walcourt. They
  assume that Ilnerik has things well in hand, and neither is aware that there's
  something hidden in the treasury below that could undo their devotion to each
  other.
Gear: scroll of shadow walk
OtherGear: >-
  staff of the blue dragon, bracers of armor +2, headband of vast intelligence
