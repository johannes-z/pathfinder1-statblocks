Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Gaetane casts greater magic fang every day, and casts barkskin, bear's
  endurance, jump, and longstrider before entering combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Gaetane remains in the rafters, where he grants favored enemy bonuses to his
  soldiers and fires arrows at the PCs, preferably at human targets. If
  confronted in melee, he uses Vital Strike and bites foes, using Acrobatics to
  jump from one end of the chamber to the other to prevent foes from making full
  attacks on him.
Morale: >-
  Gaetane fights until reduced to 20 hit points or less, at which point he
  cowardly surrenders and attempts to bargain with the PCs, offering to exchange
  information for his life. If any other soldiers remain alive at this time,
  they drop their weapons and surrender as well. You can use Gaetane to fill the
  PCs in on the truth about the "poison plot" and even to give them additional
  information they can use against Irovetti when they attack his palace (see
  Part Four).
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds
OtherGear: >-

  archery, cloak of resistance +2
