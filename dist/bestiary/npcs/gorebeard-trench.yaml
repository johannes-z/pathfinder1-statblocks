DuringCombat: >-
  Gorebeard rages, then charges the closest, toughest-looking target, using
  Power Attack to gain a +6 bonus on damage rolls at the cost of a &#8211;3
  penalty on attack rolls. He uses Stunning Fist in the first 2 rounds of
  combat. If he reduces a foe to fewer than 0 hit points, Gorebeard must make a
  DC 20 Will save to resist the compulsion to smear his beard in the victim's
  blood on his next turn as a move action&#8211;this provokes attacks of
  opportunity.
Morale: Gorebeard fights to the death.
