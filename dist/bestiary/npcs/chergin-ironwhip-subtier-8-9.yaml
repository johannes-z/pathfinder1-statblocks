BeforeCombat: >-
  Earlier in the day, Chergin cast magic vestment on his shield, and stored
  inflict serious wounds in his warhammer. As guards inform him of approaching
  intruders, he casts extended bear's endurance, bull's strength, greater magic
  weapon, extended shield of faith, and stoneskin on himself, and uses his
  enlarge person spell-like ability. The benefits of all of these spells are
  already calculated in to his statistics. Just before the PCs arrive (using his
  crystal sight ability to time the casting), Chergin casts extended blessing of
  fervor on himself and on his sentinels.
DuringCombat: >-
  Chergin opens combat with his shard explosion ability, then uses a combination
  of spells and melee combat to fight the PCs. He makes use of the waterfall
  hazard if the opportunity arises, using his earth glide ability to avoid
  slipping down the waterfall himself.
Morale: >-
  Chergin is unwilling to surrender within a temple of Droskar, so he fights to
  the death. He taunts the PCs, offering them slavery instead of death if they
  surrender instead of "wasting his time." If he believes that he is losing the
  fight, he attempts to kill a PC and use animate dead to turn her into a
  skeleton under his control as a final act of spite.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds

  resistance +1, headband of alluring charisma +2, key ring, onyx worth 225 gp
