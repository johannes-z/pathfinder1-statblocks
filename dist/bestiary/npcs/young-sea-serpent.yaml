  The sea serpent alternates between the port and starboard sides of the ship,
  using its elusive ability, and attacks unwary PCs from stealth. Waverider's
  Revenge is much larger than the young sea serpent and thus it cannot use its
  capsize ability against the ship.
Morale: The Sea Serpent retreats back to the depths if brought below 5 hit points.
