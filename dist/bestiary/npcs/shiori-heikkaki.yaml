SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Elemental Stance (Su)
    description: >-
      Most shiko me can assume one of three elemental combat stances, but
      Heikkaki has mastered two of these stances. In fire stance, Heikkaki gains
      the burn ability (2d6, DC 21) and immunity to fire, and can cast burning
      hands as a spell-like ability at will (CL 7th). In wind stance, Heikkaki
      becomes effectively invisible while motionless, gains a fly speed of 80
      feet (good maneuverability), and can cast glitterdust and gust of wind as
      spell-like abilities at will (CL 7th). Heikkaki may switch between stances
      as a swift action.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Heikkaki casts false life every day and poisons her naginata with black lotus
  extract.
DuringCombat: >-
  Heikkaki begins combat in wind stance by making a death attack with her
  poisoned naginata, then flies into the air to cast displacement and dispel
  good. She stays out of melee reach to attack foes with her spells, combining
  normal spellcasting with quickened spells such as blindness/ deafness and
  touch spells delivered with spectral hand. If forced into melee combat,
  Heikkaki switches to fire stance and attacks with her naginata, casting
  mislead to maneuver around her opponents and make sneak attacks.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, Heikkaki casts quickened false life or
  vampiric touch to regain hit points. She fights to the death to keep intruders
  from trespassing in her mistress's domain.
Gear: black lotus extract (3 doses)
OtherGear: >-
  +2 silken ceremonial armor*, +1 naginata*, masterwork composite shortbow (+5
  Str) with 20 arrows, masterwork samisen
