BeforeCombat: >-
  Ilthuliak casts mage armor, shield, and invisibility (in that order) on
  herself before she initiates combat. As a result, the dragon's AC increases to
  an impressive 48&#8211;this may be far too high for your PCs to handle, so if
  you are worried that the battle won't be fair, feel free to replace mage armor
  or shield with other 1st-level spells like magic missile and obscuring mist.
DuringCombat: >-
  The dragon opens combat with her breath weapon, following up with a few rounds
  flying overhead and casting spells like acid fog, mass reduce person, and
  flesh to stone at PCs on the ground below. When her breath weapon recharges,
  she casts haste, then on the next round swoops down to land amid the PCs and
  uses her breath weapon again&#8211;on the following several rounds, she loses
  herself in the glory of melee battle, periodically taking to the sky to cast a
  few more spells.
