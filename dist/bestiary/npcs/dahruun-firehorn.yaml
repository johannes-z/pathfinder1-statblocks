SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Maze Mastery (Su)
    description: >-
      Minotaur elders possess a supernatural cunning when in the confines of a
      maze or labyrinth. In such areas, they receive a +4 bonus on initiative
      checks and a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks. In addition, a minotaur
      elder might enter a maze spell as it is being cast along with the intended
      target so long as the target is within 30 feet. This includes maze spells
      cast by the minotaur elder. Once inside, the minotaur elder can leave the
      maze as a move action. The minotaur elder and the target appear at
      opposite ends of a 30-foot-square chamber where all exits lead to the maze
      itself (and the only way out for the target).
  - name: Natural Cunning (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability is identical to the minotaur ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary
      206).
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Dahruun has saved against the Brimoraks' smoke breath and is not sickened
  while adjacent to them.
DuringCombat: >-
  Dahruun begins the battle using his powerful charge ability to gore the
  nearest PC. When reduced to 70 hit points or fewer, he uses his maze
  spell-like ability and maze mastery special quality to isolate a
  nonspellcasting PC and attempts to grapple and gore them to death.
Morale: Dahruun fights to the death for the glory of his dark lord.
