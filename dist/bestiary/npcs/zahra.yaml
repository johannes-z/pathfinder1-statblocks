SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Psychosis (Ex)
    description: >-
      Zahra is afflicted with the psychosis insanity, shifting her alignment
      from neutral good to chaotic evil and granting her a +10 bonus on Bluff
      checks to hide her insanity.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  When the secret door to area 4d opens, Zahra prepares for intruders by casting
  heroism, cat's grace and haste, in that order. If she has time, she also casts
  heroism and displacement on Moukadeem, using her arcane bond to cast the
  additional 3rd-level spell.
DuringCombat: >-
  One the first round of combat, Zahra uses her bladethirst bardic performance
  to give her scorpion whip the shock special property. She acts as support for
  Moukadeem, using her whip from distance either to deal direct damage or to
  trip and disarm those attacking him outright, and buffing his defenses as much
  as she can with her spells. Whenever possible, Zahra uses her Arcane Strike
  feat to boost the damage output with her whip.
Morale: >-
  If cured of her insanity during combat, Zahra surrenders immediately. If she
  remains insane and Moukadeem falls in battle, she flies into a rage, casting
  no more spells and making full attacks each round. While afflicted with
  psychosis, Zahra fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  +2 chain shirt, +1 scorpion whip, ring of sustenance, journal (written in
  Aquan)
