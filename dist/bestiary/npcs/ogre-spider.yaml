  - name: save Web (Ex)
    description: >-
      Creatures with the web ability can use webs to support themselves and up
      to one additional creature of the same size. In addition, such creatures
      can throw a web up to eight times per day. This is similar to an attack
      with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of
      10 feet, and is effective against targets up to one size category larger
      than the web spinner. An entangled creature can escape with a successful
      Escape Artist check or burst the web with a Strength check. Both are
      standard actions with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 creature's HD + creature's
      Con modifier. Attempts to burst a web by those caught in it suffer a
      &#8211;4 penalty.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The giant spider is 20 feet off the ground in the northwest corner of the
  room. She's hiding when the PCs enter the room (DC 21 Perception check to
  spot). She only attacks once all of the PCs are down in the pit.
DuringCombat: >-
  The giant spider is mindless and simply sees an opportunity for food. Once all
  of the PCs are down in the pit, she webs the first one she sees and then
  attacks the rest.
Morale: The giant spider fights to the death.
