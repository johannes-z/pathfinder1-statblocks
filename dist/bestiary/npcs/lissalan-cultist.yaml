BeforeCombat: >-
  If alerted to approaching enemies, the cultists wait until they can hear the
  PCs on the stairs and cast aid, entropic shield, and protection from good, in
  that order.
DuringCombat: >-
  To begin, two cultists take positions facing the stairs and engage the PCs in
  combat with their crossbows. The other two position themselves along the wall
  on either side of the staircase exit and lay down blast runes in the four
  squares directly in front of the stairs, renewing them as needed if the party
  does not take the bait and rush into action. Once the PCs are in the room, all
  four cultists cast divine favor and engage the party in melee. The cultists
  use the Channel Smite feat with each attack they make until they are out of
  channeling attempts.
Morale: >-
  After losing half their hit points, the cultists cast cure light wounds on
  themselves. If reduced to 10 or fewer hit points, they drink their potions.
  Otherwise, the cultists fight to the death in defense of their goddess's holy
  site.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, scroll of dispel magic, unholy water (2)
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork breastplate, masterwork heavy steel shield, masterwork flail,
  masterwork light crossbow, spell component pouch, wooden holy symbol
