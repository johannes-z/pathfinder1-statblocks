  Shanwen clambers up to use the Large crossbow, but if a PC makes it to his
  carriage, he uses burning hands against the largest group of foes. He only
  channels negative energy if he's surrounded by enemies and no Hellknights are
  in the area.
Morale: Shanwen is too proud to surrender, and fights until defeated.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds
