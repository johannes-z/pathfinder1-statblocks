  - name: Spirit Summoning (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a taiga giant may perform a 10-minute ritual to tap into the
      power and insight of his ancestral spirits. These spirits provide a +4
      deflection bonus to AC, immunity to enchantment and illusion spells, and
      one of the following spell effects: bless, endure elements, protection
      from evil, protection from good, or see invisibility. The effects of a
      spirit summoning persist for 24 hours. Thassilonian Specialization Thulos
      is a Thassilonian specialist, which allows him to prepare the bonus
      transmutation spell granted by his school specialization twice rather than
      once. He treats abjuration and enchantment spells as if they were not on
      the wizard spell list. Further details on this form of school
      specialization can be found on page 17 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting:
      Inner Sea Magic.
