    description: >-
      Duergar are dazzled in areas of bright sunlight or within the radius of a
      daylight spell.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Thugmar doesn't have any equipment that requires preparation, and saves his
  enlarge person ability for when he needs it the most.
DuringCombat: >-
  Thugmar is evil, but he is no fool. He doesn't want to fight the PCs,
  especially not to protect Jevana, and he absolutely does not want to die here.
  He fights defensively (&#8211;4 penalty on all attacks, +2 dodge bonus to AC)
  and with the intent to deal only nonlethal damage (&#8211;4 penalty to
  attack), making half-hearted swings that (with these penalties) mean he is
  unlikely to hit anyone. He tries to fight the most heavilyarmored person so he
  has even less of a chance to hit, and if he does happen to hit his opponent,
  he winces and looks apologetic.
Morale: >-
  If Jevana falls (even if the driders are still alive), he throws down his
  weapon and surrenders, preferably to a non-dwarf PC. If the PCs continue to
  attack him, he tries to flee.
Gear: warhammer
OtherGear: chainmail.
