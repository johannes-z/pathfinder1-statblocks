SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Holographic Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      Deacon Hope's spell-like abilities are as much a manipulation of holograms
      as magic. The save DCs of these spells increase by 2 when in the presence
      of holographic machinery (such as in areas D8-D10). Additionally, Deacon
      Hope's dimension door spell-like ability isn't as much actual
      teleportation as it is merely him manifesting himself through an
      electrical outlet or object on the recreation deck. As such, this ability
      isn't impeded by the Divinity Drive, but it functions only here on the
      recreation deck (areas D1&#8211;D17).
  - name: Memory Consumption (Su)
    description: >-
      Deacon Hope feeds on memories and knowledge via his incorporeal touch. A
      creature damaged by his touch must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or take
      1d4 points of Intelligence drain. For each point of Intelligence drained,
      Deacon Hope gains 1 memory point&#8211;a memory point fades after 1 hour
      if not used. The save DC is Charisma-based. Deacon Hope can expend memory
      points as free actions to accomplish the following effects. Arcane Recall:
      Deacon Hope can regain one use of a 3/day spell-like ability by expending
      2 memory points, or one use per day of a 1/day spell-like ability by
      expending 5 memory points. Corporeal Form: Deacon Hope can become
      corporeal for 1 round by expending 1 memory point. He loses the
      incorporeal trait and defense and his fly speed, but gains a speed of 30
      feet and a Strength score equal to his Charisma (22). Feat Absorption: As
      he inflicts Intelligence drain on a target, he can expend 4 memory points
      to gain one feat of his choice possessed by the target. This feat persists
      for 1 hour, during which time the target can't use that feat (this doesn't
      impact access to feats that use the absorbed feat as a prerequisite).
      Skill Absorption: As Deacon Hope inflicts Intelligence drain on a target,
      he can expend 2 memory points to gain one skill check bonus of his choice
      possessed by the target&#8211;he attempts skill checks with this skill
      using the target's total bonus, not his own. This skill bonus persists for
      1 hour, during which time the target attempts all checks with that skill
      as if untrained.
  - name: Vulnerable to Force Effects (Ex)
    description: >-
      Deacon Hope takes half again as much damage (+50%) from force effects that
      deal damage.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Deacon Hope uses hallucinatory terrain each morning as part of his morning
  sermon to make the ceiling above area D2 seem as if it were open to the air,
  complete with a day-night cycle.
DuringCombat: >-
  Hope hates a fair fight. He uses mirror image constantly, then shadow
  conjuration and phantasmal killer spells to create distractions. If he has
  allies, he stays mobile and seeks to maximize sneak attacks with his
  incorporeal touch, but when alone, he uses Improved Feint to do the same.
Morale: >-
  If reduced below half hit points, Deacon Hope flees to the theater and his
  sanctum beyond (area D10), but if cornered there in his Quiet Garden, he
  fights to the death.
