  The gray reaver rushes into melee with the largest opponent. It generally
  ignores opponents among the pews, as it doesn't like the uneven footing there,
  although it wades into the jumble of pews if there are no other targets in
  easier-to-reach areas.
Morale: The gray reaver fights until destroyed.
