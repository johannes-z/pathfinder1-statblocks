SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A vampire can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the vampire
      establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of
      Constitution damage. The vampire restores 5 hit points or gains 5
      temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit
      points equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood.
  - name: Children of the Night (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a vampire can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms,
      or 2d6 wolves as a standard action. (If the base creature is not
      terrestrial, this power might summon other creatures of similar power.)
      These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1
      hour.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      A vampire can create spawn out of those it slays with blood drain or
      energy drain, provided that the slain creature is of the same creature
      type as the vampire's base creature type. The victim rises from death as a
      vampire in 1d4 days. This vampire is under the command of the vampire that
      created it, and remains enslaved until its master's destruction. A vampire
      may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any
      spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed undead. A
      vampire may free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but
      once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again.
  - name: Dominate (Su)
    description: >-
      A vampire can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action.
      Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly
      under the vampire's influence, as though by a dominate person spell
      (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet. Eastern Weapon
      Training Akina's training allows her to treat katana, naginata, and
      wakizashi as martial weapons.
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by a vampire's slam (or other natural weapon) gains 2
      negative levels. This ability triggers only once per round, regardless of
      the number of attacks a vampire makes.
  - name: Gaseous Form (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous form at will (caster
      level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of
      20 feet with perfect maneuverability.
  - name: Shadowless (Ex)
    description: A vampire casts no shadows and shows no reflection in a mirror.
  - name: Spider Climb (Ex)
    description: >-
      A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though under the effects of a spider
      climb spell. Weakened Form Akina's transformation into a vampire was
      imperfect. She gains +2 natural armor from the transformation, rather than
      +6. Vampire Weaknesses Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic
      and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from
      mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don't harm the
      vampire-they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least
      5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee
      attacks against that creature. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard
      action. After 1 round, a vampire can overcome its revulsion of the object
      and function normally each round it makes a DC 25 Will save.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Akina attempts to hide, preferring to wait on the ceiling before dropping down
  on her enemies below.
DuringCombat: >-
  Akina uses Spring Attack to move into a position where she threatens multiple
  targets, then using Whirlwind Attack and Lunge to cut them all down at once.
  She uses her vampiric abilities such as dominate only against major threats.
Morale: Overconfident, Akina fights until destroyed.
