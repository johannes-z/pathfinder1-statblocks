SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Nausea (Ex)
    description: >-
      The noxious vapors and foul fluids that constantly weep and seethe from a
      hezrou's body are particularly heinous to those the creature grapples.
      Each round a creature is grappled by a hezrou, the grappled foe must make
      a DC 24 Fortitude save to avoid becoming nauseated. A creature nauseated
      in this manner remains nauseated until he succeeds on a DC 24 Fortitude
      save, or until a minute has passed during which he is not grappled by the
      hezrou, whichever condition comes first. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
BeforeCombat: >-
  If the demon can initiate combat, it casts unholy blight, following up with
  chaos hammer if there is time before melee.
DuringCombat: >-
  The hezrou uses blasphemy as soon as two or more enemies are in range, and
  enters melee on its next turn, using its grab special ability to hold an
  opponent while it bites and claws it to death. It prefers to deal with a
  grabbed opponent before all others, but an especially dangerous enemy
  convinces it to drop its current prey and attack the more deadly foe, either
  with natural weapons or another blasphemy.
Morale: >-
  The demon is bound by an abyssal agreement to serve Jevana, and fights to the
  death.
