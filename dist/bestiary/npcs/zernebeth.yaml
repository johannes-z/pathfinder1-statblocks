SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Siccatite Skin (Su)
    description: >-
      Zernebeth has infused a layer of cold siccatite into her flesh. This gives
      her skin a pale blue sheen, renders her immune to cold, and grants her a
      +6 natural armor bonus. She can make a touch attack to deal 1d4 points of
      cold damage; this damage isn't affected by Strength. Any creature that
      makes a successful unarmed strike, natural attack, grapple attempt against
      her takes 1d4 points of cold damage. Zernebeth loses these advantages when
      under the effects of a heat metal spell or similar effect, and is treated
      as a metal creature for the purposes of effects such as rusting grasp.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Zernebeth casts overland flight, false life, mage armor, and shield on herself
  and greater magic weapon on her zero pistol.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zernebeth casts invisibility on the first round of combat, then displacement
  on the next. She remains mobile during these rounds to confuse attempts to
  track her position. On the third round she casts disintegrate at the most
  heavily armored opponent. Thereafter, Zernebeth continues her assault with her
  next most powerful ranged spell, using her wands of charm monster or slow to
  manage serious threats.
Morale: >-
  Zernebeth attempts to flee if reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, teleporting
  to Andoran to seek shelter with her distant friend Alaeron. If she's allied
  with the PCs, she contacts them via sending to organize her return to
  Starfall. Otherwise, she teleports back to Starfall in 2 days to try to set
  things back in order as best she can.
