SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoid slain by a spectre becomes a spectre themselves in 1d4
      rounds. Spawn so created are less powerful than typical spectres, and
      suffer a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, &#8211;2 hp per HD, and
      only drain one level on a touch. Spawn are under the command of the
      spectre that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which
      point they lose their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and
      free-willed spectres. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in
      life.
  - name: Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)
    description: >-
      A raise dead or similar spell cast on a spectre destroys it (Will
      negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material
      component.
  - name: Sunlight Powerlessness (Su)
    description: >-
      Spectres are powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell)
      and flee from it. A spectre caught in sunlight cannot attack and is
      staggered.
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Animals, whether wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of
      a spectre at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer
      than that and panic if forced to do so unless a master succeeds at a DC 25
      Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. A panicked animal remains so
      as long as it is within 30 feet of the spectre.
BeforeCombat: If the spectres hear the PCs approach, they surround the entryway and wait.
DuringCombat: >-
  The specters attack the first PCs through the door, but they don't work
  together. Randomly determine each round who each one attacks.
Morale: The spectres fight to the death.
