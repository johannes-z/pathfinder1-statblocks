DuringCombat: >-
  The Blacknapes have long histories of fisticuffs, and prefer this as their
  primary weapon. They'll gang up on foes to enable sneak attacks, and are fond
  of grappling enemies and holding them down while other thugs punch and kick
  them into submission.
Morale: >-
  A Blacknape is a coward at heart, and flees if reduced to 20 hit points or
