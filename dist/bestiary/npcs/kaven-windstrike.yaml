DuringCombat: >-
  Kaven is most comfortable wielding small and fast weapons like daggers, short
  swords, or rapiers. In battle, he seeks out wounded foes, leaving stronger
  enemies for his "allies" to handle.
Morale: >-
  Kaven is a coward at heart, but his worries&#8211;that abandoning his "allies"
  too soon would reveal the depths of his treachery&#8211;keep him in a fight
  longer than he might otherwise remain. If brought below 10 hit points, he
  feigns death with a Bluff check, hoping to seize a chance to escape once
  attentions are focused elsewhere. If this tactic fails, he gives in to his
  fear and makes a run for it. Kaven has already betrayed his allies once, and
  if he thinks betraying the PCs might aid in his own survival, he won't
  hesitate for a moment to do so again. If the opportunity presents itself, he's
  not above taking a hostage&#8211;although he'd prefer to take someone smaller
  and weaker than himself if possible, like a wizard or a gnome or a halfling.
