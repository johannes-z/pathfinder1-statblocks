SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Legend Vessel (Ex)
    description: >-
      Prince Carrius houses within him the legendary souls of six of the
      previous emperors of Taldor. The souls are working together to further
      their cause and grant their unified power to Carrius's body. Carrius gains
      the advanced creature simple template. Because the souls are working in
      tandem, they never gain influence over Carrius, even when using abilities
      that would normally cause a spirit to gain influence over him. In
      addition, when Carrius is using the trance of three ability, the chosen
      intermediate power remains in effect indefinitely until changed. This
      increases Prince Carrius's CR by 1.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Prince Carrius casts freedom of movement, fly, mirror image, and true seeing
  before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Prince Carrius begins by casting greater invisibility and summoning elementals
  with summon monster V to disrupt spellcasters. He prefers to channel the
  Guardian spirit whenever possible, and his statistics reflect this. He readily
  uses astral beacon to use the marshall's call to bolster guards, the
  trickster's transfer magic, and the archmage's wild arcana. He does his best
  to flank with a guard. He reserves his legendary guardian ability to avoid a
  powerful spell or critical hit.
Morale: Carrius fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  +5 chainmail, +4 longsword, amulet of natural armor +2, belt of physical might
  +4 (Str, Con), cloak of resistance +5, headband of alluring charisma +4, ring
