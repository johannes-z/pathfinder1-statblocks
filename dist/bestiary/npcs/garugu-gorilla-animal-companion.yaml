BeforeCombat: >-
  If Chorkak is aware of the PCs' attack, he sends Garugu to the ceiling,
  instructing her to hide above the entrance to drop on the PCs from above.
DuringCombat: >-
  Garugu drops on the PCs from above on the first round of combat as a charge
  action, power attacking with a bestial frenzy until all of those attacking
  Chorkak are dead. If possible, she bull rushes enemies into the blade barrier.
Morale: >-
  Garugu fights to the death to protect her master and mate, Chorkak. If he is
  slain, however, Garugu reverts to normal ape behavior, no longer under the
  lich's influence.
