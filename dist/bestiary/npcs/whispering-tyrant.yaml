SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animate Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, the Whispering Tyrant can touch a dead creature and
      animate it as a skeleton or zombie, as if using animate dead. He can
      expend one use of mythic power when using this ability to animate the body
      as a different type of undead, as if using greater create undead. The
      Whispering Tyrant treats his total Hit Dice as his caster level for these
      effects. Undead created in this way are automatically under his control.
      The Whispering Tyrant does not need to expend any material components when
      using this ability. This ability replaces the creeping paralysis mythic
      lich ability.
  - name: Aura of Absolute Terror (Su)
    description: >-
      Living creatures within 60 feet of the Whispering Tyrant are paralyzed by
      absolute terror for 1d4 rounds, after which they are shaken as long as
      they remain within his aura. Once a creature has been paralyzed by this
      aura, it is immune for 24 hours. Mythic creatures can attempt a DC 39 Will
      save to negate the paralysis but are still shaken as long as they remain
      within the aura. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. This ability
      replaces the formidable animation mythic lich ability.
  - name: Perfect Necromancer (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Whispering Tyrant can prepare spells from his opposition schools
      without needing to expend an additional spell slot. He always succeeds at
      concentration checks to cast spells. He can have any number of undead
      under his control, and he is not limited by the total Hit Dice of those
      undead. This ability replaces the enhanced spellcasting mythic lich
      ability.
ProhibitedSchools: enchantment, illusion
BeforeCombat: >-
  The Whispering Tyrant casts fly, foresight, moment of prescience, shield,
  spell turning, and true seeing.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Whispering Tyrant targets grouped PCs with horrid wilting, mage's
  disjunction, and wail of the banshee. If seriously threatened, he casts time
  stop to relocate and hamper the PCs with spells such as forcecage.
Morale: >-
  Once reduced to fewer than 150 hit points-or 250 hit points, if the daemon
  accompanying him is defeated- the Whispering Tyrant resolves to obliterate the
  PCs. He detonates the nearby shard from the Shattered Shield of Arnisant with
  the Radiant Fire as a standard action. The consequences of this detonation are
  described on page 56.
