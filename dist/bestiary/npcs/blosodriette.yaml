DuringCombat: >-
  Blosodriette is cunning and practical, never striking in the open. She prefers
  to soften up opponents from hiding using her pipes of the sewers or her scroll
  of summon monster III before emerging. In combat, Blosodriette prefers to stay
  mobile by flying and taking shots with her blowgun; she uses swift poison to
  apply venom to these darts from her sting, and takes the time to become
  invisible every other round so she can use sneak attack. She uses suggestion
  to try to prevent a character with a good or silver weapon from attacking her,
  suggesting that the weapon is damaged and that the foe should avoid using it
  for fear of breaking it. Melee is a last resort for the imp.
Morale: >-
  More practical than brave, Blosodriette flees or hides if reduced to 15 or
  fewer hit points, but as long as her contract exists, she can't flee far. If
  faced with foes who are obviously able to finish her off (perhaps those armed
  with silver weapons, or who can hit her really hard), the imp surrenders and
  begs for the PCs to destroy her contract; being banished to Hell is preferable
  to death here on the Material Plane, after all!

  pipes of the sewers, scroll of misdirection, scroll of summon monster III,
