SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Vampiric Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      An alu-demon gains temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt each
      time she successfully hits with a claw attack. She cannot gain more than
      her target's current hit points plus the target's Constitution score
      (which is enough to kill the target). The temporary hit points disappear
      in 1 hour.
DuringCombat: >-
  The alu-demons combine melee combat with using suggestion to make a PC drop
  his weapons and shield&#8211;an unreasonable suggestion that grants the PC a
  +2 bonus on the Will save.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, an alu-demon drops her longsword and
  fights with her claws. If reduced to fewer than 9 hit points, she instead
  flees through a window and, terrified of her mother's wrath, flees the manor
  entirely.
