  - name: Around Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      Gundar's stalked eyes allow him to see in all directions at once. He
      cannot be flanked.
  - name: Eye Rays (Su)
    description: >-
      Each of Gundar's eye stalks can produce a magical ray once per round as a
      free action. He can aim both of his eyes in any direction. Each eye ray
      resembles a spell cast by a 12th level caster and follows the rules for a
      ray. Each ray has a range of 150 ft. and DC 21 save. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. The left eye produces a ray that mimics hold person. The
      right produces a ray that mimics hold monster. By combining the rays of
      both eyes, Gundar can replicate minor image. He does not have to succeed
      on an attack roll to use this ray. The illusion is generated at any point
      within range and in Gundar's line of sight.
  - name: Stun Cone (Su)
    description: >-
      Gundar's central eye can, once per round, produce a cone extending
      straight ahead from its front to a range of 30 ft. Creatures in the cone
      must succeed on a DC 21 Will save or be stunned for 2d4 rounds. The save
      DC is Charisma-based.
