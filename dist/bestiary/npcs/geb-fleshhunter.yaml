  The Fleshhunters cast shield and see invisibility, then hide to prepare an
  ambush.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Fleshhunters work in pairs or with Tycha to flank foes and take advantage
  of their Pack Attack feat. Before attacking, a Fleshhunter uses its studied
  combat ability as a swift action; it then makes a studied strike on the first
  hit. An injured Fleshhunter retreats to cast displacement before returning to
  the fight. Fleshhunters ignore paralyzed enemies to focus on those who still
  pose a threat.
Morale: The Fleshhunters fight until destroyed.
