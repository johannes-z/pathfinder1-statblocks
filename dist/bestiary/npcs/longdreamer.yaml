SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dreamwarden (Su)
    description: >-
      Any sleeping creature within 30 feet of a star monarch is affected by
      protection from evil and sanctuary (Will DC 20 negates). The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Glowsap (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a star monarch can spray a target within 30 feet
      with an adhesive spittle as a ranged touch attack. A creature struck is
      affected as a tanglefoot bag (Reflex DC 20 partial; see page 160 of the
      Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). In addition, this adhesive glows under
      starlight or moonlight, limning the target as faerie fire if used outdoors
      at night. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Navigational Awareness (Ex)
    description: >-
      Star monarchs never become lost and are immune to maze spells or any
      effect that would cause them to lose their sense of direction.
  - name: Starflight (Su)
    description: >-
      A star monarch can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through
      space at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip
      within a single solar system should take 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond
      should take 3d20 days (or more, at the GM's discretion).
  - name: Toxic Flesh (Ex)
    description: >-
      A star monarch's flesh is poisonous. A creature biting it or ingesting any
      part of its body becomes sickened for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC 20 negates)
      and is affected as if it had consumed a dose of arsenic (Core Rulebook
      558). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: Longdreamer casts cloak of dreams as a defense against melee attackers.
DuringCombat: >-
  Longdreamer uses deep slumber to incapacitate foes. She grabs opponents she
  can't put to sleep, flies to a high altitude, and drops them.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 40 hit points, Longdreamer retreats to her glade to
  recover. If confronted in her glade, she fights to the death.
