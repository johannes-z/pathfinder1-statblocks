    description: >-
      Valais is affected by spells as though she were an eidolon. In addition,
      spells or effects that have a special effect against humanoids or demons
      can also affect her, albeit with a +4 resistance bonus on any saving
      throws to resist the effect. For the purposes of the favored enemy class
      feature and similar abilities, she is only an outsider with the native
      subtype.
DuringCombat: >-
  Despite her demonic appearance, Valais has no interest in taking lives. She
  spends her actions sobbing and remaining solely on the defensive.
Morale: >-
  If Valias is reduced below 23 hit points, her demonic aspects assert control,
  and she begins attacking anything in sight until she's rendered unconscious or
  slain.
