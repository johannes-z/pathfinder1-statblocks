SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bloat (Ex)
    description: >-
      Twice per day, Hok Fong can exert himself as a free action to instantly
      gain 2d4 extra blood points, but doing so puts him at great risk (see
      blood pool, below).
  - name: Blood Pool (Su)
    description: >-
      Hok Fong can spend a blood point at the time of casting a spell to recall
      it immediately afterward as if it had not been cast. If Hok Fong ever has
      more blood points than his bloatmage level but fewer than twice his
      bloatmage level, he gains the sickened condition until his blood pool
      falls to or below his bloatmage level. If he ever has twice his bloatmage
      level or higher in blood points, he immediately flies into a homicidal
      rage, striking out randomly with his most damaging attacks and abilities
      at friends and foes alike for 1d6 rounds or until his blood pool is
      reduced to 0 (whichever comes first). At the end of his rage, his blood
      pool drops to 0, his hit points drop to -1, and he begins dying.
  - name: Corpulence (Ex)
    description: >-
      Hok Fong's rolls of fatty, blood-laden flesh grant him a +1 natural armor
      bonus. Feats Hok Fong's Bloatmage Initiate feat allows him to cast spells
      of the enchantment school at +1 caster level (his save DCs already
      incorporate this bonus, but duration and other level-dependent effects do
      not). His extreme girth, however, means that he is always considered to be
      carrying a medium load (already included in his stats).
  - name: Hemophilia (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bloatmages are particularly susceptible to bleed effects, and the DC of
      any Heal check to stop a bleed effect is 5 higher than normal. In
      addition, anytime a bleeding wound is inflicted on a bloatmage, he loses 1
      blood point. This loss of blood points is cumulative for multiple bleed
      attacks, but not each time he takes damage from the same attack.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Hok Fong casts false life, mage armor, and overland flight at the start of
  each day of the competition, and casts blink before the start of his first
  match in a given day.
DuringCombat: >-
  Hok Fong uses his enchantment spells to turn his foes against one another,
  preferring to use ranged spells and hexes from a distance.

  potion of cure serious wounds, scroll of heightened hold person (3rd level),
  scroll of heroism, wand of lightning bolt (20 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork quarterstaff, belt of mighty constitution +2, cloak of resistance
  +2, ring of protection +1, 50 gp
