SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Feign Death (Ex)
    description: >-
      With a successful Bluff check, a nightmare creature can make itself appear
      dead. Any creature wishing to ascertain whether the nightmare creature is
      really dead must make a Heal check opposed by the nightmare creature's
      Bluff check. The nightmare creature cannot move or take any actions
      pretending to be dead. In addition, whenever a nightmare creature falls
      unconscious, it appears dead. A DC 16 Heal check is required to ascertain
      if the nightmare creature is alive. Nightmare creatures use this ability
      to escape destruction, to gain revenge, or to trick foes into approaching
      them. The Heal check DC is Charisma-based.
