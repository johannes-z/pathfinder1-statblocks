DuringCombat: >-
  Safira lurks on the ground and uses her stealth to approach and maul the PCs.
  She only climbs into the trees to attack if Kalim commands her to do so.
Morale: >-
  Safira, ill-treated by her master, doesn't care to stick around and defend him
  if the fight goes poorly. She flees if reduced to 25 hit points or fewer. The
  PCs can also chase the wretched creature off by succeeding at a DC 20 Handle
  Animal or Intimidate check.
