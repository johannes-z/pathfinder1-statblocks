SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Force Longsword (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, Barenby can summon a crystalline longsword. Attacks
      with this blade resolve as if they were touch attacks and deal force
      damage. Outside of Barenby's hands, the force longsword vanishes.
  - name: Thousand Faces (Sp)
    description: >-
      Barenby lost many abilities tying him to the natural world upon the death
      of his monarch, but he has since learned to adopt mortal-seeming guises.
      He can create an illusory disguise at will as a standard action, as if
      using the spell disguise self (CL 20th).
BeforeCombat: Barenby prefers to strike when his prey is already exhausted or injured.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ghoom typically opens encounters with blasts from his crystal while he closes
  to melee. If surrounded, he teleports to safety with quickened dimension door.
Morale: >-
  Barenby is far less devoted to the society than his colleagues, and he is
  comfortable using his spell-like abilities to flee if clearly outmatched or
  reduced below 75 hit points. He knows about the secret passage (area E16) and
  will happily sell out Lotheed to save his own hide.
