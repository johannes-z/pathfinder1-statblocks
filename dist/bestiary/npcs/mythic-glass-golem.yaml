SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dazzling Brightness (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mythic glass golem in an area of bright light blinds any creature within
      30 feet that can see it for 1 round (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Once a
      creature makes this save, it is dazzled for 1 round and is immune to that
      golem's brightness for 24 hours. The DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Immune to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mythic glass golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that
      allows spell resistance.In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against a mythic glass golem, as noted below. &#8226; A
      shatter spell damages a mythic glass golem as if it were a crystalline
      creature. &#8226; A keen edge spell affects all of a mythic glass golem's
      slam attacks as if they were slashing weapons. &#8226; A mythic magical
      attack that deals cold damage slows a mythic glass golem (as the slow
      spell) for 3 rounds (no saving throw). &#8226; A magical attack that deals
      fire damage ends any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage
      for each 3 points of damage the attack would normally deal. If the amount
      of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it
      gains any excess as temporary hit points. A mythic glass golem gets no
      saving throw against fire effects.
  - name: Mirrorsight (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mythic glass golem's surface reflects images of nearby creatures-even
      invisible creatures-like a multifaceted mirror. When the mythic glass
      golem is attacked while denied its Dexterity bonus to AC or while flanked,
      as an immediate action, the golem can spend one use of mythic power to
      gain the benefits of all-around vision and see invisibility until the
      beginning of its next turn. The golem can use this ability even if it
      would not otherwise be aware of the attack.
  - name: Reflect Spells (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a free action, once every 1d4 rounds, a mythic glass golem can align
      its internal structure to enhance its resistance to magic for 1 round.
      During this time, the golem reflects spells (even spells that function
      differently against the golem as described in its immune to magic ability)
      as if under the effects of spell turning.
DuringCombat: >-
  The mythic glass golem focuses its attacks on the PC that dealt it the most
  damage since its last turn.
Morale: >-
  The mythic glass golem fights until destroyed or until all four gem carvings
  are illuminated in the proper order.
