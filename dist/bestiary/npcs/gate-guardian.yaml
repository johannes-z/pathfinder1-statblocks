SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. &#8226; A transmute rock
      to mud spell slows a stone golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with
      no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit
      points. &#8226; A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the
      golem's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic
      for 1 full round.
  - name: Slow (Su)
    description: >-
      A stone golem can use a slow effect, as the spell, as a free action once
      every 3 rounds. The effect has a range of 10 feet in a burst centered on
      the golem and a duration of 5 rounds, requiring a DC 15 Will save to
      negate. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The guardian is mindless and attacks the closest foe or the one that did the
  most damage to it on the previous round.
Morale: The guardian fights until destroyed.
