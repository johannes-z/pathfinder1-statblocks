SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a magaav can exhale a noxious cloud of reeking
      corruption upon a creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed at a DC
      18 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. A creature that
      successfully saves cannot be affected by the same magaav's breath weapon
      for 24 hours. This is a poison effect.
  - name: Infernal Wound (Su)
    description: >-
      The damage a magaav deals with its claws or rend inflicts persistent
      wounds that cause 1 point of bleed damage. Bleed damage caused by an
      infernal wound is particularly difficult to stanch-a successful DC 18 Heal
      check stops the damage, and any attempt to heal a creature suffering from
      an infernal wound must succeed at a DC 18 caster level check or the spell
      does not function. Success indicates the healing works normally and stops
      all bleed effects on the victim.
  - name: Master Grappler (Ex)
    description: >-
      A magaav can wield a weapon in both hands and still attempt to grapple. If
      it's not wielding a weapon, a magaav gains a +4 bonus on combat maneuver
      checks to grapple. A magaav does not provoke an attack of opportunity when
      attempting to grapple.
  - name: Shared Senses (Su)
    description: >-
      All host devils (gaavs and magaavs) within 100 feet of each other share
      the same senses. If one individual perceives something, all others within
      range are immediately aware of it. It is still possible for a magaav to be
      surprised or flat-footed even if other host devils within range are not.
BeforeCombat: The magaav commander drinks its potion of invisibility before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The magaav commander uses telepathy and shared senses to direct the attacks of
  the murder magaavs, while attacking foes with its bardiche and claws, or
  grappling enemies with its spiked armor.
Morale: >-
  If all of the murder magaavs are slain, the magaav commander teleports back to
  the Abrogail's Fury to report failure. Otherwise, it fights to the death.
Gear: feather tokens (anchor, 2), feather token (whip), potion of invisibility
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork spiked chain shirt, masterwork heavy wooden shield, +1 adamantine
  bardiche*, belt of giant strength +2
