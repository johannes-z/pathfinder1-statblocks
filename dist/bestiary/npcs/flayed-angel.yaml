SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gout of Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a flayed angel is physically struck in battle, the impact causes
      a spray of acidic blood to fly off the creature at anyone within 5 feet.
      Anyone in the area of affect must make a DC 24 Reflex save or take 1d6
      points of acid damage from this splatter. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Profane Presence (Su)
    description: >-
      The existence of a flayed angel is such an anathema to the order of the
      multiverse that its very presence is a profanity of nature. This presence
      provides it with a +10 profane bonus to Armor Class and a +2 profane bonus
      to its saves.
