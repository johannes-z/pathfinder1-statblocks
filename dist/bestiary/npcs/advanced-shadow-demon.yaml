SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sprint (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per minute, a shadow demon increases its fly speed to 240 feet for 1
      round.
  - name: Shadow Blend (Su)
    description: >-
      During any conditions other than bright light, a shadow demon can
      disappear into the shadows as a moveequivalent action, effectively
      becoming invisible. Artificial illumination or light spells of 2nd level
      or lower do not negate this ability.
  - name: Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shadow demon is utterly powerless in bright light or natural sunlight
      and flees from it. A shadow demon caught in such light cannot attack and
      can take only a single move or attack action. A shadow demon possessing a
      creature using magic jar is not harmed by sunlight, but if it is struck by
      a sunbeam or sunray spell while possessing a creature, the shadow demon is
      driven out of its host automatically.
