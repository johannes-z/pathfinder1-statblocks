DuringCombat: >-
  If Teenoch has allied with the PCs and is present here, Duchess becomes
  distracted and flies off to fight the demon instead of assisting Aglorn in
  combat. If focused on the PCs, Duchess becomes invisible and flies among the
  PCs, stinging them when she can flank with summoned creatures.
Morale: >-
  Duchess is inexorably bound to Aglorn and the devil cannot abandon her master
  while he lives. If Aglorn dies, however, Duchess becomes invisible and
  attempts to flee.
