SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Shadow Blending (Su)
    description: >-
      Attacks against a fetchling in dim light have a 50% miss chance instead of
      the normal 20% miss chance. This ability does not grant total concealment;
      it just increases the miss chance.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Uthil Mak knows that he has limited time to complete the ritual on all his new
  slaves and focuses on the task at hand. If he is alerted to the PCs' presence,
  such as by the shadow hound's bay, he drinks his potion of barkskin, and
  continues the rite.
DuringCombat: >-
  The fetchling backs against a wall or the Wightir Conjunction to avoid being
  flanked and fights any comers. He uses flurry of blows as often as possible,
  spending ki to add an extra attack when possible. If he takes more than 25
  points of damage, he spends ki to increase his AC instead. If reduced to fewer
  than 20 hit points, he counts on Mobility and his fast movement to get him
  away from threats and buy him a chance to use his wholeness of body ability
  and his potion of cure serious wounds.
Morale: Uthil Mak fights to the death.
Gear: potion of barkskin, potion of cure serious wounds
OtherGear: >-
  ceremonial dagger, belt of giant strength +2, bracers of armor +1, cloak of
  resistance +1
