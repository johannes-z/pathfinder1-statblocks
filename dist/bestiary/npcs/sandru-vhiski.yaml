DuringCombat: >-
  Sandru stays mobile in combat, using Acrobatics to avoid attacks of
  opportunity as he flanks foes and to prevent enemies from taking full-attack
  actions on him. He uses Power Attack in all fights, but does so with a
  relatively unique style that makes him seem more graceful than brutal in
  nature.
Morale: >-
  Sandru is stubbornly brave and has a hard time envisioning his own demise. As
  a result of this attitude, he fights to the death.
