    description: >-
      A Deathbower ooze can move through any sort of bog or undergrowth (such as
      natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its
      normal speed without taking damage or suffering other impairments. It can
      also move without harm or impediment through areas that are magically
      manipulated to impede motion, including the hedges of Deathbower.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Deathbower oozes lurk within the hedges and appear to be patches of rot. A
  successful DC 15 Perception check is required to spot them.
DuringCombat: >-
  A Deathbower ooze slithers toward the nearest opponent and attacks with its
  slam, issuing its foul-smelling stink the first time it hits.
Morale: Deathbower oozes fight until slain.
