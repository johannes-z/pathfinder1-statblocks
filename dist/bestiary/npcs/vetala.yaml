  - name: Corpse Possession (Su)
    description: >-
      This functions as the malevolence ghost ability, except a vetala can only
      possess a corpse or zombie of the vetala's size or smaller. A mindless
      zombie receives no saving throw against this ability. The possessed body
      functions as a zombie, except that it doesn't have the staggered special
      quality. When the host body takes damage, the vetala also takes half
      damage. While possessing a body, the vetala takes damage as if it were
      still incorporeal: it's immune to nonmagical attacks, and damage that is
      neither a force effect nor from an incorporeal creature is halved again
      (one-quarter damage). The vetala cannot use its corrupting touch while
      possessing a body. The host body is under the effect of a gentle repose
      spell while the vetala possesses it.
BeforeCombat: The vetala has animated 16 zombies as guards.
DuringCombat: >-
  The vetala inhabits a corpse to protect itself, possessing a new zombie if the
  PCs destroy its current host. It attacks using its withering gaze while
  keeping zombies between it and attackers. If the PCs destroy more than eight
  zombies, the vetala animates eight more. If the PCs destroy all the zombies,
  the vetala continues attacking with its corrupting touch.
Morale: The vetala fights until destroyed.
