DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, a soldier fires at a foe using a screaming bolt;
  these shrieking attacks also double as alarms for the keep. Menador soldiers
  prefer to break into equal-sized groups, with half of their number engaging
  foes in melee while the others hold back and provide support via their
  crossbows. They always use Deadly Aim with crossbow attacks, and their ranged
  attacks reflect this tactic in the above statistics.
Morale: >-
  Menador soldiers are loyal to House Thrune, and fight to the death until their
  leader, Captain Lucian, is obviously defeated. At this point, any remaining
  Menador soldiers make a fighting retreat to the east in an attempt to flee
  back to the Chelish heartlands.
