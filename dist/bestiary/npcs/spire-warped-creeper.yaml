    description: >-
      The damage from the Spire-warped creeper's tendrils increases to 2d4
      points of Intelligence damage per round. Also, the zombies it creates are
      more powerful because of the effects of the Emerald Spire-they are
      Spire-warped yellow musk zombies (see below) instead of normal yellow musk
      zombies.
