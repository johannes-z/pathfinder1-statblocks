DuringCombat: >-
  In its dragon host, Maukui revels in its destructive power and prefers not to
  cast spells. It opens combat with a breath weapon, then follows that up with
  physical attacks until it can breathe again. Simple tactics perhaps, but
  Maukui has encountered few foes who can stand up to a dragon's power.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 15 or fewer hit points, Maukui uses dimension door to relocate
  somewhere safe in the hive so that it can exit its dragon body and cast its
  preparatory spells before seeking the PCs out to continue the fight. If
  reduced to 0 hit points while in the dragon's body, the intellect devourer
  emerges from the dragon and is dazed for 1 round&#8211; something it would
  rather not have happen in a fight.
