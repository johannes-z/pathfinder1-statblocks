BeforeCombat: >-
  Working in pairs, the bandits hide in treed squares at the edge of the trail
  so they can set multiple points of ambush from cover.
DuringCombat: >-
  The bandits provide flanking for one another to use their Precise Strike feat.
  Where possible they end their turns in treed squares to secure cover and
  prevent attacks of opportunity. Once they appreciate the threat the PCs pose,
  they try to melt back into the woods using the Nimble Moves feat and Stealth
  to circle around with new points of ambush.
Morale: Once all but two bandits are subdued, the others flee.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds, tanglefoot bag
