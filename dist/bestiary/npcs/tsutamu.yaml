SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Command Skeletons (Su)
    description: >-
      Tsutamu has a unique bond to the skeletons found in Brinestump Marsh. He
      can command their actions as a free action via telepathy as long as
      they're within line of sight. If Tsutamu is destroyed, the other skeletons
      immediately collapse to the ground as well, for it is the samurai's will
      that keeps them animated.
  - name: Order (Ex)
    description: >-
      Tsutamu's order is ronin. Whenever Tsutamu is the target of a challenge by
      another samurai or cavalier and he issues a challenge against that
      character in return, he receives a +1 bonus on attack rolls made against
      the target of his challenge and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks
      made by the target of his challenge.
  - name: Resolve (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, whenever Tsutamu is required to make a Fortitude or Will
      save, he can take an immediate action to roll twice and take the better
      result. He must decide to use this ability before he rolls the saving
      throw.
  - name: Self Reliant (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever Tsutamu fails a Will save against an effect with a duration
      greater than 1 round, he can attempt another saving throw at the end of
      the second round of the effect. If he makes this saving throw, it has the
      same effect as if he had made the original save.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  When Tsutamu attacks, he issues a challenge to one of his foes (preferably
  another samurai or cavalier) as a swift action, allowing his melee attacks to
  deal +2 points of damage to that foe for as long as the foe lives. While
  challenging a foe, Tsutamu takes a &#8211;2 penalty to his Armor Class against
  opponents other than his challenged target. Faced with multiple enemies,
  Tsutamu commands his skeletons to attack opponents other than his target.
Morale: Tsutamu fights until destroyed.
Gear: >-
  broken masterwork chainmail, Whispering Shrike (+1 wakizashi; see page 61),
  bronze key on necklace (opens chest in area L6)
