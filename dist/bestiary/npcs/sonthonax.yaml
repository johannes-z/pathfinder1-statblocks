BeforeCombat: >-
  If planning a raid on a slave ship, Sonthonax often outfits his humanoid
  allies with air bubble and touch of the sea to give them more freedom in the
  water.
DuringCombat: >-
  Sonthonax prefers to fight from both air and sea, diving beneath the waves,
  then erupting over the side of a ship and strafing the vessel with his breath
  weapon. He often uses his repulsion at the helm of the ship to force the pilot
  and any crew away from the wheel, rendering the ship uncontrolled.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to a quarter of his hit points, Sonthonax removes himself from
  battle. He presses on longer if lives are at stake, including those of the
  slaves he hopes to free and his own allies.
