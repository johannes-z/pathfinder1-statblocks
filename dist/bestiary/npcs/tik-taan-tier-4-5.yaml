SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Feverish Fortitude (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures within 30 feet of a Tik Taan idol gain a +2 bonus on saving
      throws against disease and poison. The effect lasts as long as a creature
      remains within the idol's aura.
  - name: Mad Rage (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature bitten by a Tik Taan idol must make a DC 16 Will save or fly
      into an uncontrollable, violent rage. Those affected by this rage are
      treated as being under the effects of both the spells rage and confusion
      for 1 minute. However, whenever the affected creature rolls a confusion
      result that would lead it to flee or attack the bone idol, the idol
      instead chooses a target for it to attack. This is a mindaffecting effect.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Zombie Fetish (Su)
    description: >-
      Any zombie created within 30 feet of a Tik Taan idol rises as a fast
      zombie (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 289).
  - name: Inanimate (Ex)
    description: >-
      An idol is effectively a statuette and does little to suggest otherwise.
      Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is
      indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. Unless noted in its
      description, an idol can make use of the majority of its special abilities
      without moving, though the round after it does so observers can make a DC
      25 Perception check to notice minute hints-magical glimmers, minute
      contortions, etc.&#8211;suggesting that the idol is actually animate.
      Overt actions, such as an idol moving or attacking, make its nature
      obvious to witnesses, and to others who make a Perception check (as
      previously noted) even 1 round after it moves.
  - name: Share Abilities (Su)
    description: >-
      An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect
      itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or
      allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them
      specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are
      marked with an asterisk (*).
DuringCombat: >-
  The Tik Taan idols are intelligent enough to avoid melee combat if at all
  possible. Instead, they use their spelllike and special abilities to support
  Da'Tunga. Any person slain during combat is immediately animated as a fast
  zombie (see ability description below).
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 5 hp or less, a Tik Taan idol reverts to its inanimate state
  (see below), hoping that its attacker will lose interest. It continues using
  its spell-like and special abilities in this state. Every time one of the Tik
  Taan is destroyed all of the primates (including Da'Tunga) are stunned for 1
  round, casting the room into a momentary, gloomy silence.
