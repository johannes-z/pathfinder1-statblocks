    description: >-
      A winter witch gains endure elements as a constant, spell-like ability,
      but only against cold temperatures. This replaces the witch's 4th-level
      hex. Ice Magic When a winter witch casts a spell with the cold descriptor,
      the save DC of the spell increases by 1. She cannot learn or cast spells
      with the fire descriptor.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: Kiryena casts mage armor before heading into the cave.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kiryena uses her evil eye and misfortune hexes against the most

  chill on that PC. If she is cornered in melee, she casts frostbite.
Morale: >-
