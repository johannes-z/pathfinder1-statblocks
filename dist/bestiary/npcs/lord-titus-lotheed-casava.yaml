DuringCombat: >-
  Titus Lotheed-Casava is an excellent duelist but a terrible tactician and a
  reckless combatant. He simply charges forward into the fray, using Combat
  Expertise and Improved Disarm to frustrate opponents. If given a good
  opportunity (such as when an opponent moves to retrieve their weapon) Titus
  drinks his potion to heal any wounds he may have.
Morale: Extremely overconfident, Titus fights to the death.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds
