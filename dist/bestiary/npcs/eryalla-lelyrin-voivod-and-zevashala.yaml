SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Beauty of Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      Submissives are immune to bleed damage, and take 1 fewer point of damage
      from all slashing attacks.
  - name: Mistress (Ex)
    description: >-
      The succubus Delvahine is the mistress to all four of these alu-demon
      submissives. If any of these alu-demons ever willingly disobeys Delvahine
      or willingly allows her to come to harm, they lose all of their
      supernatural abilities save for their vampiric claws, and take a permanent
      -6 penalty on all saving throws against enchantment effects. If Delvahine
      dies, these penalties apply as well.
  - name: Mistress Said So (Su)
    description: >-
      The alu-demon submissives gain a +1 morale bonus on all attack rolls,
      saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.
  - name: Mock Obedience (Su)
    description: >-
      Any time an alu-demon submissive is affected by a charm or compulsion
      effect, she may make a second saving throw to break its hold at any time
      as an immediate action.
  - name: Pain is Pleasure (Ex)
    description: >-
      An alu-demon submissive has damage reduction 5/&#8211; against nonlethal
      damage.
  - name: Shield the Mistress (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever Delvahine would be hit by a ranged attack or melee attack and the
      alu-demon submissive is within 5 feet of Delvahine, the submissive may
      make a DC 20 Reflex save to be hit by the attack instead. If Delvahine is
      forced to make a Reflex save against an effect that normally allows a
      Reflex save for half damage, the submissive may make that Reflex save
      against the effect to take the full damage from the effect while
      preventing any of that damage from harming the mistress. Evasion does not
      protect the submissive from this particular damage. The submissive must be
      aware of the attack and cannot be flat-footed in order to use this
      ability. She can attempt to shield the mistress against up to 8 attacks
      per round.
  - name: Tirelessness (Ex)
    description: >-
      A submissive gains a +5 bonus on saving throws against sleep and fatigue
      effects.
  - name: Vampiric Claws (Su)
    description: >-
      Each time an alu-demon damages a foe with her claw attack, she gains
      temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage she inflicted. She
      cannot gain more hit points in one strike than her target's current hit
      points + the target's Constitution score (which is enough to kill the
      target). These temporary hit points vanish in 1 hour.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  The alu-demons start combat by using suggestion on heavily armored foes,
  suggesting that those foes take off their armor and gear so the demons can
  "get a better look at them." They then attempt to use charm person against any
  foes who resist this initial suggestion. They avoid melee as long as they can,
  hovering just out of reach of non-flying foes and using their ranseurs. If one
  alu-demon is forced into melee, the others join their sister, one flanking the
  foe and the others standing directly behind their sisters to attack with the
  ranseur via reach so all four can attack one target at a time.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, an alu-demon uses dimension door to
  travel to area H7 and takes up a protective position at her mistress's side.
  If that alu-demon has a charmed PC, she takes that PC with her when she
  retreats. Delvahine may or may not offer her children and their new pets
  healing.
Gear: >-
  masterwork ranseur, belt of mighty constitution +2, bracers of armor +3,
  jewelry worth 8,000 gp
