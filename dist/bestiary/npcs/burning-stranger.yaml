  - name: Shot (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a burning stranger can take careful aim with its
      firearms and fire a single, ruinous shot. This single shot always resolves
      as a touch attack, regardless of the actual range. If the burning stranger
      threatens a critical hit with this sho t, it automatically confirms the
      critical hit . Regardless of whether the shot is a critical hit or no t,
      it deals 6d6 additional points of damage.
  - name: Superheated Weapons (Su)
    description: >-
      A burning stranger fights with a superheated pepperbox rifle fashioned
      from glowing-hot metal. This firearm has a range of 80 feet and deals both
      bludgeoning and piercing damage. At a range of up to 80 feet, a burning
      stranger's firearm attacks resolve as touch attacks. While firearms
      normally consume bullets and black powder when fired, a burning stranger's
      pistols supernaturally reload the instant it fires them, allowing the
      undead to make multiple attacks in a round with the weapons. In addition,
      any pepperbox musket a burning stranger wields functions as a +1 pepperbox
      musket. A burning stranger does not provoke attacks of opportunity when it
      fires a superheated weapon in melee. When a burning stranger dies, its
      superheated weapon melts into a pile of slag.
DuringCombat: >-
  A burning stranger stays within its first range increment and makes full
  attacks with a focus on heavily armored opponents.
