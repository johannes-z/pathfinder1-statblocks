SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Skullface (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a krenshar can pull the skin back from its face,
      revealing the musculature and bony structures of its skull. This counts as
      using Intimidate to demoralize an opponent, and is an extraordinary
      ability. The krenshar can emit a loud screech while peeling back its skin,
      causing potent fear in a single creature within 100 feet that can see the
      krenshar. The targeted creature must succeedat a DC 12 Will save or become
      frightened (if the target has 6 or fewer Hit Dice) or shaken (if the
      target has more than 6 Hit Dice) for 1d4 rounds. A creature that
      successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same krenshar's
      skullface ability for 24 hours. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear
      effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The krenshar uses the heavy undergrowth to best position itself for its
  nighttime assault.
DuringCombat: >-
  The krenshar silently approaches the nearest sleeping PC hoping to get an
  unsuspecting victim. After its initial assault the krenshar uses its skullface
  ability to demoralize any awake PCs. If faced with PCs using ranged attacks,
  the krenshar reenters the heavy undergrowth and tries to reposition itself for
  another attack.
Morale: Desperate for a meal, the krenshar fights to the death.
