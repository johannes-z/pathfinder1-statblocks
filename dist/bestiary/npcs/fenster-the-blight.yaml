    description: >-
      Fenster is swimming in disease. If he critically hits a creature with his
      unarmed strike, or if he grapples or is grappled by a creature, that
      creature is exposed to a random disease, as determined by a d4 roll:
      1-filth fever; 2&#8211;leprosy; 3&#8211;red ache; 4&#8211;shakes. See page
      557 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for details on each disease.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  If Fenster sees the PCs attempt to open his chest, or if they enter his home,
  he shrieks and charges in to attack, hoping to get in a sneak attack on a
  surprise round if possible. If he can't reach a foe via a charge, he throws
  his dagger on the first round. He focuses his attacks on unarmored foes if
  possible.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 6 or fewer hit points, Fenster drops sobbing to his knees and
  begs for his miserable life.
OtherGear: rusty broken dagger, amulet of natural armor +1
