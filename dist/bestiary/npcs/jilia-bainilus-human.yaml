DuringCombat: >-
  Without a weapon, Jilia prefers to flee rather than fight. If she has allies,
  she takes an aid another action each round to grant a bonus to an ally's AC.
  If she gains a weapon (she hopes for her heirloom, Reprisal [see page 48], but
  otherwise prefers weapons she can use with Weapon Finesse), she fights with a
  bravery that rivals that of most soldiers, particularly when she fights at the
  side of allies or against a hated enemy, such as House Thrune.
Morale: >-
  With a renewed and obsessive hatred of House Thrune, Jilia fights to the death
  when facing agents of Barzillai or the church of Asmodeus, yet harbors a deep
  fear of the undead and of vampires in particular. She flees any combat against
  an obvious vampire unless the PCs can bolster her courage (how they can do so
  is left for you to determine&#8211;but a successful DC 20 Diplomacy or
  Intimidate check should do the trick).
