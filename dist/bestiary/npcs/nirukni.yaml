BeforeCombat: >-
  Nirukni drinks an extract of shield before combat, along with his mutagen to
  gain a +6 bonus to his Constitution and a +4 bonus  to his Dexterity. He also
  activates his wings discovery to gain a large pair of white feathered wings
  for the upcoming fight.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nirukni lets the disciples of Shax move in to engage foes in melee while he
  hangs back to throw bombs; he favors shock bombs, as these won't harm his
  cambion allies. He uses swift poisoning whenever he attacks. If reduced to
  fewer than 80 hit points, he drinks one of his healing extracts&#8211;if
  reduced to fewer than 40 hit points, he drinks his combined cure moderate
  wounds/invisibility extract and then uses his other healing extracts to
  recover as much as possible before rejoining the fight.
Morale: >-
  Nirukni fights to the death, but if reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, tries
  to destroy his notes with a bomb (AC 5). The extent of the damage his bomb
  deals to the notes described in the Treasure section below is left to you to
  decide, but at the very least the bomb should destroy all the magical items
  stored there.
Gear: >-

  potions of displacement (2), potion of gaseous form, deathblade (4), purple
  worm poison (6)
