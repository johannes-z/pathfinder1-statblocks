Bloodline: infernal
BeforeCombat: >-
  Just before he starts a fight, Gamigin attempts to summon 2d4 bone devils to
  aid him.
DuringCombat: >-
  Gamigin lets summoned devils engage foes in melee while he wreaks havoc with
  mobility, using wall of ice to break up enemy tactics. Cone of cold, ice
  storm, and charm person are favorites to use at range, but once he's engaged
  in melee he abandons his spell-like abilities and focuses his anger on obvious
  healers before moving on to other enemies.
Morale: >-
  Gamigin has lived for thousands of years by knowing when he's outclassed, but
  he's never been confronted here in Xin-Shalast. He cuts it close to the edge
  as a result, fleeing to a distant hideout via greater teleport only if reduced
  to fewer than 20 hit points. He does not return to Xin-Shalast anytime soon if
  he escapes in this manner.
