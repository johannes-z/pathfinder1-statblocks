BeforeCombat: >-
  Mictena is eager to stop the PCs, but after their recent victories against
  powerful foes, she is not foolhardy in confronting them. She casts
  invisibility and levitates above the gazebo, using a major image of herself to
  appear in the gazebo and interact with the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  Mictena knows that her aura will keep most  foes calm until she attacks them,
  so she initially targets only those foes that resist it. She uses her evil eye
  hex to reduce foes' attack bonus, followed by ear-piercing scream and web to
  immobilize enemies, then relies on burning hands and her own slam attacks to
  weed out those still free. She casts cure moderate wounds if reduced below
  half her hit points.
Morale: >-
  Convinced that the PCs are aberrations that could undo the Boneyard, Mictena
  fights until destroyed.
