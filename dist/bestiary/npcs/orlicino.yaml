BeforeCombat: >-
  Orlicino casts gravity bow as soon as he becomes aware of the PCs' approach,
  increasing the damage dealt by his bow by one size category (2d6) for 3
  minutes. He then climbs to the top of the fountain and readies an arrow to
  fire at the first person down the staircase.
DuringCombat: >-
  Orlicino uses a move action on the first round and every second round
  following to activate his hunter's bond for his teammates' benefit, targeting
  any human among the PCs. Every other round (or if lacking a suitable human
  target) he makes full attacks using Deadly Aim. He uses his bow as long as
  possible, even if enemies climb onto the fountain to engage him in melee, as
  his Point Blank Mastery feat allows him to make ranged attacks with his
  longbow without provoking attacks of opportunity.
Morale: >-
  Orlicino does not run until Lyone has surrendered, fled, or been killed, in
  which case Orlicino runs for the balcony and attempts to climb up the interior
  of the well.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds
