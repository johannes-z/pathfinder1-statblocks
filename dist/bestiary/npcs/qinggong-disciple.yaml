SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ki Power (Sp)
    description: >-
      In addition to the ki powers normally available to a monk, a qinggong monk
      may access additional abilities by expending ki. In this case, the monk
      can cast scorching ray as a spell-like ability (caster level 4th) for a
      cost of 2 ki points from her ki pool.
BeforeCombat: The qinggong disciple drinks her potion of blur before entering combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  The monk prefers to stay away from melee combatants, using her scorching ray
  ki power to blast foes at range and deflecting missile attacks with her
  Deflect Arrows feat. If forced into melee, she uses Stunning Fist to
  incapacitate her attacker so she can retreat back for more ranged attacks.
Morale: >-
  The monk is loyal to her master and fights until knocked unconscious, at which
  point she turns gaseous and wafts away in a cloud of vapor.
Gear: potion of blur, potion of cure light wounds
OtherGear: amulet of natural armor +1, 50 gp
