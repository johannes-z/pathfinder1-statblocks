  - name: Spellcasting Preparations (Sp)
    description: >-
      Auberon has cast a contingency spell on himself that activates when he's
      reduced below 100 hit points, casting empowered inflict serious wounds
      upon him. In addition, he cast spellstaff upon his masterwork
      quarterstaff, allowing him to cast maze as though it were a prepared
      spell. He has used permanency to give himself the permanent effects of
      arcane sight, see invisibility, and tongues. Finally, as long as he's in
      the Omen Dominion, he gains the benefits of foresight (CL 19th).
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Auberon casts mind blank, true seeing, empowered false life, and mage armor.
  Additionally, by using his spell study ability, Auberon casts freedom of
  movement (expending stoneskin and fear) and barkskin (expending acid arrow and
  invisibility). Auberon makes additional preparations based on his observations
  of the PCs via enter image. For example, if the PCs have powerful
  spellcasters, he casts spell turning; if they favor a particular energy type,
  he casts protection from energy; if they use summoned creatures, he casts
  magic circle against good.
DuringCombat: >-
  Auberon begins by toying with his opponents, using spells that incapacitate
  rather than kill such as mass hold person, empowered enervation, and power
  word stun. In his megalomania, he believes that showing his superior
  spellcasting will compel his opponents to submit to him. If that doesn't
  work-or if the PCs' party includes members of hated races such as merfolk or
  aquatic elves-Auberon instead uses damaging spells such as horrid wilting and
  lightning bolt.
Morale: >-
  Auberon surrenders if reduced below 60 hit points, as he does not know where
  he will rejuvenate if destroyed. His negotiations are described in area E7. If
  his surrender isn't accepted, he casts silent dimension door to escape, heals
  himself with his negative energy touch, rallies any remaining allies, and
  returns to attack the PCs.
