BeforeCombat: >-
  Satha casts false life on himself every day. Given warning about the nature of
  his opponents, Satha drinks potions of protection from energy and resist
  energy. If he expects flying enemies or needs to maneuver quickly, he casts
  fly. If he anticipates the need to flee, he casts rope trick in a hidden place
  to give him a place to retreat to.
DuringCombat: >-
  Satha tries to deal as much damage as possible at the start of combat in order
  to kill as many weak opponents as he can. Depending on the nature of his
  opponents, he may cast fire shield or shield, or use a defensive scroll. If
  battling undead, he either tries to kill them with brute force or disables the
  leader with command undead or halt undead to give himself time to destroy
  enemy minions. He likes to use his elemental wall ability to divide the
  battlefield to his advantage.
Morale: >-
  Satha has died once and doesn't want to experience that again; if brought to
  20 hit points or fewer, he flees, using elemental wall, expeditious retreat,
  fly, invisibility, or rope trick as needed.
