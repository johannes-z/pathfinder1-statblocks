DuringCombat: >-
  Calgredine rides into combat and charges the PC he can see who's wearing the
  most armor. He tries to ride by and circle around to repeat the action
  throughout the rest of combat. If surrounded, Calgredine dismounts and fights
  with his shortsword.
Morale: >-
  Calgredine is a brute, but he's not stupid. If his men are slain and there's
  no escape for him, he surrenders.
