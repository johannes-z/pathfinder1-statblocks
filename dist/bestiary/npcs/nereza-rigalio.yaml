BeforeCombat: >-
  Nereza casts detect scrying every day, and misdirection before going into
  negotiations to redirect spells onto a nearby object (she prefers to target
  her +2 axiomatic shortbow).
DuringCombat: >-
  Nereza favors ranged combat in a fight, but starts with magic and a bardic
  performance to inspire courage. She does so with a rousing speech, so that 
  when she casts greater invisibility, her allies can continue to be inspired.
  While invisible, she casts displacement, haste, and mirror image before moving
  on to cast offensive spells. At that point, she follows mind fog with her
  various mind-affecting ranged spells. She prefers to use her shortbow to
  attack, using Arcane Strike and Deadly Aim to maximize her damage. If reduced
  to fewer than 100 hit points, she casts greater invisibility again to help
  protect herself.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 30 or fewer hit points, Nereza casts shadow walk to escape,
  fleeing back to Egorian to recover and recuperate. Whether or not she returns
  to further diplomatic relations depends on if she was fleeing the PCs or a
  Skinsaw assassin (see page 10 for more details).
