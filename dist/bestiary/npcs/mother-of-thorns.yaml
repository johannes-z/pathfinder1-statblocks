DuringCombat: >-
  The Mother of Thorns attempts to dominate a character she suspects to be a
  rogue or a member of another class capable of performing sneak attacks. In
  melee combat, she uses her many methods of causing fear effects to make
  additional sneak attacks via her Shatter Defenses feat. She relies on her
  thorns and wand of enervation for ranged combat. During the battle, she 
  communicates with Kordaitra telepathically, keeping the Gray Maiden updated on
  her status.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 40 hp or fewer, the Mother of Thorns teleports to area E18,
  where she uses her wand of cure critical wounds and aid from Zenobia to heal
  her wounds and prepare for a rematch. When fighting at Zenobia's side, she
  fights to the death.
