      Rite serpentfolk has the wealth of a PC rather than an NPC. This equipment
      increases his CR by 1.
  - name: Permanent Spells (Ex)
    description: >-
      Through the arcane rituals of the ancient serpentfolk empire, an
      Amphisbaenian Rite serpentfolk has had the following spells made permanent
      on himself: detect magic, greater magic fang, read magic, and telepathic
      bond (between Nazith-Yol and Nylla-Jas).

      Str; cure 2 saves.
Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: Divination, Illusion
BeforeCombat: >-
  An Amphisbaenian Rite serpentfolk applies his physical enhancement to his
  Constitution score and casts extended false life and extended mage armor on
  himself everyday. If alerted to intruders in the temple, he casts extended
  protection from energy (fire) and extended stoneskin. If he has enough time
  before combat, he also casts fly and shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Nazith-Yol casts quickened magic missile and
  globe of invulnerability. He then casts extended slow on his opponents and
  commands the siege serpents to close ranks and defend against anyone trying to
  reach him. From this position of safety, he uses area effect spells against
  grouped enemies and rays against individual foes, as well as quickened
  spectral hand to deliver touch spells at range. If opponents engage him in
  melee combat, he protects himself with a resilient sphere, casting blur and
  mirror image before emerging to fight with his rod of the viper.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 115 hit points, Nazith-Yol uses his telepathic bond
  with his partner Nylla-Jas in area B14 and requests that she activate her ring
  of friend shield. Nazith-Yol fights until he has fewer than 60 hit points
  remaining, at which point he uses his change shape ability to take the form of
  a Medium earth elemental, earth gliding to area B14 to join Nylla-Jas.
  Thereafter, he makes a last stand by her side, teleporting with her back to
  Sverenagati if all seems lost.
