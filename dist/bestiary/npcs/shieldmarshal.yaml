SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Danger Sense (Ex)
    description: >-
      The shieldmarshal gains a bonus on initiative checks equal to 1/2 his
      shieldmarshal level, and can always act during a surprise round, even if
      unaware of opponents.
  - name: Eye for Detail (Ex)
    description: >-
      The shieldmarshal adds his Intelligence bonus as well as his Wisdom bonus
      on Perception and Sense Motive checks. Additionally, he gains a bonus
      equal to 1/2 his shieldmarshal level on Perception checks opposed by
      another creature's Disguise or Sleight of Hand checks.
  - name: Gunmarshal (Ex)
    description: >-
      The shieldmarshal adds 1/2 his shieldmarshal level to his gunslinger level
      for the purpose of gaining deeds. Within the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, the
      shieldmarshal gains a bonus on all Charisma-based skill checks equal to
      1/2 his shieldmarshal level if he openly displays his shieldmarshal's
      badge.
  - name: Labyrinthine Cunning (Ex)
    description: >-
      The shieldmarshal never becomes lost in urban terrain, and he never takes
      penalties to movement for poor visibility in urban terrain, even while
      temporarily blinded. A shieldmarshal can open or close doors as a swift
      action instead of a move action.
  - name: Legal Judgment (Ex)
    description: >-
      The shieldmarshal can pronounce legal judgment upon his foes as a swift
      action, providing a bonus or ability based on the type of judgment made.
      This functions as an inquisitor's judgment class feature and allows the
      shieldmarshal to use the legal judgment abilities on page 63.
