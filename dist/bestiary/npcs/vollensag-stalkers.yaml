DuringCombat: >-
  The werewolves rage on the first round of combat. They fight with their axes,
  biting only when given an easy opportunity to make second attacks.
Morale: >-
  The werewolves do not want the PCs dead&#8211;they want them to carry the
  Primals' threat back to Ascanor. As a result, they fight only until they have
  killed one of the PCs, or until reduced to fewer than half their hit points.
  At that point, they break off the battle, snarling a final warning to the PCs
  before running off into the woods.
