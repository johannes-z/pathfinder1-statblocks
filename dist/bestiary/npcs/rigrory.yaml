BeforeCombat: >-
  Rigrory burrows into a snowdrift at the base of the rocky mound and waits for
  the party to arrive. Rigrory recognizes Uliyara, and tries to use her
  deception to his advantage. He emerges from the snow, tells the PCs who she
  is, and demands that they surrender her to him. He threatens to call down the
  entire pack if the PCs don't acquiesce.
DuringCombat: >-
  If the PCs don't surrender Uliyara, Rigrory attacks. He uses his breath weapon
  on the first round, and then attacks the PC who looks easiest to trip.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, he attempts to flee while howling for
  reinforcements, hoping to get credit for locating Uliyara, even if he can't
  capture her.
