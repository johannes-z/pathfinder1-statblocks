SpecialAbilities:
  - name: s Displeasure (Su)
    description: >-
      Minagho currently suffers from a powerful effect placed on her via a
      miracle by Baphomet: she has 10 permanent negative levels and is in
      constant minor pain until she can convince the demon lord to forgive her
      for allowing the PCs to destroy the Kenabres wardstone fragment. As long
      as she suffers from these negative levels, she takes a -10 penalty on many
      rolls and her hit points are reduced by 50&#8211;these penalties are
      incorporated into the stats above. This weakness reduces her CR by 4, to
      CR 16. As long as she suffers this effect, she loses her branding, profane
      grace, and profane pact abilities, along with her quickened charm monster
      and her unholy aura spell-like abilities. Only by earning back Baphomet's
      favor are the negative levels are removed; should that happen, Minagho
      regains her lost abilities, and she is restored to a CR 20 foe&#8211; see
      page 48 of The Worldwound for further details on these currently
      unavailable lilitu powers.
  - name: Create Husk (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a swift action, when Minagho deals enough damage with a
      weapon, spell, or spell-like ability to kill a humanoid within 30 feet,
      she can opt to transform that slain humanoid into a husk. A successful DC
      26 Fortitude save negates this effect, allowing the victim to die
      normally. A humanoid transformed into a husk withers away into an immobile
      and desiccated corpse, but does not actually die&#8211;in this state, the
      creature remains aware of its surroundings but cannot take any action. A
      husk is essentially treated as an object with hardness 15 and 60 hit
      points. If a husk is destroyed, the effect ends and the body dies. This is
      a curse effect&#8211;removing this curse restores the victim to life at a
      number of negative hit points equal to the creature's Constitution &#8211;
      1; a husk restored to life in this way has 1 round to stabilize or be
      saved before it dies. Minagho can maintain 10 husks at a time. If she
      creates one too many husks, a previously created husk is released and
      immediately dies. Minagho currently keeps six other husks in her portable
      hole, but she must remove one from this extradimensional space before she
      can use her husk link ability. Her current favored husk is the body of the
      famous heroine Yaniel, which she keeps in an armoire in her lair (see page
      15). Her other husks are various other crusaders&#8211;you can customize
      these husks into specific characters if you wish. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Husk Link (Su)
    description: >-
      By spending a minute in blasphemous contact with a husk she's created,
      Minagho can establish a supernatural link to that husk. As long as she and
      that husk remain on the same plane, divination spells reveal the linked
      husk's alignment to be the same as Minagho's (chaotic evil). The husk link
      allows her to use her change self ability to assume a husk's original
      form&#8211;when she does, she gains a +20 bonus on Disguise checks made to
      impersonate that person. If Minagho takes enough damage to be slain while
      having an active husk link, the husk takes the killing blow's damage
      instead and is destroyed, instantly severing that link; if Minagho is
      disguised in the husk's original form, she instantly reverts to her true
      form.
  - name: Profane Wishcraft (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that accepts a wish from Minagho immediately becomes chaotic
      evil unless it succeeds at a DC 26 Will save. A creature that becomes
      chaotic evil in this way gains the benefits of a good hope spell for 24
      hours, followed by the effects of crushing despair for 1d6 days (these
      spell effects function at CL 17th). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Swift Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      When Minagho makes a full-round attack action, she can attack twice with
      each of her claws, for a total of four attacks per round.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Until the final confrontation at the end of this adventure, Minagho prefers to
  torment the PCs. She doesn't attempt to kill, but rather to vex and humiliate.
  She may attempt to disarm them via telekinesis and abscond with a valued
  weapon, use domination to set a PC against the party, or even use binding on a
  PC if she has the time. The tactics she uses once she seeks to finish the PCs
  off are detailed in the adventure.
Morale: >-
  Minagho uses greater teleport to escape after spending a few rounds tormenting
  PCs early on, but in the final battle she knows it's her last chance to make
  things right with Baphomet and fights to the death.
Gear: dust of disappearance (3), potions of cure serious wounds (2)

  hole, ring of spell storing (cure critical wounds, cure light wounds)
