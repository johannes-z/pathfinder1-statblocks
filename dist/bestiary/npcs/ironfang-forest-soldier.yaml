  These rank-and-file soldiers use straightforward tactics, targeting distant
  foes with their longbows, and swapping to melee weapons when opponents close.
  Whenever possible, they attempt to form shielded ranks, with a forward soldier
  wielding a shield and battleaxe while a partner stands behind and attacks with
  a glaive.
Morale: Ironfang soldiers fight to the death.
