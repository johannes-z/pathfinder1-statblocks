SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Crystalline Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      A crystallis's claws overcome damage reduction and hardness as if they
      were adamantine, but crumble to powder if removed or upon the creature's
      death.
  - name: Immunity to Earth (Ex)
    description: >-
      A crystallis is immune to natural attacks and supernatural abilities from
      creatures of the earth subtype, and to all spells with the earth
      descriptor. They are also immune to disintegration effects.
  - name: Petrification Cloud (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4+1 rounds, a crystallis can breathe forth a cloud of orange
      smoke as a free action. This cloud fills a 10-foot cube adjacent to the
      crystallis and lasts for 1 round before dispersing. A living creature that
      enters the cloud must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be petrified,
      transforming into a crystalline statue. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  Both elder crystallises breath out petrification clouds on the first round,
  trying to catch as many enemies within as they can, then breathe again as
  often as they can. They prefer to focus attacks on the same foe, starting with
  the strongest-looking characters first since they know spellcasters will have
  problems with the noqual in the walls.
Morale: The crystallises fight to the death.
