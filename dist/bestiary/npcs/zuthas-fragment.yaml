  arcane bond (+1 conductive scythe), enhanced ability scores, power over
  undead, shadowy remnants
Source: AP 135
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Contingency (Sp)
    description: >-
      Zutha's fragment has the benefit of a contingency spell in effect whenever
      he is manifested by the runewaking ritual. This contingency spell causes a
      greater invisibility spell to activate on Zutha if he takes damage. Both
      the contingency and the greater invisibility spell function at CL 20th.
  - name: Enhanced Ability Scores (Ex)
    description: >-
      As with the other runelords, Zutha used wish spells to increase his
      ability scores. This fragment retains an echo of those effects and has a
      +4 inherent bonus to its Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and
      Charisma scores.
  - name: Shadow Gear (Ex)
    description: >-
      When completed, the runewaking ritual equips Zutha's fragment with shadowy
      reflections of his favored magic items-his scythe and his rings. In this
      form, Zutha's scythe functions as a +1 conductiveUE scythe (which also
      functions as his arcane bond), while the combination of his rings gives
      him a +5 deflection bonus to his Armor Class, a +1 insight bonus to his
      Armor Class, a +3 resistance bonus on saving throws, and a +2 enhancement
      bonus to his Charisma score. These effects are intrinsic parts of his
      being-if one of his rings or his scythe is lost, dropped, or removed, it
      turns to shadows and vanishes at the end of the round only to instantly
      reappear on Zutha's person.
  - name: Shadowy Remnants (Su)
    description: >-
      Zutha's fragment does not have the standard lich ability of rejuvenation.
      When destroyed, Zutha and his shadow gear collapse into a pile of decay
      and ruin that, over the course of several minutes, wafts away into shadows
      before fading entirely from the physical world. During that time, though,
      any living creatures within 300 feet of the runelord feel raw necromantic
      power metaphysically caressing their souls. All creatures in this area of
      effect gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against attacks from undead
      creatures. This bonus persists until the creature is slain by a death
      effect-when this occurs, the +2 bonus is expended and the death effect
      that would have otherwise slain the creature is negated. A creature that
      becomes enhanced by these shadowy remnants instinctively understands the
      benefit and knows how this protection functions. Note that if the
      fragment's existence ends as a result of the expiration of the runewaking
      ritual's 1-minute duration, he and his shadow gear disappear but nearby
      creatures do not gain the necromantic power.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  As Zutha's fragment manifests, some of his prepared spells (those he casts
  most often when preparing for battle) are automatically cast on him. This
  takes no action from Zutha but expends the spells from his list as if he had
  cast them normally. The spells cast in this fashion are false life, fly, and
  mage armor.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zutha's fragment has full knowledge of the runelord's combat tactics and
  spellcasting but little concept of the world beyond the Tarnished Temple. This
  allows him to fight the PCs effectively but prevents him from attempting to
  simply flee a fight to try to establish himself elsewhere in the world
  (something he'd not be able to do anyway, considering the 1-minute duration of
  his manifestation).  His first act in combat is to fly into the air to put
  some distance between himself and his foes, after which he casts quickened
  displacement and then finger of death on the primary caster of the runewaking
  ritual. During the second round, Zutha casts quickened mirror image and
  another finger of death on the character that posed the greatest threat to him
  on the previous round. During the third round, he casts quickened
  blindness/deafness on a ranged combatant, along with disintegrate. He
  continues to rely on range or invisibility to protect himself in following
  rounds, resorting to attacks with his +1 conductive scythe only if he faces a
  single foe or hopes to paralyze someone who is particularly vexing.
Morale: >-
  Zutha's fragment fights until destroyed, or until it fades away after the
  runewaking ritual's 1-minute duration ends.
