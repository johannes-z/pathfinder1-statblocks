BeforeCombat: >-
  Melazmera casts mirage arcana and alarm (mental) every day to conceal and
  protect her treasure, making the mound of wealth look like a mound of rubble
  against the north wall of the cavern. She casts false life on herself every
  moonrise.
DuringCombat: >-
  If confronted while she's carrying her partially eaten catoblepas, Melazmera's
  first action in combat is to use the freshly slain corpse as an improvised
  thrown weapon (ranged attack +12, damage 2d8+10) that creates a 10-foot-radius
  cloud of poison gas equal to a catoblepas's breath for 1d4 rounds (Pathfinder
  RPG Bestiary 2 52). She prefers to use her breath weapon as shadow breath to
  weaken foes. She casts shield on herself if it becomes apparent that her
  enemies can hit her with ease. Her experiences as the apex predator of
  Colyphyr have given her something of a skewed sense of power, and she prefers
  to use her 1st-level spells to attack foes at range. As soon as she's reduced
  to fewer than 150 hit points, she casts heal on herself. If she returns to her
  lair and finds anything from her hoard is missing, she casts locate object on
  the missing item to aid in tracking it down.
Morale: >-
  Melazmera casts teleport to retreat higher up the mountain if she's reduced to
  fewer than 75 hit points, then casts healing spells on herself until  she's
  back at full hit points before returning to pick up the fight again. When she
  does return, she lands on a nearby ledge opposite the entrance to her cave and
  uses project image to place herself at the entrance to area J2, attempting to
  finish the fight through this relatively safe method. If this tactic isn't an
  option, though, she fights to the death.
