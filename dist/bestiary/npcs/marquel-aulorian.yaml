  - name: Withered Arm (Ex)
    description: >-
      One of Marquel's arms is withered and useless. He can't use the arm to
      take actions or carry objects, and takes a -4 penalty on Climb, Disable
      Device, Sleight of Hand, and Swim checks and to his CMD (these modifiers
      are incorporated into the above statistics). He can't use two-handed
      weapons at all.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  In a fight, Marquel always uses the total defense option, and either seeks
  support from others or simply attempts to flee. He has no taste for violence,
  and uses his rapier only to defend himself.
Morale: >-
  Marquel flees combat as soon as he takes any damage. The one exception is if
  he believes Cassius Sargaeta is in danger&#8211;Marquel fights to the death if
  he thinks doing so will save his beloved.
