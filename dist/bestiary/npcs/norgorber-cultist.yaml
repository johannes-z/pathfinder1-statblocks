DuringCombat: >-
  The cultists prefer playing support roles, hanging back in a battle with
  sanctuary or invisibility spells in effect so they can move to and fro casting
  healing spells on those better suited for combat. If directly confronted, they
  rely heavily upon their ability to channel negative energy and confusion
  spells.
Morale: The cultists are fanatic and fight to the death.
Gear: potions of cure moderate wounds (2), potions of invisibility (2)
