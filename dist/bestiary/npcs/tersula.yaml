BeforeCombat: >-
  Before ambushing the PCs, Tersula uses her wand of mage armor and imbibes her
  potion of invisibility.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tersula immediately casts sleep to knock out as many PCs as possible while her
  sister rushes in to steal the keg. She uses vanish, which makes her invisible
  for 2 rounds, to further confuse the PCs as the heist unfolds. The sisters
  have taken pains to look as similar as possible, and try to keep the fact that
  there are two of them a secret.
Morale: >-
  Tersula imbibes her potion of cure light wounds if brought to 4 hit points or
  fewer. She has a long and close relationship with her sister, and neither is
  willing to risk death. If one sister is captured or falls, the other offers to
  surrender the keg to ensure her sister survives. The two are simply trying to
  steal the keg, and fight only if cornered. If death seems like an imminent
  threat, both attempt to flee, whether they have the keg in tow or not.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure light wounds, potion of invisibility, wand of mage armor (15
  charges)
OtherGear: quarterstaff
