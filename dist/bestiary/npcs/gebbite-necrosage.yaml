BeforeCombat: >-
  A necrosage uses its armor of bones revelation and casts false life and shield
  of faith.
DuringCombat: >-
  The necrosage casts unholy blight on groups of foes, then enters melee to cast
  inflict spells. When within 30 feet of Amaretos, the necrosage benefits from
  his armor's sacrilegious aura (a +2 profane bonus on attacks, damage rolls,
  and saving throws); these benefits are not included in necrosage's statistics.
Morale: Gebbite necrosages are fanatically loyal and fight to the death.
