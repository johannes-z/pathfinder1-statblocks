SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When a dark stalker is slain, its body combusts in a flash of white-hot
      flame. This flame acts like a fireball that deals 3d6 points of fire
      damage to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst. A DC 15 Reflex save
      halves this damage. A dark stalker's gear and treasure are unaffected by
      this explosion. The save is Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      Dark stalkers are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally
      poisoning themselves. Like their diminutive kin, the dark creepers, dark
      stalkers use black poison on their weapons and generally carry six doses
      on them. Black Smear-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/ round for 6
      rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save. The poison DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: See in Darkness (Su)
    description: >-
      A dark stalker can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including that
      created by deeper darkness.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Zoathrias prepares for combat by poisoning his blade and then casting deeper
  darkness.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zoathrias is a hit-and-run fighter. He tries to keep hidden and in darkness to
  catch opponents flatfooted. Whenever he isn't threatened, he reapplies poison
  to his blade.
Morale: >-
  Zoathrias fights to the death. If reduced to fewer than 5 hit points, he
  charges the nearest opponent and attempts to grapple him, hoping to catch as
  many victims as possible in his explosive death throes.
Gear: elemental gem (earth)
OtherGear: >-
  masterwork leather armor, masterwork short swords (2), cloak of resistance +1,
  drow-crafted boots of elvenkind, ring of protection +1, black smear (6 doses)
