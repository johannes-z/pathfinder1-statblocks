DuringCombat: >-
  As soon as opponents enter the room, Poryphanes takes to the air, using
  suggestion to lure trespassers closer to the tendriculos. If any of his foes
  are female, the satyr casts charm person or suggestion on them to take them
  out of the fight in hopes of seducing (and then sacrificing) them after the
  battle. If threatened, Poryphanes casts unholy blight and fear, then fights
  with his natural weapons and castings of poison. If necessary, he casts summon
  monster III to summon a wolverine as another ally.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, Poryphanes attempts to flee and rejoin
  his bastard sons in area E4.
