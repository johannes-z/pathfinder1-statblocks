  - name: Lone Witness (Ex)
    description: >-
      Kakishari's millennia of solitude have excised what little empathy she
      once had. When she successfully confirms a critical hit while using her
      destructive smite domain ability, she can activate her deadly weather
      domain ability as a free action. She also gains an additional hit point
      per Hit Die. This ability replaces her bonus teamwork feats and solo
      tactics class feature.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  At the first sign of intruders, Kakishari summons and mounts her skeletal
  horse before casting see invisibility and freedom of movement. When she
  believes an encounter is imminent, she casts ward of the faithful and divine
  power.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kakishari used her mounted mobility to strike her enemies and ride beyond
  their reach. If unseated, she wades into melee combat, where she remorselessly
  breaks her foes' favorite equipment before ending their lives.
Morale: >-
  Kakishari has perished a dozen times and has always returned to haunt
  Neruzavin. She fights until destroyed.
