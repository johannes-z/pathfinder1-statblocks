SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Lightning Finish (Ex)
    description: >-
      As an immediate action, Dismaal can make a single attack with a
      manufactured light or one-handed slashing weapon against any target she
      has hit at least twice with her unarmed strike during her turn. She can
      take a 5-foot step before or after performing a lightning finish so long
      as she ends adjacent to her target, though if she takes this step, she
      cannot perform a 5-foot step during her next turn. Dismaal can use this
      ability a number of times per day equal to her monk level, but no more
      than once per round.
  - name: Sirocco Fury (Su)
    description: >-
      Dismaal can spend 2 ki points as a full-round action to enter a meditative
      trance that replicates the spell dance of a hundred cutsUM, using her monk
      level as her caster level. Unlike for the spell, she must both move 10
      feet and make a melee attack each round after she begins this trance to
      prevent the effect from ending.
BeforeCombat: >-
  If she suspects trouble, Dismaal drinks her potions of owl's wisdom and
  barkskin.
DuringCombat: >-
  Dismaal immediately enters her sirocco fury, adding +3 to her attack and
  damage rolls, Acrobatics checks, and AC; she moves constantly, using her
  Punishing Kick feat to knock down opponents for her guards to pick off. If her
  guards fall, she switches to her flurry of blows and lightning finish to focus
  on one foe at a time.
Morale: >-
  Unlike her monks, Sister Dismaal is a practical woman, and she attempts to
  flee if reduced below 20 hit points. She can return to harry the PCs during
  their attack on King's Pillar at your discretion.
Gear: >-
  potions of barkskin (2), potions of cure serious wounds (2), potions of owl's
  wisdom (3)
OtherGear: >-
  mwk temple swordAPG, amulet of mighty fists +1, belt of physical might +2
  (Dex, Con), cloak of resistance +2, ring of protection +2
