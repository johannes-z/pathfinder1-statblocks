SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Inanimate (Ex)
    description: >-
      An idol is effectively a statuette and does little to suggest otherwise.
      Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is
      indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. An idol can make use of
      the majority of its special abilities without moving, though the round
      after it does so observers can make a DC 25 Perception check to notice
      minute hints-magical glimmers, minute contortions, etc.-suggesting that
      the idol is actually animate. Overt actions, such as an idol moving or
      attacking, make its nature obvious to witnesses, and to others who make a
      Perception check (as previously noted) even 1 round after it moves.
  - name: Stony Mind (Su)
    description: >-
      Any divination spell targeting a creature or object within 30 feet of a
      stone idol instead targets the construct. Thus, for the purposes of any
      spell that reveals auras, those affected are treated as being under the
      effects of the spell misdirection, while spells like detect thoughts
      receive nothing more than vague impressions. Should detect thoughts or
      another mind-reading effect target a stone idol that contains a memory,
      the ability user instantly gains the memory held within.
  - name: Suggestive (Su)
    description: >-
      Those fascinated by a stone idol's animal trance or hypnotic pattern
      spell-like ability become highly susceptible to the suggestions of others
      nearby. Any creature can make a suggestion (as per the spell suggestion)
      to a fascinated creature, which must then make a DC 15 Will save or
      proceed to follow the suggestion. Any creature that makes a suggestion is
      understood by the fascinated creature, as per the spell tongues or speak
      with animals. A suggestion lasts for 1 hour, even if the creature is no
      longer being fascinated. A fascinated creature follows only the first
      suggestion it fails its saving throw against and no additional
      suggestions. The DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
DuringCombat: >-
  The idols remain inanimate as they try to fascinate intruders with hypnotic
  pattern, at which point their magic mouths activate to make suggestions. The
  idols use hold person to paralyze any opponent who resists the fascination or
  suggestion, before animating and moving in to attack opponents with their
  slams. They cast doom and reduce person on foes who continue to resist.
Morale: >-
  These eternal guardians defend their knowledge until destroyed, at which time
  their memories are released (see Development).
