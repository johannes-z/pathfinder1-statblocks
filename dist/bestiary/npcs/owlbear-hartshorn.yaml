  - name: Blind in One Eye (Ex)
    description: >-
      A character who makes a DC 10 Perception or Sense Motive check notices
      that Owlbear is blind in his left eye and very slow. If his opponent
      notices this and attempts to fight Owlbear from that side, that PC can
      make a DC 10 Acrobatics or Bluff check each round to easily avoid
      Owlbear's clumsy blows.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Owlbear fights with his fists, dealing nonlethal damage until reduced to 15
  hit points or fewer (see Morale below). If grappled, he attempts to break the
  grapple, but goes to back to using his fists as soon as he is free.
Morale: >-
  If Owlbear is reduced to 15 hit points, Plugg hurls a club in his direction.
  Owlbear naturally picks up the club and continues the fight with the weapon.
  If reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, Owlbear cries and tries to back away,
  but is pushed back into combat by Plugg and his mates.
