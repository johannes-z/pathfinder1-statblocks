DuringCombat: >-
  Yue Xin begins combat by launching a spray of shooting stars, and then relies
  on color spray and command to incapacitate opponents or inflict light wounds
  to damage them. He uses his last 1st-level spell slot to cast divine favor
  before entering melee with his morningstar. If reduced to fewer than 10 hit
  points, he backs away and drinks his potion of cure light wounds.
Morale: Yue Xin surrenders or flees if he is reduced to fewer than 5 hit points.
