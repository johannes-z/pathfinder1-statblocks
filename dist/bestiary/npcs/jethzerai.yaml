BeforeCombat: >-
  Jethzerai casts mage armor before returning to area B2 and activating the
  portals with his portal control device.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jethzerai stays airborne with his jetpack, casting ranged spells and favoring
  targets who are interfering with the portals. Against fire-resistant foes,
  Jethzerai uses his zero pistol. He draws his spear and fights in melee once he
  runs out of spells.
Morale: >-
  If the gate to the Plane of Fire is open and Jethzerai is brought to fewer
  than 20 hit points, he flees through the gate, using his jetpack's secondary
  ability to gain a fly speed of 90 feet (clumsy). If the gate isn't open,
  Jethzerai doesn't abandon his precious portals; he fights to the death.
