BeforeCombat: >-
  When not alone in her chambers, Durriya makes sure she always has mage armor
  in effect. If given time to prepare for the PCs' approach, she casts shield
  and invisibility, then projects a silent image of herself sitting regally in
  the room's throne. If possible she casts haste while still invisible before
  attacking.
DuringCombat: >-
  Durriya lines up as many targets as possible for a surprise lightning bolt,
  and follows up with a barrage of damaging and mind-affecting spells to keep
  her opponents on their toes. She fights in melee only if approached by a foe
  or if her protectors are defeated.
Morale: >-
  Durriya saves one 4th-level spell slot for dimension door (or uses her bonded
  object to cast the spell), using the spell to escape into the tunnel exiting
  area H2 once reduced to 30 or fewer hit points. If she is somehow prevented
  from escaping, she surrenders, hoping to use her powers of enchantment to
  bargain her own way out of the PCs' hands.
