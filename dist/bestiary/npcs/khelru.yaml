BeforeCombat: >-
  If he has the opportunity, Khelru casts bull's strength and shield of faith on
  Idorii. Because of the situation's fluid nature, these benefits have not been
  added to Idorii's stat block.
DuringCombat: >-
  Khelru casts spiritual weapon on the first round of combat, then takes
  whatever actions are needed to support his companions, especially to protect
  Azaz when he can. Khelru is the group's primary healer, using his wand of cure
  light wounds, channeling energy, or spontaneously casting cure spells as
  needed. If forced into melee combat, Khelru casts magic weapon and sun metal
  on his quarterstaff.
Morale: >-
  If Azaz's life is in danger, Khelru surrenders to save his partner's life.
  Otherwise, Khelru fights until killed or rendered unconscious.
