DuringCombat: >-
  The cultists organize into pairs, so that they outnumber PCs two to one if
  possible&#8211;if they choose to attack the whole party while they are
  skulking in the off-limits part of the Opera House, all six take part in the
  fight. If a cultist surprises a PC, he casts hold person to try to end the
  fight before it begins. The cultists cast divine favor on the first round of
  combat, then move to flank foes. A cultist reduced to 20 or fewer hit points
  casts invisibility, then flees to heal as best as she can with her spells
  before returning to the combat try to finish the fight. These cultists try not
  to kill the PCs, but rather render them unconscious&#8211;hoping to save as
  many as possible for a ritual sacrifice (likely to take place in area G20) at
  1:00 a.m. Captured PCs are held prisoner in area G21 until that time comes.
Morale: A Skinsaw cultist fights to the death.
