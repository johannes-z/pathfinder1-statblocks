SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bestial Challenge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever Helkit issues a challenge, both she and her hunting pack gain the
      bonuses and penalties associated with her challenge. This ability modifies
      a cavalier's challenge ability.
  - name: Hunting Pack (Ex)
    description: >-
      Helkit has gained the service of an animal companion, Brimstone. Her
      effective druid level is equal to her cavalier level.
  - name: Pack Tactics (Ex)
    description: >-
      Helkit and her war beast gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls while flanking
      the same opponent (instead of the normal +2 bonus).
  - name: Rage (Ex)
    description: >-
      Helkit gains the rage barbarian class ability, except that her effective
      barbarian level for the ability is equal to her barbarian level - 3.
  - name: Tactician (Ex)
    description: >-
      A huntmaster's tactician ability affects only her hunting pack, not other
      allies. This modifies the tactician ability.
  - name: War Beast (Ex)
    description: >-
      Helkit has gained the service of an animal companion, Brimstone. Her
      effective druid level is equal to her barbarian level.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Helkit drinks her potion of enlarge person once combat begins. If her Slayers
  are still faring well, she then moves closer and uses her Dazzling Display
  feat to demoralize as many PCs as she can. Her tactics are otherwise simple
  but brutal: she begins to rage, charges into melee, and makes judicious use of
  Power Attack and Dramatic Display while commanding Brimstone to flank with
  her.
Morale: >-
  Helkit yields if reduced to 15 hit points or fewer or if all but one of her
  allies (including Brimstone) fall. If the PCs "accidentally" ignore her
  surrender, she grits her teeth and fights to her death, cursing them for their
  dishonor.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds, potion of enlarge person
OtherGear: +1 piecemeal armor (see sidebar), +1 greataxe, javelins (3), 227 gp
