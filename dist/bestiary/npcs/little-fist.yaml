BeforeCombat: >-
  The monk often tries to reason or treat with potential foes in an effort to
  avoid unnecessary combat, or to quietly study enemies and discern each one's
  strengths and weaknesses. Once combat is unavoidable, he drinks potions of
  barkskin and bull's strength.
DuringCombat: >-
  The monk trusts his improved evasion, high saves, and spell resistance to
  safeguard him against spellcasters, and focuses on martial opponents,
  combining Spring Attack and Stunning Fist. He uses Lunge against Small or
  Medium opponents, often using ki points to grant himself a bonus to AC and
  negate the penalty from using Lunge. When making a flurry of blows, he
  attempts a Stunning Fist on the first strike. He uses Snatch Arrows to return
  thrown weapons and Deadly Aim whenever he catches a weapon he is proficient
  with.
