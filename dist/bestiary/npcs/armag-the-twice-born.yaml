DuringCombat: >-
  At the beginning of combat, Ovinrbaane casts aid on Armag and modifies his
  memory to make him believe that the PCs are his greatest enemies. He then
  rages and charges the strongest enemy in sight, using Improved Vital Strike
  and Power Attack&#8211;he continues using Power Attack throughout the battle.
  If surrounded by multiple foes, he uses Great Cleave. Against spellcasters, he
  counts on Ovinrbaane's dispel magic power to shield him from debilitating
  effects, preferring to take down a spellcaster's protectors before turning the
  blade on her.
Morale: >-
  Even before he succumbed to the bloodlust of Ovinrbaane, Armag never retreated
  or surrendered&#8211;he fights to the death.
