DuringCombat: >-
  Tuirziaz activates her inspire courage bardic performance on the first round
  and then casts displacement. She then retreats to area M10, as she prefers to
  make melee attacks in combat while standing her ground on or near the rune in
  the floor there so she can communicate with Xanderghul. She focuses her first
  attacks each round on arcane spellcasters in hopes of reducing their
  spellcasting abilities with energy drain, then switches to target weapon users
  and periodically attempts to disarm them with her whip.
Morale: Tuirziaz fights to the death.
