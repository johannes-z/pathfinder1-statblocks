DuringCombat: >-
  The demonic giant flies buzz over to attack the PCs immediately in melee,
  casting darkness at the start of combat and then focusing their bites on
  obvious worshipers of good deities. As they attack, they use their telepathic
  powers to alert Othirubo in area P9 and Jeslyn in area P18 of the PCs' arrival
  and actions, keeping their contacts updated throughout the fight.
Morale: The demonic giant flies fight to the death.
