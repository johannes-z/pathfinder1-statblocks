    description: >-
      Attacks against a fetchling in dim light have a 50% miss chance instead of
      the normal 20% miss chance. This ability does not grant total concealment;
      it just increases the miss chance.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Mazzel Gol hears the sounds of combat in the next room, she immediately
  drinks her mutagen (already included in her stats). If time further permits,
  she drinks her extracts of spider climb and invisibility, and readies her true
  strike extract.
DuringCombat: >-
  Mazzel Gol initiates combat by throwing an acid bomb into the largest group of
  PCs she can target. She fights recklessly with her claws and bite, climbing up
  the walls if she's cornered or facing an opponent she can neither hit nor
  effectively damage, and then resorting to bombs from range.
Morale: >-

  the death.
