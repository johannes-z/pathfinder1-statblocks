SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Paranoia (Ex)
    description: >-
      Guxer's paranoia imparts a -4 penalty on Charismabased skill checks and
      Will saves, and he cannot receive benefit from or attempt the aid another
      action nor can he willingly accept aid (including healing) from another
      creature unless he makes a DC 17 Will save-otherwise he fights tooth and
      nail to prevent the "aid" (which he perceives as a threat). Lesser
      restoration has no effect on curing Guxer's paranoia, but restoration
      reduces the strength so that the nobleman can function relatively normally
      (enough so that he can treat with the PCs and forge alliances, at least).
      Greater restoration, heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish immediately cure
      Guxer completely of his insanity, though he remains depressed and confused
      by recent events.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Guxer is dejected and depressed, and only fights in self-defense or if he
  suspects that someone is in league with his brother. In this case, he fights
  with his rapier while tears of anger stream down his cheeks.
Morale: >-
  Guxer feels increasingly that he has little reason to live-if a fight begins,
  he fights to the death.
Gear: +2 padded armor, +1 rapier
