SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Chill Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      Damage caused by the groaning spirit's touch attack is considered negative
      energy and sends a chilling cold through an opponent's body. Any creature
      touched must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or suffer 1 point of
      Strength drain. Groaning spirits are the bane of other undead, and any
      undead they touch (except other groaning spirits) must succeed on a DC 19
      Will save or flee in fear for 2d6 rounds. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Keening (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, at night only, a groaning spirit can release a death wail
      audible to a range of 1 mile. All creatures within 30 feet that hear this
      must make a successful DC 21 Will save or be affected as per the wail of
      the banshee spell. Those that make their save still take 3d6+7 points of
      damage. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the
      groaning spirit's Ability Focus feat.
  - name: Lifesense (Su)
    description: A groaning spirit can sense all living creatures up to 5 miles away.
  - name: Vulnerability to Dispel Evil (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a dispel evil spell (the second effect requiring a touch attack) is
      used against a groaning spirit the creature must succeed on a Will save
      (DC 15 + caster's relevant ability score modifier) or be destroyed
      immediately.
