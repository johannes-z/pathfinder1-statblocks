Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Inexora casts deathwatch, freedom of movement, levitate, bear's endurance,
  shield of faith, and divine favor in that order once her babau reports that
  enemies are nearby. She then orders her demons to hide themselves in an effort
  to ambush the PCs. If she is surprised, she only has deathwatch and levitate
  active.
DuringCombat: >-
  Inexora first attempts to extinguish or suppress the PCs' light sources with
  her spell-like abilities as she levitates to the ceiling. She considers her
  familiar expendable and orders it to deliver harmful touch spells. She drops
  back to the floor next to disabled or hindered PCs to attack with her dagger
  or channel demonic energy, which grants her chaotic evil allies the benefits
  of the rage spell. When she sees a creature wounded, including herself,
  Inexora describes the injury out loud in medical terms as if she were
  conducting an autopsy, using her Bluff skill to downplay her own injuries and
  convince the PCs that theirs are more severe.
Morale: >-
  Inexora's shame at her defeat at the battle of Celwynvian has gnawed at her
  for years, and she refuses to consider retreat.
Gear: >-
  lesser bouncing metamagic rod, scroll of wind wall, wand of resist energy (CL
  7th, 8 charges)

  +1 chainmail, +1 dagger, amulet of natural armor +1, cloak of resistance +1,
