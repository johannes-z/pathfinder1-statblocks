DuringCombat: >-
  Hetamon casts sanctuary at the start of combat, following with shield of
  faith. He then focuses his actions on providing healing or assistance to
  allies. On his own, or when forced to fight, the tiefling starts a battle with
  spiritual weapon, then uses blindness/ deafness on the most dangerous-looking
  foe. Of course, he much prefers to end combats before they begin, often with
  the aid of an enthrall spell.
Morale: >-
  Hetamon is no coward, but neither does he seek to martyr himself. If reduced
  to fewer than 10 hit points, he attempts to flee combat, go into hiding, and
  recover. If he's forced to abandon allies, he turns all of his resources to
  rescuing any who were captured, or if they were killed, avenging their deaths.
