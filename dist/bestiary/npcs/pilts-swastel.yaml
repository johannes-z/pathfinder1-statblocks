BeforeCombat: >-
  Pilts casts alarm on the door to Salvator's cell every morning, and unseen
  servant and undetectable alignment as soon as he takes his throne for the day.
  As soon as he realizes he's about to have visitors, he also casts glibness and
  tongues on himself. Before Pilts enters combat, he makes sure to drink his
  potion of barkskin +4 and casts cat's grace.
DuringCombat: >-
  Pilts orders his minions to the attack, supporting them with inspire courage
  on the first round of combat. He then alternates casting spells such as
  confusion, charm monster, and hold person with activations of his rod of
  wonder. Each time he successfully uses this unpredictable device, he shrieks
  in delight and offers impromptu commentary on the rod's results. As soon as it
  seems obvious that he's about to be attacked, he casts displacement on himself
  and fights back with his war razor.
Morale: >-
  If brought below 20 hit points, the emperor uses dimension door to go to his
  bedroom (area C11), then takes 3d6 rounds gathering up his favorite prizes
  before using dimension door again (or by fleeing via area C7) to hide out in
  Old Dock and nurse his wounds and plan his revenge against the PCs. If he's
  brought below 10 hit points and unable to use dimension door, Pilts's bravado
  crumbles. He drops to his knees and begs pitifully for his life, offering up
  pretty much anything to the PCs in return for mercy. In either event, as soon
  as Pilts is killed or surrenders publicly (or 2d6 rounds after he flees), his
  mob falls to pieces and the thugs scatter, seeking a safe place to recover and
  figure out what to do next.
