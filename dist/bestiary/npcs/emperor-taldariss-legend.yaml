DuringCombat: >-
  Taldaris was a skilled warrior, but also a skilled tactician. He attempts to
  use the terrain to his advantage, keeping his back to walls to keep opponents
  from flanking him while lining enemies up for his own Cleave or Whirlwind
  Attacks. If his opponents surround him, he uses teleport to find some
  breathing room, and casts mirror image to distract multiple attackers.
Morale: Taldaris's legend fights until destroyed or until talked down by reason.
