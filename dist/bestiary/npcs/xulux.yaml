SpecialAbilities:
  - name: around Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gibbering abomination sees in all directions at once. It cannot be
      flanked List special ability info here.
  - name: Amorphous (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gibbering abomination's body is malleable and shapeless. It is immune to
      precision damage (like sneak attacks) and critical hits, and can move
      through an area as small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or
      one-eighth its space when squeezing.
  - name: Arcane Frenzy (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gibbering abomination is capable of using its spell-like abilities more
      frequently than other creatures. It may use a single spell-like ability
      each round as a swift action, two spell-like abilities as a standard
      action, or four spell-like abilities as a full-round action; it may not
      choose to do more than one of these in the same round, and cannot use this
      ability in the same round it uses Disruptive Cacophony. When engaging in
      an arcane frenzy, the gibbering abomination may use the same spelllike
      ability multiple times, but may not use the same spelllike ability against
      the same target twice in one round. If more than one spell-like ability is
      used, the specific spell-like abilities and their targets must be
      determined before any effects are determined, including saves and attack
      rolls.
  - name: Blood Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      On a successful grapple check after grabbing, several of the creature's
      mouths attach to its target. Each round it maintains its grapple, the
      gibbering abomination automatically deals 3d6+12 points of bite damage and
      1 point of Constitution damage as it drains its victim's blood.
  - name: Deathless (Su)
    description: >-
      When a gibbering abomination is slain, it is not truly dead, and 1 hour
      later it returns to life at 0 hit points, allowing fast healing thereafter
      to resume healing it. A gibbering abomination can be permanently destroyed
      only with death magic or complete incineration of its remains (such as
      dumping it into a pool of magma).
  - name: Disruptive Cacophony (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action the gibbering abomination may produce a horrible
      quasi-arcane chanting that is highly disruptive to nearby magic effects.
      Any creature that can clearly hear this chanting (maximum range 100 ft.)
      must make a concentration check (DC 20 plus level of spell) to
      successfully cast a spell or use a spelllike ability. The check DC is
      Charisma-based. A gibbering abomination that uses this ability may not use
      any of its spelllike abilities on its current turn, or until the start of
      its next turn.
  - name: Pain Immunity (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because the gibbering abomination is already in incredible pain, it is
      immune to any effect or condition caused as a result of extreme pain or
      agony. This ability does not protect it against any physical damage it
      might suffer as well, however.
