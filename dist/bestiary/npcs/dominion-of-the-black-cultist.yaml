BeforeCombat: >-
  Each cultist casts misdirection on themselves when they wake each evening,
  targeting their daggers. They cast mage armor soon after they set out for the
  mine each night, or as soon as they suspect combat is imminent.
DuringCombat: >-
  If the cultists get in a fight, one of them attempts to escape while the other
  three hold the PCs off. The escaping cultist uses a scroll of invisibility to
  aid his escape, then a scroll of phantom steed to quickly reach the Nesher
  Mines to warn Abtaroh&#8211;this cultist can be encountered later at that
  location. The remaining cultists attempt to charm the PCs on the first round,
  hoping to stop combat before it begins. Failing this, one of the cultists uses
  summon monster spells while the other two use their scrolls of fireball if
  there's room. One cultist readies actions each round to launch magic missiles
  at foes as they cast spells if they are strong spellcasters or healers. A
  cultist uses vampiric touch as soon as possible after he's wounded, and drinks
  a potion of cure moderate wounds if brought to fewer than 15 hit points.
Morale: The cultists fight to the death.
