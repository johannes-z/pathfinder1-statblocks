DuringCombat: >-
  Jurrg lets his minions engage foes in melee so he can take the time to bolster
  their powers, first by casting good hope and activating inspire courage,
  followed by casting haste, rage, and mirror image before he enters melee.
Morale: >-
  As long as any of Jurrg's minions still stand, he fights to the death. If he's
  alone and Irovetti still lives, he fights until reduced to 100 hit points or
  fewer, at which point he casts dimension door to go wherever he believes
  Irovetti is located to report to his king. When fighting at Irovetti's side or
  defending the throne room itself, he fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  +2 mithral breastplate, +2 keen greatsword, +1 composite longbow with 20
  arrows, cloak of resistance +2
