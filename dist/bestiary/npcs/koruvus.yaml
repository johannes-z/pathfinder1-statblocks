    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, Koruvus can spew a 20-foot-long line of
      foul-smelling and acidic blood from his mouth. Any creatures in this area
      take 2d4 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 13 half). A creature that takes
      damage from the acid must also make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be nauseated
      for 1 round. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

  Koruvus takes his duty as guardian of this chamber seriously, and immediately

Morale: >-
  Koruvus fights to the death, and pursues foes all the way to the Glassworks or
  the catacombs' exit if necessary before returning here.
