DuringCombat: >-
  Sajan relies on Mobility to get into a strategic location in combat, and uses
  a combination of Combat Reflexes and flurry of blows to deal as much damage as
  possible to his targets. Against a particularly powerful single enemy, he
  utilizes Stunning Fist to take the combatant out of commission.
