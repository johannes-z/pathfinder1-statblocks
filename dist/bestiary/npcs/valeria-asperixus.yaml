  Scourge
Source: AP 60
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Detect Chaos (Sp)
    description: >-
      This ability functions like a paladin's detect evil ability, save that it
      detects chaos. Disciplines (Sp and Su) Valeria has access to the
      Hellknight disciplines of tracker and vigilance. Twice per day, she can
      summon an eagle, riding dog, wolf, or leopard as if using a summon monster
      spell, but the duration is 1 hour. In addition, Valeria gains low-light
      vision, and as a full-round action twice per day, she can see through up
      to 5 feet of wood or stone for as long as she concentrates (maximum 6
      rounds). Metal or denser barriers block this effect.
  - name: Force of Will (Ex)
    description: >-
      Valeria gains a +4 bonus on Will saves against spells with the compulsion
      descriptor and a +2 bonus on Will saves against spells with the fear
      descriptor.
  - name: Hellknight Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      Valeria has earned the right to wear a special type of masterwork full
      plate called Hellknight plate armor (Inner Sea World Guide 290). While
      wearing Hellknight plate, Valeria reduces the armor check penalty by 2,
      increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by 1, and moves at full
      speed. Order Valeria is a member of the Order of the Scourge.
  - name: Smite Chaos (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as the paladin's smite evil ability, but against
      chaotic-aligned creatures. This ability is twice as effective against
      outsiders with the chaotic subtype, chaotic-aligned aberrations, and fey.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Once the Abrogail's Fury comes under attack, Valeria drinks her potion of
  cat's grace and uses her tracker discipline to summon a leopard to help defend
  Admiral Druvalia Thrune. The effects of Druvalia's ward the faithful spell are
  already included in Valeria's stat block.
DuringCombat: >-
  Valeria stays close to her mistress, Druvalia Thrune, throughout any combat,
  using her Bodyguard and In Harm's Way feats to intercept attacks meant for the
  admiral. If forcibly separated from her charge, she does everything in her
  power to get back to Druvalia's side. Valeria uses the reach of her bardiche
  to keep foes at a distance while the Chelish marines deal with them. She casts
  detect chaos as a move action to determine if any enemies are chaotic, then
  focuses her attacks on those foes, using her smite chaos ability and Improved
  Vital Strike with her axiomatic bardiche, using her pole fighting ability, if
  necessary, to shorten her grip on her weapon to attack adjacent foes. If
  knocked overboard, Valeria drinks her potion of fly to return to Druvalia's
  side.
Morale: >-
  Valeria is enraged if Druvalia is killed, and fights to the death to avenge
  her.
Gear: >-
  elixir of swimming, potion of cat's grace, potion of cure serious wounds,
  potion of fly
OtherGear: >-
  +1 Hellknight plate, +1 axiomatic bardiche*, masterwork composite longbow (+4
  Str) with 20 arrows, belt of giant strength +2
