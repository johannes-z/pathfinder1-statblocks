BeforeCombat: >-
  The doppelgangers prefer to strike from hiding, drinking a potion of blur and
  using a surprise round (should they get one) to throw globes from their
  necklaces of fireballs (originally intended to destroy infrastructure during
  the invasion).
DuringCombat: >-
  The infiltrators open up with their hand crossbows, hoping to catch enemies
  flat-footed, then move to flank with their sword canes. They fling their
  thunderstones at casters. They use only their claws if they've already been
  exposed as shapeshifters.
Morale: The infiltrators are loyal soldiers and fight to the death.

  (2), scroll of sending, wand of undetectable alignment (31 charges),
  thunderstones (3)
