SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      The dung monster's acid does 1d8 damage with each successful hit and per
      round to any creature engulfed.
  - name: Adhesive (Ex)
    description: >-
      The dung monster exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive,
      holding fast any creatures or items that touch it. The dung monster
      automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack.
      Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the dung monster is alive
      without removing the adhesive first. A weapon that strikes the dung
      monster is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex save.
      A successful DC 20 Strength check is needed to pry off a stuck weapon.
      Strong alcohol or universal solvent dissolves the adhesive, but the dung
      monster can still grapple normally. The dung monster can dissolve its
      adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 5 rounds after the
      creature dies. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Creeping (Ex)
    description: >-
      The dung monster can climb any vertical surface and can hang from the
      underside of any horizontal surface as long as a third of its mass touches
      a vertical surface. It can pass through any opening through which water
      could pass.
  - name: Engulf (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although it moves slowly, the dung monster can simply engulf Large or
      smaller creatures in its path as a standard action. It cannot make a slam
      attack during a round in which it engulfs. The dung monster merely has to
      move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can
      make attacks of opportunity against the dung monster, but if they do so
      they are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks
      of opportunity can attempt a DC 20 Reflex save to avoid being engulfed-on
      a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent's choice) as the dung
      monster moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the dung
      monster's acid, gain the pinned condition, are in danger of suffocating,
      and are trapped within its body until they are no longer pinned. The save
      DC is Strengthbased.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      The dung monster is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance.
  - name: Mimic Object (Ex)
    description: >-
      The dung monster can assume the general shape of any Large object, such as
      a massive chest, a stout bed, or a door. The creature cannot substantially
      alter its size, though. The dung monster's body is hard and has a rough
      texture, no matter what appearance it might present. The dung monster
      gains a +20 racial bonus on Disguise checks when imitating an object in
      this manner. Disguise is a class skill for the dung monster.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Ex)
    description: >-
      Even if the dung monster is somehow destroyed, trapped, transported away,
      or otherwise rendered inert, it returns to roam Level 1 (and any other
      level the GM chooses) after 1d4 days.
