BeforeCombat: >-
  Mutasafen drinks a displacement elixir, a mythic fire shield elixir, a mythic
  fly elixir, and a mythic invisibility elixir&#8211;he augments fly as he
  drinks in order to gain a +4 bonus on his Reflex saves and as a dodge bonus to
  AC while flying (these bonuses are not included in the stats above, so
  remember to apply them while Mutasafen is in flight!).
DuringCombat: >-
  Mutasafen activates his sinfrenzy ability at the start of combat&#8211;these
  adjustments are included in the stats above. Then, if he hasn't had a chance
  to prepare the effects listed above, he does so. Once he's prepared, he uses
  bombs against his foes, using the stinking clouds created by his gibrileth
  assistant to conceal himself between attacks.
Morale: >-
  Mutasafen attempts to escape if brought below 50 hit points, using an
  augmented dose of invisibility elixir to cover his retreat and then using fly
  to speed his flight from the region. He has no further official role to play
  in this campaign if he escapes, so feel free to use him as a recurring enemy
  in future encounters. Alternatively, the PCs may encounter him in the final
  adventure as a tormented prisoner of the Storm King.
