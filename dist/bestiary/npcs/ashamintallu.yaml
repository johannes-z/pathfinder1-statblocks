SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Vampiric Claws (Su)
    description: >-
      Each time Ashamintallu damages a foe with her claw attack, she gains an
      amount of temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage she dealt.
      She cannot gain more hit points than her target's current hit points plus
      the target's Con score (which is enough to kill the target). These
      temporary hit points vanish in 1 hour.
Gender: Female
ProhibitedSchools: Transmutation, Necromancy
BeforeCombat: Ashamintallu casts mage armor, protection from good, and shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ashamintallu activates her boots of haste on the first round of combat, then
  uses flight to hover out of reach from melee attacks while she uses her spells
  to pick the party apart. Her first act in combat is to use confusion on the
  PCs, followed by a fireball in the second round. She's fond of using charm
  monster, charm person, and suggestion to compel enemies to cast aside their
  weapons and strip off their armor and gear. Once she manages to neutralize the
  party through enchantments, she picks off the stragglers with her spells and
  at reach with her guisarme.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, Ashamintallu flees combat using
  dimension door to area L22, where she begins scouring the dungeon for allies
  and drinks her potions of cure serious wounds before returning to confront the
  PCs. If the PCs goad her into revealing her true nature, though, her madness
  takes over and she fights the PCs to the death.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds (4), wand of dimension door (14 charges)
OtherGear: +1 keen guisarme, boots of haste, spell component pouch
