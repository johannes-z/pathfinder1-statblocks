BeforeCombat: >-
  The juggernaut lays dormant under a layer of slag, pinned in place by
  Fossilblight. While in this torpor, under a protective shell of slag, the
  juggernaut cannot affect the PCs, nor can they affect it.
DuringCombat: >-
  The juggernaut favors trample attacks over its slam attacks. It can roll over
  the cliff faces, allowing it to escape area B4 and into the rest of the dome,
  if necessary.
Morale: >-
  The mindless juggernaut fights until destroyed, pursuing the PCs throughout
  the area, and beyond. Unless  destroyed, the juggernaut travels all the way
  down the Hero's Trail to the Broken Temple.
