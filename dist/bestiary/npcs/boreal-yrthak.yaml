    description: >-
      A boreal yrthak is surrounded by a glowing blue and green aura of
      electrically charged particles that blurs and conceals the creature's
      form. The yrthak takes a -5 penalty on Stealth checks in dim light or
      darkness, but gains concealment (20% miss chance).
DuringCombat: >-
  The yrthak attacks from the air, wheeling around to repeatedly target
  opponents with its sonic lance. It uses its explosion attack to target massed
  groups of foes. If brought to the ground, the yrthak attacks with its bite and
  claws.
Morale: The yrthak takes to the air and flees if reduced to fewer than 30 hit points.
