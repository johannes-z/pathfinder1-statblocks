SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mournful Wail (Su)
    description: >-
      Aldronard died in the throes of crippling despair, and can emit a mournful
      wail as a standard action. All creatures within a 30-foot spread must
      succeed at a Will save or become frightened for 2d4 rounds. This is a less
      extreme version of the Frightful Moan standard ghost ability, but the
      effect supernaturally penetrates immunity to fear. A character who is
      normally immune to fear but fails to resist the effect with a Will save
      becomes shaken for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect.
      A creature that successfully saves against the wail cannot be affected by
      it again for 24 hours.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      Aldronard is doomed to remain a ghost until either Justinia or her father
      Eredian forgives him-a forgiveness made much more complex, since both
      Justinia and Eredian have been dead for decades now. See Development,
      below, for one possible way the PCs could accomplish this forgiveness.
DuringCombat: >-
  Aldronard uses his mournful wail every round that intruders trespass upon his
  chapel. He attacks with his corrupting touch only if he is attacked
  first&#8211;or if he spies anyone who appears to be a paladin or a worshiper
  of Sarenrae, in which case he shrieks out, "It was for you I came north,
  Sarenrae! Why couldn't you protect Justinia? Why did you send me away from
  her?" and attacks the object of his despair. Aldronard does not pursue
  intruders from area A5 of the chapel.
Morale: Aldronard fights until destroyed, only to re-form in 2d4 days.
