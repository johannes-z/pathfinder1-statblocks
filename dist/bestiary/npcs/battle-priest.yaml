BeforeCombat: >-
  As soon as the PCs confront Hjort's look-alike, the cleric of Gorum quietly
  casts shield of faith amid the din of the bar and readies to stand and shout
  at them.
DuringCombat: >-
  The cleric isn't afraid of melee&#8211;he draws his greatsword, casts bane,
  and charges into battle with a bellowing roar. He uses true strike if he finds
  a PC to be hard to hit, casts cause fear if he's taking too much damage, and
  channels positive energy to heal his companions, excluding 3 of the PCs from
  the healing burst.
Morale: The battle priest fights until beaten unconscious or killed.
