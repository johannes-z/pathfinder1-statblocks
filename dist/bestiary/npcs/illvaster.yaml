SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Broken Bones (Ex)
    description: >-
      Over the centuries, many of Illvaster's bones have become broken and
      misshapen. As a result, Illvaster has a -2 to hit and damage and cannot
      make effective use of his wings and claws as weapons. This penalty has
      already been factored into his statistics block above.
BeforeCombat: Illvaster waits inside the pool, hiding from casual observation.
DuringCombat: >-
  Although once a terrible foe, Illvaster now lacks battle intelligence. He
  attacks the nearest target, often switching opponents after each successful
  attack. If a PC gets by him and moves to aid Sulianna, Koth'Vaul orders
  Illvaster to focus on that foe without regard for attacks of opportunity.
Morale: Illvaster fights until destroyed.
