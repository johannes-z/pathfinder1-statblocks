    description: >-
      Because it remains buried until it attacks, a successful DC 20 Perception
      check is required to notice a sand kraken before it attacks for the first
      time. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use either
      of those skills instead of Perception to notice the sand kraken.
  - name: Tentacle Regeneration (Ex)
    description: >-
      The only parts of a sand kraken that are normally exposed are its
      tentacles, which a foe can attack individually. Each tentacle has 15 hit
      points. A sand kraken can no longer use a destroyed tentacle to make
      attacks, but damage dealt to a tentacle does not affect the sand kraken's
      hit point total. Destroyed tentacles regrow in 1d4 days.
