BeforeCombat: >-
  Paeta casts alarm on the tower's main doors and the stairs to area B30 every
  day.
DuringCombat: >-
  Paeta uses her ethereal ambush ability to make poisoned sneak attacks,
  repeating this tactic on as many intruders as possible to weaken or kill them.
  She then grabs a physically weaker opponent and drags the victim up the tower
  wall to use as a bargaining chip to force the others to do her bidding.
Morale: >-
  Paeta has no wish to die in Haetanga's service. If reduced to 30 hit points or
  fewer, she flees to the Ethereal Plane and reports to her mistress, who likely
  comes to investigate the PCs herself soon afterward.
