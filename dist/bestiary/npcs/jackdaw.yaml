Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Jackdaw uses her ragged nails to make unarmed strikes against the PCs as soon
  as they enter her cell, drawing attacks of opportunity with each attack. She
  won't stand down until her Charisma drain from the long years of isolation and
  insanity is healed, and will need to be restrained until this issue can be
  addressed if the PCs lack a method of healing her.
Morale: >-
  Jackdaw fights to the death while insane, but once cured and restored, she
  flees combat if reduced to fewer than 10 hp&#8211;unless doing so endangers an
  ally, in which case she'll fight to the death to defend that friend.
