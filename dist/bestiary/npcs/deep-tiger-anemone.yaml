      Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, a deep tiger anemone can draw
      large quantities of surrounding water into its body and then expel the
      water at high pressure. It makes a single combat maneuver check against
      all creatures within 30 feet&#8211;those whose CMD this roll equals or
      exceeds are pushed back to a maximum distance of 30 feet from the anemone.
      This forced movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
