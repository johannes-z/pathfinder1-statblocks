BeforeCombat: >-
  Caigreal casts undetectable alignment every day. Before meeting the PCs or
  before any combat, she also casts shield of faith.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once her true form is revealed, Caigreal begins combat by casting fog cloud to
  buy herself enough time to bolster herself with spells like divine favor and
  her copycat ability. Next, she channels negative energy and targets opponents
  with her offensive spells. She has no qualms about engaging foes in melee
  combat, combining disfiguring touch or spontaneous inflict spells with her
  natural attacks.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, Caigreal casts invisibility and flees
  from the combat. She heads straight for her coven sisters, first racing to the
  green hag Grishelmuk in area D7, then to the witchfire Silyzil in area D5,
  where the coven makes its final stand.
Gear: >-
  quarterstaff, phylactery of negative channeling, iron key to area D5, spell
  component pouch, wooden unholy symbol of Mestama
