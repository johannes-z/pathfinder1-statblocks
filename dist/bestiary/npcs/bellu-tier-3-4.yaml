BeforeCombat: >-
  Bellu makes no special preparations for combat besides accepting Ichon's
  spells (already included in the eidolon's stats).
DuringCombat: >-
  Bellu wades gracefully into the fray, swinging with fists and feet and
  delighting in the crunch of bones breaking. She prefers to divide her attacks
  between two adjacent targets whenever possible. The eidolon always power
  attacks (already applied to her statistics).
Morale: Bellu is tied to Ichon and cannot flee.
