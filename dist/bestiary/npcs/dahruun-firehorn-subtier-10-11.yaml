SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Damned (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a demoniac is killed, his soul is instantly claimed by the Abyss. In
      time, the demoniac's soul is transformed into a demon appropriate to the
      greatest sins the demoniac gloried in while he lived. Any character
      attempting to resurrect a slain demoniac must succeed at a caster level
      check equal to 10 + the demoniac's level or the spell fails. That
      character cannot attempt to resurrect the demoniac again until the
      following day, though other characters can attempt to do so if they
      please.
  - name: Demonic Mark (Ex)
    description: >-
      A demoniac bears the sign of his chosen demon lord as a tattoo-like brand
      somewhere on his body. Once per day, a demoniac can call upon the profane
      power of this mark to power a spell as he casts it. Doing so causes the
      spell to gain the chaotic and evil descriptors, and causes the spell not
      be expended as it is cast, allowing the demoniac to cast the spell again
      at a later point in the day.
  - name: Energumen (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a demoniac can open his soul to a demonic spirit as a free
      action. This spirit possesses the demoniac for a number of rounds equal to
      his demoniac level, granting a +2 profane bonus to one ability score of
      the demoniac's choice. When the energumen ends, the demoniac becomes
      confused for a number of rounds equal to his demoniac level as the demonic
      spirit has its way with his mind. At the start of each round of confusion,
      the demoniac can make a DC 25 Will save to end the confusion effect
      immediately. Energumen is a possession effect, and is negated by
      protection from evil or protection from chaos. A demoniac can prevent or
      end the confusion side effect by having one of these spells cast upon him
      when (or before) the energumen ends, but being affected by such a spell
      before the energumen has run its course also causes the benefits granted
      to end prematurely.
  - name: Obedience (Ex)
    description: >-
      In order to maintain the abilities gained from this prestige class
      (including all spellcasting abilities that have been augmented by this
      prestige class), a demoniac must indulge in a daily obedience to his
      chosen demon lord. This ceremony is incorporated into whatever method the
      demoniac uses to regain spellcasting abilities. In Dahruun's case, he
      remains motionless each morning for 55 minutes, and then spends the last 5
      minutes speaking 50 observations regarding his surroundings into a
      hollowed-out bull's horn, granting him immunity to maze and a +4 profane
      bonus on saving throws against confusion and insanity effects. Spells
      Dahruun's tactics include the casting of weapon of awe on his greataxe if
      possible. This spell grants one manufactured weapon a +2 sacred bonus on
      damage rolls for 1 minute per level, and if the weapon scores a critical
      hit, the target of that critical hit becomes shaken for 1 round with no
      saving throw. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Dahruun notices the PCs coming, he casts entropic shield on himself and
  weapon of awe on his greataxe (granting it a +2 sacred bonus on damage rolls;
  see Special Abilities for more details) before they arrive.
DuringCombat: >-
  Dahruun begins the battle using his powerful charge ability to gore the
  nearest PC. When reduced to 70 hit points or fewer, he uses his maze spelllike
  ability and maze mastery special quality to isolate a nonspellcasting PC and
  attempts to grapple and gore them to death within the maze.
Morale: Dahruun fights to the death for the glory of his dark lord.
Gear: +1 breastplate, greataxe, silver unholy symbol of Baphomet
