BeforeCombat: >-
  After he hears the PCs fighting the proto-shoggoths in area B11, Mun sends an
  arcane eye to spy on that level of the Mysterium. He then keeps an ear to door
  to make sure that they're not coming for him if the arcane eye has run out.
  Otherwise, he keeps watching the PCs to try to discern their true motivation
  for being down here. When the PCs begin heading to his room, he drinks his
  extracts of stoneskin, barkskin, shield, and thorn body (in that order) right
  as they bust through the door. He gives bull's strength and cat's grace to his
  homunculus. If he witnessed one of the PCs favoring a specific energy type or
  using it more than a couple of  times, he drinks his resist energy extract
  (this has not been factored into his stat block).
DuringCombat: >-
  Mun lets his homunculus do most of the fighting and stands back to support it.
  He throws his club to attack, but if he finds himself subject to enemy
  attacks, he drinks either his greater invisibility extract or his displacement
  extract. If his homunculus is taking too much damage, he uses his wand of make
  whole to heal it.
Morale: >-
  Mun is frightened and on the verge of insanity. In this state of fear, he
  feels he won't make it out alive, so he fights to the death.
Gear: wand of make whole (9 charges)
