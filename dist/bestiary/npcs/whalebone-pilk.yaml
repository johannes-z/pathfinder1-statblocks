    description: >-
      Whalebone Pilk and his ship Deathknell cannot simply be defeated in
      combat. If "destroyed," Pilk (and his gear) dissolve into mist. Both
      captain and ship reappear in 1d3 weeks, fully healed and repaired. The
      only way to permanently destroy Pilk and the Deathknell is to destroy the
      ship's bell (hardness 9, hp 30, Break DC 28). Doing so instantly slays
      Pilk and all his crew, and causes the Deathknell to sink to the bottom of
      the sea, never to sail again.
  - name: Steal Air (Su)
    description: >-
      A breath taker can cause a ghostly, incorporeal hand with a reach of 10
      feet to emerge from its own hand. If it makes a successful incorporeal
      touch attack, the breath taker's hand plunges into the chest of its
      victim, who must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of
      Constitution damage and become fatigued as he begins to suffocate. On a
      successful save, the hand is harmlessly expelled. The breath taker must
      make a touch attack each round as a move action to maintain the
      connection. As long as the breath taker maintains the connection, the
      victim must continue to make a Fortitude save each round to expel the
      hand. On the second failed save, the victim falls unconscious and is
      reduced to 0 hit points. One round later, the victim falls to -1 hit
      points and is dying. One round after that, the victim dies. Each round,
      the victim can delay that round's effects from occurring by making a
      successful Fortitude save, but each time a victim fails his Fortitude
      save, he moves one step further toward suffocation. As this happens, the
      breath taker's rotted chest visibly expands as it draws the victim's air
      into itself. To escape the touch, the victim must either make a successful
      Fortitude save and move (or be carried) out of the breath taker's reach,
      or the breath taker must be destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Pilk attempts to skewer an opponent with his harpoon, which is tied off to the
  mainmast. He then attacks the impaled victim with his steal air attack.
Morale: >-
  Pilk knows he cannot be permanently killed unless his ship's bell is first
  destroyed, so he fights recklessly and without fear. If attacks are made
  against the bell, he panics and focuses all of his attention upon that
  individual in order to prevent the bell's destruction.
