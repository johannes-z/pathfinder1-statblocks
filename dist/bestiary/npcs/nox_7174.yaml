    description: >-
      As long as Nox wears her blinders, she loses limit her vision to no
      farther than 10 feet; she remains no farther than 10 feet from Cizmekris
      at all times as a result. As a standard action, an adjacent creature can
      yank a chain hanging from the back of the blinders, causing the device to
      painfully rip away. This deals 2d4 points of damage to Nox, but restores
      her sight and baleful gaze ability.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Nox uses her glaive's reach to fight the PCs while they engage in melee with
  others. She prefers to fight with this weapon, but switches to her torturous
  touch if forced into close quarters. If Cizmekris removes her blinders, Nox
  swiftly moves away from her "master" to keep him out of reach of her gaze if
  possible&#8211;though she doesn't bother to keep any dottari guards sheltered
  from the gaze. She doesn't bother summoning a lemure in this battle. She
  avoids using rage so she can retain the option of using dimension door if
  needed to pursue the PCs.
Morale: Nox fights to the death.
