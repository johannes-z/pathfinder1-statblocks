BeforeCombat: >-
  Skell is on watch duty and has his crossbow loaded and readied to fire at any
  foe he spots encroaching on the Aspis base from cover.
DuringCombat: >-
  Skell fights from cover against unprepared enemies, but is unafraid to step
  out onto the ice to engage invaders in melee, lessening the ice's effect on
  his movement with his cleats. Skell and Hildr are competitive and do not aid
  one another in battle, but if his sister falls in the course of the skirmish,
  Skell focuses his attention on the enemy who dealt the killing blow.
Morale: >-
  As long as Hildr fights alongside him, Skell fights to the death. If she falls
  and he is reduced to 5 or fewer hit points, he flees to area A5 to gather
  reinforcements.
Gear: >-
  masterwork chainmail, heavy wooden shield, heavy crossbow with 10 bolts,
  longsword, cleats*, cold weather outfit, bronze Aspis Consortium badge, 6 gp
