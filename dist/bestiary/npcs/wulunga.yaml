    description: >-
      Old Wulunga can emit a roar at will as a standard action. This ability is
      modified by his Improved Roar feat (see the Bunyip Feats sidebar). All
      hearing creatures with 8 or fewer HD within a 200-foot spread must succeed
      at a DC 17 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This ability is
      otherwise identical to the bunyip's roar ability (Bestiary 2 50).
