BeforeCombat: >-
  If aware of intruders, Versevosh casts heroism on himself (not included in his
  stats) and mounts his duskhound steed.
DuringCombat: >-
  Versevosh uses his satire bardic performance on the PCs as soon as they enter
  the room. He casts scare or hideous laughter on any PCs attempting to cross
  the bridge to make that PC an easy target. He casts grease on the bridge
  underneath the PCs' feet to knock them down, and dexterously trips or disarms
  foes near the bridge using Weapon Finesse and his whip. Versevosh heals
  himself if reduced below 18 hit points; he also heals other goblins or his
  duskhound mount if he gets the chance.
Morale: >-
  Versevosh flees if more than half of the PCs make it across the bridge or if
  his goblin minions are slain.
