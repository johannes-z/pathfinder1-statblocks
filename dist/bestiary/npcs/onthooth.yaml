BeforeCombat: >-
  Onthooth prepares its lair for intruders with many illusions, as described in
  area D5 on page 54. When a fight is imminent, Onthooth casts blur, freedom of
  movement, heroism, mage armor, and see invisibility if it has the time.
  Onthooth also casts resist energy three times, selecting the energy types that
  the PCs have been using the most while fighting the skum and faceless stalker
  minions in the temple.
DuringCombat: >-
  When Onthooth is fighting in its own lair, in the first few rounds of combat
  it casts spells with a range of touch through an illusory double created by
  project image. Onthooth avoids melee combat, casting spells and swimming away
  to keep at distance until only one or two foes remain. Each round, if
  possible, Onthooth uses a swift action either to heal itself with its live on
  ability, to deal damage with painful reminder, or to cast quickened magic
  missile or another 1st-level spell.
Morale: >-
  When reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, Onthooth proposes a truce (see
  Campaign Role on page 63). If the PCs decline, the aboleth attempts a fighting
  retreat.
Gear: >-
  +1 shock amulet of mighty fists, deep red sphere ioun stone, headband of
  twisted intellect (see page 54), iridescent spindle ioun stone
