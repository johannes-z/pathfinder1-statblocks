BeforeCombat: >-
  Prior to making her assault on the cathedral, the Lissalan Assassin used her
  scrolls of bear's endurance, bull's strength, and shield, drank her potion of
  protection from good, and had an ally on the other side of the portal cast
  freedom of movement and stoneskin on her (both at caster level 12th). She has
  already applied a dose of purple worm poison to her short sword.
DuringCombat: >-
  The cultist assassin uses greater invisibility to sneak attack using spring
  attack, and if possible, a death attack on the first PC to catch up to her
  after the chase through the streets. When she has the chance while under the
  cover of invisibility, she applies her second dose of purple worm poison to
  her blade.
Morale: >-
  Having never met a foe she couldn't best and driven by her zeal for Lissala,
  the Lissalan assassin fights until she is likely too close to death to escape.
  If reduced to 10 hit points or less, she attempts to flee.
Gear: >-
  potion of protection from good (CL 6th), potion of fly, scroll of bear's
  endurance, scroll of bull's strength, scroll of cure serious wounds, scroll of
  greater invisibility, scroll of mirror image (CL 9th), scroll of shield (CL
  12th), purple worm poison (2 doses)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 mithral shirt, +1 short sword, cloak of resistance +1, belt of incredible
  dexterity +2, handy haversack, 5 gp
