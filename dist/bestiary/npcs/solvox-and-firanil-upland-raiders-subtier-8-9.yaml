BeforeCombat: >-
  The drow hide and prepare to ambush their enemies. Once they hear the enemies
  arrive in the basement, the drow use their darkness spell-like abilities on
  the fletching of their loaded crossbow bolts and then drape their cloaks over
  their weapons to block the spell effect.
DuringCombat: >-
  The drow use their stand up talent to stand as a free action, make a full
  ranged attack, then drop back to the ground behind cover if threatened by
  ranged attackers. After shooting any flat-footed PCs, they attempt to entangle
  their enemies with tanglefoot bags before continuing to fire their crossbows.
  When engaged in melee, the drow drop their crossbows and move to flank with
  their rapiers.
Morale: Fearing punishment by Inexora, Solvox and Firanil fight to the death.
