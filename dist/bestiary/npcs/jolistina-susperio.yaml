BeforeCombat: >-
  Jolistina casts shield and uses her wand of cat's grace on herself, then takes
  a dose of pesh before combat; she has taken 1 point of Constitution damage and
  2 points of Wisdom damage as a result.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jolistina plays a madcap game of cat and mouse with the PCs, taunting and
  commenting on her undead showcase. She tries to keep out of melee combat by
  rushing from room to room using Stealth and potions of invisibility, making
  use of her screaming bolts and ray of enfeeblement to further vex her foes.
  She takes single shots with her crossbow from hiding, creating bleeding sneak
  attacks, then hides again. When forced to fight in melee, she prefers doing so
  with her zombies so she can flank enemies. Confronted on her own, her first
  thought is to flee to another part of the manor to hide and ambush.
Morale: >-
  Jolistina surrenders if she's reduced to 10 or fewer hit points and tries to
  bargain for her life by spilling her guts (see What Jolistina Knows on page
  109). She tries to escape from the PCs at the first chance she gets; if she
  does escape, she seeks out Rolth despite his request for privacy, so the PCs
  may well encounter her at his side later in the chapter.
