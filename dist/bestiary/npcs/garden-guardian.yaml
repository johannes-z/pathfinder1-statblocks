  - name: Worldbound (Ex)
    description: >-
      The garden guardians are transformed jann that have been bound to the
      Material Plane by Vudrani magic. As a result, they do not have the ability
      to use ethereal jaunt or plane shift as spell-like abilities. Because of
      their unique nature, they also lack the create spawn ability possessed by
      most fungal creatures.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The garden guardians become invisible as soon as they hear anything or anyone
  approaching the area they protect.
DuringCombat: >-
  These fungal creatures open combat with their poison spore clouds, following
  that up with melee attacks. They avoid using their change size ability to
  increase their own size so as to maintain more mobility on the ledge, but
  don't hesitate to reduce the size of particularly strong foes.
Morale: >-
  The fungal janni fight to the death, pursuing foes throughout the entire
  cavern (but not into area D24, area D25 or the palace above).
Gear: +1 chainmail, mwk light steel shield, +1 scimitar
