BeforeCombat: >-
  As soon as Mumbuckle hears trouble outside on deck, he swallows his mutagen
  and readies his crossbow before rushing out the door to protect the ship.
DuringCombat: >-
  Mumbuckle throws tanglefoot bags with little regard for his own crew and
  attacks from the quarterdeck with his bombs and crossbow. If drawn into melee,
  he draws his rapier and fends his off foes as best as he can, calling to his
  crew to help him.
Morale: >-
  Mumbuckle may be cowardly, but he is dedicated to his captain, Alejia. He
  fights until all of his fellow crew members are defeated and he is reduced to
  fewer than 10 hit points, at which point he surrenders, blubbering for his
  life.
