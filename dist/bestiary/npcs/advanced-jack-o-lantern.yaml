SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Explode (Ex)
    description: >-
      One round after a jack-o'-lantern is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it
      explodes in a burst of flaming spores. Creatures within 10 feet must
      succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save or take 3d6 points of fire damage and be
      stunned for 1 round. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage
      and is not stunned. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Fear Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature within 30 feet of a jack-o'-lantern must succeed at a DC 15
      Will save or be shaken for 2d6 minutes. If a creature succeeds at this
      Will save, it is immune to that jack-o'-lantern's fear aura for 24 hours.
      This is a vision-based mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.
  - name: Pumpkin Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A jack-o'-lantern can shrink in size and douse its sinister fiery
      radiance, allowing it to blend in almost perfectly with normal pumpkins
      and take 20 on its Stealth checks to hide in plain sight as a normal
      pumpkin. While using this ability, a jack-o'-lantern loses its fear aura.
      A jack-o'- lantern can use this ability as a full-round action and end it
      as a free action.
  - name: Strangling Ensnare (Ex)
    description: >-
      A jack-o'-lantern's slam attack entangles the target in its vines for 2d4
      rounds unless the target succeeds at a DC 16 Reflex save. The target can
      attempt to burst these entangling vines before the duration expires with a
      successful DC 14 Strength check as a full-round action. While the target
      is entangled, its vines also grasp at the target's mouth. The target
      cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components while it is entangled
      by the jack-o'-lantern. When a creature is entangled by this ability, the
      jack-o'-lantern loses its slam attack, but it can end this ability as a
      free action. The save and the burst DCs are Constitution-based.
