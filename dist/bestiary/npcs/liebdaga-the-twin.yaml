SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Negative Levels (Ex)
    description: >-
      Every cooling chamber the PCs shut down imparts a permanent negative level
      upon Liebdaga. This stat block assumes that all five cooling chambers are
      shut down, and that the pit fiend has five permanent negative levels. You
      should adjust his stats as appropriate if this is not the case.
  - name: Staggered (Ex)
    description: >-
      Liebdaga is staggered, but as a standard action, he can focus his thoughts
      so that on the round immediately following he can act as if not staggered.
      The round after he acts as if not staggered, he becomes nauseated for 1
      round, after which he returns to his normal, non-nauseated staggered
      condition. While focusing his thoughts, Liebdaga is considered
      flat-footed.
  - name: Tenacious Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      As an infernal duke, Liebdaga possesses an additional power beyond most
      pit fiends-his tenacious soul. This grants Liebdaga complete immunity to
      mindaffecting effects, but more impressively it allows him to recover from
      even the most devastating of wounds. If reduced to -25 hit points, the pit
      fiend dies, but a smoky, ghostly devilish form rises from his wounds-the
      pit fiend's soul. On the pit fiend's next action, his soul targets the
      body with a breath of life spell effect (CL 12th), healing the downed pit
      fiend 5d8+12 points of damage. If this healing brings his hit point total
      back up to -25 or higher, his fast healing kicks in-if it restores him to
      positive hit points, he revives and can continue to fight. If his soul is
      unable to restore the body to at least -25 hit points, the pit fiend is
      truly dead. At this point, the soul shrieks in frustration and rage-all
      creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 19 Will save or suffer 1d6 points
      of Charisma damage from this soul-shattering, madness-inducing howl (the
      save DC is Charisma-based), after which Liebdaga's soul moves on to Hell
      and must begin anew as a mass of mindless lemures- this effectively ends
      Liebdaga for good, preventing him not only from returning to Westcrown to
      seek revenge, but from ever returning to power in Hell itself.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Liebdaga opens combat by casting fireball at the densest group of PCs. On the
  second round of combat, he takes a round to focus his thoughts so that on the
  third round of combat he can make a full attack action. He repeats these
  tactics, saving his spell-like abilities to use against foes if he can't
  engage them in melee.
Morale: >-
  Liebdaga has no choice as long as he remains imprisoned or bound to area F37,
  and fights to the death as a result.
