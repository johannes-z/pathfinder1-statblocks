SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Death (Su)
    description: >-
      A seal-breaker radiates an aura that causes undead creatures within 10
      feet to gain a +2 profane bonus on all saving throws.
  - name: Aura of the Grave (Su)
    description: >-
      A seal-breaker is constantly surrounded by the chill of death. Mindless
      undead within 10 feet of the seal-breaker don't attack him unless directly
      ordered to, and even then only after succeeding at a DC 19 Will save. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Aura of Rebirth (Su)
    description: >-
      If a living creature is slain within 10 feet of a seal-breaker, at the
      start of his next turn the seal-breaker can spend two uses of his smite
      good ability as a standard action to summon the spirit of a dead murderer
      to reanimate the corpse as a mohrg. The mohrg immediately rises and
      attacks the seal-breaker's foes, acting under the antipaladin's command.
      After 1 minute, the mohrg's soul leaves the body, which collapses, again
      lifeless.
  - name: Corpse Rider (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as the weapon bond of an antipaladin's fiendish
      boon ability.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Yosiduin uses his corpse rider ability to grant his warhammer the speed
  special ability. He casts eagle's splendor on himself and drinks his potion of
  bear's endurance. His warhammer contains the vampiric touch spell.
DuringCombat: >-
  Yosiduin prefers to face good foes in melee, smiting them before making full
  attacks. He keeps two uses of his smite good in reserve, however, as he enjoys
  animating fallen enemies as mohrgs with his aura of rebirth.
Morale: >-
  As he knows that Vigil is doomed, Yosiduin fights fanatically and meets his
  death with satisfaction.
Gear: potion of bear's endurance, potions of cure serious wounds (3)

  +3 full plate, +1 grayflameUE spell-storing warhammer, mwk daggers (3), belt
  of giant strength +2, cloak of resistance +2, ring of protection +1, silver

  upright rapier on a red field (to bypass the constructs in areas G2 and G13),
  keys to all doors in the Redoubt of the Red Crusader
