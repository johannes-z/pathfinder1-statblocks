SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      When an edavagor uses its breath weapon, both of its heads breathe a
      30-foot-long cone of flame. These cones can be directed to affect separate
      squares (dealing 8d6 points of fire damage to those within), or can cover
      the same area (wholly or partially; dealing 16d6 points of fire damage to
      those within). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Devil Chills: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 24; onset immediate; frequency
      1/day; effect 1d4 Str damage; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Spoor Worm (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature bitten by an edavagor must attempt a DC 24 Reflex save as a
      wave of worms spills over its wound. On a failed save, the devil's worms
      latch onto the creature or burrow into its wound. While the worms don't
      damage or hinder the creature, their presence allows the edavagor to know
      where the infected creature is at all times, as per the spell locate
      creature with no maximum range and even between planes. Any remove disease
      effect instantly destroys a spoor worm infestation. Immunity to disease
      offers no defense. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  Losarkur's loyal edavagor opens combat with its breath weapon, attempting to
  get as many targets as possible within the two cones. On rounds when it cannot
  use its breath weapon, the edavagor wades fearlessly into the largest mass of
  enemies it can reach, using its size and many attacks to deal damage to as
  many creatures as possible each round.
