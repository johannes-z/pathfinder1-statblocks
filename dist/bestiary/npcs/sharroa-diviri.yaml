SpecialAbilities:
  - name: (Su)
    description: >-
      While wearing her signifer mask, as a swift action, DiViri can see through
      up to 5 feet of stone, wood, or similar barriers within 30 feet as if they
      didn't exist. This effect cannot penetrate metal of any kind. She can use
      her assiduous gaze for up to 2 rounds per day; these rounds need not be
      consecutive. Exceptional Equipment DiViri possesses the sanguine talisman
      of Sheel Leroung, a magic item more powerful than a character of her level
      should possess. In addition to this, she has access to many of the magical
      treasures of the Order of the Rack Hellknights-particularly wands of
      summon monster. This advantage increases her CR by 1.
