SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cold Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      Eight times per day, as a standard action, Cailleach can unleash a blast
      of freezing cold. The blast deals 2d6+4 cold damage to all creatures
      within 5 feet of the hag and staggers them for 1 round. A successful DC 18
      Reflex save halves the damage and negates the staggered condition. The DC
      is Intelligence-based.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Demon Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 20; onset immediate; frequency
      1/day; effect 1d6 Con damage (target must save a second time or 1 point of
      the damage is drain instead); cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  As soon as she detects intruders, the hag turns invisible, then darts about
  the caverns making subtle scratching noises in order to lure them towards Eya,
  using her as bait to distract them so she can gain surprise.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once the PCs become occupied with Eya, she strikes from behind, biting the
  nearest opponent, and then unleashes her cold blast special ability. Next, she
  turns ethereal, uses her sleet storm ability, and if possible, grabs Eya and
  drags her about the caverns, taunting the PCs and trying to get them to split
  up in order to attack them individually, alternating between her at-will
  powers and physical attacks. As she wears down, she eventually drops Eya in
  another location and then begins stalking the PCs.
Morale: >-
  If reduced below 20 hit points, the hag turns ethereal (or invisible if she's
  lost her heartstone) and attempts to flee.
