DuringCombat: >-
  The sailors fight in a well-organized way, firing their crossbows at any PCs
  attempting to board or cutting the grappling ropes as the PCs are attempting
  to cross. Once the PCs reach the deck, the sailors attempt to bull rush
  boarders over the side, then draw their short swords to defend their ship,
  working as a group to outflank opponents.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 6 hit points, a sailor withdraws to the sterncastle
  (area B4) but continues fighting with his crossbow. If reduced to 3 hit points
  or fewer, a sailor flees or surrenders.
