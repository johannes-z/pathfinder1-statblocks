SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Tallowthroat (Ex)
    description: >-
      Fane and Oana's advanced stage of tallowthroat has reduced their Charisma
      scores to 5, and they take a -4 penalty on saving throws made against
      mind-affecting effects in areas of bright illumination. A character
      touching either thrall risks contracting the disease.
DuringCombat: >-
  Fane and Oana don't want to see any harm befall Ilquis, but they are not
  trained in the ways of combat and fight only haphazardly to protect him.
Morale: >-
  Though afflicted with tallowthroat and charmed by Ilquis, Fane and Oana are
  not stupid and surrender if reduced to below half their total hit points.
