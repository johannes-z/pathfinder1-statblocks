DuringCombat: >-
  Kroop is no fighter, and prefers attacking opponents from behind, preferably
  with a sneak attack, rather than facing foes in a fair fight.
Morale: >-
  When the odds are against him, Kroop fights like a cornered dog. He feels he
  has nothing to lose, and rarely backs down. If protecting a friend, he is
  fiercely brave, and fights to the death.
OtherGear: >-
  padded armor, daggers (4), frying pan (improvised club), steadfast grapple
  (see page 59), bottle of rum, chicken, clay mugs (2), gold earring worth 5 gp
