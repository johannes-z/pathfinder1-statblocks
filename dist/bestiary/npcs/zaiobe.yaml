SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mute (Ex)
    description: >-
      Zaiobe's oracle curse renders her mute-she can't speak, use verbal spell
      components, or use her captivating song as a result. This same curse,
      though, grants her the ability to cast all spells as if using the Silent
      Spell metamagic feat without modifying that spell's actual level. In
      addition, Zaiobe can communicate telepathically with any creature she is
      in physical contact with. She can also maintain a telepathic bond with one
      specific creature at a time by taking a full-round action to link her mind
      to that creature during telepathic communication. Currently, she shares
      this link with Kikonu, even though, ironically, the two are not speaking.
      Zaiobe can change the target of her telepathic link once per day.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Zaiobe avoids melee combat, casting entropic shield on herself on the first
  round of combat after using flight to put some distance between herself and
  her enemies. She saves cause fear to drive away anyone who manages to stay in
  melee with her, relying primarily on her longbow to take down foes. She's
  saving her flaming arrows for Kikonu&#8211;she suspects the next time they
  interact, he'll push her over the edge, after all&#8211;but if brought below
  25 hit points, she uses the arrows on her most dangerous foe at that time
  instead. She casts cure light wounds on herself whenever she drops below 20
  hit points.
Morale: >-
  Zaiobe fights to the death, confident that her mysterious connection to Pazuzu
  will protect her until proven otherwise.
