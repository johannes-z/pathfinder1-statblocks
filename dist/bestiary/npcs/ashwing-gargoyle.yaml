DuringCombat: >-
  Ashwing gargoyles hate humans-and among them, hate Shoanti the most. They
  favor these targets in combat over all others, and often take advantage of
  Flyby Attack to swoop in and bite at enemies while preventing full attacks in
  retaliation.
Morale: An Ashwing flees once reduced to fewer than 5 hp.
