  The grand inquisitor casts keen edge (on his crossbow bolts), resist energy
  (fire), shield of faith, and stoneskin.
DuringCombat: >-
  The grand inquisitor first studies his targets and uses his bane and scythe of
  evil abilities to enhance his attacks. He employs ranged attacks for as long
  as possible, firing poisoned bolts to weaken his foes while remaining out of
  melee. When melee is necessary, the grand inquisitor activates his eyes of
  embersight and casts deeper darkness on his armor. He then feints his foes as
  often as he can.
Gear: wand of darkness (10 charges), blue whinnis (4), deathblade, unholy water (2)
