SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Seeded (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creatures killed by the Star Seed rise as seeded creatures in 1d10
      rounds. (See page 90 of Pathfinder Adventure Path #113: What Grows Within
      for more information on seeded creatures.)
  - name: Dread Decay (Su)
    description: >-
      The Star Seed's tentacles inflict a horrible affliction that withers the
      flesh, digesting the victims with alarming speed. This withering begins
      when the tentacle deals damage and continues for 4 rounds thereafter. Each
      round the rot persists, the target must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save
      or take 2 points of Constitution damage and 2 points of Strength damage.
      If the target succeeds at two consecutive saving throws, the effect is
      cured. Heal also ends the effect.
  - name: Fungal Snares (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, the Star Seed can shoot out streams of sickly fungus
      that can snag targets at a range of 60 feet. The Star Seed can fire three
      of these each round and must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit
      a target. Targets struck take 3d6 points of damage and are subject to grab
      and dread decay.
  - name: Powerful Tentacles (Ex)
    description: The Star Seed's tentacle attacks are treated as primary natural attacks.
  - name: Returning Great Old One (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Star Seed is a merger of Xhamen-Dor and Count Lowls. Until Count Lowls
      is forever subsumed into the Great Old One, the Star Seed isn't a full
      Great Old One. However, it gains all of the benefits from the Great Old
      One subtype (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 306) save for immortality and
      mythic.
  - name: Unspeakable Presence (Su)
    description: >-
      Failing a DC 28 Will save against the Star Seed's unspeakable presence
      causes a victim to become nauseated for 1d2 rounds and sickened for an
      additional 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
