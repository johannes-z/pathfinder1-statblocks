SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cartouche of Invulnerability (Su)
    description: >-
      Hakotep's name has been branded onto the undead dinosaur's chest.
      Originally meant as a mark of dominance, the cartouche also protects
      Sensuret with the effects of a globe of invulnerability. Once per round, a
      character who attacks the Tribe-Eater (or specifically takes an action to
      study the undead creature) can attempt a DC 25 Perception check to notice
      the brand on the creature's desiccated flesh under its linen wrappings;
      with a successful DC 35 Knowledge (arcana) check, a character identifies
      the marking for what it is. The cartouche can be sundered (it has 20 hit
      points that do not count against the dinosaur's actual hit point total),
      at which point the Tribe-Eater loses its invulnerability until it
      rejuvenates.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      If Sensuret is destroyed, its body and bones crumble to sand that swiftly
      blows away in the wind, but only 1d4 hours later it reforms at the spot of
      its death, fully healed. If its cartouche was destroyed, it is restored to
      full effectiveness at this time. In order to be permanently destroyed, the
      Tribe-Eater must be reduced to 0 hit points while its figurine is placed
      on the podium in area C6, or it must be reduced to 0 hit points while
      within the area of a hallow spell.
DuringCombat: >-
  Sensuret uses pounce and Power Attack to attack foes as often as possible,
  moving from target to target whenever it can&#8211;the undead dinosaur doesn't
  really fight defensively at all. When it's prevented from using pounce but
  still needs to move, it uses an Improved Vital Strike bite instead.
Morale: Sensuret fights until destroyed.
