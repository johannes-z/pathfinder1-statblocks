  - name: Spider Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      Every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a corpsespun can spray a hail of
      spiders from its mouth in a 20-foot cone. Each creature in the area takes
      3d6 points of swarm damage (DC 23 Reflex save for half ) and is distracted
      (DC 23 Fortitude save negates). The spiders quickly spread across the
      opponent's body in the same round they contact it and automatically bite,
      delivering a highly debilitating poison. The spiders cause swarm damage
      and distraction each round for 1d4 rounds, at which point they fall off
      and die. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Spider Transfer (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a corpsespun successfully hits an opponent with a natural attack,
      or whenever the corpsespun is successfully hit with a natural attack or
      unarmed strike, a number of spiders are automatically transferred to the
      opponent. The spiders quickly spread and swarm over the opponent (as
      detailed in the spider spray ability). These spiders fall off and die
      after 1 round.
DuringCombat: >-
  The corpsespun sarcosuchus sprays opponents with its spider spray as often as
  possible, then attempts to bite and grab the nearest enemy to use its death
  roll. It uses its tail slap on any other creatures who come within its reach.
Morale: The sarcosuchus fights until destroyed.
