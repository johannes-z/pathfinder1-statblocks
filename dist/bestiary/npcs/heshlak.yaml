SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bane (Su)
    description: >-
      Heshlak can imbue one of her weapons with the bane weapon special ability
      as a swift action. She must select one creature type when she uses this
      ability (and a subtype if the creature type is humanoid or outsider). Once
      selected, the type can be changed as a swift action. This ability lasts
      for a number of rounds per day equal to her inquisitor level. These rounds
      do not need to be consecutive.
  - name: Improved Whip Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      When wielding a whip, Heshlak threatens an area equal to her natural reach
      plus 5 feet.
  - name: Judgments (Su)
    description: >-
      Heshlak can pronounce judgment on her foes as a swift action. Starting
      when the judgment is made, she receives a bonus or special ability based
      on the type of judgment made. Once activated, this ability lasts until the
      combat ends, at which point all of the bonuses immediately end. She must
      participate in the combat to gain these bonuses. If she is frightened,
      panicked, paralyzed, stunned, unsconscious, or otherwise prevented from
      participating in combat, the ability does not end, but the bonuses do not
      resume until she can participate in the combat again. When Heshlak uses
      this ability, she must select one type of judgment to make. As a swift
      action, she can change this judgment to another type. The two judgment
      types Heshlak uses in this combat are as follows: Destruction: Heshlak is
      filled with divine wrath, gaining a +2 profane bonus on all weapon damage
      rolls. Protection: Heshlak is surrounded by a protective aura, granting a
      +2 profane bonus to Armor Class.
  - name: Solo Tactics (Ex)
    description: >-
      All of Heshlak's allies are treated as if they possessed the same teamwork
      feats as her for the purpose of determining whether Heshlak receives a
      bonus from her teamwork feats. Her allies do not receive any bonuses from
      these feats unless they actually posses the feats themselves. The allies'
      positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisities listed in the
      teamwork feat for Heshlak to receive the listed bonus.
  - name: Tandem Trip (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever Heshlak makes a trip attempt against an enemy who is threatened
      by an ally with this feat, she may roll twice and take the better result.
  - name: Whip Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Heshlak does not provoke attacks of opportunity when making attacks with a
      whip. Additionally, she can deal lethal damage with a whip, but can still
      deal nonlethal damage when she chooses. Finally, she can deal damage with
      a whip despite a creature's armor bonus or natural armor bonus.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If warned of the PCs' approach, Heshlak casts bless on herself and the
  cultists, drinks her potion of cat's grace, and casts flames of the faithful
  on her whip, granting it the flaming burst weapon special property for 6
  rounds (caster level +1 round as a transmutation spell).
DuringCombat: >-
  Once the PCs are in range, Heshlak casts spiritual weapon on a spellcaster,
  pronounces a judgment of destruction against the party, and moves forward to
  threaten any PC entering the room with her whip. She tries to stay out of the
  PCs' reach, letting cultists engage them while using her whip's reach to
  dominate the floor, expending a swift action to activate her bane ability,
  selecting the most common humanoid subtype among the Pathfinders. She
  positions herself to have multiple PCs within 10 feet, if possible, and uses
  her action each round to either strike a target of the subtype of her bane
  ability or to make trip attacks. She gleefully takes attacks of opportunity
  against anyone within range who provokes them. If attacked, she trips her
  assailant and steps away, laying into them with the whip if trapped.
  Confronted by multiple assailants at once, she switches her judgment to
  protection and lashes about her as best she can.
Morale: >-
  Heshlak refuses to surrender. If brought below 15 hit points, and a PC is
  between her and the opening to the  central well, she attempts a bull rush to
  knock her enemy and herself into the shaft for a 60-foot drop.
Gear: potion of cat's grace, potion of cure serious wounds
OtherGear: >-
  +1 mithral shirt, heavy steel shield, +1 agile whip, masterwork scimitar,
  heavy crossbow with 10 bolts, spell component pouch, wooden holy symbol
