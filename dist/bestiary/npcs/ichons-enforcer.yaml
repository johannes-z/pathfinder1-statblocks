BeforeCombat: >-
  The enforcers prefer to scare targets rather than risk their necks in fights.
  If they suspect Senzer is asking the PCs for help, they cut him off before he
  reveals their identity, using the surprise round to demoralize the PCs with
  Intimidate checks.
DuringCombat: >-
  The enforcers rely on their saps unless opponents prove invulnerable to
  nonlethal damage.
Morale: Ichon's men fear her more than they fear death. They don't run or surrender.
Gear: studded leather, light crossbow with 10 bolts, sap, scimitar
