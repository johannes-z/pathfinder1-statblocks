BeforeCombat: Tsadok drinks his potion of blur before entering combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tsadok opens fire on the first round of combat with his doubleshot pepperbox,
  making a full attack by firing two barrels at a time at the most heavily
  armored opponent. When his pistol is empty, Tsadok drops the pepperbox, draws
  his falchion, and rages. The stat block above includes the extra bonuses from
  his furious falchion. Tsadok waits for opponents to come to him, using his
  unexpected strike rage power to make attacks of opportunity against foes who
  engage him. He activates his guarded stance rage power and makes Power
  Attacks, using his auspicious mark rage power to turn a miss into a hit if
  necessary, and attempts to sunder the weapons of anyone attacking him in
  melee.
Morale: Tsadok does not fear death and fights to the end.
