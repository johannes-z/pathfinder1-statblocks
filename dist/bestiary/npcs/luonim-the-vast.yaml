SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bloat (Su)
    description: >-
      Luonim can exert himself as a free action to gain 1d6 blood points twice
      per day (see Blood Pool, below). Bloatmage Initiate By undergoing
      elaborate rituals and gruesome rites to increase the amount of blood in
      his body, Luonim can draw upon additional magical reserves. This feat
      allows Luonim to cast evocation spells at +1 caster level, but the
      resulting bloating encumbers him as if he had a medium load.
  - name: Blood Pool (Su)
    description: >-
      Luonim has 4 blood points, representing his capacity to draw upon excess
      blood in his body to fuel his sorcerous magic. He can spend blood points
      at the time of casting to cast a spell without using that spell's spell
      slot. Retaining a spell slot in this manner costs a number of blood points
      equal to the spell's level. Luonim can push himself via his bloat ability
      in order to gain a number of extra blood points, but such exertion is a
      dangerous gamble. If his current number of blood points is greater than 4
      blood points but less than or equal to 8 blood points, he gains the
      sickened condition. If he exceeds 8 blood points, he immediately flies
      into a homicidal rage, striking out randomly with his most damaging
      attacks and abilities at friends and foes alike for 1d6 rounds or until
      his blood points are reduced to 0 (whichever comes first). At the end of
      the rage, his blood points drop to 0 and his hit points drop to -1.
  - name: Corpulence (Ex)
    description: >-
      Luonim is so fat that his rolls of blood-laden flesh grant him a +1
      natural armor bonus.
  - name: Hemophilia (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bloatmages are particularly susceptible to bleed effects, and the DC of
      any Heal check made to stop a bleed effect is 5 higher than normal.
      Anytime Luonim suffers a wound that causes bleed damage, he loses 1 blood
      point, but he does not lose additional blood points for taking ongoing
      bleed damage.
Gender: Male
Bloodline: fey
BeforeCombat: >-
  Luonim casts mage armor at the start of each day, using a point from his blood
  pool that he then regains by applying his fortifying leeches. He uses a charge
  from his wand of shield as soon as he fears combat is nearing.
DuringCombat: >-
  The gnome bloatmage starts combat by casting invisibility using 2 points from
  his blood pool, then casts fly to move about the room while the PCs deal with
  the centrifuge. While invisible, he casts fire shield on himself, then casts
  summon monster III spells for a few more rounds to summon lantern archons to
  harass the PCs. Once he's confident the PCs have their hands full, he begins
  hammering the PCs with shouts, fireballs, and cones of cold. He makes use of
  his blood pool each round to maximize his spells available.
Morale: Luonim is out of his mind, and fights to the death.
Gear: potions of cure moderate wounds (3), wand of shield (CL 10th, 11 charges)
