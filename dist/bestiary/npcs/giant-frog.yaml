SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adhesive Tongue (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant frog's tongue has a 15-foot reach. The tongue deals no damage on a
      hit, but can be used to grab the target-the adhesive qualities of the
      tongue grant a giant frog a +4 racial bonus on CMB checks made to grab a
      target with its tongue. If it grabs a foe, it can pull that target. A
      giant frog's tongue may be attacked and has AC 15. Damage inflicted to the
      tongue is deducted from the frog's hit points as normal. If the tongue
      takes any amount of piercing or slashing damage, the frog drops whatever
      it has grabbed with its tongue and cannot use its tongue attack again
      until it heals to its full hit points.
  - name: Pull (Ex)
    description: >-
      The frog can make a free combat maneuver check with a successful tongue
      attack. If successful, the tongue pulls the frog's opponent 5 feet closer
      to the frog. This ability only works on Medium or smaller creatures.
      Opponents pulled in this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity and
      stop if the pull would move them into a solid object or creature.
  - name: Swallow Whole (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a frog begins its turn with an opponent grappled in its mouth, it can
      attempt a new combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the
      opponent). If it succeeds, it swallows its prey, and the opponent takes
      bite damage. The opponent can be up to one size category smaller than the
      frog. Being swallowed causes a creature to take damage each round (see
      above). A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, while the
      creature that did the swallowing does not. A swallowed creature can try to
      cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon (by dealing
      the creature 2 hit points of damage), or it can just try to escape the
      grapple. The frog's interior Armor Class is 10. If a swallowed creature
      cuts its way out, the frog cannot use swallow whole again until thedamage
      is healed. If the swallowed creature escapes the grapple, success puts it
      back in the frog mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.
