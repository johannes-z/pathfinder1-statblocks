  Hatchet-Hand lacks any ranged capabilities save for his gas grenades. He uses
  them against foes as needed, not caring much if he catches one or two Smilers
  in the area of effect of the toxic cloud. He prefers to fight in melee,
  especially if he can make a full attack with both axes.
Morale: Hatchet-Hand fights to the death.
