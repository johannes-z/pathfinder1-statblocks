    description: >-
      While in darkness, the serpent of darkness has fast healing 5. Outside of
      darkness, the serpent of darkness loses its fast healing, its damage
      reduction, and its spell resistance, and takes a -4 penalty on all attack
      rolls and saving throws.
DuringCombat: >-
  The serpent of darkness prefers to attack the strongest, most heavily armored
  foes if an obvious champion of a good deity is not apparent. It uses smites
  good with its first attack in combat, and is fond of using Power Attack
  (taking a &#8211;4 penalty to deal 8 extra points of damage on each hit), but
  abandons this tactic if it can't hit its current foe with at least one bite
  per round.
Morale: >-
  The serpent of darkness fights to the death in the dark, but if reduced to 40
  hp or less while in any amount of light, it flees to find a dark place to hide
  and heal.
