  The guards' primary responsibility is to keep the peace, and keep anyone from
  interfering with customers enjoying themselves and spending money. They're
  also always tasked with the responsibility of preventing anyone from "testing"
  Ika's illusion of Jherizhana.
Morale: >-
  If brought down to 5 or fewer hit points, the guards disengage in order to get
