SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Greater Resolve (Ex)
    description: >-
      After a critical hit is confirmed against him, a samurai can spend one use
      of his resolve as an immediate action to treat that critical hit as a
      normal hit. Effects that only trigger on a critical hit do not trigger
      when the samurai uses this ability.
  - name: Without Master (Ex)
    description: >-
      The ronin can call upon his immense willpower as an immediate action, and
      can use it in one of three ways. He can use his willpower whenever an
      attack would reduce him to fewer than 0 hit points but wouldn't kill him,
      to instead be at 1 hit point and conscious. He can use his willpower after
      making an attack roll to confirm a critical hit in order to reroll the
      confirmation roll. Finally, he can use his willpower to take 10 on a skill
      check during combat, even if the situation or the skill would not normally
      allow him to take 10. A ronin can use this ability once during a combat.
