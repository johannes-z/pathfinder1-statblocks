SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Enchantment Weakness (Ex)
    description: >-
      The weakened conviction of the soulbound doll's soul makes her susceptible
      to mind-affecting effects, despite her construct traits.
  - name: Soul Focus (Su)
    description: >-
      The soul bound to the doll lives within a focus integrated into the doll
      or its apparel, in the Diva's case a gem embedded into the doll's chest.
      As long as this soul focus remains intact, it can be built into another
      dollfor the soul to animate, using the same cost as creating a new
      construct. Once bound into the soul focus, the soul continues to learn,
      and so if later put into a new doll body, the soul retains its personality
      and memories from its previous body or bodies. The Diva's soul focus has
      hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break DC of 20.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  The Diva sits lifeless on the organ's bench, patiently waiting for her next
  victim. If the PCs activate the wailing worm in area B1, the Diva hides behind
  the organ and casts mage armor (effectively +3 to her AC). The Diva attempts
  to distract PCs with ghost sound or ventriloquism as they explore the room or
  to subdue them with her scroll of deep slumber. Once the PCs attention is
  diverted or they pass out, she casts suggestion on the PC with the highest
  Charisma, directing that PC to play a somber dirge on the organ. If the PC
  makes a mistake at the keyboard (Perform [any] DC 10), the Diva attacks in
  anger.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Diva avoids melee combat, using enthrall, grease, and levitate to keep
  combatants at a distance or out of the combat.
Morale: >-
  The Diva fights until destroyed, though even if reduced to 0 hit points, if
  her soul focus isn't removed and destroyed (see below) she could eventually be
  reconstructed and placed into a new soulbound doll body.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure light wounds, potion of invisibility, scroll of cure moderate
  wounds, scroll of deep slumber
OtherGear: masterwork studded leather, masterwork dagger, cloak of resistance +1, 48 gp
