SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acidic Pustules (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gnoll skirmisher is covered in necrotic pustules that burst at the
      slightest touch. Whenever a creature deals piercing or slashing damage to
      the Mana Wastes mutant, all creatures adjacent to the gnoll take 1d4
      points of acid damage (Reflex DC 17 negates) as the mutant gnoll's boils
      and blisters pop and spray about. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Anyone who lives with mana fever for a week straight without dying becomes
      immune to the disease, but also becomes a Mana Wastes mutant. Mana fever:
      Injury-slam; save Fort DC 17; onset 1d4 minutes; frequency 1 day; effect
      1d3 Con damage, 1d3 Cha drain; cure 2 consecutive saves.
DuringCombat: >-
  The gnolls switch between firing bullets and pellets against single targets,
  resorting to slam and spear attacks if their enemies force them into melee
  combat.
Morale: >-
  The gnolls know that they have little means of escape and fear punishment from
  Gurstweld if they fail their mission, and thus fight to the death.
