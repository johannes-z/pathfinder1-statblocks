BeforeCombat: >-
  If the orcs notice the PCs' approach, they apply shadow essence to their
  falchions.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, one of the orcs throws his goblin skull bomb
  while other two engage foes in melee. The orcs use Power Attack and Cleave to
  maximum efficiency.
Morale: >-
  As long as at least two orcs are still standing, they fight to the death. If
  the sole surviving orc is reduced to fewer than 5 hit points, he drops his
  weapons and surrenders, groveling for mercy.
