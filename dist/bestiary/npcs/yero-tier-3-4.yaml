BeforeCombat: >-
  Yero interacts with the PCs in a friendly&#8211;if brash&#8211;manner until it
  dawns on him what they are after, at which point he calmly begins to use his
  bardic performance ability to fascinate one of the PCs. During his dramatic
  performance, he quaffs the potion of bull's strength he's holding, acting as
  though it's a part of whatever he's acting out. He then turns his sword on the
  PCs, breaking the fascination effect.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first turn of combat, Yero throws a smokestick down to hide his
  movements. Afterward, he attacks whichever PC is closest to him with his
  longsword. While he could drop his gnome disguise to increase his size to
  Medium, Yero prefers fighting with his sword, which would be undersized for
  him were he to change his shape.
Morale: Yero fights until he is rendered unconscious or killed.
