    description: >-
      Once per month, the Black Milk Mother may, as a full-round action, give
      birth to its monstrous brood. When it does so, a vile, watery, black fluid
      spews from its body in a 10-foot radius, coating the ground as well as any
      creatures or objects in the area. Any creature that comes in contact with
      the fluid must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4
      rounds. The following round, 1d3 advanced hyenas emerge from the
      creature's putrid womb. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  The Black Milk Mother begins combat chained the back wall. So long as it
  remains shackled, it cannot move beyond 15 feet from the chain's anchor point
  on the southern wall, and must wait for opponents to come within reach before
  striking.
DuringCombat: >-
  The foul creature furiously gnashes at opponents with its powerful jaws,
  tugging wildly at its chains. Each round, the Black Milk Mother uses its move
  action to try to break free (Strength DC 35) and attack. If it lasts 4 rounds
  while fighting the PCs, it suddenly begins convulsing. For the next 2 rounds,
  it fights defensively, and then gives birth to its vile spawn.
Morale: The Black Milk Mother fights to the death.
