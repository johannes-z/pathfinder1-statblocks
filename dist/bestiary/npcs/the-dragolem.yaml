  - name: Immunities (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dragolem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell
      resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently
      against the creature, as noted below. &#8226; An erase spell cast on a
      dragolem paralyzes it for 1d6 rounds unless it succeeds on a Will save
      with a DC equal to 11 + spellcaster's key attribute. &#8226; The
      comprehend languages spell functions as a charm monster spell when used
      against a dragolem.
