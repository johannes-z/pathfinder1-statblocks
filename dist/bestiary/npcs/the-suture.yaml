SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Pain (Su)
    description: >-
      The Suture's body is constantly wracked with pain, causing all living
      non-outsiders within a 30-foot spread to writhe in sympathetic agony as
      well. At the start of any round in which a creature is in this area, it
      must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be staggered by the pain for 1
      round. Once a creature succeeds at this saving throw, it is immune to the
      Suture's aura of pain for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based, and
      includes a +10 racial bonus.
  - name: Dampen Mythic Power (Su)
    description: >-
      The Suture's presence impedes the function of mythic power other than his
      own. All mythic creatures within a 30-foot spread of the Suture take a -2
      penalty on all attack rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and ability
      checks (no save). All costs for expending uses of mythic power are doubled
      while in this area.
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      If the Suture is slain, his body explodes in a blast of red lightning,
      filling a 30-foot-radius spread and dealing 20d6 points electricity damage
      to all creatures in the area of effect. A successful DC 20 Reflex save
      halves this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Reflect Death (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Suture is immune to death effects, and any death effect that
      specifically targets him is automatically reflected back in full at the
      target, as if via spell turning (this ability also affects supernatural
      death effects).
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      The Suture cannot be permanently slain as long as the Worldwound remains
      open. If killed by any method, he returns to life at the place he died (or
      in the closest available space able to support his weight; see also
      Worldwound-Bound, below). Long-term effects that disable him, such as
      flesh to stone, imprisonment, or temporal stasis, automatically fail after
      24 hours, releasing him from the condition with no further harm. If the
      Worldwound is closed, he immediately perishes forever. Worldwound-Bound
      (Ex) If the Suture ever travels farther than 100 miles from Threshold, he
      immediately dies (triggering his death throes). When he rejuvenates, he
      appears at a random location within a 10-mile radius of Threshold. Travel
      to other planes triggers this death, with the exception of entering the
      Rasping Rifts at Threshold. Entering an extradimensional pocket (such as
      that created by rope trick or a portable hole) does not trigger a death.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Suture relies on blasphemy and word of chaos at first, then focuses his
  feeble melee attacks on those who lie senseless as a result. Otherwise, he
  spends the duration of every battle attempting to hide and avoid being hurt if
  possible, simpering and whining all the while.
Morale: >-
  The Suture knows that death holds no permanence, but does not enjoy dying. He
  attempts to flee and hide if reduced to fewer than 100 hit points.
