BeforeCombat: >-
  Dr. Davaulus casts misdirection whenever he expects to be involved in a public
  scene; if he meets with the PCs, he chooses one of the chaotic good but
  unconscious Varisians in area F7 as the spell's target.
DuringCombat: >-
  Davaulus considers himself a gentleman, even though his interests run to
  murder and cruelty. He engages in physical combat only as a last resort. When
  he fights, he uses Combat Expertise, saving hideous laughter for use against
  foes who seem to have more brawn than brains.
Morale: >-
  Davaulus attempts to flee if brought to fewer than 10 hit points, but fights
  to the death if no escape seems possible. Loyal to the Red Mantis, he does not
  surrender.
