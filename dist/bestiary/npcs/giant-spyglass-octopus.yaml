DuringCombat: >-
  The octopus targets multiple victims with its tentacles, relying on
  Blind-Fight and its grab ability to pull opponents into the water. Once it has
  prey in the water, the octopus either constricts it, transfers the victim to
  its mouth for a poisonous bite, or holds it underwater until it drowns.
Morale: >-
  The octopus retreats if it falls below 25 hit points, leaving behind an ink
  cloud as it jets away with any victims still in its grasp.
