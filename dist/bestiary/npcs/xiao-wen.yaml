    description: >-
      Xiao can cast spells while wielding a weapon at the same time. This
      ability functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the off-hand weapon
      is a spell that is being cast. As a full-round action, she can make all of
      her attacks with his melee weapon at a -2 penalty and can also cast any of
      her prepared spells with a casting time of 1 standard action (any attack
      roll made as part of this spell also takes this penalty). If Xiao casts
      this spell defensively, she can decide to take an additional penalty on
      her attack rolls, up to her Intelligence bonus, and add the same amount as
      a circumstance bonus on her concentration check. If the check fails, the
      spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. Xiao can choose
      to cast the spell first or make the weapon attack first.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Xiao waits belowdecks to avoid ranged attacks until she can board the PCs'
  ship. The round before boarding, Xiao uses her arcane pool ability to give her
  scimitar a +1 enhancement bonus on attacks.
DuringCombat: >-
  Xiao uses color spray on the first round to hit as many PCs as possible. She
  then attacks any PCs who weren't affected by the color spray with her
  offensive spells and scimitar, using spell combat to both cast and attack each
  round.
Morale: >-
  Xiao knows enough about the empire's plans for the Braid of a Hundred Masters
  to realize it is of crucial importance, and thus fights to the death for the
  glory of Lingshen.
