Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Pezock sneak attacks the closest flat-footed foe he can on the first round of
  combat. If he has allies, he remains mobile and attempts to maximize his sneak
  attacks, but if on his own, the tengu prefers to take full attack
  actions&#8211;if facing multiple foes, he fights defensively.
Morale: >-
  Pezock attempts to flee if reduced to 10 hit points or fewer. He'll even drop
  his magic sword if he thinks that'll give him an extra few seconds to flee
  while his pursuer stops to pick the weapon up, but if he does so and gets
  away, he obsesses over getting his prize back.
