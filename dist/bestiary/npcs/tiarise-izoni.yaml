SQ: dimensional augmentation, witch's familiar (devil, imp named Kelaxiax)
Source: AP 100
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Commune with Familiar (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per week, Tiarise can use her link with her familiar Kelaxiax to cast
      contact other plane as a spell-like ability. The entity contacted replies
      via Kelaxiax, speaking through the familiar in a disconcertingly deep
      voice. Tiarise gains a +4 bonus on the Intelligence check to avoid ability
      score decreases when using the spell in this way, and such decreases last
      only 24 hours rather than a number of weeks.
  - name: Dimensional Augmentation (Su)
    description: >-
      Up to five times per day, Tiarise can augment her spells by incorporating
      complex mathematical equations in a ritualized manner while casting,
      inscribing the equations on a nearby surface with chalk or ink. Doing so
      adds a somatic component and a material component (the chalk equations),
      and increases the spell's casting time to a number of rounds equal to the
      spell's level (if the spell's casting time is 1 minute or longer, it is
      not altered). Augmenting a spell in this way increases its effective
      caster level by 1. Dimensions Patron Tiarise gains the following bonus
      spells from this patron (although she normally doesn't prepare all of
      them): blink, dimensional anchor, hold portal, lesser planar binding, and
      rope trick.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Every day, Tiarise casts false life, mage armor, and unseen servant, all at
  caster level 12th via dimensional augmentation. She casts status in this
  manner as well, targeting her imp Kelaxiax, both of her invisible stalkers,
  and her hellcat Megonya. Tiarise drinks a potion of shield of faith just
  before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tiarise begins combat with her most dangerous spells&#8211;flesh to stone,
  feeblemind, and phantasmal killer, avoiding melee combat if possible. She
  retreats to take cover in the inquisitor troop if no other option is
  available, although doing so forces her to attempt concentration checks to
  cast spells. If reduced to 50 or fewer hit points, she uses vampiric touch,
  delivered by her imp familiar, on the most heavily wounded PC. She commands
  her unseen servant to pick up any items the PCs drop in combat, to open and
  close doors to break line of sight, or otherwise force the PCs to waste
  valuable time.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 20 hp, Tiarise casts dimension door to teleport to
  area B3, where she casts rope trick on the bell cord to go into hiding.
  Therein, she casts her healing spells before emerging to take up the battle
  again. If reduced to 20 hp or less a second time, she casts teleport to flee
  to the Temple of Asmodeus&#8211;the PCs can confront her again at Barzillai's
  side, and this time, she does not flee. If Tiarise is slain, her body swiftly
  fades away into a coil of shrieking mist that then dissipates, leaving her
  gear behind but no body. This begins her transformation into an undead
  guardian, which won't reach its conclusion until the final adventure,
  "Breaking the Bones of Hell." Methods exist to prevent this transformation
  from occurring, such as taking care to kill Tiarise while she is in the area
  of effect of a hallow spell, but once she's slain and the transformation
  begins, the PCs are destined to face her again in the final adventure.
