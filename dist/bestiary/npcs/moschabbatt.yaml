BeforeCombat: >-
  Moschabbatt never enters battle without mage armor, and if he's aware of
  incoming danger, he will also cast shield and resist energy (cold). If he has
  not been spotted, he likes to enter engagements under the cover of
  invisibility.
DuringCombat: >-
  Moschabbatt prefers to face foes above the lava lake, stripping them of their
  fire resistance and magical flight using dispel magic (often quickened). He
  then blinds ranged combatants, and blasts the rest with cold spells before
  switching to electricity and acid.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20% of his hit points, Moschabbatt will parley. However, if his
  enemies are after the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords, he will teleport or dimension
  door to his vault, use heal while there, and return to fight to the death.
