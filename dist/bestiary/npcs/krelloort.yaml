DuringCombat: >-
  Krelloort closes in to concentrate his attacks on those who are less armored,
  delighting in watching his opponents slowly turn into coral from his magical
  trident's attacks. If hard pressed, Krelloort enters a blood frenzy and tries
  to take down as many opponents as possible.
Morale: >-
  If Krelloort survives his blood frenzy but finds he still has substantial
  opponents remaining, he attempts to flee out of the lair through area D18 and
  down into the depths of the blue hole. He hopes his high Constitution score
  will allow him to survive in the anoxic waters until his pursuers have
  succumbed to suffocation. If pursuers instead wait for him above the anoxic
  level, he eventually swims upward to meet them, fighting to the death to
  defeat his foes.
