SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Chilling Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      A yuki-onna's touch causes 4d6 cold damage. Whenever a creature takes cold
      damage in this manner, it must make a DC 20 Fortitude save to avoid being
      staggered by the supernatural cold for 1 round. This duration stacks. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Fascinating Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Fascinated for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Will DC 20 negates. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Snow Dependency (Ex)
    description: >-
      A yuki-onna is staggered if she is ever in an area without snow while her
      snowstorm aura is suppressed or otherwise not functioning.
  - name: Snowstorm (Su)
    description: >-
      A yuki-onna is surrounded by whirling blasts of snow, even in areas that
      wouldn't allow for such weather, that comprise a 200-foot-radius spread.
      Within this area, the snowfall and wind gusts cause a -4 penalty on
      Perception checks and ranged attacks. The wind itself blows in a clockwise
      rotation around the yuki-onna, and functions as severe wind (Core Rulebook
      439). A yuki-onna is unaffected by snowstorms or blizzards of any kind.
      Any effect that causes these winds to drop below severe (such as control
      weather or control winds) cancels the snowstorm effect entirely.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Lonely Maiden casts ice storm on massed foes and targets individual male
  opponents with eyebite. In melee combat, she casts cones of cold followed by
  her freezing touch attacks.
Morale: >-
  The Lonely Maiden fights until destroyed, quickly melting until only a small
  pool of water remains.
