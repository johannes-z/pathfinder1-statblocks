Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Alexeara uses divine bond to add the heavy fortification special ability to
  her armor. She casts death ward on herself and good hope on herself and her
  allies before combat. If she knows the PCs favor attacks that deal energy
  damage (such as fire or electricity), Alexeara also casts resist energy of the
  appropriate type (this resistance is not included in the stat block).
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Alexeara activates her shared defense ability to
  bolster her allies, then chooses an enemy to smite as a swift action. On
  following rounds, she activates the haste ability of her armor as a free
  action and attacks the target of her smite, augmenting her strikes with spells
  that can be cast as swift actions, like resounding blow and fire of
  entanglement.
Morale: >-
  Alexeara fights to the death, but she casts hero's defiance (followed by
  laying on hands) to stay in the fight longer. If reduced to 0 hit points again
  and further healing is unlikely, the lord marshal casts blaze of glory as she
  goes to her final reward in Iomedae's embrace.
