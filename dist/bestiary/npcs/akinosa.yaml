SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Opium Addict (Ex)
    description: >-
      Akinosa is addicted to opium (see the sidebar on page 29). While under the
      effects of the drug, he gains +1d8 temporary hit points and a +2
      alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves for 1 hour, but he is also fatigued.
      In addition, he has taken 2 points of Constitution damage and 2 points of
      Wisdom damage from the drug (already reflected in the stat block).
Gender: Male
Bloodline: Aberrant
BeforeCombat: >-
  Akinosa casts false life and mage armor every day. If alerted to the presence
  of intruders, Akinosa sends out his guards from the Open Web (area A8b) and
  casts scrying to determine the point of attack. He then positions his elite
  defenders, the Gossamer (area A10b), between the attack and himself. Before
  combat, Akinosa casts blur, fly, mirror image, and shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Akinosa casts haste on the first round of combat. If encountered in his lair,
  Akinosa plays his drums of panic (see area A9b) to scare away foes, then
  drinks from his flask of endless sake in the hope of getting a beneficial
  potion. Akinosa uses fly or dimension door to move around in combat and avoid
  melee, instead using his wand of lightning bolt and casting his toughest
  spells, including chain lightning and baleful polymorph. Akinosa enjoys
  polymorphing his enemies into rats, an animal considered unlucky by many in
  Tian Xia. If engaged in melee combat, Akinosa casts interposing hand for cover
  and attacks with his dagger of venom.
Morale: >-
  Akinosa is likely to believe that any attackers are agents of Munasukaru and
  fears capture accordingly. If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, Akinosa casts
  dimension door to flee to safety, gathering whatever followers he has left to
  launch a counterattack.
Gear: wand of lightning bolt (23 charges), Medium spider venom (4 doses)
OtherGear: >-
  dagger of venom, masterwork blowgun with 10 darts, cloak of resistance +2,
  flask of endless sake (see page 60), silver sake drinking bowl (worth 110 gp),

  locks in the aboveground levels of the House of the Withered Blossoms
