SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Superior Grappler (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gaav can wield a weapon and still make grapple checks. If it's not
      wielding a weapon, a gaav gains a +4 bonus on grapple checks. Each gaav
      can lift up to 50 pounds and still fly without being impeded.
  - name: Noxious Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a gaav can exhale a breath that reeks of pure
      corruption upon a creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 14
      Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitutionbased. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by
      the same gaav's noxious breath for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize
      poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with
      immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison
      receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. Once a gaav uses its
      breath weapon, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The gaav has already used its summon devil ability for the day, summoning an
  imp to explore the surrounding territory.
DuringCombat: >-
  The gaav attacks the nearest target relentlessly, only changing targets if the
  first is unconscious or otherwise incapacitated.
Morale: >-
  The gaav fights until brought below 5 hit points and then attempts to fly
  away. If successful, the gaav flees and does not return to bother the PCs
  again.
