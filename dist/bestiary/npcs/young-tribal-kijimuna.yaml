  - name: Steal Fire (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a kijimuna can call out to a nonmagical fire within
      30 feet equivalent in size to the flames of a burning torch. Doing so
      causes the flame to become a light similar to that created by a dancing
      lights spell, under the control of the kijimuna. An attended object can
      make a DC 13 Reflex saving throw to avoid this effect. Unlike a dancing
      lights spell, a kijimuna's steal fire ability can cause a stolen fire to
      strike a creature, either ringing the target in light as per the spell
      faerie fire for 5 minutes, or dealing 2d6 points of fire damage (DC 13
      Reflex half ). Both save DCs are Charisma-based. A lantern, candle, torch,
      or similar item that has its flame stolen cannot be relit by any means for
      24 hours.
DuringCombat: >-
  The young kijimunas thirst for blood, and attack whichever PCs look the
  weakest.
Morale: >-
  The young kijimunas know that their tribe's leaders will look down upon them
  if they flee, and so they fight to the death.
