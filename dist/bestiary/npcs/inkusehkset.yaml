DuringCombat: >-
  Inkusehkset begins combat by emerging from the walls amid the PCs to unleash
  his terrifying laughter, hoping to panic the PCs and split them up. He pursues
  any PC who runs off on her own (determining a target randomly if more than one
  qualify), using Spring Attack to bite and then move back into the safety of
  the walls.
Morale: >-
  Inkusehkset fights until destroyed if confronted during the day, but if
  confronted at night and reduced to 30 or fewer hit points, the geist flees,
  forever abandoning his haunts to seek out another lair elsewhere.
