SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Crucify Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      Five times per day, a crucifixion spirit can attempt a ranged touch attack
      to crucify the soul of a single living target within 60 feet. If the
      attack is successful, the target's soul is ripped from its body, which
      collapses in a heap on the ground. Although the victim is not dead, the
      target's soul appears as a ghostly copy of the victim superimposed over
      the body of the dead soldier crucified on the door, held in place by
      translucent spikes or nails. The victim cries out silently in pain, and is
      visible to all those viewing it. A crucified soul cannot be attacked or
      affected by anything, cannot take any actions (other than trying to
      escape; see below), and experiences excruciating pain that deals 2
      negative levels to it in the round it is crucified, and 1 negative level
      each round thereafter. A successful DC 25 Fortitude save is required to
      remove a negative level. A crucifixion spirit does not need to concentrate
      on this ability for it to continue to affect a target, and the crucifixion
      spirit can direct attacks against different opponents. A creature whose
      soul is crucified can try to escape each round by attempting a DC 25 Will
      save. If the save is successful, the creature's soul is freed from its
      torment and returns to its body in the same round. The creature is stunned
      for 1 round, but can act normally afterward. A creature slain with this
      ability cannot be returned to life except through the casting of a wish,
      miracle, or true resurrection spell. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Immunity to Channel Energy (Su)
    description: >-
      A crucifixion spirit takes no damage from the channel energy ability, and
      is not affected by effects that mimic channel energy or are based on the
      channel energy ability (such as Turn Undead and Command Undead).
DuringCombat: >-
  The crucifixion spirit attempts to crucify the souls of as many opponents as
  it can, using its incorporeal touch to paralyze those foes who initially
  resist. In melee, it uses Combat Expertise to gain an additional +4 dodge
  bonus to its AC.
Morale: The crucifixion spirit fights until destroyed.
