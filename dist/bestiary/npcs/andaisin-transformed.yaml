  - name: Great Claw (Ex)
    description: >-
      Lady Andaisin's larger scythe-shaped claw deals x4 damage on a critical
      hit, and is treated as an evil weapon for the purpose of penetrating
      damage reduction. Spells The transformed Lady Andaisin casts spells as a
      6th-level cleric of Urgathoa. She selects two domains to determine bonus
      spells, she doesn't gain domain powers.
DuringCombat: >-
  As part of her transformation, Lady Andaisin regains many spells as detailed
  above, but loses all those she otherwise had while alive. In addition, all
  ongoing spell effects on her end, and all of her gear lies discarded on the
  ground amid her other remains after she transforms. She casts shield of faith
  on the first round of combat, followed by her other ranged spells unless the
  PCs immediately surround her, in which case she fights in melee.
Morale: The newly transformed Lady Andaisin fights until she is destroyed.
