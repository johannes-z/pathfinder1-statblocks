  - name: eating (Ex)
    description: >-
      After killing a target, the zombie uses its next turn to eat it's victim's
      brain. This prevents raising the body from the dead by any method that
      requires an intact corpse.
  - name: Death Burst (Ex)
    description: >-
      When the zombie dies, it explodes in a burst of decay. All creatures
      adjacent to the zombie are exposed to its disease as if struck by a slam
      attack and must make a Fortitude save or contract zombie rot.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      The zombie's natural attacks carry the zombie rot disease. Zombie rot:
      slam- injury; save Fort DC 12; onset 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2
      Con, this damage cannot be healed while the creature is infected; cure 2
      consecutive saves. Anyone who dies while infected rises as a Gillamoor
      zombie in 2d6 hours.
  - name: Quick Strikes (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever the zombie takes a full-round attack action, it can make one
      additional slam attack at its highest base attack bonus.

  chosen quarry until either the prey or the zombie is dead.
