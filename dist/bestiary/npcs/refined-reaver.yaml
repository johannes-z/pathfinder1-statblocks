BeforeCombat: The barbarian drinks his potion of shield of faith if he has time.
DuringCombat: >-
  The barbarian plunges into battle using Spring Attack. Once in position, he
  uses Whirlwind Attack with Lunge and Power Attack, alternating regular ranseur
  attacks with trip, disarm, or sunder maneuvers (the latter against targets far
  enough away that they cannot make attacks of opportunity). He exits and
  re-enters rage whenever necessary to reactivate once-per-rage powers like
  mighty swing and unexpected strike.
