Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Aredil tries to talk his way out of any fight, but failing that, he sets his
  paid guards on any potential assailants.
DuringCombat: >-
  Aredil prefers to avoid combat at all costs, instead allowing his paid
  mercenaries to back him up in a physical confrontation. Should that prove an
  impossible prospect, he imbibes his potion of haste before firing a bullet
  from his sword cane pistol. He doesn't bother reloading unless he has ample
  opportunity, instead resorting to melee with his sword cane.
Morale: >-
  If he realizes his allies are turning on him or he is reduced to fewer than 15
  hit points, Aredil imbibes his potion of invisibility and makes for the docks,
  where he has arranged for a ferry to transport him down the Ustradi and toward
  Quantium for safety. If this is not an option or he is caught, he surrenders,
  groveling for his life.
