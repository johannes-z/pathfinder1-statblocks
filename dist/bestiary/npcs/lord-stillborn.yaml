DuringCombat: >-
  Lord Stillborn starts combat by using his wand of greater invisibility so he
  can maximize his sneak attacks against foes. He relies on his wand of
  enervation for ranged attacks, and if reduced to fewer than 100 hit points, he
  flees into the Soul Foundry to find a hiding spot and uses his wand of inflict
  serious wounds to heal up before returning to the fight.
Morale: >-
  Lord Stillborn flees if reduced to fewer than 40 hit points, fighting to the
  death only if cornered. If he escapes, he seeks healing and then devotes
  himself to tracking down and slaying the PCs, preferring to attempt
  assassinations when one PC is alone.
