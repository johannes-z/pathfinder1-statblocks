BeforeCombat: >-
  Yero interacts with the PCs in a friendly&#8211;if brash&#8211;manner until it
  dawns on him what they are after, at which point he calmly begins to use his
  bardic performance ability to fascinate the PCs. During his dramatic
  performance, he quaffs the potion of bull's strength that he's holding, acting
  as though it's a part of whatever scene he's acting out. He then turns his
  sword on the PCs, breaking the fascination effect and entering melee with
  them.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first turn of combat, Yero either casts invisibility or throws a
  smokestick down to hide his movements. Afterward, he attacks the PC closest to
  him with his longsword. While he could drop his gnome disguise to increase his
  size to Medium, Yero prefers fighting with his sword, which would be
  undersized for him were he to change shape.
Morale: Yero fights until he is rendered unconscious or killed.
