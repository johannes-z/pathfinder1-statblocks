  If Ishgahkah notices the sounds of combat, it casts invisibility and mage

  Ishgahkah immediately uses a scroll of summon monster VII to summon 1d4+1
  babaus while still invisible, then casts slow before closing to melee. As a
  gug, it revels in bloodshed, and it uses Arcane Strike and Power Attack to
  rend enemies with its claws, unleashing more spells only on opponents who keep
  their distance.

  fiendish kin in area J9, where the savant makes its final stand.
