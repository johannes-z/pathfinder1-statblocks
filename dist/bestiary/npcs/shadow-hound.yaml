SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bay (Su)
    description: >-
      When a shadow mastiff howls or barks, all creatures except evil outsiders
      within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or become
      panicked for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. A
      creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same mastiff's
      bay for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +1 racial
      bonus.
  - name: Shadow Blend (Su)
    description: >-
      In any condition of illumination other than full daylight, a shadow
      mastiff disappears into the shadows, giving it concealment. Artificial
      illumination, even a light or continual flame spell, does not negate this
      ability. A daylight spell, however, does. A shadow mastiff can suspend or
      resume this ability as a free action.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The shadow hound lurks behind one of the room's larger crates, waiting to be
  fed. When the PCs enter, it doesn't recognize their scent and initiates combat
  with its bay ability.
DuringCombat: >-
  Frenzied, the hound deactivates its shadow blend ability as it attacks the
  PCs. The hound pursues the intruders to the length of its chain. If reduced
  below 10 hp, it activates its shadow blend and continues fighting while
  remaining in whatever shadows it can find among the room's clutter.
Morale: >-
  The shadow hound fights to the death, and howls loudly and relentlessly if the
  PCs move beyond its reach.
