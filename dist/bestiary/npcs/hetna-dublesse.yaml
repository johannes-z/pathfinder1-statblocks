SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Exceptional Resources (Ex)
    description: >-
      Hetna inherited a great many magical resources from her mentor Oothi,
      giving her the wealth of a PC rather than an NPC. This equipment increases
      her CR by 1.
  - name: Permanent Spells (Ex)
    description: >-
      Hetna benefits from the following permanent spells cast on herself:
      darkvision, see invisibility, and telepathic bond (with Oothi).
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Hetna casts extended false life and extended mage armor every day, and casts
  poison into her witching gown (activating its spite effect; see page 51). She
  also drinks a potion of bear's endurance before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Hetna casts cloak of dreams on the first round of combat. While her guards
  deal with intruders, Hetna prepares a waxen image of the PCs' most
  dangerouslooking warrior, making that character run through the window by the
  fireplace and fall to the ground 20 feet below. Thereafter, she attacks
  enemies with mass pain strike, confusion, mind fog, mass suggestion, or
  lightning bolt. Once anyone closes with her in melee, Hetna casts blink and
  unwilling shield, then targets her opponent with ill omen followed by baleful
  polymorph or charm monster.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 65 hit points or fewer, Hetna smashes her elemental gem to
  summon a Large air elemental with which to occupy the PCs while she flies to
  the ceiling or out a window to heal herself. She returns to the battle until
  she reaches 30 hit points or fewer, at which point she casts dimension door to
  join her sister Aisa in area F30.
Gear: >-
  elemental gem (air), potions of bear's endurance (2), potions of cure moderate
  wounds (2)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 dagger, amulet of natural armor +3, belt of incredible dexterity +4, broom
  of flying, headband of vast intelligence +4 (Knowledge [history] and
  [planes]), ring of protection +3, witching gown (contains poison; see page
