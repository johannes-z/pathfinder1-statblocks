SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dream Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A primordial demon has no physical form and only exists within the
      subconscious realm of dreams. Because it exists only as thought and
      concept, it can neither leave this realm nor exist in any other plane,
      realm, or reality. Likewise, the only way for a mortal to confront the
      creature is to travel to its realm. Methods include meditation, suffering
      head injury that renders one unconscious, dreaming, and spells that permit
      planar travel (such as planeshift). Any creature slain by a primordial
      demon does not die in the Material Plane. Instead, the individual falls
      unconscious and is forced from the dream realm (see above).
  - name: Psychic Implosion (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a primordial demon can constrict his tendrils to
      psychically rend the mind of a grappled victim. The attack deals 12d6
      points of damage, though the victim may attempt a DC 23 Will save for half
      damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
