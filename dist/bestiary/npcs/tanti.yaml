BeforeCombat: >-
  Tanti's stats include the effects of Nedowyn's heroes' feast. She drinks a
  potion of shield of faith and a potion of bear's endurance before entering a
  fight.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tanti's fighting style is somewhat complex but rather effective. Working with
  allies (usually Nedowyn), she rarely, if ever, stands still long enough to
  make a full attack. Instead, she circles her enemies to line up flanking
  opportunities, but simultaneously seeks to provoke attacks of opportunity from
  foes so she can use opportune parry and riposte to try to get additional
  attacks on them instead as they attack her. If such movement puts her in a
  disadvantageous position when she flanks a foe, she uses Spring Attack to move
  out of danger after delivering the strike. By using up a foe's attacks of
  opportunity and parrying them, she prevents the opponent from using those
  attacks against spellcasting allies. She avoids spending her last point of
  panache if possible to maintain the benefits of her precise strike.
Morale: >-
  Tanti fights to the death unless she's the last one standing, in which case
  she flees Barleybridge.
