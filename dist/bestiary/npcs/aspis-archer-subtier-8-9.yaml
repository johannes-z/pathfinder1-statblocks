BeforeCombat: >-
  The archers have become rather complacent, as the Muckmouth tribe has not
  attempted any kind of rebellion against the Aspis Consortium. They do not
  notice the PCs' approach.
DuringCombat: >-
  The archers grant each other bonuses from hunter's bond and alternate their
  uses of bardic performance to inspire courage within each other. If given the
  opportunity, both cast aspect of the falcon and gravity bow. They call out to
  Durra throughout the battle, providing details about the interlopers in
  Draconic, hoping the PCs cannot understand that language.
Morale: If one twin is killed, the survivor fights to the death.
