SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Radiance (Sp)
    description: >-
      An iophanite usually glows with a golden light equivalent to that of a
      candle. In battle, the angel's glow increases, filling the area within 5
      feet. An iophanite can suppress or resume this glow as a free action.
      Additionally, as a standard action, an iophanite can intensify this glow
      to reproduce the effects of a flare spell at will. A creature can resist
      this effect with a successful DC 13 Fortitude save, though evil creatures
      take a -4 penalty on their saves. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Shield Form (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, an iophanite can transform into a +1 spiked light steel
      shield sized for a Small or Medium creature. An iophanite cannot
      communicate or use any of their other abilities while in this form. Once
      transformed, an iophanite cannot change back for 24 hours, though a break
      enchantment spell can end the transformation early. An iophanite regains
      full hit points upon shifting back into their normal form. If the shield
      is destroyed, the iophanite is killed.
