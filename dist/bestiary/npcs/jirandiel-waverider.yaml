BeforeCombat: >-
  Jirandiel is suspicious of the PCs. If she sees Caradoc with them, she
  immediately orders her sailors to recover him from the PCs and attacks.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jirandiel attempts to flank opponents with the sailors, so she can use her
  sneak attack ability. In addition, she always chooses to forgo her second
  attack on a full attack action so she can use her parry ability (Pathfinder
  RPG Core Rulebook 383) to block incoming melee strikes.
Morale: Jirandiel surrenders if brought below 5 hit points.
