  None of the tengus are hardened murderers; they won't kill in cold blood,
  though they also aren't shy about killing a foe in a fight. They hide in the
  darkness, move constantly between the stacks of crates, and lash out with
  sneak attacks when they see an opening or can flank an enemy.
Morale: >-
  Korva stops and negotiates if at least two of her sisters are killed or
  knocked unconscious, telling the PCs anything they want if she and her sisters
  can leave without harm. If Korva dies, any surviving tengus immediately
  surrender.
