BeforeCombat: >-
  Cale the Calistrian favors self-preservation over all things, including his
  mission to steal the Pale Maiden. Before the PCs arrive, he casts displacement
  and fire shield on himself and arcane lock on the door to area L3. If the PCs
  take a while breaking down the magically held door, Cale continues to layer
  defensive spells upon himself, starting with protection from energy (most
  likely fire, but Cale chooses wisely if he has reason to know the PCs favor a
  certain energy type).
DuringCombat: >-
  Cale unleashes a web on the PCs when they enter area L9. Thereafter, he
  focuses on damage-dealing spells like additional ice storms, fireball, and
  lightning bolt.
Morale: >-
  If all of his associates are killed or near death, Cale the Calistrian employs
  teleport to send himself to the entrance of the Maze of the Open Road on the
  lodge's rear lawn.
