SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sting-injury; save Fort DC 30; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6
      Con and 1d4 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Spit (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, the Favored of Deskari can spit a high-pressure jet
      of water in a 40-foot line that deals 10d6 points of nonlethal damage to
      all creatures in the area of effect. In addition, these creatures are
      stunned for 1 round. A successful DC 30 Fortitude save halves the damage
      and negates the stun effect. Unlike a normal spitting eurypterid (which
      must recharge its water stores as a full-round action while submerged),
      the Favored of Deskari can use this ability at will. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Favored of Deskari uses greater teleport to relocate up into an upper
  ledge from the pit below to attack foes in melee. It uses its spit attack
  against foes who stay out of range.
Morale: The Favored of Deskari fights to the death.
