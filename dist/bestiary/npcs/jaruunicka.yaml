    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, Jaruunicka can utter heretical words
      against a religion other than one that reveres a demon lord. A worshiper
      of the chosen religion must be able to hear this utterance, or this
      ability fails. Jaruunicka gains SR 27 against spells cast by worshipers of
      this religion until she uses this ability again-she currently possesses
      this SR against spells cast by worshipers of Desna.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Jaruunicka casts air walk, freedom of movement, magic vestment, spell immunity
  (charm monster and suggestion), and shield of faith before combat. She casts
  status on her two drake riders and the derakni at area P1 every day, so if
  something happens to any of these creatures, she knows.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jaruunicka hangs back in combat initially, using a few of her spells at range
  or channeling negative energy to attack foes, then moving in to heal demonic
  allies as necessary. Once she enters melee combat, she starts by casting slay
  living on a PC healer, then moves on to make full attacks as often as
  possible. She prefers worshipers of Desna as targets if possible.
Morale: Jaruunicka fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  potions of cure moderate wounds (2), scroll of greater dispel magic, scroll of
  blade barrier, scrolls of heal (2)
OtherGear: amulet of mighty fists +2, 4,000 gp
