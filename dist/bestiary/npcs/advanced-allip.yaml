SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Babble (Su)
    description: >-
      An allip constantly mutters and whines to itself, creating a hypnotic
      effect. All sane creatures within 60 ft. of the allip must succeed on a DC
      22 Will save or be fascinated for 2d4 rounds. While a target is
      fascinated, the allip can approach without breaking the effect, but an
      attack by the allip breaks the effect. This is a sonic, mind-affecting
      compulsion effect. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by
      the same allip's babble for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Madness (Su)
    description: >-
      Anyone targeting an allip with thought detection, mind control, or
      telepathic ability makes direct contact with its tortured mind and takes
      1d4 points of Wisdom damage.
  - name: Touch of Insanity (Su)
    description: >-
      The touch of an allip deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. A successful
      critical hit causes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage and 1 point of Wisdom
      drain (instead of double Wisdom damage). On each successful attack, an
      allip gains 5 temporary hit points.
