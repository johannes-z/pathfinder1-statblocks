    description: >-
      Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a
      hindrance. Your curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a
      deity. Clouded Vision: Your eyes are obscured, making it difficult for you
      to see. You cannot see anything beyond 30 feet, but you can see as if you
      had darkvision. Revelation At 1st level, you uncover a new secret about
      the mystery that grants your powers and abilities. Unless otherwise noted,
      activating the power of a revelation is a standard action. Your revelation
      is Touch of Flame (see below).
