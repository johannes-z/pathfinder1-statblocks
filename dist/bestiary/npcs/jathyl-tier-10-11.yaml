    description: >-
      Jathyl was once the ruler and protector of her forest, and she maintains a
      commanding air. Once per round, as a standard action, she may control one
      living creature as per the spell dominate monster, with a range of 30
      feet. She may only dominate one creature at a time, and any creature that
      successfully saves is immune to her influence for 24 hours. Variant Dryad
      Because of her dedication to the protection of her forest, Jathyl's
      spell-like abilities are different from those of a standard dryad, and she
      considers druid spells as being on her spell list for purposes of using
      spell completion and command word magic items. Additionally, she may sense
      any part of here tree at any range, as long as it is on the same plane, or
      unless a protection from evil spell wards it.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: Verdant*
BeforeCombat: >-
  If Jathyl has taken damage before this point, she can use draining touch or
  enervation to restore hit points. Jathyl prepares for battle by casting cat's
  grace, and see invisibility. Lastly, she activates her fleeting glance fey
  bloodline ability.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jathyl is driven by passions, not tactical calculations. Using feathers (e.g.,
  arrows, summoned angels, or birds), disfiguring any part of her tree, or
  channeling positive energy enrages Jathyl. She focuses her wrath on such
  transgressors, taking unnecessary risks to punish them. Jathyl opens with
  sleet storm if necessary to drive the PCs away from her tree. Otherwise, she
  casts ice storm, followed by lightning bolt. She then switches to melee,
  alternating between corrupting touch and draining touch, always draining
  Wisdom. She saves her telekinesis (violent thrust) to hurl away any annoying
  weapons. She starts the battle supremely confident of her mastery of the
  situation, not hesitating to stand toe-to-toe with the party's warriors.
  However, if any PC successfully casts ghostbane dirge, uses a ghost touch
  weapon, or reduces her to half her normal hit points before she drops any PC,
  she attempts to dominate that PC with influence, turning him against his
  allies.
Morale: >-
  Jathyl fights until destroyed. As she dies, she whispers, "Your corpses will
  burn when I return from death." Her body dissolves into a pinpoint of ghostly
  light that drifts toward the temple and into the roots of her tree.
Gear: wand of control water (42 charges)
