    description: >-
      The tubes installed into Snarltongue's head grant him several exceptional
      powers. The purple tube contains a fluid that allows Snarltongue to become
      invisible as per the spell for up to 10 rounds per day. These rounds do
      not have to be consecutive. Using this ability is a move action. The green
      tube contains a liquid that gives Snarltongue fast healing 2. This ability
      is always active. When he uses rounds of rage, the fluid in the red tube
      begins to drain (this fluid does not grant him any additional rage powers
      or rounds of rage).
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  If the PCs venture through the gallery up above, Snarltongue merely observes
  them from the shadows under the table, which grant him a +4 circumstance bonus
  on his Stealth check. If the PCs find their way down, he uses his ability to
  turn invisible and closes in to attack, using his dire rats to distract the
  rest of the party.
DuringCombat: >-
  Snarltongue closes with his enemies before becoming visible and flying into a
  rage. He attacks with reckless abandon and, given the chance, tosses
  alchemist's fire at spellcasters to distract them from casting spells.
Morale: The goblin fears only his master's wrath. As such, he fights to the death.
