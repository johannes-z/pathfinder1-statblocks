SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Agonized Wail (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a defaced nymph can emit an agonized wail that
      affects all creatures within 120 feet-this wail causes those who
      experience it to become shaken (Will DC 20 negates) as long as they remain
      within 120 feet of the defaced nymph. A successful save renders a creature
      immune to that defaced nymph's agonized wail for 1 minute. This is a
      mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Baleful Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature within 60 feet of a defaced nymph must succeed on a DC 20
      Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Strength, Constitution, and Charisma
      drain. Whatever the result of the saving throw, the creature cannot be
      affected by the same defaced nymph's baleful gaze again for 1 minute. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Torturous Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      A defaced nymph can make a touch attack to cause hideous, painful wounds
      to rip open in the target's body. This touch causes 2d6 points of slashing
      damage and 1d6 points of Dexterity damage, and causes the touched creature
      to fall prone in a fit of convulsions (during which the creature is
      helpless) for 1d4 rounds. A DC 20 Fortitude save negates the Dexterity
      damage and the convulsive fit. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If a defaced nymph has the opportunity before battle, she casts air walk and
  barkskin.
DuringCombat: >-
  A defaced nymph uses her baleful gaze on the first round of combat, then
  activates her blinding beauty, saving her stunning glance to use against
  non-humanoid foes or creatures that manage to engage her in melee. She prefers
  to hang back and cast spells on foes, using her agonized wail if she's
  surrounded.
Morale: >-
  A defaced nymph fights to the death, as if eager for release from her painful
  existence.
