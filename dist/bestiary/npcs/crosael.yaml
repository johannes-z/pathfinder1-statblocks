    description: >-
      As a rakshasa-spawn tiefling, Crosael's ability score modifiers are +2
      Dex, +2 Cha, and -2 Wis, unlike standard tieflings.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Every evening before bedtime, Crosael places a silent mental alarm on each of
  the four doors leading into her room. She also casts unseen servant every
  morning. If she's warned that someone's about to enter her room, she casts
  invisibility.
DuringCombat: >-
  If Crosael starts combat invisible, she remains silent and watches her foes,
  trying to determine what they want. She orders her unseen servant to open
  doors and then uses one open door that is unguarded to slip out of the room to
  gather up the thieves from area E5 or perhaps to let in the shadows from area
  E10. She won't initiate combat, if she can help it, until she has allies. If
  she has the chance in a surprise round, she starts casting summon monster III
  to conjure 1d3 lemures-when the summoned creatures appear on the first round
  of combat, she orders them to attack and uses inspire courage. She then
  attempts to stay at range to use spells to vex foes, avoiding melee as much as
  she can.
Morale: >-
  Crosael is headstrong and stubborn-she fights to the death as a result, but if
  reduced to 10 or fewer hit points and offered a chance to surrender, she takes
  the mercy and could become a valuable informant to the PCs if they can assure
  her that they'll let her go once she tells them what she knows of the Council
  of Thieves... which is a lot (see Gathering Intelligence on page 23).
Gear: wand of sound burst (23 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 chain shirt, +1 buckler, masterwork rapier, masterwork shortbow with 20
  arrows, ring of protection +1, gray bag of tricks
