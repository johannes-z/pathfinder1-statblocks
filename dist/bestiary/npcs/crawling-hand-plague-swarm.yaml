SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hivemind (Su)
    description: >-
      The plague swarm maintains constant telepathic communication with the
      one-handed wights (see area G2) from whom they were severed as long as
      they are on the same plane. These wights have an attitude of helpful
      toward the swarm.
  - name: Mark Quarry (Su)
    description: >-
      Upon dealing damage to a creature, the crawling hand plague swarm can mark
      that creature as its quarry as a free action. The swarm is always aware of
      its quarry's location as if under the effect of a continuous locate
      creature spell, and the swarm's swarm attack deals an additional 1d6
      blight damage to the quarry. The mark quarry ability lasts until the
      quarry is slain, the swarm marks a new quarry, or the swarm is dispersed.
  - name: Reform (Su)
    description: >-
      The crawling hand plague swarm can only be permanently destroyed by first
      destroying the one-handed wight troop in area G2 and then dispersing the
      plague swarm within 60 feet of the troop's remains. This causes the
      crawling hands to reunite with their estranged bodies, after which the
      intact bodies slowly disintegrate.
  - name: Throttle (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature damaged by the plague swarm can't breathe, speak, or cast
      spells with verbal components for 1 round.
DuringCombat: >-
  The plague swarm surges over any intruders, marking the first creature it
  damages as its quarry.
Morale: >-
  The plague swarm doesn't leave this area, but it otherwise fights until
  destroyed.
