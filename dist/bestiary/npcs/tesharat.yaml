BeforeCombat: >-
  Tesharat casts mage armor every day, and displacement and greater invisibility
  if she expects imminent combat. If she has more time to prepare, she also
  casts mirror image and holds the charge on vampiric touch to combine with her
  first melee attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tesharat opens combat with her breath weapon. She relies on displacement and
  greater invisibility  to reduce the effectiveness of attacks against her as
  she fights in melee.
Morale: >-
  If brought below 50 hit points, Tesharat attempts to flee using teleport or
  dimension door. After taking the time to heal, she likely returns to hunt down
  the PCs in order to finish them off.
