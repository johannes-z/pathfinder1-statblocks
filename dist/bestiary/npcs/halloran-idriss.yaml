DuringCombat: >-
  Halloran eschews his slam attacks in favor of the sword he once wielded in
  service to Iomedae, making good use of his combat feats when possible.
Morale: >-
  Halloran fights until destroyed, unless the PCs manage to dispel or suppress
  the control Radvir, Aisa, and Hetna have over him. If no longer under their
  command, Halloran ceases to attack and attempts to parley with the PCs, asking
  for their assistance in atoning for his fall from grace (see Development,
  below).
