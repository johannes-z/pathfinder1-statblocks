    description: >-
      The chirurgeon table's syringe attacks inject a target with blue whinnis
      poison on a successful hit. The table can inject 2 doses of the poison
      before needing to be refilled.
DuringCombat: >-
  The table targets one PC at a time as directed by Gravvik. It uses its
  syringes to sedate the target and its strap to restrain it, slashing
  constantly with its scalpels, whether or not the target is restrained or
  unconscious.
Morale: >-
  An unintelligent machine, the table fights until Gravvik instructs it to stop.
  If Gravvik is killed before disengaging the chirurgeon table, it fights until
  destroyed.
