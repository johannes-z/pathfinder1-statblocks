BeforeCombat: >-
  If Daridela is aware of the PCs in her grotto, she prepares for combat by
  casting cat's grace and produce flame before casting magic fang on the fungal
  wolves. She activates her bramble armor ability just before the PCs move the
  barricade and enter the chamber.
DuringCombat: >-
  If Daridela didn't get a chance to cast any preparatory spells, she activates
  her bramble armor ability on the first round of combat. If the fungal wolves
  can successfully keep the PCs back, she attacks from a distance with produce
  flame. If one of the PCs closes into melee combat, she fights with her spear
  or casts flame blade.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, Daridela casts obscuring mist and
  attempts to flee the grotto.
