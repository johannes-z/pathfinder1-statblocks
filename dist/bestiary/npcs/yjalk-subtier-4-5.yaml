DuringCombat: >-
  Yjalk directs his crew to attack any spellcasters and challenges the
  strongest-looking PC to face him. He begins raging and strikes with Power
  Attack and powerful blow to end the fight quickly. He uses his oil of magic
  weapon only if he cannot consistently hit an opponent.
Morale: >-
  Yjalk drinks a potion of cure light wounds if he has 20 or fewer hit points
  but only if he's not already engaged in melee combat with the enemy. If Yjalk
  has 20 or fewer hit points and has only one ally remaining, he orders a
  fighting retreat.
