SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Anchored to Consciousness (Su)
    description: >-
      The Tatterman is directly tied to Ulver Zandalus and his consciousness.
      For the most part, the Tatterman is locked away in the Dimension of
      Dreams, and can influence only Zandalus's thoughts. The Tatterman can't
      manifest on the Material Plane while Zandalus is conscious, but when the
      cult leader sleeps, the Tatterman can haunt the halls of Briarstone
      Asylum. If Zandalus is killed, the Tatterman can freely walk the waking
      world.
  - name: Nightmare Transformation (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoid slain by the Tatterman's nightmare spell-like ability returns
      to life 1 hour later as a vile creature. If the creature's Charisma score
      is equal to or higher than its Constitution score, it transforms into a
      doppelganger. If its Charisma score is lower than its Constitution score,
      it transforms into a ghoul. A humanoid who becomes a doppelganger or ghoul
      in this way retains none of the abilities it had in life. The creature is
      not under the control of the Tatterman, but its alignment changes to evil
      and it behaves like a normal doppelganger or ghoul in all respects.
