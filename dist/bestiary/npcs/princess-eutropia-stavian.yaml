SpecialAbilities: []
DuringCombat: >-
  While she generally avoids combat these days and usually travels with guards,
  Eutropia still participates in the occasional duel. She prefers to use Combat
  Expertise, letting opponents tire themselves out on her defenses before
  disarming them. She is still not above fighting dirty when angry or defending
  herself, and she may occasionally sucker punch opponents, spit in their eyes,
  or deliver a swift head butt.
Morale: >-
  Eutropia generally duels to disarm, but she hates losing and won't surrender
  until reduced below 20 hit points.
Gear: >-
  +3 mithral chain shirt, +2 rapier, belt of mighty constitution +4, riding
  jacket of resistance +3 (as cloak of resistance +3), ring of protection +3,
  Stavian signet ring, teapot, 580 gp
