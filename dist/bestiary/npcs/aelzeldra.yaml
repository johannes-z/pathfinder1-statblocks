SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mimicry (Ex)
    description: Aelzeldra can imitate the sounds of almost any animal found near her lair.
  - name: Weakness (Su)
    description: >-
      Aelzeldra's claws sap strength from those she strikes. Each time Aelzeldra
      hits a foe with her claw attack, the victim takes 2 points of Strength
      damage unless he resists the weakness with a DC 17 Fortitude save.
      Alternatively, Aelzeldra can attempt to inflict even greater weakness by
      making a touch attack-this variant requires a standard action, and cannot
      be attempted in the same round she makes claw attacks. The opponent
      touched must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 2d4 points of
      Strength damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Aelzeldra opens combat by casting obscuring mist to limit the visibility of
  attackers. On the following round, she goes invisible and singles out the
  weakest target to attack with her wicked claws. Her general approach to combat
  is to confuse and frustrate, using invisibility and claw attacks on
  alternating rounds. Against opponents proving difficult to hit, Aelzeldra
  takes a round to cast true strike before attacking.
Morale: >-
  When reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, Aelzeldra attempts to flee into the
  forest.
