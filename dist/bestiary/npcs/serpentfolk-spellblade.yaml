  A spellblade casts defensive shock if it expects battle, often following with
  displacement and invisibility to pursue a chosen target more freely.
DuringCombat: >-
  A spellblade combines arcane power and mental mastery with the deadly, sinuous
  grace of the blade. It uses its hasted assault ability whenever possible, and

  chill touch, ray of enfeeblement, and vampiric touch.
