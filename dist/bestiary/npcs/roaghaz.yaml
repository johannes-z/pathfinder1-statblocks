BeforeCombat: Roaghaz casts mage armor.
DuringCombat: >-
  Roaghaz employs the boulders for cover while his kobold bodyguards engage the
  PCs. He tries to use his wand of web early to prevent too many PCs from
  getting into the room, then casts his ranged spells until forced into melee.
  When that seems inevitable, he casts mirror image and remains mobile as he
  tries to stay out of reach of weapons while casting spells. He uses his cloak
  of fangs to bite in the first 5 rounds of melee. If Nighttail is with the PCs,
  Roaghaz is furious to see the traitorous kobold, and has his guards focus
  their attacks exclusively on her until she is slain.
Morale: >-
  Roaghaz fights to the death. If the PCs manage to capture him, he rants of how
  mighty Lord Aeteperax is, and how death and destruction await all of them.
Gear: scrolls of glitterdust (2), wand of web (5 charges)
