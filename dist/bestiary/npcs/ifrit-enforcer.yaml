DuringCombat: >-
  The ifrit soldiers use their martial flexibility when combat begins,
  preferring Deflect Arrows or Step Up unless a different feat could stymie the
  PCs' tactics. One of the ifrits tries to use his burning hands spell-like
  ability to set one of the shop's oil-soaked areas on fire and deal damage to
  any nearby PCs. The ifrits then brawl with any nearby PC, using their knockout
  ability to even the odds.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 15 or fewer hit points, the ifrit tries to flee and report his
  failure to Tygora. One round after the alchemy shop explodes, the ifrits
  conclude they have caused enough damage and all withdraw to the palace.
