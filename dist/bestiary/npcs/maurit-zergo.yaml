Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If the PCs befriend Maurit, she follows them into the dungeon, offering
  helpful advice, and waits near a particularly tasty looking PC for the party
  to become engaged in combat with another foe.
DuringCombat: >-
  While Maurit has manufactured weapons, she only uses her daggers or shortbow
  for ranged attacks when melee is impossible, much preferring to use her new
  natural weapons to take down her foes. Though hungry and ravenous, Maurit
  knows what Pathfinders are capable of, and attempts to paralyze all her foes
  before she begins eating any of them.
Morale: >-
  Maurit's condition is irreversible and she knows it. She fights to the death
  to get a meal.
Gear: potions of cure light wounds (2), potion of protection from evil
OtherGear: >-
  leather armor, dagger, shortbow with 20 arrows, masterwork thieves tools, opal
  worth 200 gp
