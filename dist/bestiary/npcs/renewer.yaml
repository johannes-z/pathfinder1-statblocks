BeforeCombat: >-
  The Renewer usually selects life as her wandering spirit. When she expects
  combat, she casts barkskin and false life on herself. She then casts life
  pact  on herself and all of her allies and applies her ward hex to an ally,
  preferably one who is acting as a sentry. Finally, she casts fly on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  If the Renewer is alone, she focuses on hampering effects that target a wide
  area, such as burning entanglement. With allies, she prefers to use her
  summoning spells and focus her efforts on keeping her most effective allies in
  the fight, using her Flexible Hex feat to switch her life sight hex to the
  life link hex. If her allies prove ineffective against her foes, she does not
  waste her efforts on saving them and instead uses her offensive abilities.
