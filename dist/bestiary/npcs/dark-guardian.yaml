SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When a dark stalker is slain, its body combusts in a flash of white-hot
      flame. This acts like a fireball that deals 3d6 points of fire damage to
      all creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst. A DC (DC 14) Reflex save
      halves this damage. The dark stalker's gear and treasure are unaffected by
      this explosion. This save is Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      Dark stalkers are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally
      poisoning themselves. Dark stalkers use black smear poison on their
      weapons and generally carry 6 doses on them. Black Smear-injury; save Fort
      DC 14; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save. The
      poison DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: See in Darkness (Su)
    description: >-
      A dark stalker can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including that
      created by deeper darkness.
BeforeCombat: >-
  When the PCs enter, the guardian casts shield of faith and applies poison to
  both of his swords. When the PCs begin to climb the stairs or ascend by other
  means, the guardian steps onto the limestone walkway and casts deeper darkness
  to shroud the tower in darkness.
DuringCombat: >-
  In battle, the dark guardian attempts to stay in darkness to utilize his sneak
  attack, channeling negative energy if he becomes surrounded by foes. If the
  majority of the PCs make it out of the darkness, he scales the walls and casts
  deeper darkness on the other landing as well.
Morale: >-
  The dark guardian never retreats except to heal under cover of darkness in
  order to sneak attack again, and fights to the death to eradicate all who dare
  violate his sacred site. If the PCs flee, it pursues them relentlessly.
Gear: wand of inflict moderate wounds (8 charges), black smear (6)
