BeforeCombat: Yahar casts heroism and mirror image and tries to summon an additional vrock.
DuringCombat: >-
  Yahar remains at the back while her shemhazian guards engage the enemy, using
  the first few rounds of combat to cast mirror image and heroism (if she hasn't
  already) before using her musket against spellcasters and opponents with
  ranged weapons. She uses her dance of ruin with any summoned vrock, knowing
  her demons will be immune to its effects. She engages in melee only as a last
  resort.
Morale: Yahar fights to the death.
