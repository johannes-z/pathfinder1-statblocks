SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Deconstruct (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cyberplasm can mix traces of its own nanites with dead organic material,
      giving the material a semblance of life. As a full-round action, a
      cyberplasm can use this ability to transform a dead Large or smaller
      creature into a quivering blob, transforming it into a hungry flesh
      (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 152). The hungry flesh remains active for 1
      hour before collapsing into a slurry of inert organic material. A
      cyberplasm can use this ability on a hungry flesh it has created in this
      way at any point during the hour to reset the duration.
  - name: Infest (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a cyberplasm can attempt to inhabit a Large or
      smaller corporeal creature. The cyberplasm must move into the target's
      space (dealing swarm damage in the process), and the target must succeed
      at a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being infested. An infested creature
      retains its physical ability scores, hit points, special attacks, and
      natural abilities, while the cyberplasm uses its own mental ability
      scores, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental
      abilities. The host is considered unconscious while infested, and can't
      take actions or control any of its own abilities as long as the cyberplasm
      inhabits it. The infested creature gains 2 slam attacks appropriate for
      its size if it doesn't already have slam attacks. While infesting a host,
      a cyberplasm can't access its host's thoughts, skills, or mental
      abilities, and it loses its swarm traits (including immunity to weapon
      damage) and use of its extraordinary abilities. Any damaging attacks or
      effects affecting the host deals half of the damage to the host and half
      of the damage to the cyberplasm. Any electricity damage dealt to the host
      deals full damage to the host and the cyberplasm (and the cyberplasm is
      still subject to its vulnerability to electricity). A cyberplasm deals 1
      point of Constitution damage every hour it is inside a host. If the
      cyberplasm reduces its host's Constitution score to 0 in this way, the
      host's body dissolves into gray dust and is destroyed (similar to a
      disintegrate effect). A cyberplasm can end its infestation as a move
      action, appearing in any space adjacent to the infested creature. If the
      host is slain, the cyberplasm is immediately ejected and is dazed for 1
      round. A remove disease spell has a 50% chance to force a cyberplasm from
      a host, but the creature receives a saving throw against this effect.
      Anytime a creature infested with a cyberplasm is subjected to electricity
      damage, it can attempt another DC 15 Fortitude save to eject the
      cyberplasm. The save DC for this ability is Charisma-based and includes a
      +2 racial bonus.
  - name: Reconstruct (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cyberplasm can temporarily reshape and repair constructs. As a
      full-round action, a cyberplasm can reactivate a destroyed or inert
      construct by leaving traces of its own nanites within the construct.
      Constructs revived in this way are restored with their full normal hit
      points, but after 1 hour the traces of nanites within the construct become
      inert and the construct is destroyed once again. A cyberplasm can use this
      ability on a construct it has revived at any point during the hour to
      reset the duration.
