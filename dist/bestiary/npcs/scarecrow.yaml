DuringCombat: >-
  The Scarecrow does not pursue foes up the stairs, but it does chase after
  anyone who tries to escape into the alleys of Underbridge.
Morale: >-
  Although a construct and loyal to the cult, the Scarecrow values its life as
  well. If brought below 20 hit points, it tries to escape into the ocean, where
  it remains for days until it feels brave enough to emerge and seek out someone
  it can bully into repairing its damage.
