DuringCombat: >-
  The cloakers hide near the roof above the pit until victims come close enough
  for them to strike from surprise. Each then makes a sneak attack and attempts
  to engulf a chosen foe. Thereafter, the cloakers use their moan attacks, each
  causing a different effect. Once a cloaker has chosen its target, it casts
  blur and focuses its attacks on that target.
Morale: A cloaker flees back into the pit if reduced to fewer than 30 hit points.
