BeforeCombat: >-
  Sepoko casts magic vestment on his shield and greater magic weapon on his
  morningstar every morning. If he hears combat in a neighboring room, he casts
  insect plague to place wasp swarms in the northern part of the room and then
  casts freedom of movement and shield of faith on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Sepoko initially lets his summoned insects and wardens face the PCs while he
  hangs back to cast spells. As soon as it becomes apparent that he'll soon be
  in melee, he casts divine favor. Whenever possible, he uses Channel Smite to
  further empower his blows with negative energy. If enemies look like they're
  about to reach him, he casts control water to cause the water level in this
  area to rise, flooding the entire cavern for 1 round before rushing out into
  the other caves. On that initial round, anyone who makes a DC 20 Swim check
  resists the sudden current&#8211;all others are knocked prone and washed into
  area N10, N11, or N13 (whichever is closest). Thereafter, the water level in
  the caves stabilizes at a depth of 1 foot (meaningless to boggards with their
  swamp stride ability). This tactic immediately disperses any insect swarms
  still in the area, but it should give Sepoko a chance to disrupt the PCs'
  tactics quite well.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 35 hit points or fewer, Sepoko's remaining faith in Gogunta
  shatters and he drops to his knees and croaks out a prayer to the Legless Lady
  to save him and smite the intruders. Of course, no divine intervention comes
  (although Sepoko immediately loses access to all of his spells and cleric
  abilities), and any surviving boggards who witness this failure realize that
  their leader has fallen. Amid a sudden chorus of "Kill the heretic!" in
  Boggard, the remaining boggards forget about the PCs' presence and swarm
  forward, eager to tear Sepoko limb from limb in hopes of showing Gogunta, who
  must surely be watching, that they still fear her.
