  - name: Discharge (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a full-round action, a mutant galvo can discharge a burst
      of electricity in a 20-foot radius centered on itself that deals 15d6
      points of electricity damage. A creature that succeeds at a DC 25 Reflex
      save reduces this damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based.
