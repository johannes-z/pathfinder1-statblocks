SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Draining Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures within 20 feet of a scarlet walker are subject to the
      monster's eerie blood-draining gaze. Affected creatures must succeed at a
      DC 26 Fortitude save or thin streams of blood pour from their eyes,
      flowing through the air and into the eye-socket-like pits in Ithier's
      face. This does not impact the victim's vision, but deals 1 point of
      Constitution damage and sickens the victim for 1 round from the hideous
      pain. A creature already suffering from a bleed effect takes a -4 penalty
      on the saving throw. This is a bleed effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Bloodsense (Su)
    description: >-
      Ithier can sense living creatures with blood in their veins and undead
      creatures that feed on blood (such as vampires). This ability functions
      like blindsight to a range of 60 feet.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ithier casts mind fog on the first round of combat and uses quickened lesser
  confusion each round on a fighter, a barbarian, or another well-armed PC.  The
  scarlet walker casts greater invisibility on the second round, following that
  up with its mind-affecting spells and spell-like abilities. It keeps Ileosa
  informed of the battle via telepathy. It pursues foes throughout the Sunken
  Queen, but not into the flooded areas. If it manages to affect the target of
  the soultrapping gem in area B19 with dominate person or demand, it orders
  that person to go fetch the gemstone and thus fall victim to the gem's
  effects.
Morale: Ithier fights to the death.
