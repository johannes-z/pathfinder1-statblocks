SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Despair (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures within a 30-foot radius that see Shielseis must make a DC 19
      Will save or be paralyzed by fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save
      is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by her despair
      ability for 24 hours. This is a paralysis and mindaffecting fear effect.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      Mummy Rot: slam-injury; save Fort DC 16; onset 1 minute; frequency 1 day;
      effect 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha; cure -. Mummy rot is both a curse and a
      disease and can only be cured if the curse is first removed, at which
      point the disease can be magically removed. Even after the curse element
      of mummy rot is lifted, a creature suffering from the disease cannot
      recover naturally over time. Anyone casting a conjuration (healing) spell
      on the afflicted creature must succeed on a DC 20 caster level check, or
      the spell is wasted and the healing has no effect. Anyone who dies from
      mummy rot turns to dust and cannot be raised without a resurrection or
      greater magic. The save DC is Charisma-based.
