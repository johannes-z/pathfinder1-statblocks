SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fogburst (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a mist drake can expel a ball of solid mist that
      explodes into a cloud of fog upon impact. This attack has a range of 60
      feet and deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a
      20-foot radius (Reflex DC 18 half). A flying creatures that fails its
      Reflex save is pushed 1d4x5 feet from the center of the fogburst's area of
      effect (taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet if it strikes a solid
      object), while creatures on the ground are knocked prone on a failed save.
      The area of effect of the fogburst is filled with mist (as per obscuring
      mist) for 1d4 rounds after impact. Once a mist drake has used its fogburst
      attack, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Fogvision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mist drake can see normally through any form of natural or magical mist,
      fog, or precipitation.
  - name: Misty Camouflage (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mist drake can use Stealth to hide whenever it is in or adjacent to an
      area of mist, even while being observed.
  - name: Speed Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a swift action, a mist drake can draw on its
      draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that enables it to
      take an additional move action in that round.
DuringCombat: >-
  The drakes attempt to disorient the PCs with fogbursts and then hide within
  the created clouds, making hit-and-run attacks from concealment.
Morale: >-
  The drakes fear death more than even Bozhithar and Grasping Storm. They flee
  into the sky if reduced to 15 hit points or fewer.
Gear: horn of fog (one drake only), wind fan (one drake only)
