SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blackfire Eruption (Sp)
    description: >-
      Xanthir can sacrifice a prepared spell of 4th level or higher to create a
      searing ebon vortex. This effect functions as unholy blight, but its
      maximum damage is increased by 1d8 points (2d6 against good outsiders) per
      level of the sacrificed spell above 4th. It ignores hardness if targeted
      against objects. A creature slain or object destroyed by this effect
      crumbles to ash. This is a conjuration effect.
  - name: Blackfire Pact (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Xanthir can create a resonance between himself and a
      target within 30 feet. He gains a +1 profane bonus on attack rolls and
      caster level checks against the target, and the target takes a -1 penalty
      on saves against his attacks and spells (&#8211;2 against conjuration
      effects). This effect lasts for 4 rounds (Will DC 14 save reduces to 1
      round), and the effect ends if the target moves more than 30 feet away
      from Xanthir.
  - name: Blackfire Taint (Su)
    description: >-
      Xanthir gains a +1 profane bonus on saving throws, caster level checks,
      Charisma checks, and Charisma-based skill checks against demons. Demons he
      conjures via planar binding or similar effects gain +4 temporary hit
      points, a +1 profane bonus on saving throws, and a +1 profane bonus to
      resist being banished&#8211;these demons are indicated in the adventure
      text as appropriate. Contingency If Xanthir is reduced to 0 or fewer hit
      points, his contingency spell activates a false life on him. Wealthy
      Xanthir has the wealth of a PC of equal level&#8211;this increases his CR
      by +1.
Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: divination, enchantment
BeforeCombat: >-
  Xanthir casts false life, augmented mythic fly (he expends 1 additional use of
  mythic power to augment this spell, and thus while flying gains a +4 bonus on
  Reflex saves and a +4 dodge bonus to his AC&#8211;these bonuses and
  expenditure of mythic power are included in his stats above), and shield
  before entering combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Xanthir is a complex character&#8211;suggested round-by-round tactics for
  combat are given in a sidebar on page 55. As a general rule, he saves his uses
  of mythic power to cast mythic spells (he can do so twice per day without
  expending a use of mythic power, thanks to his mythic spellpower ability), but
  he is also fond of expending a use of mythic power to cast his summon monster
  spells as swift actions once combat is underway.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 10 or fewer hit points, Xanthir casts dimension door to escape,
  traveling to the point where the tunnel from area Q18a emerges along the cliff
  face to the south. Once he recovers, he casts teleport as soon as possible to
  flee to the ruined city of Iz, where he keeps a hideout. He doesn't return to
  the Ivory Sanctum if he escapes in this manner. Xanthir has no official role
  to play in the forthcoming volumes of this Adventure Path; if he escapes, you
  can use him however you see fit&#8211;suggestions for his actions in future
  adventures can be found on the volumes' inside back covers.
