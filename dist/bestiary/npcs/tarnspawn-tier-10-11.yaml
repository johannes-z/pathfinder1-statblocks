SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animal Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tarnspawn counts as both an animal and a monstrous humanoid for the
      purposes of spells, abilities, and effects that affect animals. A
      tarnspawn is allowed a Will save to resist spells and effects that
      specifically affect animals, even if the effect does not normally allow a
      Will save.
  - name: Soul Feast (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a tarnspawn may attempt to drink the soul from any
      adjacent humanoid creature killed within the last round, storing the life
      force inside itself to carry back to the Silver Tarn entity. Draining a
      soul is a touch attack that provokes an attack of opportunity. A tarnspawn
      may only store a single soul, and cannot use this ability if it has
      already feasted on a soul. A creature whose soul has been imbibed may not
      be returned from the dead with any magic short of a limited miracle.
      Slaying the tarnspawn releases the stored soul, allowing the character to
      be raised normally. If the tarnspawn returns to the Silver Tarn, both it
      and the soul are absorbed by the entity, permanently slaying both.
  - name: Spit Bile (Ex)
    description: >-
      Tarnspawn may spit a stream of acidic bile up to 40 feet as a ranged
      attack.
BeforeCombat: >-
  If the tarnspawn stalk humans or expect combat, roughly half of the pack
  hides, attempting to prowl behind their prey or leap unexpectedly from ambush.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tarnspawn in a group reserve one member each round to unleash a terrifying
  howl (using their Dazzling Display feat; remember to include a +4 bonus if the
  tarnspawn are larger than their opponents). They eschew weapons, instead using
  their claws and fangs and focusing on shaken opponents.
