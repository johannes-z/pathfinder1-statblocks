  Shard. She casts divine favor to lessen the penalties further, and follows

  her stat block. If she has further time, she casts entropic shield from her
  scroll to further improve her defenses.

  heavily armored PC. After that she attacks any character who presents a

  surrounded, she repeatedly channels negative energy, trusting her selective
  channeling feat to shield her allies. If she successfully uses hold person on
  an enemy, she does her best to drop that foe before moving on. Melkorka has
  numerous avenues for healing herself, and she uses them all to stay in the
