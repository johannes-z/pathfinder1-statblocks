SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Swarming (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ratfolk are used to living and fighting communally, and are adept at
      swarming foes for their own gain and their foes' detriment. Up to two
      ratfolk can share the same square at the same time. If two ratfolk in the
      same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that
      foe as if they were in two opposite squares.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  The tower captain positions himself so that his guards are between him and the
  PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  The ratfolk captain attempts to stay out of melee for as long as possible,
  instead putting his years of training with the longbow to use. Should he be
  forced into melee, he draws his short sword and swarms with any remaining
  guards.
Morale: If brought below 25 hit points, the ratfolk captain attempts to surrender.
