  During Combat Although Cadrilkasta is a dangerous foe, the curse that afflicts
  her helps to soften that danger somewhat. She doesn't bother casting many
  preparatory spells before combat, and for the first few rounds of battle she
  doesn't bother taking more than a move action, and stays in her nest. She
  clutches the Shard of Sloth tightly in one claw at all times, which prevents
  her from making a second claw attack even when she does start making full
  attacks. At the start of combat, Cadrilkasta activates her storm breath
  ability, calling down a bolt of lightning on the closest foe. She continues
  calling down bolts each round until she's reduced to fewer than 250 hit
  points. At this point, she realizes she's up against significant foes. She
  then leaps into the air and starts taking her full complement of actions (at
  which point her curse makes her sickened). She prefers not to make full
  attacks, and instead swoops back and forth while casting spells or breathing
  lightning on the PCs. She also starts using Quicken Spell to cast additional
  spells each round&#8211;displacement on the first round, followed by
  glitterdust, scorching ray, magic missile, grease, and reduce person. She
  saves a 7th-level spell slot for summon monster VII, three 5th-level spell
  slots for her teleport spells, and at least two 4th-level slots for charm
  monster spells to be used as detailed in her  section if she flees. Once she's
  reduced to fewer than 150 hit points, her contingency spell activates, turning
  her invisible. She then casts teleport to retreat to area F3, where she casts
  summon monster VII to summon 1d3 lillend azatas, then orders them to heal her
  with cure serious wounds and cure light wounds. Once they exhaust their
  healing, she uses her mirage ability to create a duplicate image of herself
  farther up the tunnel, making it appear that she's come back to cast more
  spells and breathe more lightning at foes while her lillends move up to attack
  the PCs as well. As soon as her mirage ends or the PCs confront her in F3, she
  lands in their midst and starts making full attacks (still minus one claw
  attack).   Cadrilkasta tries to escape if reduced to 60 hit points or fewer,
  taking with her only the treasures she carries or wears and leaving the rest
  behind in area F10. She casts teleport to return to area F1, then flees
  through the portal back to area E3 in the Embassy of Leng (she doesn't realize
  she can do the same by fleeing into the clouds below). The dragon makes her
  way back through the dungeons&#8211;pausing to breathe a bolt of lightning
  into the pit at area E3 to wake up and anger the bhole so that pursuing PCs
  need to deal with it (unless they've already damaged the bhole enough to make
  it retreat for an extended time). As she works her way back up through the
  dungeon, Cadrilkasta uses charm monster to recruit additional creatures to
  slow down her pursuers. Once she exits the dungeon (or immediately upon
  returning to the Material Plane if the abysium reactor is no longer
  functioning), she uses teleport to escape into an old lair in the Kodar
  Mountains.
