BeforeCombat: >-
  The sentries freely employ their scrolls of detect magic if they see or hear
  anything suspicious, and they drink a potion of shield of faith if they expect
  a fight.
DuringCombat: >-
  The sentries drill to fight as a unit, and remain adjacent to take advantage
  of their teamwork feats, especially Outflank and Paired Opportunists. They
  freely use their Bodyguard feat to defend each other in combat. One sentry
  uses a scroll of haste if any allies are injured. These guards gain a +4 or +2
  morale bonus to attack rolls and saving throws if the Royal Guard entity is
  still hostile or unfriendly toward the PCs.
Morale: The Imperial Palace sentries fight to the death.
