  Rimetusk focuses his attacks on the PC who most recently damaged him or openly
  challenged his authority. If he finds he's having an easy time hitting a
  particular target, he power attacks to drop that opponent sooner so he can
  move on to another target.
Morale: Rimetusk is extremely confident of his combat prowess and fights to the death.
