    description: >-
      If the supercharged Brass Guardian is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points,
      it immediately begins to overheat. On its next turn, the Brass Guardian
      explodes, dealing 8d6 points of fire damage to every creature in
      10-foot-radius (Reflex DC 23 negates) and exposing any creature damaged by
      the explosion to eidite sickness (see page 19). The save DC is
      Dexterity-based.

      As long as the Brass Guardian is attached to the turbine in Krauss's
      workshop via its various cables (which effectively form a 20-foot-long
      tether) and for 1 round after detaching from the cords, the construct is
      supercharged with electricity. During this time, all of the Brass
      Guardian's melee attacks are treated as though they possessed the shocking
      burst special ability. A creature struck by the supercharged Brass
      Guardian is paralyzed for 1 round (Reflex DC 19 avoids). Creatures with
      immunity or energy resistance to electricity are immune to this paralysis
      effect. The Brass Guardian can rip free of the cords tethering it to the
      turbine as a free action, and other creatures can break the cables with
      slashing weapons (AC 10, 25 hp, hardness 3). The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
