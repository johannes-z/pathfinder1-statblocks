    description: >-
      The rose window has 2 CP, which it has spent on two additional slam
      attacks.
DuringCombat: >-
  The window begins combat by leaping onto a creature from its perch (requiring
  a ranged touch attack and dealing 3d3 points of damage) and relying on its
  hardness to resist the damage to itself. It then attacks with its slam
  attacks, focusing on one creature at a time.
