DuringCombat: >-
  Alise makes good use of Spring Attack in combat, staying on the move so she
  can make flanking attacks while minimizing full attacks on herself from
  enemies. She avoids ending her turn standing within 5 feet of any foe.
Morale: >-
  Alise surrenders if either she's brought below 25 hit points or at least four
  of the other castaways are defeated. In this event, Alise throws herself upon
  the PCs' mercy, tearfully explaining that she feared they were assassins sent
  by Harrigan and begging them to rescue her and her crew from this "cursed
  rock." If she finds out that the PCs are Harrigan's enemies, she tells them
  about the files her captain Scags kept on his old commander, stored in a
  watertight chest on the Devilish Duchess, which she knows has been claimed by
  the brykolakases and is in area A5. See "Rescue and Repairs" on page 25 for
  more details on how Alise can help the PCs against Harrigan.
