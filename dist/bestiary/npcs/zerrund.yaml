SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Overwhelming Wrath (Ex)
    description: >-
      Zerrund suffers from an overwhelming sense of wrath that hampers his
      judgment. He lacks the discorporate ability and racial skill bonuses most
      worms that walk have. This, plus the fact that he's lost his arcane focus
      and has no gear, reduces his CR by 1.
Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: conjuration, abjuration
DuringCombat: >-
  Without his arcane bond, Zerrund must succeed at a concentration check (DC =
  20 + the spell's level) when he casts a spell to avoid losing the spell as he
  casts it. If he fails to cast a spell in this way, his rage compels him to
  make a slam attack against a foe on the next round rather than cast a spell.
  These significant disadvantages aside, on the first round of combat he
  attempts to cast fly, then does his best to maintain distance between himself
  and the PCs and focuses on using his other spells to blast them to death.
Morale: Zerrund fights to the death.
