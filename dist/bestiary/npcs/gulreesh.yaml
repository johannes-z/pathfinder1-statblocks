BeforeCombat: >-
  Gulreesh refuses to talk to any visitors unless they are within 20 feet of
  him-if the visitors anger Gulreesh, he can then reach them easily and use
  Combat Reflexes to make attacks of opportunity against anyone who acts before
  him.
DuringCombat: >-
  Gulreesh prefers not to move around a lot. He prefers to use his bite to make
  attacks of opportunity except when he can reach the target only with a
  tentacle. When facing multiple creatures, Gulreesh usually releases any
  creature he grabs after dealing constrict damage.
Morale: >-
  If the PCs attacked Gulreesh without provocation, he fights to the death. If
  the PCs attempted to negotiate with Gulreesh before the fight, he surrenders
  and agrees to help the PCs when reduced to 40 or fewer hit points.
