BeforeCombat: >-
  Skelg taunts the PCs for as long as he can, but once any of the PCs make a
  move to attack him, he rages and throws himself at the nearest PC.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once Skelg is adjacent to a PC or two, he uses his come and get me rage power
  every round as a move action, risking more damage from the PCs but dealing
  massive damage back with his attacks of opportunity. Should adjacent PCs try
  to step away from Skelg, he uses Following Step, Step Up, or Step Up and
  Strike to immediately follow and strike again. Note that Skelg's greataxe has
  the vicious property on it, but that his damage reduction prevents any of the
  return damage the +2 vicious greataxe would deal back to him.
Morale: Ulfen jarls live to die in battle&#8211;Skelg fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  +3 elven chainmail, +2 vicious greataxe, belt of physical might (+2 Str/Con),
  cloak of resistance +1, ring of protection +1
