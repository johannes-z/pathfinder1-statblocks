BeforeCombat: >-
  When the PCs attack or talk to the mercenaries in area A5, Celeena is alerted
  to their presence. At this point she uses her scroll of mage armor and hides
  behind the northwest shelf. Once she thinks the PCs have either allied with
  her mercenaries or killed them, she casts summon monster II and summons a
  lemure, directing it to stand in the square just north of the door and attack
  the first PC who enters the room.
DuringCombat: >-
  Celeena casts ray of enfeeblement first, hitting the PCs fighting the lemure
  and trying to weaken them. She then uses her wand of magic missile for ranged
  attacks and casts color spray and burning hands once the PCs get closer. If
  the lemure falls and she has time, she summons another to prevent the PCs from
  reaching her.
Morale: >-
  Celeena is obsessed but not stupid&#8211;if reduce to 5 hit points or fewer,
  she surrenders.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure light wounds, scroll of mage armor (already used), wand of
  magic missile (50 charges)
