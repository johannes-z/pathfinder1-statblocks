Source: PFS S10-01
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Rapid Reversion (Su)
    description: >-
      Ilchok can revert to his true form as a swift action. However, doing so
      temporarily suppresses his ability to take alternate forms, preventing him
      from using his change shape ability for 10 minutes.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  When Ilchok notices that PCs are investigating his murders, either through
  overhearing their questions or through what he uncovers with detect thoughts,
  he drinks his potion of mage armor. If the PCs find him in area D4 and he is
  no longer in disguise, he casts magic fang on one of his claws (this bonus is
  not included in his statistics).
DuringCombat: >-
  Ilchok attacks humans first, using Power Attack and Rending Claws to increase
  his damage. If his attacks consistently fail, he stops using Power Attack. If
  attacking lightly armored foes, Ilchok uses Bloody Assault.
Morale: >-
  Ilchok drinks his potion of invisibility and attempts to flee if brought below
  25 hit points, cursing the PCs and warning them that the Ghostknives will
  destroy them and their allies. If he escapes, he returns to the Ghostknives'
  hideout and warns Cladara about the PCs-a warning that costs him his life.
