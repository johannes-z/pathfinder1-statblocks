SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Anarchic Gift (Su)
    description: >-
      Arueshalae's redemption has altered her profane gift ability. This ability
      functions the same, except the bonus to an ability score granted by
      anarchic gift is a sacred bonus, and the gift cannot be removed by dispel
      evil. She can maintain only one anarchic gift at a time.
  - name: Path to Redemption (Ex)
    description: >-
      Arueshalae's hopeful path toward redemption has had some unique effects on
      her abilities as a demon. She no longer has the evil subtype, and she's
      lost the use of some of her demonic spell-like abilities as detailed
      above. Her DR has changed from DR 10/cold iron or good to DR 10/cold iron
      or lawful. When she's within 30 feet of a CR 6 or higher demon at the
      start of any turn, she must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be
      staggered for 1 round by flashbacks of her evil past. Wealthy Arueshalae
      has the equivalent gear of a 15th-level PC; this increases her CR by 1.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Arueshalae activates her boots of speed on the first round of combat. She
  prefers to focus on ranged attacks with her starbow, using Mythic Deadly Aim
  to gain a +12 bonus on damage rolls at a penalty of &#8211;4 on attack rolls,
  and uses Rapid Shot when she can to fire off an additional shot. In melee, she
  tries to stay mobile or flank foes to gain sneak attacks. She uses charm
  monster and suggestion for battlefield control, ordering those who succumb to
  leave the combat or otherwise take actions that prevent them from harming her
  or her allies.
Morale: >-
  Arueshalae flees combat if brought below 40 hit points, unless a friend
  remains in danger or she's presented with a chance to do some good by staying
  in combat, in which case she fights to the death.
Gear: spherewalker staff (1 charge), wand of cure serious wounds (28 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +3 leather armor, +1 cold iron holy starknife, starbow, belt of physical
  perfection +2, boots of speed, efficient quiver (contains 20 arrows, 20 +1
  evil outsider bane arrows, 10 +1 phase locking arrowsUC, five +1 axiomatic
  holy evil outsider bane arrows, and five evil outsider slaying arrows), ring
