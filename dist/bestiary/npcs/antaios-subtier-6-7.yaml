SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Assimilate (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a living topiary can consume any undergrowth or
      bushy plant matter it is currently touching and then incorporate that
      matter into its own form. The topiary can do this at a rate of 5 cubic
      feet per round, healing 1d8 points of damage when it does so. If the
      living topiary is at maximum hit points this ability has no effect.
  - name: Brambles (Ex)
    description: >-
      Living topiaries with this ability are made out of plants with deadly
      thorns. Those with this ability deal 1d8 points of piercing damage with
      their attacks (rather than 1d6 bludgeoning).
  - name: Hedge Stride (Sp)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as tree stride, but rather than allowing for
      teleportation from tree to tree, it permits the living topiary to teleport
      from one area of brush or hedges to another area of similar vegetation
      within 1,500 feet. A living topiary can use this ability three times per
      day.
  - name: Move Through Hedges (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living topiary may move through any solid object made of brambles or
      thick, porous plants without penalty. It must begin and end its turn
      outside of the object.
  - name: Sculpt Shape (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a living topiary can alter itself to take on the
      basic form of any creature. The change is purely cosmetic, and does not
      change its size, grant it any special powers, or alter its abilities.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Antaios is confused and disturbed by the morning's violence, and sits quietly
  until it detects intruders in the shop.
DuringCombat: >-
  Antaios attacks the closest target, using Power Attack until its attacks miss
  twice. It then either moves on to attack the next nearest target or stops
  using Power Attack.
Morale: >-
  Once Antaios falls to fewer than half its full normal hit points, it attempts
  to assimilate the nearest 5 cubic feet of plant material in order to heal its
  wounds. It retreats to a corner and takes total defense if reduced to one
  quarter its total hit points.
