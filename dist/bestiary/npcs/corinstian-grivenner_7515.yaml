BeforeCombat: >-
  Corinstian takes time to cast magic vestment on his buckler and chainmail and
  greater magic weapon on his unholy heavy mace before combat. If he notices
  intruders, he also casts bull's strength and shield of faith on himself
  (enhancing both with his metamagic rod) in anticipation of a fight. He also
  casts status every day on a group of four erinyes devils, using his lesser rod
  of extend metamagic, then sends those devils to guard area E33.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once he's attacked, Corinstian moves to the edge of the hellfire so he
  benefits from concealment from foes but his own vision isn't blocked. In so
  doing, he makes sure he's positioned such that one of the Asmodean priests can
  come cast shield other on him as soon as possible. He supports his minions
  with ranged spells, but focuses on defending his lover Aluceda Zhol if she's
  being attacked. In melee, he casts quickened divine favor (this is included in
  his statistics above) and casts fire shield before moving to use his mace,
  preferring to strike those who appear to be divine spellcasters of good or
  chaotic faiths. If he notices the devils in area E33 are being harmed or
  attacked via his status spell, he alerts those in the nave and sounds the
  alarm, then sends Aluceda up to alert Barzillai so that they can join in the
  defense of the chamber.
Morale: Corinstian fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  chainmail, buckler, +1 unholy heavy mace, belt of mighty constitution +2, rod
  of lesser extend metamagic, 533 gp
