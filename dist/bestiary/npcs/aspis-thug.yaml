BeforeCombat: >-
  If the PCs approach the lookout, he uses Bluff to try passing himself off as a
  member of the town guard, explaining that he and his comrades are escorting a
  belligerent youth home.
DuringCombat: >-
  If the lookout can see that his ruse isn't working, he throws a thunderstone
  at the PCs to try to deafen them and warn the other thugs. One of the agents
  restraining Kanjo moves to assist the lookout, while the remaining thug begins
  attacking the young man.
Morale: >-
  If the thugs manage to kill Kanjo, they immediately attempt to flee. They
  surrender if more than one of them is reduced to fewer than 5 hit points,
  hoping to escape later.
