DuringCombat: >-
  Although Neolandus trained as a ranger, he realizes his true skills are in
  diplomacy. As such, he only fights when there is no other choice, in which
  case he prefers to engage in combat with his deity's favored weapon, the light
  crossbow.
Morale: >-
  Neolandus won't abandon an ally, but if alone, flees to safety if brought to
  fewer than 15 hit points.
