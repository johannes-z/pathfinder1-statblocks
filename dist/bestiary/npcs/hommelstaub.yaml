SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Snow Sight (Su)
    description: >-
      Hommelstaub can see through falling snow and sleet without taking any
      penalties on Perception checks as long as he there is enough light for him
      to see normally.
  - name: Wintry Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action 7 times per day, Hommelstaub can perform a melee
      touch attack that deals 1d6+1 points of cold damage.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  If he has time to prepare, Hommelstaub uses his scroll of resist energy and
  casts magic stone on three pebbles to hurl with his sling.
DuringCombat: >-
  Hommelstaub turns invisible and flies upward to hide in the falling snow,
  where his snow sight grants him a superior view of the camp. He then throws a
  thunderstone, smashing it against an armored enemy or the side of an igloo to
  deafen his opponents and warn Teb Knotten and his sprite allies (see
  Development, below). Hommelstaub hurls bottles of liquid ice to snuff out any
  enemy fire sources, and casts summon monster I to summon fiendish eagles to
  attack opponents while he uses his sling. If drawn into melee combat,
  Hommelstaub casts reduce person on his attackers before making sneak attacks
  with inflict light wounds or his wintry touch.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, Hommelstaub retreats back into the
  falling snow to drink his potion of cure moderate wounds. Thereafter, he
  fights to the death, though if Teb Knotten is dead, he might try to flee
  through the winter portal back to Irrisen instead.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure moderate wounds, scroll of remove curse, scroll of resist
  energy (fire), liquid iceUE (3), thunderstones (2)
OtherGear: sickle, sling, 64 gp
