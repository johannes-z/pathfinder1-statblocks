BeforeCombat: >-
  Unlike many of the Pale Tower's inhabitants, Jairess has trouble weathering
  the cold, so she casts endure elements on herself every day.
DuringCombat: >-
  Jairess directs her ravens to swarm opponents on the first round of battle
  while she drinks her potion of fly (increasing her Fly skill to +12) and rises
  into the air. She then casts wind wall to defend against ranged attacks,
  followed by spells such as hold person and sound burst to keep enemies from
  avoiding the raven swarm. If she must fight, Jairess casts returning weapon
  from her scroll on her shortspear. If she or the ravens become significantly
  injured, she casts obscuring mist and channels positive energy, excluding
  nearby adversaries with her Selective Channeling feat.
Morale: >-
  Once she exhausts her offensive spells and healing powers, Jairess surrenders,
  calling her surviving birds back to her. If the raven swarm is slain, Jairess
  avenges them by fighting to the death.
Gear: potion of fly, scroll of returning weaponUC
