BeforeCombat: >-
  If the PCs set of Aglorn's alarm spell on the stairs to C1, he casts mage
  armor and false life on himself before the Pathfinders reach the cavern.
DuringCombat: >-
  Aglorn begins combat by summoning monsters to waylay the PCs along the rope
  bridges and plateaus, doing so as far as his range will allow. He summons
  creatures in the following order: 1d3 fiendish giant spiders (summon monster
  III), 1d3 lemures (summon monster III from his bonded item), and 1d3 fiendish
  dire rats (summon monster II), each using the Augment Summoning feat and 1
  charge of Aglorn's lesser extend metamagic rod. Once he can see the PCs, he
  uses the next round to catch as many of them as possible in a fireball, and
  casts dispel magic on the first PC he sees flying or otherwise using magic to
  gain mobility across the treacherous terrain. If he is cornered in melee, he
  uses his dimensional steps spell like ability to escape and continue the
  combat at range.
Morale: >-
  Aglorn knows the entire Aspis Consortium effort in the Hao Jin Tapestry hinges
  on him maintaining control of the Diamond Gate, and he fights to the death to
  defend it.
