SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear Aura (Su)
    description: A creature that succumbs to Nihil's fear aura cowers in fear for 1 round.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  As soon as she receives reports that the castle is being invaded by the PCs,
  Nihil uses prying eyes to explore Scarwall's heights in search of the
  intruders. If she finds them, she watches their tactics to familiarize herself
  with their capabilities. As soon as it looks like the PCs are about to reach
  this chamber, she casts greater invisibility and attempts to summon a barbed
  devil to augment her defenses.
DuringCombat: >-
  When Nihil attacks, any minions she has nearby attempt to isolate individuals
  and wear them down before switching to other targets, letting Nihil make as
  many final kills as possible. As soon as the PCs are all within this chamber,
  she casts blasphemy, followed in the next 2 rounds by horrid wilting and chain
  lightning. If one PC in particular seems to be far more dangerous than others
  (such as a heavily armored fighter with weapons that can penetrate her damage
  reduction), she uses forcecage to separate that character from the battle to
  be dealt with later.
Morale: >-
  Nihil is unable to flee as long as she remains a spirit anchor, and thus
  fights to the death.
