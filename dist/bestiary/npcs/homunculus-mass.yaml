SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Absorb Body (Su)
    description: >-
      A corpse orgy can absorb the physical body of any creature it has reduced
      to 0 or fewer hit points by moving over it and remaining in contact with
      it for at least 1 full round. An unconscious or dying opponent who
      succeeds at a DC 29 Fortitude save evades absorption; otherwise, the
      victim dies upon being absorbed. A dead opponent gets no saving throw.
      When the corpse orgy absorbs a body, it gains 12 temporary hit points. A
      creature whose body is absorbed can only be raised or resurrected if the
      corpse orgy that absorbed its body is slain and the corpse in question is
      recovered. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Pain Shriek (Su)
    description: >-
      Twice per day, as a standard action, the homunculus mass can unleash a
      piercing shriek that deals 10d6 points of sonic damage to all creatures
      within a 40-foot-radius burst (Fortitude DC 25 half ). This is a sonic
      effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Slam-injury; save Fort DC 29; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect
      sleep for 1 minute; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The homunculus mass prefers to attack one target, focusing its attacks there
  in an attempt to absorb a body. It pursues foes throughout the complex, but if
  confronted by a construct, it favors attacks against its creator's minions
  over the PCs.
Morale: The corpse orgy fights to the death.
