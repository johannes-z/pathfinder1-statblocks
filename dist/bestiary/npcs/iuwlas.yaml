    description: >-
      Iuwlas is an evolutionary throwback, possessing magic and intellect his
      people lost long ago. He gains a +6 bonus to his Charisma and can cast
      cure light wounds three times per day as a spell-like ability. Because of
      the awe and fear he inspires in other morlocks, he loses his swarming
      racial ability. This ability originally appeared in Pathfinder Campaign
      Setting: Darklands Revisited.
Gender: Male

  splendor, protection from good, and shield of faith on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Iuwlas begins any conflict by unleashing his storm of souls revelation and
  then casting spiritual ally. He clings to the walls and ceiling and unleashes
  attack spells, beginning by using telekinesis to fling enemies into the
  waterfall and down to area G14 for the lake's denizen to finish off.
Morale: >-
  Iuwlas retreats to his morlock allies in G12 if reduced below 60 hit points.
  He makes a final stand in area G19 with the tribe's chief.
