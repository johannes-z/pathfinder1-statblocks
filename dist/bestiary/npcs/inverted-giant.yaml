SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      An inverted giant can channel arcane energy into its fists whenever it
      makes a successful claw attack, dealing 1d6 points of energy damage (cold,
      electricity, or fire, chosen when the inverted giant attacks-these giants
      favor fire damage) in addition to the damage its claws normally deal.
  - name: Runes (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever an inverted giant is affected by a spell or spell-like ability,
      it can cause the runes covering its body to flash with light. All
      creatures within 10 feet of the giant must succeed at a 21 Fortitude save
      or be blinded for 1 round. The saving throw is Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  When the PCs appear in the room, the inverted giants rush to attack, having
  been told to destroy all non-giant beings they see.
Morale: >-
  If one of the giants is slain, the other makes a fighting retreat to area M5,
  where it fights to the death.
