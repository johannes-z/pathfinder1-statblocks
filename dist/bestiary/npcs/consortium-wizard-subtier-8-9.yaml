  (already included in his stats).
DuringCombat: >-
  Startled in the night, the Consortium Wizard responds quickly to any sounds of
  attack by casting greater invisibility and then surveying the situation. If
  the camp is under attack, he releases the beast from its cage and either
  continues to buff or uses his wand of black tentacles depending on the
  situation. He continues to fight with a mix of controlling and damaging
  spells.
