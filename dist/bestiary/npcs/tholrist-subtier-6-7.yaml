SpecialAbilities:

    description: >-
      Ghoul Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 15; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC
      is Charisma-based. A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at
      the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none
      of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of any
      other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like
      a normal ghoul in all respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as
      a ghast.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  As if he hears the PCs outside of his chamber, Tholrist prepares for battle by
  casting freedom of movement, resist energy, and owl's wisdom on himself, and
  casts aid, rage, and shield of faith on one of his ghoul minions. He then
  hides behind the sacrificial altar until the PCs have entered and his minions
  have gone into melee with them.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once combat begins, Tholrist casts unholy blight on the party, followed by
  chaos hammer. He then targets any obvious casters with blindness/deafness,
  following up by casting command or hold person to hinder the PCs' approach. If
  any casters have a summoned outsider aiding them, Tholrist uses dismissal to
  eliminate that threat. If PCs get close enough for melee, he attacks with his
  claws and bite, augmented by his fury of the Abyss ability from the Demon
  domain, and sometimes casts offensive touch spells like bestow curse. Tholrist
  uses his channel energy ability, augmented with Quick Channel, to quickly heal
  himself and his minions rather than using it to attack the party unless he's
  surrounded by three or more PCs. Tholrist ignores any creatures he
  successfully paralyzes until the battle is over.
Morale: >-
  Knowing he is cursed to remain in this chamber forever and clearly insane
  after all the intervening years, Tholrist fights until destroyed.
