BeforeCombat: >-
  Once they spot the PCs, the skeletal champions rage. Rage has already been
  figured into their stats.
DuringCombat: >-
  The skeletal champions possess great intelligence (for undead) and use it to
  flank the PCs and tactically retreat and strike again when they can. If a
  cleric uses his channel positive energy ability against the skeletal
  champions, they immediately focus all of their rage on that PC.
Morale: The skeletal champions fight until destroyed.
