BeforeCombat: >-
  The coven casts mind blank on Vorysa. She casts mage armor and slipstream on
  herself before entering combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vorysa prefers to hold back in a fight, casting ray of enfeeblement on foes,
  using her evil eye on healers or particularly powerful melee combatants, or
  blasting foes with her wand. She tries to remain within 60 feet of as many
  foes as possible so her horrific appearance will weaken them-note that the
  advanced chuul has already been exposed to this effect today and is immune for
  the rest of the day.
Morale: >-
  Vorysa knows when she's outclassed, and once reduced below 40 hit points or
  once the chuul is defeated, she flees the scene and returns to the Augur's
  Throne to report to her coven. If attacking alongside the other hags in her
  coven, she fights to the death.
