  Kanjougas focuses his fury on the most heavily armored target, attempting to
  keep that person stunned as long as possible so he can finish her off without
  retaliation before moving on to the next foe. He uses his slam only when he
  can't make a full attack, but generally does so with the aid of Vital Strike.
Morale: Kanjougas fights until destroyed.
Gear: amulet of mighty fists +1, belt of giant strength +2, black key to area F24
