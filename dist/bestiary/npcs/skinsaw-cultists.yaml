DuringCombat: >-
  The cultists organize into pairs, with each focusing on a specific PC in order
  to maximize sneak attack opportunities. If a cultist gets to act in a surprise
  round, he casts hold person to try to end the fight before it begins. The
  cultists cast divine favor on the first round of combat, then move to flank
  foes. A cultist reduced to 20 or fewer hit points casts invisibility, then
  flees to heal as best he can with his spells before returning to combat to
  finish the fight.
Morale: A Skinsaw cultist fights to the death.
