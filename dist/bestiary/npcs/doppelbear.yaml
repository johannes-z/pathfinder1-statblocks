SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Daemonic Osmosis (Su)
    description: >-
      If a doppelbear spends at least 24 hours watching a mark (or just being
      within 50 feet of him) it may permanently gain a feat that the mark has
      used, even if the doppelbear does not meet the requirements.
      Alternatively, it may gain one 0-level or 1st-level spell that the mark
      casts during that time as a spell-like ability (CL 3rd), usable 3 times a
      day. This effect uses the creature's Charisma to determine the spell's DC.
      This ability can be used only to obtain spells with a material component
      worth less than 5 gp. Once daemonic osmosis is used on a mark, the ability
      only functions if used on the same mark.
  - name: Morph (Su)
    description: >-
      A doppelbear begins to change into a facestealer the first time it uses
      its daemonic osmosis ability, taking on the appearance of its mark over a
      period of 3 days.

      Doppelbears have a 25% chance to treat any critical hits they suffer as a
      normal hit.
