SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Brain Consumption (Ex)
    description: >-
      If Cephal deals damage with his bite attack against a helpless or pinned
      living foe, the bitten creature must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be
      reduced to a negative hit point total equal to 1 lower than his current
      Constitution as Cephal begins to consume the victim's brain. If Cephal
      bites a foe who already has negative hit points, he automatically kills
      the foe by eating his brain. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Command Zombies (Su)
    description: >-
      Cephal can automatically command all normal zombies within 30 feet as a
      free action. Normal zombies never attack Cephal unless compelled.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Cephal casts fly, mage armor, shield, and fire shield if he has a chance to do
  so before combat begins. He then flies to the cavern ceiling to use the
  stalactites as cover.
DuringCombat: >-
  Cephal remains near the ceiling as long as possible, targeting his magic at
  spellcasters and characters using ranged weapons. He casts glitterdust on
  those making ranged attacks. If he depletes his ranged attacks and hand of the
  apprentice uses, he swoops down to finish the fight with his dagger and bite
  attacks.
Morale: Cephal fights until destroyed.
Gear: >-
  +1 dagger, ring of protection +2, spell component pouch, spellbook (contains
  all cantrips and currently prepared spells)
