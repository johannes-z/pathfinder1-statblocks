BeforeCombat: >-
  Aponavicius attempts to summon a marilith and casts fly before seeking out the
  PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  Aponavicius doesn't immediately enter combat with the PCs. Rather, she uses
  project image to confront them, then uses blade barriers and telekinesis to
  soften them up. Once this tactic no longer seems viable, she slithers in to
  attack with her bewildering array of exotic weapons.
Morale: Aponavicius is done with giving up and fleeing&#8211;she fights to the death.

  keen lawful outsider bane falcata, +3 unholy khopesh, +3 wounding katana,
