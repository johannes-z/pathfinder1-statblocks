  - name: Aura of Command (Su)
    description: >-
      As long as her statue in area A4 of the Five-Pointed Sun remains intact,
      Isatemkhebet possesses an aura of command. All creatures within 60 feet
      become convinced that Isatemkhebet is a powerful general and feel
      compelled to follow her orders. Once per round as a swift action,
      Isatemkhebet can issue a command to any one creature within this area. The
      targeted creature can resist the compulsion to follow the command (which
      has the same limitations as a suggestion at CL 14th) with a successful DC
      23 Will save. A successful save grants immunity to Isatemkhebet's aura of
      command for 24 hours. This is a language-dependent, mind-affecting effect.
      Undead who have fewer than 14 Hit Dice can be affected by Isatemkhebet's
      aura of command as if they weren't immune to mind-affecting effects. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  If she fears that she is about to be attacked, Isatemkhebet uses her bracelet
  of friends to call her mummified gorgon, Kor-Ahn-Tuk, from area A13 to her
  side; if she's surprised, she does this on the first round of combat instead.
  If the gorgon has already been defeated, she wastes her action attempting to
  call it, but this does not expend the bracelet's last charm.
DuringCombat: >-
  At her first two opportunities to make a full attack, Isatemkhebet activates
  her burst of vengeance ability. She prefers to leave victims alive but
  disabled, so that after a fight she can leisurely finish them off with a slam
  attack and her dust stroke ability, although she does not generally take
  advantage of this tactic in battle. Each round, she attempts to use her aura
  of command&#8211;speaking in Ancient Osiriani&#8211;to order one PC at a time
  to lay down his weapons, drop to his knees, and take no action. She prefers to
  attack characters obviously capable of healing or those who provide support to
  allies first, but if faced with a foe that is particularly capable of damaging
  her, she concentrates on that target instead. She uses Power Attack until she
  misses with more than half her attacks made as     a full-attack action, at
  which point she ceases using Power Attack against that foe.
Morale: >-
  Isatemkhebet is eager to prove her worth to the Sky Pharaoh, and has little
  interest in surrender, but if the PCs reduce her to 50 or fewer hit points,
  she attempts to return to her sarcophagus and lower the lid so that she can
  gain its healing effects (see area A16). Once she's exhausted her
  sarcophagus's power for the day, she rises again and rejoins the fight until
  destroyed.
Gear: >-
  skyplate armor (+1 steel lamellarUE, see page 63), +1 bashing heavy steel
  shield, +2 khopeshUE, headband of alluring charisma +4, bracelet of friends (1
  charm, currently linked to Kor-Ahn-Tuk)
