BeforeCombat: >-
  The cultist casts shield of faith. They remain hidden as long as possible, for
  they plan to attack only once the golem from area B2 is lured into this room.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once the clockwork golem attacks, these cultists hang back to fire inubrix
  arrows at any heavily armored PCs. The skulks move after each shot, hoping to
  hide again and snipe at the PCs while they are forced to concentrate on the
  golem. Hanging back also keeps the skulks from accidentally attracting the
  wild golem's attention!
Morale: >-
  A skulk that is reduced to fewer than 20 hit points attempts to flee south to
  area B4 to warn the skulks there and join in the defense of that area's
  stairs.
