Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Palaveen casts invisibility on himself if he suspects battle is about to
  start.
DuringCombat: >-
  While invisible, Palaveen casts spiritual weapon and directs it to attack a
  lightly armored character. He uses his wand to heal allies and casts stabilize
  on any who fall beyond the range of his touch. If forced to attack he uses
  burning hands on a group of enemies (even if he catches another tiefling in
  the area, as he expects their fire resistance will protect them), fire bolt at
  wounded targets, and cause fear or hold person on weak-willed opponents. If he
  is visible and has a spare turn, he uses copycat to confuse opponents. If he
  wants reinforcements, he calls to the Hell dog in area 16, or moves to that
  area if that is a better tactical option.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 10 hp and unable to heal himself, Palaveen tries to escape,
  using copycat if possible and his potion of disguise self to blend it with the
  human population of Westcrown. He may surrender if he thinks the PCs won't
  kill him.
Gear: potion of disguise self, wand of cure light wounds (11 charges)
OtherGear: +1 breastplate, +1 morningstar, iron unholy symbol, treasure chest key, 330 gp
