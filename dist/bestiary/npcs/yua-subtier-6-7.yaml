SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Combat Healer (Su)
    description: >-
      Yua's combat healer revelation works with inflict spells rather than cure
      spells.
  - name: Corrupting Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      By passing part of her incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard
      action, Yua deals 8d6 points of damage (DC 19 Fortititude half). This
      damage is not negative energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds
      and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are
      immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of
      damage reduction. Eastern Armor Training Yua may use instant armor to
      summon a suit of steel lamellar armor instead of banded mail.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat:
      the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful
      spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently
      destroy Yua is to cremate her body and send her ashes to a resting place
      that her spirit deems acceptable, such as to her family or to the
      Ossuaries of the Fallen in Vigil.
  - name: Spectral Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Yua can use her corrupting touch through a spectral version of the +1
      katana she wielded in life. When she does so, she may add her Charisma
      bonus to damage rolls and augment her corrupting touch with any effect
      that would augment a weapon. This attack uses the critical threat range of
      corrupting touch, rather than that of a katana.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Yua casts instant armor to create a suit of steel lamellar armor around her
  body. The bonuses of this spell are factored into her statistics. Note that
  while this spell is active, she cannot pass through walls.
DuringCombat: >-
  Yua attacks her foes with her spectral katana. She uses her combat healer
  revelation to heal herself during the fight. If the fight starts to go poorly
  for her, she casts darkness, hoping to force her foes to retreat and buy
  herself time to heal.
Morale: >-
  Trusting in her rejuvenation to restore her to unlife, Yua fights until
  destroyed.
