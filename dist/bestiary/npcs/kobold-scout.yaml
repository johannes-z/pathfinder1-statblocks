DuringCombat: >-
  The scouts attempt to pin down as many opponents as they can with their tangle
  bolts (+1 seeking bolts that entangle the target on a hit, in addition to the
  bolt damage, as if it had been hit by a tanglefoot bag), then use Deadly Aim
  to deal maximum damage to entangled targets. One scout mans the trap trigger
  at all times.
Morale: >-
  The scouts only stay long enough to lure as many PCs as they can into the path
  of the boulder. They flee to the drainage room (area 2b), where they can
  continue the fight with an ally.
Gear: potions of cure light wounds (2), tangle bolts* (2)
OtherGear: studded leather, short sword, light crossbow with 20 bolts
