SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Champion of the Dawnflower (Su)
    description: >-
      Lady Sophronia's devotion to Sarenrae empowers her attacks. She adds her
      Charisma modifier as a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with a
      ghost touch weapon. This bonus on attack rolls stacks with the bonus
      gained from her smite evil ability.
  - name: Divine Endowment (Su)
    description: >-
      Lady Sophronia can touch a weapon to imbue it with a measure of divine
      power. The weapon then sheds light as a torch, gains an additional +1
      enhancement bonus (to a maximum of +5), and gains the holy weapon special
      ability. These effects end if the weapon leaves the Sightless Sphinx or if
      Lady Sophronia is permanently destroyed or put to rest. While a weapon is
      infused with this power, Lady Sophronia loses the use of her divine bond
      class feature.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      Lady Sophronia persists as a ghost so long as the glabrezu Ninureset is
      alive. If Ninureset is killed or banished back to the Abyss, Lady
      Sophronia is put to rest and her soul passes on to the afterlife.
DuringCombat: >-
  Lady Sophronia casts spells to assist her allies and uses her smite evil
  ability to attack evil foes with her ghost touch longsword. Against living
  evil creatures, she uses her corrupting touch as well.
Morale: >-
  Lady Sophronia fights to defeat evil until she's destroyed, though she
  rejuvenates 2d4 days later.
Gear: >-
  +1 ghost touch full plate, +1 ghost touch longsword, silver holy symbol of
  Sarenrae
