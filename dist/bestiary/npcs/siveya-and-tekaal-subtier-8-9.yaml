BeforeCombat: >-
  If they are on alert, the two sylphs cast barkskin, call lightning, greater
  magic fang, owl's wisdom, and shillelagh, and they activate their skymaster
  ability to fly.
DuringCombat: >-
  The sylphs cast obscuring mist, which their Cloud Gazer feat lets them see
  through. Each sylph casts summon nature's ally III to summon 1d3 small air
  elementals to harass the PCs (see page 27). The s ylphs assist from behind
  cloud cover using call lightning (the bolts deal 3d10 points of damage in this
  room) or wind blasts to bull rush PCs into the hurricane. They use dispel
  magic to attempt to dispel the PCs' magical methods of flight. If they are out
  of other options or Grasping Storm commands it, they use wild shape to
  transform into Medium air elementals and fly in to attack.
Morale: >-
  The sylphs surrender if Grasping Storm dies, but otherwise fight until
  incapacitated.
