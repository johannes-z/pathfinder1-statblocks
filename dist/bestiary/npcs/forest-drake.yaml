SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acidic Cloud (Su)
    description: >-
      A forest drake can, as a standard action, spit a ball of acid that
      dissipates into a cloud on impact. This attack has a range of 60 feet and
      deals 4d4 points of acid damage to all creaturesin a 10-foot-radius
      spread. A DC 15 Reflex save halves this damage. The cloud remains for 1d4
      rounds once created, but a strong wind disperses it in a single round.
      Once a forest drake has used its acidic cloud breath, it cannot do so
      again for 1d6 rounds. The Reflex save is Constitution-based.
  - name: Aquatic Adaptation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A forest drake can breathe underwaterindefinitely and can freely use its
      breath weapon and other abilities while underwater. The acidic cloud
      created by that attack dissipates after 1 round if used underwater.
  - name: Speed Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a swift action, a forest drake may draw on its
      draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional
      move action in that round.
DuringCombat: >-
  The forest drake begins combat with its acidic cloud breath, attempting to
  catch as many opponents as it can in the cloud. Thereafter it focuses its
  attacks on any elves or gnomes present.
Morale: >-
  The forest drake is cowardly and flees back to its lair if reduced to fewer
  than 20 hit points.
