SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aversion to Daylight (Ex)
    description: >-
      Boneneedles shun all light. If exposed to natural sunlight (not merely a
      daylight spell), they take a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving
      throws, and skill checks.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      The bite of a boneneedle secretes a thick, syrupy neurotoxin that destroys
      flesh and quickly breaks down bone. The chemical reaction causes the bones
      to weaken and become brittle. If the opponent fails his save against the
      poison's secondary effect, its bones weaken, and it takes an extra 2
      points of damage from any crushing or bludgeoning attack until all
      Dexterity damage dealt by marrow poisoning is healed. Cumulative bites do
      not increase the amount of extra damage beyond 2 points An opponent
      reduced to Dexterity 0 dies as its bones become too brittle to support its
      weight thus causing its body to collapse in on itself. Creatures without
      bone structures, such as constructs (except those crafted from bone),
      oozes, and plants, are immune to the effects of marrow poisoning. Bone
      Needle Poison; Sting-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 2
      rounds; effect 1d4 Dex; secondary effect: target takes an extra 2 points
      of damage from crushing or bludgeoning attacks until all Dex damage is
      healed; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
