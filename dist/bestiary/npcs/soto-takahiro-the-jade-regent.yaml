    description: >-
      As the Jade Regent of the Minkai Empire, Takahiro has access to the vast
      wealth of a PC. This increases his CR by 1. Fiendish Facade Unlike most
      tieflings, Takahiro appears mostly human. As a result, he gains a +5
      racial bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a normal human. This feat
      appears in Pathfinder Player Companion: Blood of Fiends. Oni-Spawn
      Tiefling An oni-spawn tiefling has the following racial traits, which
      replace those for a normal tiefling: +2 Strength, +2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma;
      +2 racial bonus on Disguise and Intimidate checks; and alter self as a
      spell-like ability once per day. All other racial traits are the same as
      for a normal tiefling. Complete rules for oni-spawn tieflings can be found
      in Pathfinder Player Companion: Blood of Fiends.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Takahiro readies an action to absorb the first spell thrown his way with his
  ioun stone.
DuringCombat: >-
  At the beginning of combat, Takahiro executes a flourishing slash with
  Karusetsu before issuing a demanding challenge and charging forward to attack.
  Takahiro holds his chosen destiny ability in reserve until he needs to make a
  saving throw against a particularly powerful effect. Once his o-yoroi of
  imperial rule has absorbed 15 points of damage, he releases the stored energy
  against his foes. Takahiro uses his greater banner ability to help free his
  allies from harmful effects.
Morale: >-
  Takahiro always uses his resolve to negate critical hits against him and to
  roll twice on saving throws. He keeps at least one use in reserve to stabilize
  himself and remain conscious so he can buy himself enough time to drink a
  potion of cure serious wounds. If reduced to fewer than 60 hit points,
  Takahiro makes an honorable stand against the target of his challenge and
  fights to the death.
Gear: potions of cure serious wounds (3)
OtherGear: >-
  o-yoroi of imperial rule (+4 adamantine glamered o-yoroi*; see page 60),
  Karusetsu (+3 nodachi*; see page 60), +1 composite longbow (+5 Str) with 20
  arrows, amulet of natural armor +3, belt of physical perfection +4, cloak of
  resistance +4, lavender and green ioun stone (27 spell levels remaining), ring
  of evasion, ring of protection +3, key to secret door in area H16, gold
  bracelet (focus for Renshii Meida's sacred bond, worth 100 gp)
