Source: Risen From The Sands
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alchemy (Su)
    description: >-
      By holding a potion for 1 round, you can use Craft (alchemy) to identify
      it as if using detect magic. Extracts You can prepare a number of extracts
      each day. Extracts behave like spells in potion form, and you cast the
      spells by drinking the extract. You must refer to your formula book
      whenever you prepare an extract.
  - name: Inspiration (Ex)
    description: >-
      You begin each day with a pool of five uses of inspiration. As a free
      action, you can expend one use of inspiration to add 1d6 to the result of
      a skill check or ability check (including any you take 10 or 20 on). You
      can do this after you make the roll, but must do so before the results are
      revealed. You can only use inspiration once per roll. You can use
      inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, or Spellcraft skill check
      without spending a use of inspiration, provided you're trained in that
      skill. As an immediate action by expending two uses of inspiration, you
      can use inspiration on attack rolls and saving throws. Investigator
      Talents You have learned the following investigator talent:
  - name: Keen Recollection (Ex)
    description: You can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.
  - name: Poison Lore (Ex)
    description: >-
      If you take 1 minute to examine a poison, you can attempt a Knowledge
      (nature) check to identify any natural poison or a Knowledge (arcana)
      check to identify any magical poison (DC = the poison's save DC). Once
      identified, you can spend 1 minute to attempt a Craft (alchemy) check (DC
      = the poison's save DC) to neutralize 1 dose of the poison, rendering it
      harmless. You cannot accidentally poison yourself when applying poison to
      a weapon or when examining or attempting to neutralize a poison.
  - name: Trap Sense (Ex)
    description: >-
      You gain a +1 bonus on Reflex saving throws made to avoid traps and a +1
      dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. Trapfinding You gain a +1
      bonus on Perception skill checks made to locate traps and to Disable
      Device checks. You can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps.
