BeforeCombat: Zanedra casts barkskin, bear's endurance, shield, and stoneskin on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zanedra orders Svennarobeth into melee combat, but hangs back, casting haste
  on the first round of combat and then supporting her eidolon with ranged magic
  like hold monster, create pit, or summon monster VI (her favorite creatures to
  summon with this spell are 1d3 babaus). She steps in to heal her eidolon
  whenever it drops below 40 hit points.
Morale: >-
  Zanedra teleports to the Ivory Sanctum if reduced to fewer than 20 hit points.
  If Svennarobeth still lives, the eidolon is instantly returned to the Abyss.
  Zanedra then seeks out Jerribeth to report to her&#8211;at your discretion,
  the glabrezu may slay Zanedra and leave her mutilated body somewhere on
  display in the Ivory Sanctum for the PCs to eventually discover, or she may
  task Zanedra with seeking the PCs out and finishing the job of murdering them.
  In either case, Jerribeth reports to Xanthir Vang, who then sends a retriever
  to abduct one of the PCs' allies, as detailed on page 55.
Gear: potions of cure moderate wounds (4), scrolls of planar binding (2)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 leather armor, +1 frost hand crossbow with 20 bolts, mwk dagger, cloak of
  resistance +2, diamond dust for stoneskin worth 500 gp, silver unholy symbol
