BeforeCombat: >-
  Tunuak casts endure elements every day. Before combat, he activates his air
  barrier and wings of air revelations; drinks a potion of barkskin; and casts
  bear's endurance, cloak of winds, shield of faith, and protection from energy
  (against a type commonly used by the PCs, likely fire). Before he makes his
  pronouncement against the PCs, Tunuak casts eagle's splendor.
DuringCombat: >-
  Tunuak activates his invisibility revelation to gain greater invisibility and
  casts attack spells such as unholy blight and silence. He creates spiritual
  allies adjacent to spellcasters and multiple spiritual weapons (appearing as
  longswords, Sithhud's favored weapon). If several opponents are in a line, he
  casts river of wind against them.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to fewer than 20 hit points or if all of his minions are slain,
  Tunuak uses his invisibility revelation to flee Iqaliat entirely and harry the
  PCs' caravan on their further journeys. If confronted by the PCs before they
  venture into Tunuak's Bore, Tunuak uses his invisibility revelation or casts
  obscuring mist and flees to area K3 to set up an ambush with the hoarfrost
  spirits there.
Gear: potions of barkskin (2)
OtherGear: >-
  cloak of resistance +2, ring of mind shielding, staff of journeys*,
  cold-weather outfit, unholy symbol of Sithhud
