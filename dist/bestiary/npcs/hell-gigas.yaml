SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hurl Fireball (Su)
    description: >-
      Hell gigas charge any rocks they throw with explosive energy. Wherever a
      rock thrown by a Hell gigas lands, it explodes in a 30-foot-radius burst
      of flame that deals 1d6 points of fire damage for every 3 Hit Dice the
      gigas possesses (6d6 for most Hell gigas; Reflex DC 27 half). This is in
      addition to any damage caused by the thrown rock. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Planar Empowerment (Su)
    description: >-
      While in Hell, a Hell gigas gains access to earthquake (DC 25), firestorm
      (DC 25), and unholy aura as spell-like abilities, each usable once per
      day. If the gigas ventures onto another plane, it can't make use of these
      abilities, though its other spell-like abilities remain available. The
      save DC for the spell-like abilities is Charisma-based and includes a +5
      racial bonus.
