DuringCombat: >-
  Purpurrup is not a confident combatant-she moves frequently to avoid melee,
  and prefers to heal others rather than use her sling or spear. If cornered,
  she uses burning hands on as many enemies as possible.
Morale: >-
  Purpurrup's recent loss has her shaken. If reduced to 3 hp or fewer, she flees
  combat, hides, and heals herself.
Gear: >-
  scroll of bless, scroll of protection from evil, wand of cure light wounds (20
  charges)
OtherGear: sling with 20 bullets, spear, familiar satchelUE, 12 gp
