BeforeCombat: Same as Bahor's tactics.
DuringCombat: >-
  When appearing as Glorio (or in any human guise, for that matter), Bahor
  prefers to avoid combat if at all possible, since his human form lacks some of
  his true form's key defenses (particularly damage reduction and spell
  resistance). If he must fight, he does so with his kukri, relying on allies to
  flank foes as possible. Against foes he feels confident he can defeat quickly,
  or who already know his secret, he reverts to his true form as soon as
  possible.
Morale: >-
  If faced with a combat not to his advantage, yet in a situation where he does
  not wish to reveal his true shape, Glorio flees at once, using invisibility if
  able. He hopes to return to Arkona Palace. If confronted there, he has
  additional allies upon whom he can rely.

  scroll of sending (3), wand of haste (19 charges), wand of illusory script (12
  charges), wand of shield (23 charges)
