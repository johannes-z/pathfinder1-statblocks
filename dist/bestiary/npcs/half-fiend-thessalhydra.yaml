  The thessalhydras cast unholy aura on themselves in the first round of combat
  (this spell's effects are calculated into the stat blocks already), then cast
  summon monster IX on the second round to each summon 1d3 hezrous. On the third
  round, they move into position to hit as many PCs as possible with their
  breath weapons, after which they fight in melee.
