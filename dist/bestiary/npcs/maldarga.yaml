SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Command Ghouls (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, Maldarga can automatically command all normal ghouls
      within 30 feet (as per the command undead spell). Normal ghouls never
      attack a dread ghoul unless compelled.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature killed by Maldarga that lies undisturbed until the next
      midnight rises as a dread ghoul at that time. The new dread ghoul is not
      under Maldarga's control. A protection from evil or gentle repose spell
      cast on the victim's corpse prevents this.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  When intruders enter, Maldarga immediately bellows for any ghouls in area D1
  to assist her, then kicks aside the rough bridge her workers use. Ghouls
  arrive at a rate of 2d4 per round, and while the weak undead likely offer no
  challenge for the adventurers, Maldarga hopes to stymie the PCs' advance 
  while she unleashes a hail of arrows. If anyone crosses the gap, she smears
  her oil of darkness on herself and switches to melee combat. She always
  attacks using Deadly Aim or Power Attack.
Morale: >-
  If reduced below half hit points, Maldarga withdraws to join Nul Kraz in area
  D6.
Gear: oils of darkness (2)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 composite longbow, with 20 arrows, amulet of natural armor +2, ring of
  protection +2
