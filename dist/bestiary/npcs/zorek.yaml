SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ability Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a divine guardian, Zorek heals 1 point of ability damage per round in
      each damaged ability score.
  - name: Blessed Life (Ex)
    description: >-
      Zorek does not age or breathe, and he doesn't need to eat, drink, or
      sleep.
  - name: Bound to the Faith (Ex)
    description: >-
      A worshiper of Gorum with the Command Undead or Turn Undead feat can use
      the effects of these feats on Zorek as if he were an undead creature.
      Zorek suffers a -4 penalty on his Will save to negate the effect.
  - name: Sacred Site (Ex)
    description: >-
      Zorek is bound to guard Armag's Tomb by Gorum himself, and he cannot leave
      the tomb complex. Should Zorek ever leave the tomb, he immediately takes
      6d6 points of Constitution drain as the years of lost food, drink, and
      sleep return tenfold.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Zorek casts magic vestment and greater magic weapon daily. His status as
  divine guardian allows him to track the PCs' movements through the tomb, and
  as they approach this chamber, he casts the following spells in this order:
  freedom of movement, air walk, bear's endurance, bull's strength, shield of
  faith, righteous might, and divine favor.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zorek's first acts in combat are to cast antilife shell and to moves to the
  top of the stairs leading down to area D12. He then uses his ranged spells to
  soften up the PCs for 4 rounds (favoring blade barrier, his flame strikes, and
  chaos hammer) before negating his antilife shell by stepping up to engage the
  PCs in melee. Zorek casts heal on himself whenever he drops below 60 hit
  points.
Morale: >-
  Zorek fights to the death-if he's slain by mortals, he is granted the true
  freedom of death as certainly as if his charge to guard the tomb had been
  completed (although Zorek doesn't realize this).
