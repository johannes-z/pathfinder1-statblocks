BeforeCombat: >-
  As soon as the stone blocks between areas B8 and B9 begin to descend,
  Keshenepek casts hallucinatory terrain to fill the chamber with illusory plant
  growth.   He then hides, readying to strike with his poisoned spear at the
  first intruder who approaches either the control pyramid or the scrivener's
  pillar.
DuringCombat: >-
  Keshenepek gleefully engages the first opponent within reach, but prefers
  combat with martial adversaries if he spots them. After the bulk of the party
  has joined the battle, he alternates between using his boiling ability sea and
  melee strikes for the rest of the combat&#8211; unless he needs to use deeper
  darkness to catch a breather or reposition himself.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, Keshenepek attempts to flee the chamber
  and then cast control water to lower the water directly beneath the tunnels
  back to area B8 by 24 feet. If he succeeds, the party will require another
  means to exit the chamber other than swimming. Once he reaches area B8,
  Keshenepek attempts to summon a pairaka, ordering it to delay the PCs. He then
  retreats to area B1 and allies with any mud elementals that remain. Keshenepek
  makes his last stand as the PCs exit the Water Crypt, fighting to the death.
Gear: >-
  +2 keen spear, belt of physical perfection +2, bracers of armor +1, hand of
  glory, ring of evasion, gold jewelry (worth 900 gp)
