BeforeCombat: >-
  If she knows she'll be in a fight soon, Kogra casts bull's strength, eagle's
  splendor, and shield of faith, and uses her wand of owl's wisdom on herself.
  She uses her wand of undetectable alignment for more diplomatic encounters,
  bluffing foes into believing that she's a prisoner or victim until she can
  gain the element of surprise and obliterate unwary opponents.
DuringCombat: >-
  Kogra lets her undead minions do most of the work, but if pressed, she casts
  offensive spells to keep enemies at bay, fighting in melee as a last resort.
Morale: >-
  Kogra's false fealty for Gurstweld isn't something she's willing to die for.
  If reduced to fewer than 40 hit points, she casts word of recall to return to
  Alkenstar.
Gear: >-
  scroll of breath of life, wand of owl's wisdom (14 charges), wand of
  undetectable alignment (16 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +3 full plate, +1 longspear, amulet of natural armor +2, belt of incredible
  dexterity +2, cloak of resistance +2, stability skull (as stable metamagic
  rod), 5 onyx gems (worth 200 gp each), powdered diamond (worth 200 gp), 20 gp
