BeforeCombat: >-
  Unless under immediate threat, Captain Raim takes his time to study and parley
  with opponents. However, he rarely gives enemy divine casters a chance to
  escape.
DuringCombat: >-
  Captain Raim concentrates his attacks on divine casters. Once he defeats them,
  he offers a truce to any surviving foes. He often pretends to be a dumb brute
  to mislead opponents.
Morale: >-
  Knowing that if killed he does not have the luxury of a divine resurrection,
  Captain Raim surrenders and lives rather than fighting to the death, though it
  galls him greatly to be humbled by a religious opponent.
Gear: >-
  half-plate, heavy steel shield, +1 longsword with godslayer blessing, dagger,
  longbow with 20 arrows, 63 gp
