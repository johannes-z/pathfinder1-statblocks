SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Curse of Melancholy (Su)
    description: >-
      Grenseldek is afflicted with the curse of melancholy, giving her a -2
      penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and
      weapon damage rolls.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Grenseldek focuses her attacks on human opponents if possible (to take
  advantage of her favored enemy bonus), wielding her twin handaxes with
  murderous effect. If able to easily hit her opponent, she makes Power Attacks.
  Once Grenseldek chooses a foe, she gives no quarter, switching to another
  target only after the first is rendered unconscious or dead.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, Grenseldek attempts to flee. If no
  escape route is available, she instead offers information in exchange for her
  freedom (see Development on page 56).
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds
OtherGear: >-
  +1 scale mail, +2 handaxe, mwk handaxe, mwk composite longbow (+9 Str) with 20
  arrows
