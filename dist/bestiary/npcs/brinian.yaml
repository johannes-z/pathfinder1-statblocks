BeforeCombat: >-
  Brinian ordinarily calls out his opponent to set up a fair fight, preferring
  to duel until first blood is drawn, though he is willing to duel until one
  participant lands three hits. He only ambushes opponents in dire circumstances
  or if he can be convinced that the indignity is absolutely necessary.
DuringCombat: >-
  Outside of a duel, Brinian enjoys closing with spellcasters to make use of his
  Disruptive feat. Otherwise he attacks the most powerful melee opponent and
  attempts to shame his enemies into fighting him one-on-one, using vulgar
  comments, slights against his foe's appearance, skill, favorite foods,
  liaisons with sisters and mothers, and anything else he can determine about
  his opponent.
Morale: >-
  Brinian's air of bravado is quite sincere and doesn't crack until he reaches 5
  hit points or fewer, at which point he flees. If humbled in this fashion, he
  remembers the face of the one responsible and plots revenge.
Gear: elixir of tumbling (2), potions of cure light wounds (6)
