SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Detect Thoughts (Su)
    description: >-
      Iksha can detect thoughts as the spell of the same name (CL 18th). He can
      suppress or resume this ability as a free action. When Iksha uses this
      ability, it always functions as if he had spent 3 rounds concentrating and
      thus he gains the maximum amount of information possible. A creature can
      resist this effect with a successful DC 22 Will save. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. Hunger Oracle's
  - name: Curse (Ex)
    description: >-
      Iksha gains none of the benefits from spells or magic items that provide
      nourishment, such as goodberry, heroes' feast, or a ring of sustenance. He
      begins each combat with the sickened condition until he deals damage with
      his bite attack. His bite attacks gain the grab extraordinary ability, as
      the universal monster rule, against any creatures smaller than he is. (The
      hunger oracle's curse appears on page 17 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting:
      Inner Sea Monster Codex.) Speaker of the Void Iksha loses his racial
      sorcerer spellcasting and instead treats his innate sorcerer levels as
      oracle levels.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Iksha casts freedom of movement on himself and greater magic weapon on his
  falchion. He uses his lesser extend metamagic rod to cast bear's endurance and
  bull's strength.
DuringCombat: >-
  Iksha begins each combat with the sickened condition, which is not reflected
  in his statistics above. If Iksha has the opportunity, he casts divine power
  and quickened shield of faith on himself at the start of combat. He then casts
  quickened protection from good and makes a full attack against any foe in
  melee range, using his bite attack first to remove the sickened condition
  caused by his oracle curse. If Iksha is caught off guard, he instead attacks
  the most dangerous foe with harm followed by quickened inflict light wounds.
Morale: Iksha casts plane shift to escape if reduced below 30 hit points.
