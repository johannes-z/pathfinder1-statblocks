DuringCombat: >-
  Tsskath uses his frightful moan and corrupting gaze in an attempt to scare
  away intruders. If this does not work, he resorts to his spells, casting mind
  fog and crushing despair to weaken his foes' minds before using his long limbs
  to make corrupting touches.
Morale: >-
  Tsskath fights until destroyed, but rejuvenates 2d4 days later. The only way
  he can be put to rest permanently is to awaken the hibernating serpentfolk
  here.
