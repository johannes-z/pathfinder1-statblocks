DuringCombat: >-
  Halid remains floating above his corpse and focuses his corrupting gaze on an
  opponent each round. If the PCs engage him in melee, he uses Combat Expertise
  to increase his Armor Class and lashes out with his corrupting touch.
Morale: >-
  Halid fights until destroyed. If he is shown the amulet he gave Belina and
  told she does not return his undeclared love, he is dazed for 1 round. If
  Halid is destroyed while the amulet is in his line of sight, he is destroyed
  permanently.
