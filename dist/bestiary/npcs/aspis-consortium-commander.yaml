SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ambush Trap (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Aspis Consortium commander can specially rig a mechanical trap he has
      either crafted or bypassed by exceeding its Disable Device DC by 10. This
      trap can then be triggered by the Aspis Consortium commander as a move
      action as long as he is adjacent to the trap. He adds his trap sense bonus
      (+5) to the trap's Perception DC and the trap's attack rolls, and adds his
      sneak attack damage (+6d6) to the trap's damage if the target is
      flat-footed or otherwise denied its Dexterity bonus to AC.
  - name: Mask Alignment (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, the Aspis Consortium commander can alter his
      alignment aura to deceive effects that detect alignment. He may choose to
      be detected as any specific alignment of his choice or as no alignment.
      This affects only alignment detection, not effects that cause harm or that
      are otherwise based on alignment. This effect lasts until the Aspis
      Consortium commander dismisses it or until he changes his alignment aura
      again.
  - name: Shrunken Smuggle (Sp)
    description: >-
      The Aspis Consortium commander can use shrink item once per day as a
      4th-level caster. While an item is shrunk in this way, it is also affected
      as nondetection. This effect ends when the item returns to its proper
      size.
