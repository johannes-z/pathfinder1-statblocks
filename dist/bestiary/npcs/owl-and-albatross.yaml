DuringCombat: >-
  The gathlains cast entangle and other ranged spells. They try to avoid melee
  combat except to jab at hampered targets. They are not especially malicious,
  and they would rather harass and chase off foes than purposefully kill them.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 4 hp or fewer, a gathlain surrenders. The other surrenders 1
  round later, and the two begin blaming each other for starting the fight.
Gear: >-
  wand of ventriloquism (25 charges, albatross only), wand of identify (25
  charges, owl only), potion of cure light wounds
OtherGear: javelins (3), mwk spear, fishing pole
