SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ib of the Pharaoh (Su)
    description: >-
      The Forgotten Pharaoh is possessed by Hakotep's ib, and gains several
      unique abilities as a result. Hakotep's consciousness has overwhelmed
      Serethet's innate mental faculties, in effect transposing her Wisdom and
      Charisma scores, and though she has lost all of her cleric spells and
      class features, the Forgotten Pharaoh now casts spells as a 14th-level
      sorcerer and gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat. In addition, the
      force of Hakotep's will grants the Forgotten Pharaoh a deflection bonus to
      her Armor Class equal to her Charisma modifier. As leader of the Cult of
      the Forgotten Pharaoh, she also has access to greater resources
      (equivalent to PC wealth).
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  The Forgotten Pharaoh casts false life and mage armor every day. When alerted
  to the approach of intruders, she casts fly, greater heroism, shield, and
  stoneskin.
DuringCombat: >-
  The Forgotten Pharaoh casts mirror image on the first round of combat, then
  casts haste from her wand on her cultist guards. She continues with her most
  devastating spells, including dominate person cast on the strongest-looking
  warrior among her opponents, prismatic spray, chain lightning, and cone of
  cold. If an enemy spellcaster starts to cast a spell, she uses the falcon
  crown to fire a ray and attempt to interrupt the spell. In melee, the
  Forgotten Pharaoh uses her armband of the golden serpent to cast touch spells
  such as vampiric touch or ghoul touch.
Morale: >-
  The Forgotten Pharaoh fights to the death to recover the piece of Hakotep's
  soul contained in the Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh.
Gear: potions of cure serious wounds (2), wand of haste (20 charges)
