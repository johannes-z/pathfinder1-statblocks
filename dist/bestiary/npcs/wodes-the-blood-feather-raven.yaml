BeforeCombat: Wodes casts barkskin, cat's grace, and magic fang before entering combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Wodes casts summon nature's ally III on the first round combat to summon 1d3
  Small air elementals and orders the raven swarm to attack intruders. Wodes
  then casts produce flame to attack opponents.
Morale: >-
  Wodes has no great loyalty to the Frozen Shadows, but he is absolutely loyal
  to Goti and will not abandon Ravenscraeg as long as the sorcerer lives. If
  hard pressed, however, he retreats to area C22, circling around to enter the
  hall by other means and ambush the PCs later.
