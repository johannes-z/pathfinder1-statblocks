SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When a dark stalker is slain, its body implodes violently into
      nothingness, leaving its gear in a heap on the ground. All creatures
      within a 10-foot burst take 1d8 points of sonic damage and must succeed at
      a DC 14 Fortitude save or be deafened for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Soul Harvest (Su)
    description: >-
      When a dark slayer damages a flat-footed foe or a foe it is flanking with
      a melee touch spell or spell like ability that deals hit point damage, the
      spell does an additional 1d6 points of damage and the dark slayer gains an
      equal number of temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for
      a maximum of 1 hour.
Bloodline: undead
BeforeCombat: >-
  The dark slayer is in a deep, trancelike meditative state and most likely
  unaware of the PCs' approach. Should it manage to hear the PCs before the
  encounter begins, it draws its wand and kukri.
DuringCombat: >-
  The dark slayer attempts to sneak attack the PCs with ranged touch and melee
  touch spells, taking full advantage of its soul harvest ability. Should the
  PCs attempt to neutralize the deeper darkness effect in the shrine, the dark
  slayer uses its wand of dispel magic to negate the PCs' spells or effects.
Morale: The dark slayer defends its unholy shrine to the death.
Gear: >-
  black smear (2 doses), scroll of deeper darkness, scroll of mage armor, wand
  of dispel magic (CL 11th, 6 charges)
OtherGear: +1 kukri, 322 gp
