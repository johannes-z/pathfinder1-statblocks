    description: >-
      A serpentstone sentinel can use its breath weapon once every 1d4+1 rounds
      to create a 60-foot cone of green gas. Those caught in the area of the gas
      can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save to resist the effects, but those who
      fail the save are immediately petrified. This petrification is
      temporary-each round, a petrified creature can attempt a new DC 20
      Fortitude save to recover from the petrification as long as it is not
      caught within the area of effect of the golem's breath weapon a second
      time while petrified. A creature exposed to the golem's breath a second
      time while already petrified becomes permanently petrified, and can no
      longer attempt to make additional Fortitude saves to recover naturally.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  Upon activation, the sentinel attacks anyone present in the courtyard,
  petrifying opponents with its breath weapon. The sentinel is confined to this
  area and does not pursue anyone beyond the gates or farther into the fortress.
Morale: The sentinel fights until destroyed or commanded to stop.
