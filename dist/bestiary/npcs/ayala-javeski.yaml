Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: Ayala uses her 2 vials of bloodroot to poison her bladed scarf and one arrow.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ayala starts combat by making a sneak attack with her bow if she wins
  initiative; otherwise, she works with her donkey rats to flank foes. If both
  donkey rats are slain, she retreats up into the Crow, using tanglefoot bags to
  slow pursuit. If she can't find other Tower Girls to aid her, she picks a
  hiding spot and waits to ambush the PCs, continuing this cat-and-mouse game as
  best she can while trusting her damage reduction to keep her from becoming too
  wounded.
Morale: >-
  If reduced below 5 hit points, Ayala flees to a safe hiding place, assumes
  dire rat form, and then flees back to Magnimar. She harbors a grudge&#8211;at
  this point, she'll swallow her pride and seek out new allies among another
  Sczarni gang. Eventually, she'll organize revenge against the PCs, perhaps
  ambushing them with a new gang of recently infected wererats at a later date.
Gear: bloodroot (2), tanglefoot bags (3)

  masterwork studded leather, +1 bladed scarf, masterwork composite shortbow
  with 20 arrows, climber's kit, grappling hook with 50-foot silk rope,
