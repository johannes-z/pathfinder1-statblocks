SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Lasting Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      A rogue with this talent can apply poison to a weapon in such a way that
      it is effective for two successful attacks instead of one. The poison has
      a reduced effect, however, and saves made against the poison receive a +2
      circumstance bonus. Applying poison in this way requires a full-round
      action, or a standard action if the rogue has the swift poison talent.
  - name: Master Poisoner (Ex)
    description: >-
      A poisoner can use Craft (alchemy) to change the type of a poison. Doing
      so requires 1 hour of work with an alchemist's lab and a Craft (alchemy)
      skill check with a DC equal to the poison's DC. If successful, the
      poison's type changes to contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury. If the
      check fails, the poison is ruined. The poisoner also receives a bonus on
      Craft (alchemy) skill checks when working with poison equal to 1/2 her
      rogue level. This ability replaces trap sense.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Large scorpion poison-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6
      rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The assassins stealthily approach behind opponents, attempting to poison them
  with darts before entering melee.
DuringCombat: >-
  The assassins attempts to maneuver into flanking positions, using Acrobatics
  checks to navigate around the furniture.
Morale: >-
  If an assassin's allies fall and she drops to fewer than 7 hit points, the
  assassin attempts to flee. If caught, the captured assassin attempts to kill
  herself before she can be forced to talk.
