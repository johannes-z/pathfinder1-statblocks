SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Freeze (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gargoyle can hold itself so still it appears to be a statue. A gargoyle
      that uses freeze can take 20 on Stealth checks to hide in plain sight as a
      stone statue.
BeforeCombat: >-
  The gargoyle uses its freeze special ability to blend in with the fountain's
  statuary. If the PCs repeat the phrase above, the gargoyle guardian remains
  motionless and ignores the PCs' presence within Ostergarde.
DuringCombat: >-
  The gargoyle attempts to get in a position to attack as many targets in a
  single round as possible, but uses the room's two-story layout to its
  advantage if the PCs are spread out in such a way that hit-and-run tactics
  work more in the guardian's favor.
Morale: >-
  The gargoyle fights until reduced below 20 hit points, at which time it flees
  Ostergarde, only to return when the geas effect forces it back. If at any time
  the PCs speak the phrase above, the gargoyle guardian immediately surrenders
  and retakes its position at the fountain. The gargoyle does not attack any
  creature that has previously spoken the pass phrase.
