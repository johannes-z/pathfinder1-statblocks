DuringCombat: >-
  Oriana prefers to fight side-by-side or back-toback with allies or those she
  commands so as to prevent foes from flanking her, but does not shirk from
  battle when she must fight on her own. She uses Power Attack against foes at
  the start of combat, but switches to Combat Expertise whenever she's reduced
  below 55 hit points. She uses Improved Disarm on foes with her second attack
  in a round unless the foe appears to be heavily wounded or isn't wielding a
  dangerous weapon.
Morale: >-
  Oriana is no coward, and as long as those she commands or allies with still
  live, she'll fight to the death. On her own, she flees (or surrenders, if
  flight is impossible) once reduced to fewer than 15 hit points.
