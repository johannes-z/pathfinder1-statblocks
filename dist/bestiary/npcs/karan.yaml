  Karan casts mage armor on himself and uses his spider climb spell-like ability
  to move 15 feet up the wall.
DuringCombat: >-
  Karan uses burning hands and color spray if he can catch multiple targets in a
  cone; otherwise, he first casts flaming sphere and moves it around the
  battlefield, supplementing it with his wand of magic missile or ray of
  enfeeblement spells. If a PC succeeds in damaging him with a cold iron or good
  weapon, Karan focuses his attacks on that character. If Parveen has empowered
  him, Karan opens combat with his spiritual weapon spell-like ability.

  fights until slain.
