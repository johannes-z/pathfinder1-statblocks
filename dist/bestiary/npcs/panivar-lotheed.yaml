SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cloaked from Death (Su)
    description: >-
      Panivar has struck a deal that cloaks him from the awareness of
      psychopomps and death itself. Even those psychopomps he summons lose all
      memory of him upon returning to the Boneyard. This ability grants Panivar
      the mental ability score bonuses from his advanced age but none of the
      physical penalties. If reduced below 0 hit points, Panivar falls prone and
      is paralyzed, but he cannot die, regardless of the state of his remains,
      and he continues to heal naturally over time.
Gender: Male
ProhibitedSchools: enchantment, illusion
BeforeCombat: >-
  Panivar maintains a constant bodyguard with his summoner's charm ability to
  keep a powerful outsider-normally a morrigna psychopomp-bound to him. He also
  maintains mage armor and mind blank spells  each day. If he expects a fight,
  he also casts false life, fly, protection from energy (fire), see
  invisibility, and shield.
DuringCombat: >-
  Panivar begins by casting time stop, using the extra time to cast prismatic
  wall and wall of lava opposite each other, and then using any remaining time
  to cast clenched fist, crushing hand, and wall of force to protect himself. He
  directs his hands to bull rush opponents into either wall. When undefended by
  his wall of force, Panivar targets opponents with restricting spells such as
  acid pit, black tentacles, and forcecage before casting cloudkill from his
  staff, relying on his conjured morrigna to heal him.
Morale: >-
  Panivar's immortality has bred overconfidence, and he won't retreat from a
  battle.
Gear: scroll of fly, staff of conjuration
OtherGear: >-
  +1 dagger, amulet of natural armor +3, belt of mighty constitution +6, cloak
  of resistance +5, headband of vast intelligence +6, ring of the recalled soul,
  ring of protection +4, Lotheed family signet ring
