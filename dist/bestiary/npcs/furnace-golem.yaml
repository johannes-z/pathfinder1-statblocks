  - name: Furnace Interior (Ex)
    description: >-
      A furnace golem can try to shove a grabbed opponent up to two sizes
      smaller than itself into its interior by making a successful grapple
      check. An opponent thrown into the furnace golem's interior is trapped as
      a metal grating closes over the opening in the same round. A trapped
      creature automatically takes 2d6 points of fire damage each round.
      Escaping the creature's interior requires a successful DC 30 Strength
      check to bend the bars. Alternatively, a trapped creature can escape by
      dealing at least 25 points of damage to the bars (AC 22; the golem's
      damage reduction applies to attacks against the bars as well). A Huge
      furnace golem's interior can hold two Medium, eight Small, or 16 Tiny or
      smaller creatures.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A furnace golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow
      spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against
      it, as noted below. &#8226; A magical attack that bypasses a furnace
      golem's cold resistance slows it (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no
      saving throw. &#8226; A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any
      slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of
      damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would
      cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess
      as temporary hit points.
