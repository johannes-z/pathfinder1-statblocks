BeforeCombat: >-
  The entothropes spend most of their time in their hybrid forms these days,
  training and communing with their primitive insect instincts. If alerted to
  intruders, they fly to the tops of the room's pillars and study newcomers for
  3 rounds so they can attempt to use their death attacks.
DuringCombat: >-
  The entothropes spit poison whenever possible, but otherwise try and overwhelm
  one or two targets at a time, preferring divine spellcasters.
Morale: The entothropes fight to the death.
