SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alchemically Quickened (Ex)
    description: >-
      Vashian's speed increases by 10 feet, and each round in which he moves at
      least 10 feet, he gains the effects of a blur spell until the start of his
      next round. Feats Vashian's Desperate Battle feat grants him a +1 morale
      bonus on attack and damage rolls when he is more than 10 feet from an ally
      and not benefiting from the aid another action.
  - name: Prayer Attack (Su)
    description: >-
      To initiate a prayer attack, a Red Mantis assassin holds her sawtooth
      sabre (or sabres) out, point down, and weaves the blade in the air. She
      must be within 30 feet of and visible to her victim. Beginning a prayer
      attack is a standard action, and causes her victim to be fascinated by her
      unless he makes a Will save. She can maintain this effect by
      concentrating. The victim may attempt a new save to escape the fascination
      each time a threat (other than the fascinating assassin) appears. At any
      point after 3 rounds, she may make a coup de grace attack against the
      target, provided the target is still fascinated. Activating or
      concentrating on maintaining a prayer attack does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity.
  - name: Red Shroud (Su)
    description: >-
      A Red Mantis assassin can create a veil of red mist as a move-equivalent
      action. The red shroud persists for 1 round per class level. It grants a
      +1 dodge bonus to AC and fast healing equal to the assassin's Constitution
      bonus. This mist cannot be dissipated by wind. If she is slain while this
      ability is active, she can choose whether to remain corporeal or to
      disintegrate into a cloud of red mist that leaves behind only her gear in
      order to deprive her enemies of access to her remains.
  - name: Summon Mantis (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Vashian can summon an advanced fiendish giant mantis, 1d3
      fiendish giant mantises, or 1d4+1 giant mantises as if using summon
      monster V. He can mentally direct the actions of these summoned vermin as
      a free action. All mantises summoned by this spell-like ability are blood
      red, and gain no racial bonus on Stealth checks in forests.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Vashian casts bull's strength, cat's grace, and expeditious retreat, all of
  which have been factored into his statistics. He also casts invisibility.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vashian hides with invisibility and then uses his fast stealth rogue talent to
  sneak up on an unaware opponent and score a sneak attack with his sawtooth
  sabre. He then uses Spring Attack and his considerable movement speed to
  distance himself from the PCs during the same round, preferably around a
  corner. He repeats this tactic as often as he can get away with it. He might
  cast ventriloquism to duplicate his villainous laughter in an area away from
  him to divert the PCs' search. He knows the college's layout and takes
  advantage of the secret door in area 3 and ladder in area 5 to attack from
  unsuspected directions.
Morale: >-
  Unable to conceive of his defeat, Vashian ultimately fights to the death,
  whereupon he disintegrates his body into a cloud of red mist if his red shroud
  ability is active.
Gear: >-
  +1 mithral shirt, +1 sawtooth sabre, dagger, amulet of natural armor +1, cloak
  of resistance +2, mask of the mantis*, ring of protection +1, cipher stone
