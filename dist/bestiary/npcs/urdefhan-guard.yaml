SQ: armor training 1, daemonic pact (DC 17)
Source: AP 41
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Daemonic Pact (Su)
    description: >-
      Urdefhans are infused with daemonic energy; as an immediate action, an
      urdefhan can attempt to allow this energy to consume its soul (50% chance
      of success per attempt). If it succeeds, the urdefhan dies and releases a
      5-foot-radius burst of negative energy that deals 2d6 points of damage (DC
      17 Reflex half). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Negative Energy Affinity (Ex)
    description: >-
      An urdefhan is alive, but it reacts to positive and negative energy as if
      it were undead- positive energy harms it, while negative energy heals it.
  - name: Strength Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      An urdefhan's bite drains vitality, turning the skin and muscle around the
      wound transparent and causing 2 points of Strength damage unless the
      target succeeds on a DC 17 Fortitude save. The flesh remains transparent
      until the Strength damage is healed, but this does not have any other
      effects. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The urdefhans fire arrows at enemies while the skavelings make flyby attacks.
  If knocked from their mounts, the urdefhans draw their rhoka swords and
  attack.
Morale: >-
  The urdefhans pursue intruders for as long as they can see them. If three
  guards are slain, the fourth immediately retreats, flying to area F1 to inform
  the other urdefhans of the patrol's fate.
Gear: +1 arrows (10), potion of inflict serious wounds
OtherGear: >-
  +1 scale mail, masterwork composite longbow (+5 Str) with 10 arrows,
  masterwork rhoka sword
