  Xicorax casts blur and attempts to summon another air mephit. He stays near
  Morton, using his breath weapon and claws against any attackers. The open air
  and decks of both the Dryad's Grave and the PCs' ship counts as gusty areas
  for the purposes of Xicorax's fast healing.
Morale: >-
  Xicorax flees back to the Dryad's Grave if reduced to fewer than 15 hit
  points. If Morton is slain, Xicorax flies into the sky, never to return.
