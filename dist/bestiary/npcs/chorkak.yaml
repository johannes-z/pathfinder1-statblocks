SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures with fewer than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius of the lich that look
      at him must succeed on a Will save or become frightened. Creatures with 5
      HD or more must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for a number of rounds
      equal to the lich's Hit Dice. A creature that successfully saves cannot be
      affected again by the same lich's aura for 24 hours. This is a
      mind-affecting fear effect.
  - name: Paralyzing Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      Any living creature a lich hits with its touch attack must succeed on a
      Fortitude save or be permanently paralyzed. Remove paralysis or any spell
      that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the bestow curse spell
      description, with a DC equal to the lich's save DC). The effect cannot be
      dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a lich seems dead, though a DC 20
      Perception check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals that the victim is still
      alive.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  If alerted to the PCs' attack on his cultists in area Z1 or the creatures in
  Z2, Chorkak casts blade barrier on the entrance to his chamber to provide
  himself additional time to buff. He augments himself and Garugu with as many
  of the following as possible, in the following order: antilife shell,
  righteous might, shield of faith, divine power, and true seeing. He then
  summons a fiendish dire ape with summon monster IV and three additional apes
  with summon nature's ally IV on the far side of the wall of blades, using
  speak with animals to direct them to drop from the ceiling onto foes below,
  and readies to cast harm on the first PC to bypass the blade barrier.
DuringCombat: >-
  Chorkak prefers to use magic against his enemies, casting such spells as
  bestow curse, chaos hammer, harm, slay living, and unholy blight, but does not
  hesitate to engage in melee should PCs penetrate or dispel his antilife
  sphere. He uses his +1 unholy spear if granted a full attack or his paralyzing
  touch if restricted to a single attack action. He heals himself with negative
  energy as needed.
Morale: >-
  Chorkak knows his phylactery is safe and does not fear destruction. He fights
  to the death.
Gear: >-
  +2 scale mail, +1 unholy spear, belt of giant strength +4, headband of mental
  prowess + 2 (Cha/Wis)
