DuringCombat: >-
  Once combat begins, the hidden skulks move along the walls of the room and
  attempt to take up positions where they can move as pairs to flank foes. They
  continue to fight two-on-one as long as possible to maximize their sneak
  attacks. They prefer to fight foes who do not possess silver weapons, breaking
  off combat with those who use such weapons to seek easier prey if possible.
Morale: >-
  The vampire skulks fight until reduced to 0 hit points, at which point they
  turn gaseous and drift toward the balcony to the northwest. Once there, they
  seep through cracks in the wall into a room under the balcony in which their
  coffins (actually nothing more than narrow niches in the floor) wait for them
  to rest and recover.
Gear: +1 vicious dagger, +1 composite shortbow with 20 arrows, ring of protection +1
