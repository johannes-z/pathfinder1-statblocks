Source: AP 38
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Serpent Companion (Ex)
    description: >-
      Raogru has a constrictor snake animal companion from the Scalykind domain.
      His effective druid level for this companion is his cleric level -2.
  - name: Venomous Stare (Sp)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Raogru can activate a gaze attack with a 30-foot
      range (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 300). This is an active gaze attack that
      can target a single creature within range. The target must make a DC 16
      Will save. Those who fail take 1d6+3 points of nonlethal damage and are
      fascinated until the beginning of Raogru's next turn. This is a
      mind-affecting effect.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  If he hears the sounds of fighting in the temple proper, Raogru prepares for
  combat by casting magic stone, bear's endurance, protection from energy
  (fire), and divine favor on himself, and magic fang on Chu-tok.
DuringCombat: >-
  Raogru uses his venomous stare on opponents, then orders Chu-tok to attack
  while he casts spells and throws rocks, keeping Chu-tok between him and his
  enemies. If forced into melee combat, Raogru goes into a shrieking frenzy and
  attacks with his mace and bite.
Morale: Raogru fights to the death.
