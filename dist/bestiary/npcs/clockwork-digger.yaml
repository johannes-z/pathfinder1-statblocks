    description: >-
      A clockwork digger is outfitted with a drill arm that it can use to bore
      through solid rock. A clockwork digger's drill attack ignores half the
      hardness of stone objects. When equipped with a pale blue rhomboid ioun
      stone, a clockwork digger can spend 1 hour drilling and chiseling at a
      stone surface to clear a 5-foot-by- 5-foot area, allowing it to create
      tunnels or passages other creatures can pass through. This ability
      replaces a clockwork servant's net and repair clockwork abilities.
