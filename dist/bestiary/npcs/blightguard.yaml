SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Chimeric Anatomy (Ex)
    description: >-
      A blightguard gains the weaknesses of both its component fey
      types-quickling and redcap. If subject to a slow spell or effect, a
      blightguard loses access to its quickling speed ability and its fast
      healing, and is sickened for the effect's duration. If it fails a save for
      the redcap irreligious weakness, it loses access to its quickling speed in
      addition to gaining the frightened condition.
  - name: Quickling Speed (Su)
    description: >-
      Thanks to its quickling components, a blightguard moves with unnatural
      speed and grace that makes it difficult to target, increasing its base
      speed by 20 feet. Any time a blightguard moves at least 10 feet in a
      round, it gains concealment (20% miss chance) until the beginning of its
      next turn. This ability also grants the blightguard evasion (as per the
      rogue ability).
BeforeCombat: >-
  Blightguards neither sleep nor eat, standing guard at their posts until
  dispatched to a new duty.
DuringCombat: >-
  In combat, blightguards prefer to remain mobile, relying on their unnatural
  speed and oversized weapons to whittle away at foes.
Morale: Blightguards fight until slain.
