  Ouidda drinks her potion of invisibility when she hears someone approach the
  door.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ouidda attempts to turn the PCs against one another and win allies through her
  mastery of compulsions. She tries to avoid melee at all costs, preferring to
  use charmed foes as blockers between herself and her attackers.
Morale: >-
  Ouidda is not stupid and knows when she's beaten. She can exact revenge on the
  PCs if she can simply get away, which she attempts to do if reduced to fewer
  than half her total hit points.
