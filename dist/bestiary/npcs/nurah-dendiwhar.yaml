BeforeCombat: >-
  Nurah casts undetectable alignment on herself every day, and maintains a magic
  aura spell on her four vials of shadowblood at all times (this generally means
  she's casting one magic aura spell every other day).
Morale: >-
  During Combat Nurah has little in the way of fighting prowess and prefers to
  hang back in combat to provide support in the form of bardic performances. She
  casts cat's grace on herself on the first round of combat, and then harries
  foes with grease or suggestion, switching to healing spells if her allies are
  wounded. While under cover, she has no qualms about doing her best to support
  the PCs against demonic foes&#8211;demons are easily replaced, after all. If
  her cover is blown, she immediately tries to flee as detailed under  below.
  When facing the PCs in a battle (which she might do later, if she flees to
  Drezen to join with Staunton), she uses bardic performances to aid her allies
  and casts displacement on herself, then uses suggestion on any NPC allies to
  make them believe the PCs have been possessed by demons while using her
  Spellsong feat to mask the fact that she's casting spells at all.   Nurah
  retreats from combat once she drops below 30 hit points&#8211;if she still has
  allies (whether or not they're real allies), she casts healing spells on
  herself and continues to support them with bardic performances, but if a
  battle looks lost or if her true allegiance is discovered, Nurah tries to
  escape. She does so by first casting invisibility and then using her scroll of
  dimension door to get as far away from the PCs as possible. She next uses her
  scroll of sending to alert Staunton that her cover's been blown and then casts
  phantom steed to hasten her journey to Drezen, where she joins up with
  Staunton in area F20 to help him fight back against the PCs.
