  Darik uses his sleep arrows, favoring human targets. If the fight presses on
  after exhausting his sleep arrows, he hesitates for 1 round, ordering his
  enemies to surrender; if they continue to fight, he turns to his regular
  arrows. Throughout the fight, he calls out insults like, "Filthy Norgorber
  dogs!" and "Murder gets you nowhere!"
Morale: Darik flees once his hit points fall below 15.
