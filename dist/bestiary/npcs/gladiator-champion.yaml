DuringCombat: >-
  In a gladiator match, the warrior fights with dramatic showmanship, performing
  unnecessary acrobatic maneuvers, intimidating foes with flashy weapons
  displays (using Dazzling Display), and otherwise prolonging the fight.
  Depending on the style and theme of the match, he may go for blood with his
  sword and mace, hold the high ground with his trident, or capture and drag his
  opponent with the net. Outside the arena, he is quick and brutal with his
  attacks, wasting no time before killing his opponent so he is out of danger as
  soon as possible.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds, potion of heroism
