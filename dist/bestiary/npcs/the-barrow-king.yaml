DuringCombat: >-
  The Barrow King's first action is to knock over the votive candles atop his
  sarcophagus, awakening the grasping dead haunt (see below). He then charges
  into combat with Vital Strike and uses Cleave and Step Up to keep from being
  surrounded.
Morale: >-
  The Barrow King fights until destroyed. If, however, the PCs lay the island's
  dead to rest (such as by destroying the haunt), the Barrow King halts combat
  and thanks them, offering his blessing and the Bard's Heart in gratitude.
Gear: potion of water walk, elixirs of fire breath (2)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 brass dragonhide breastplate, +1 greatsword, masterwork throwing axe, ring
  of protection +1, cloak of resistance +1, 92 gp
