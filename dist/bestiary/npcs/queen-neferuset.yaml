Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Neferuset uses her wand of deeper darkness in area E13, casts spell
  resistance, and activates her cloak of darkness revelation.
DuringCombat: >-
  Neferuset lets her neshmaal allies engage opponents directly while she casts
  orb of the void. She then tries to disrupt spellcasters by using feeblemind
  and her gift of madness revelation, utilizing her bouncing metamagic rod when
  she thinks her target has a strong defense against her spell. If the battle
  turns in her enemies' favor, she casts destruction against the foe who appears
  to be the greatest threat, followed by reverse gravity. If forced into melee
  combat, Neferuset employs her wings of darkness revelation to fly out of reach
  and casts antilife shell to prevent living foes from approaching her.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 0 hit points, Neferuset is not actually destroyed. Two hours
  after her destruction, the canopic jar of unlife in area E14 begins
  regenerating her undead body. When she regains full strength, Neferuset
  pursues those who dared to attempt to destroy her, or joins her husband in
  area E34.
