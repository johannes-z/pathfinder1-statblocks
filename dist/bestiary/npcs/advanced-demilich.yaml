SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Devour Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action with a range of 300 ft., a demilich can imprison the
      soul of a living creature within one of 10 special gems embedded in its
      skull. If the target succeeds at a DC 27 Fortitude save, it gains two
      permanent negative levels. If it fails, its soul is immediately drawn into
      one of the gems in the demilich's skull. The soul remains trapped within
      the gem, visible as but a gleam except under true seeing. The soulless
      body corrupts and decays rapidly, reducing to dust in a single round. As
      long as the dead creature's soul remains trapped in the gemstone, it
      cannot be restored to life via any means save direct divine intervention.
      Gems with souls trapped in them can be retrieved from a destroyed
      demilich, at which point they can either be crushed to release any souls
      within to their afterlife or used in the place of the usual material
      components to restore the soul and body with resurrection or true
      resurrection. After 24 hours, the demilich can choose to consume any soul
      trapped in a gem, healing it 1d6 hit points per Hit Die of the soul, at
      which point only miracle or wish can restore the dead creature to life.
      The save DC is Charismabased, and includes a +2 bonus for the Ability
      Focus feat.
  - name: Greater Bestow Curse (Sp)
    description: >-
      This spell-like ability functions like bestow curse, but can have one of
      the following effects: -12 to one ability score; -6 to two ability scores;
      -8 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks; or a 25% chance to act
      normally. This ability is treated as a 6th-level spell.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      A demilich is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell
      resistance. In addition, certain spells function differently against the
      creature, as noted below. A dispel evil spell deals 2d6 points of damage,
      with no saving throw. Holy smite affects a demilich normally. A power word
      kill spoken by an ethereal caster deals 50 points of damage to the
      demilich if it fails a Fortitude save (with a DC determined as though the
      spell allowed a saving throw). A shatter spell deals 1d6 points of damage
      per two caster levels (maximum 10d6), with no saving throw.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      A destroyed demilich reforms in 2d6 days. To permanently destroy a
      demilich, holy water must be poured over its remains within the area of a
      hallow spell. To complete the destruction, holy word or dispel evil must
      be cast. If the caster succeeds at a caster level check with a DC equal to
      10 + the demilich's Hit Dice, the demilich is permanently destroyed.
  - name: Telekinetic Storm (Su)
    description: >-
      As a special use of its telekinesis spell-like ability, a demilich can
      churn up its treasure, dust, bones, and other loose debris in the area
      into a whirling storm about its skull. The storm obscures vision as a fog
      cloud within a 20 ft. spread centered on the demilich's skull. Creatures
      within the storm take 12d6 points of damage per round on the demilich's
      turn (Reflex DC 20 for half damage). The demilich can maintain the storm
      indefinitely by concentrating.
  - name: Torpor (Ex)
    description: >-
      A demilich takes no actions against intruders unless its remains or
      treasure are disturbed.
  - name: Unholy Grace (Su)
    description: >-
      A demilich gains a bonus on saves and a profane bonus to AC equal to its
      Charisma modifier.
  - name: Vorpal Susceptibility (Ex)
    description: Vorpal weapons of any kind ignore a demilich's damage reduction.
