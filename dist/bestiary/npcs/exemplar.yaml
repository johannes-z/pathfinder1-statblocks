SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Howl (Su)
    description: >-
      When Exemplar howls, all evil creatures within his limited domain (see
      below) must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be panicked for 2d4 rounds.
      This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Good or neutral creatures are
      unaffected by the howl as long as they are not there to attack Valor's
      Fastness or steal from the dead interred there. Whether or not the save is
      successful, a creature cannot be affected by Exemplar's howl again for 24
      hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Know Alignment (Su)
    description: >-
      Exemplar automatically knows the alignment of any creature that enters
      Valor's Fastness. This ability can be suppressed, but Exemplar can
      reactivate it the following round as a free action. This ability cannot be
      extended beyond the limits of Exemplar's domain.
  - name: Limited Domain (Ex)
    description: >-
      Exemplar is sworn to protect the grounds of Valor's Fastness. He can
      freely wander through the courtyard and first floor of the temple (areas
      H3 through H13), but he cannot move beyond these boundaries.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      Exemplar cannot be destroyed through simple combat. If slain, Exemplar
      restores himself in 24 hours, reappearing in Valor's Fastness. The only
      way to permanently destroy Exemplar is to raze Valor's Fastness to the
      ground and cast desecrate or unhallow on the fountain in the church's
      courtyard (area H3).
  - name: Soul Defender (Su)
    description: >-
      Exemplar's sacred duty is to defend the bodies and souls of those buried
      within Valor's Fastness. Any attempts to cast animate dead or similar
      spells to create undead within Exemplar's domain require the caster to
      succeed at a DC 20 caster level check. If the check fails, the spell
      fizzles away just as if it had been cast.
  - name: Wisdom Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      Exemplar's incorporeal bite deals 1d8 points of damage and 1d4 points of
      Wisdom damage to a target. A successful DC 16 Fortitude save negates the
      Wisdom damage. On each successful attack that deals Wisdom damage,
      Exemplar gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Exemplar identifies evil threats with his know alignment ability and then uses
  his howl ability to panic as many enemies as possible, hopefully attracting
  reinforcements from the fortress as well. In melee, he first targets evil
  divine spellcasters.
Morale: Exemplar fights to the death.
