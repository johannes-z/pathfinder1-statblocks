    description: >-
      Mother Comfort constantly rants, creating a frightening effect. All
      creatures within 30 feet of Mother Comfort must succeed at a DC 15 Will
      save or be frightened for 1d6 rounds. While a target is frightened, it
      must flee from Mother Comfort as best it can. Creatures that successfully
      save cannot be affected by Mother Comfort's rant for 24 hours. This is a
      sonic, mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
