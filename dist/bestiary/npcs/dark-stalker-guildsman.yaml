DuringCombat: >-
  The dark stalkers create darkness in battle, attempting to sneak attack their
  opponents. They bellow orders and curses in Dark Folk at their underlings the
  entire time, directing them to set up flanking attacks.
Morale: >-
  These dark stalkers fight to the death as long as Stiglor lives. If he falls,
  they immediately retreat, covering their escape with a fog cloud. They hope to
  flee all the way to Walcourt, and canny PCs can follow them right up to the
  guildhall.
