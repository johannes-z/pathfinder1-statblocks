BeforeCombat: >-
  The saboteurs drink their mutagens and their extracts of aid, expeditious
  retreat, keen senses, and spider climb. These magical enhancements have
  already been applied to their stats.
DuringCombat: >-
  The saboteurs smash their way in through the windows on the cliff side of the
  house, one or two to each of the big windows. They try to keep moving and to
  cause as much mayhem as possible with bombs and fuse grenades. If they can
  isolate one person or are forced into melee, they focus on attacking a single
  target with their poisoned blades, drawing new poisoned daggers to use for
  each strike.
Morale: >-
  The saboteurs' intention is to cause damage and soften the Pathfinders'
  defenses. If more than half of the saboteurs fall in combat, the remaining
  saboteurs flee, using smoke bombs or smokesticks to cover their escape.
Gear: >-
  smokestick (3), dagger (4), fuse grenade (2), giant wasp venom (3 doses,
  applied to daggers)
OtherGear: haramaki, thieves' tools
