SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Beast Form (Su)
    description: >-
      When angered or intoxicated, a baccae takes on a beastlike visage, growing
      sharpened fangs and claws. This transformation lasts for 1 hour and cannot
      be ended voluntarily.
  - name: Charming Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      In human form, a baccae can charm any humanoid within 30 feet who meets
      her gaze. This functions as a charm person spell (CL 5th). An affected
      creature can attempt a DC 15 Will save to resist the effects. A baccae can
      suppress this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Rage (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a baccae in beast form can fly into a berserk frenzy. This
      frenzy lasts for 10 rounds. In this rage, she gains temporary bonuses to
      two ability scores: +4 Strength and +4 Constitution. She likewise gains a
      +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. A
      baccae cannot voluntarily end her rage.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  The baccae rage on the first round of combat, focusing their attacks on male
  opponents.
Morale: >-
  While raging, the baccae fight to the death. Otherwise, they flee into the
  woods if reduced to fewer than 10 hit points.
