BeforeCombat: >-
  If she is able to, Cerise drinks a potion of heroism before battle (not
  included in her stat block).
DuringCombat: >-
  Highly skilled in swordplay, Cerise uses Combat Expertise, her offensive
  defense rogue talent, and her defending rapier to increase her Armor Class and
  keep attackers at bay. She moves strategically through any melee, tumbling
  past opponents and through occupied squares with her superior Acrobatics skill
  in order to avoid becoming surrounded. When possible, she feints to create
  sneak attack opportunities for herself, always attempting to knock away an
  enemy's weapon by utilizing her Disarming Strike feat when she scores a
  critical hit.
Morale: >-
  Cerise appreciates anyone who bests her in physical combat, becoming intrigued
  enough to surrender. After falling below 20 hit points&#8211;and provided her
  attackers have acted honorably&#8211;she relinquishes her blade, counting on
  escaping later or waiting until her loyal crew rescues her. If she senses
  duplicity and evil intentions in her opponents, however, she evades capture at
  all costs.
Gear: potion of cure serious wounds, potions of heroism (2)
