BeforeCombat: Paajgat casts keen edge at the start of combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Paajgat uses shadow scream on the first round, then casts divine favor before
  attacking in melee. She pauses to heal herself whenever she's brought below
  100 hp, and saves her channel energy for when she's surrounded or when it
  looks like several foes are on their last legs.
Morale: >-
  Paajgat abandons combat if reduced to fewer than 30 hit points and uses her
  scroll of wind walk to escape the region once she can escape the Hive. If she
  does so, she may well end up in Starfall, in which case the PCs can encounter
  her again amid the kytons there.
Gear: scroll of wind walk
OtherGear: +1 chainmail, +1 unholy spiked chain
