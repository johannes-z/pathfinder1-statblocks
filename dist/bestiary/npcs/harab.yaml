  Harab uses her wand of mage armor to protect herself before combat via Use
  Magic Device.
DuringCombat: >-
  Harab tries to sneak into combat to start a fight with a sneak attack. Once
  combat is underway, she attempts to flank foes with her followers for more
  sneak attacks. If reduced to 50 or fewer hit points, she drinks her potion of
  invisibility, then drinks her potion of cure moderate wounds before
  repositioning for another sneak attack. She saves her wand of scorching ray to
  attack foes who have excellent armor classes.
Morale: >-
  Harab surrenders if reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, at which point she
  becomes friendly to the PCs if they promise to spare the lives of any of her
  remaining followers; if she has no followers left, though, she fights to the
