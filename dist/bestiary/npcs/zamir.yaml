DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, Zamir orders Jumra to attack and tries
  fruitlessly to activate the scepter of the arclords. Zamir keeps Jumra between
  him and attackers and casts produce flame, hurling fire at the nearest enemy.
  He switches to his scimitar once he's run out of flames.
Morale: >-
  If Jumra is slain or Zamir is reduced to 9 or fewer hit points, he attempts to
  retreat down the south tunnel. He casts soften earth and stone, which causes
  part of the ceiling to collapse, providing an exit through which he flees.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds
