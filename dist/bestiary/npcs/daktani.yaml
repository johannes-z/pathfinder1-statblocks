DuringCombat: >-
  If forced to fight, Daktani tries to hinder opponents with dirty tricks and
  his tangleburn bag, flanking with Ghaer as much as possible to make sneak
  attacks. Daktani dodges around the basement and ruins above, both of which he
  knows quite well by now. He attempts to lead enemies into traps (using his
  cunning trigger rogue talent to set off the trap in area H10 if it hasn't yet
  been triggered), through monster-infested areas, and anywhere else hazardous
  enough to shake pursuers.
Morale: >-
  If Ghaer is defeated and Daktani is reduced to 5 hit  points or fewer, he
  tries to escape with the use of his smoke pellets or potion of vanish. If
  escape seems unlikely, the cowardly half-orc lays down his weapons and
  surrenders.
