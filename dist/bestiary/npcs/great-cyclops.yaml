  - name: Flash of Brutality (Su)
    description: >-
      Every round that a great cyclops makes an attack, there is a 5% chance
      that it gains a burst of savage inspiration. If this occurs, the cyclops
      triples the threat range of all weapons it attacks with for that round.
      For all of a great cyclops's natural attacks, tripling the threat range
      allows for a critical hit on any attack roll of 18-20. If a great cyclops
      is reduced to fewer than half its hit points (typically 97 or lower), its
      chance of gaining a flash of brutality increases to 15%. Should the
      cyclops have 0 hit points or fewer (conscious only because of its Diehard
      feat) and choose to attack, its chance of gaining a flash of brutality
      increases to 25%.
DuringCombat: >-
  The cyclopes throw rocks at invaders, then make powerful charges before
  engaging opponents in melee combat.
