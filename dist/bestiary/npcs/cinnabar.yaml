SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mantis Form (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Cinnabar can transform into a blood-red giant praying mantis
      as a standard action, as if using vermin shape IIUM (CL 10th). In addition
      to the normal adjustments to Strength, Dexterity, and natural armor
      provided by this spell effect, she gains the giant mantis's darkvision
      (with a range of 60 feet), grab, lunge, mandibles, and sudden strike
      extraordinary abilities, but not its immunity to mind-affecting effects or
      its racial modifiers on Perception and Stealth checks. If she wields a
      magical sawtooth sabre in her hand when she transforms, the magical
      enhancements for that weapon apply to her corresponding claw attack-if she
      wields two of them, then the weapons each apply to a different claw
      attack.
  - name: Prayer Attack (Su)
    description: >-
      Resisting Cinnabar's prayer attack requires a successful DC 17 Will save.
      See page 145 for more details on this signature assassination style.
  - name: Red Shroud (Su)
    description: >-
      Cinnabar's red shroud persists for 7 rounds when she activates it. She can
      use this ability four times per day. See page 145 for more details.
  - name: Resurrection Sense (Su)
    description: >-
      Cinnabar senses if a creature she has slain within the last year has been
      restored to life, as long as she and the creature are both on the same
      plane.
  - name: Summon Mantis (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Cinnabar can summon an advanced fiendish giant mantis, 1d3
      fiendish giant mantises, or 1d4+1 giant mantises, as if using summon
      monster V. She can mentally direct the actions of these summoned vermin as
      a free action. All mantises summoned by this spell-like ability are
      bloodred and gain no racial bonuses on Stealth checks in forests.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Cinnabar casts fly, bear's endurance, bull's strength, and cat's grace on
  herself before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  If she is with allies, Cinnabar hangs back to summon 1d3 fiendish giant
  mantises on the first round of combat, then casts haste on the second round
  before moving in to join the fight in melee, staying mobile as needed to make
  sneak attacks. If she is alone, she instead fights defensively and attacks via
  melee on the first round. She uses Arcane Strike to enhance her attacks.
Morale: >-
  Cinnabar is a relentless leader and loyal to the Red Mantis, yet her
  personality has begun to crack. If she is reduced to 10 or fewer hit points,
  her next action in combat is to drop her weapons and fall to her knees and beg
  for a quick death. If death is not granted in 1 round, she picks her weapons
  back up (hoping to provoke attacks of opportunity that result in her demise)
  and then fights to the death with a furious wrath, gaining a +4 morale bonus
  on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls for the next 10 rounds. If she is
  granted mercy and given the chance to surrender instead of death, the
  conditioning in her mind reels and she instead becomes speechless for 1d6
  rounds, during which she takes no offensive actions unless she's attacked (in
  which case she is filled with a wrath as detailed above). If none attack her
  in those 1d6 rounds, Cinnabar's original, more kind-hearted personality has a
  chance to return. A full redemption should take many weeks or even months, and
  while she doesn't aid the PCs in combat (her distaste for bloodshed having
  returned), she can provide them with information about the repercussions the
  PCs may face for driving off the Red Mantis. This includes the information in
  her recent letter from the Crimson Citadel, along with warnings of Mistress
  Kayltanya, as well as information about the defenders within Deathhead Vault.
  In time, she'll be targeted for assassination by the Red Mantis, but if the
  PCs can keep her alive, Cinnabar can become a potent ally in the climax of
  Curse of the Crimson Throne (at your discretion).
