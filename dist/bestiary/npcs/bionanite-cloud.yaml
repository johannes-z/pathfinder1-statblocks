SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fascination (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a bionanite cloud can create a series of hypnotic
      waves of color to fascinate creatures within 30 feet. The distraction of a
      nearby combat or other dangers prevents this ability from working, but
      otherwise, all affected creatures must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or
      become fascinated. The bionanite cloud can maintain this effect each round
      after initial activation as a move action. This is a visual mind-affecting
      effect. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Reconstructive Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a bionanite cloud can heal a single living target it
      shares a space with, healing 1d6 points of damage. The cloud often
      triggers this ability when it reduces a creature to negative hit points,
      so as to stabilize the target. The cloud can administer this healing in an
      instant before resolving any actual damage dealt to prevent a creature's
      death from its swarm attack.
  - name: Weakness (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a bionanite cloud damages a living creature, it disrupts the
      transmission of nerve impulses to the creature's muscles, causing 1d4
      points of Strength damage. A successful DC 15 Fortitude save negates this
      Strength damage, but a creature that is nauseated takes a -4 penalty on
      this saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  Once the bionanite cloud notices "defective androids," it surges up to pacify
  them. The cloud does not seek to kill these defects, and does not damage foes
  who have fallen unconscious through damage or poisoning.
Morale: >-
  The bionanites fight until destroyed, but do not pursue "defective androids"
  more than 50 feet from the Aurora. If the trap in this room is disarmed, the
  cloud pursues defective androids throughout the complex. Note that it also
  treats the mutated androids found deeper in the ship as defective, as well as
  any other humanoid it encounters.
