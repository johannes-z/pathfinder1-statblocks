SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Tree of Ages (Su)
    description: >-
      Henbane can restore life to wooden objects, transforming them into
      constructs of living wood that serve as her allies. Up to three times per
      day as a swift action, she can create up to three wooden allies (see stat
      block below). Each of these allies remains animated for one minute, until
      she uses this ability again, or until it is reduced to 0 hit points.
  - name: Tree Meld (Su)
    description: >-
      A dryad can meld with any tree, similar to how the spell meld into stone f
      unctions. She can remain melded with a tree as long as she wishes.
  - name: Tree Dependent (Su)
    description: >-
      Henbane must stay within 300 yards of locations and times that are
      connected to the strange tree of branching paths of time to which she is
      bound. If she strays more than 300 yards away from such a location, she is
      sickened. Every hour thereafter, she must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to
      resist becoming nauseated for an hour. Henbane carries four soothe syrups
      to stave off the effects while she is away from her metaphysical tree,
      which she does not need to use during this scenario.
  - name: Woodcraft (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dryad has a +6 racial bonus to Craft checks involving wood, and is
      always treated as if she had masterwork artisan's woodworking tools when
      making such checks.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: Henbane casts heroism and resist energy (fire) and on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Henbane prefers to avoid direct confrontation by frightening potential foes
  into seeing matters from her perspective. If combat seems becomes unavoidable,
  she uses her animate wood ability to create allies out of the surrounding
  tower and uses her wooden allies for her teamwork feats. She combines spells
  and archery to hamper her foes and pick them off one at a time.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 hit points or less, Henbane casts invisibility on herself and
  sneaks down the tower with the temporal essence she has collected so far.
Gear: >-
  potion of cure serious wounds, ring of delayed doom (3 charges), soothe
  syrupAPG (4)
OtherGear: >-
  +1 darkleaf cloth studded leatherUE, +1 composite longbow (+2 Str), mwk living
  steel heavy maceUE, belt of incredible dexterity +2, cloak of elvenkind,
  efficient quiver, empty vial (10), 3 gp
