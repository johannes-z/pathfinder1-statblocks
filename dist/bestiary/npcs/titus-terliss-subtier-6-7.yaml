BeforeCombat: >-
  If Terliss is aware of the PCs' approach, he coats his rapier with bloodroot
  poison and readies to use his wand of haste (on both himself and Lal Chawda)
  and his wand of shield just prior to the PCs' arrival in area D7.
DuringCombat: >-
  Terliss initiates combat with his wand of fireball, then attempts to flank
  with Lal Chawda, who always threatens adjacent squares due to his natural
  attacks and threatens at reach with his longspear. If unable to effectively
  sneak attack his foes, Terliss uses his wand of fireball from range to keep
  himself out of harm's way, knowing that Lal Chawda has natural fire resistance
  to protect himself from taking too much damage.
Morale: >-
  Titus Terliss is under strict orders from the Spider to tear apart the
  Pathfinder Society against all opposition. Fearing retaliation for his
  failure, the Shadow Lodge instigator fights to the death.
