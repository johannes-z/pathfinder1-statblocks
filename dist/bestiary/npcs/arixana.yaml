BeforeCombat: >-
  Arixana used a charge from her wand of mage armor a few minutes before
  approaching the whale.
DuringCombat: >-
  Arixana's tactics depend upon her faction.  Docktown: Arixana hangs back,
  leading off with grease to hamper the PC's movement and attempting to keep the
  fight at range as long as possible.  Galtans: Arixana screams insults at the
  PCs as she rushes in to the fight and attempts to hit as many PCs with burning
  hands as possible, followed by other damaging spells.  Loyalists: Arixana
  calmly informs the PCs that they are under arrest, and demands that they
  surrender immediately. If the PCs do not surrender, she attacks without
  mercy.  White Thistles: Arixana tells the PCs that she will accept surrender
  at any time, and is careful not to target unconscious or badly wounded PCs
  with her evocation spells.
Morale: >-
  Arixana surrenders if she is reduced to 2 hit points or fewer, or if both of
  the sailors fall unconscious.
