SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full round action, a raktavarna can take the shape of a handheld
      object, most often an ornamental light, a one-handed weapon, or a piece of
      treasure. If the rakshasa remains stationary in such a form, it can
      attempt Stealth checks even while being observed. It can remain motionless
      in object form indefinitely, but reverts to its true form as soon as it
      takes any action. Master's
  - name: Eyes (Su)
    description: >-
      A raktavarna can designate a single creature as its master as a standard
      action. If the raktavarna is a spellcaster's familiar, its master is
      automatically that spellcaster, and the raktavarna cannot change this. As
      a full-round action, a raktavarna's master can observe the world as if
      looking through the raktavarna's eyes. The master must concentrate to
      maintain this link each round. The master's visual senses are suppressed
      for this time, and he uses the raktavarna's darkvision, detect magic, and
      regular eyesight to observe the world. This ability has no limit on range,
      and functions even across planar boundaries. If the raktavarna is slain
      while its master is using this ability, the master is stunned for 1d4
      rounds (no save).
  - name: Poison (Su)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2
      Wis plus modify memory; cure 1 save. Each time a victim takes Wisdom
      damage from this poison, a modify memory effect causes the victim to
      forget the previous minute's interactions with the raktavarna, as long as
      the raktavarna is no longer visible or is in object form. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
