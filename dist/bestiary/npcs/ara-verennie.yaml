BeforeCombat: >-
  Ara casts mage armor, shield, protection from good, and invisibility as soon
  as she realizes someone intrudes upon her lair.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ara doesn't engage the PCs directly at first. She remains invisible and uses
  her summoning spells to summon numerous Medium earth elementals that look like
  skeletal Hellknights to attack the PCs. She attempts to use malevolence on the
  most attractive PC if she can arrange to be alone in a room with that
  character&#8211;if successful, she poses as the PC for as long as possible to
  learn what she can about the PCs before reporting to Chammady in hopes of
  being granted leave to take her hijacked body through the well of many worlds
  to experience Hell. If discovered, she prefers to use her spells and
  corrupting gaze at range, using her flight to stay out of melee.
Morale: >-
  Ara fights until destroyed, but unless the dagger is removed from her body and
  her remains are returned to Paralictor Chard, she rejuvenates in 2d4 days and
  resumes her blasphemies.
