SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Scrap Bomb (Su)
    description: >-
      When Yarak creates a bomb, he can choose to have it explode into shards of
      shrapnel that deal piercing damage. Any creature that takes a direct hit
      from a scrap bomb takes 1 point of bleed damage per die of bomb damage
      unless it succeeds at a Reflex save. This discovery appears on page 116 of
      the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  When Yarak becomes aware of intruders, he drinks his mutagen (included in his
  stats) and pulls up the rope to prevent easy access to the upper level.
DuringCombat: >-
  Yarak uses his bombs and vomit swarm extracts on intruders below, even if his
  helpers are also caught in their effects. He does, however, change to scrap
  bombs to avoid damaging his swarms.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 15 hit points or fewer, or if cornered in melee combat, Yarak
  drinks his invisibility and expeditious retreat extracts and flees into the
  sewers.
