DuringCombat: >-
  Having focused his studies on prophecy and diplomacy, Augustille knows few
  combat spells. Instead, he relies on his natural troll abilities, roaring
  dramatically (as he imagines his savage brethren might) and charging in with a
  show of berserk rage, clawing and biting anyone who comes within range and
  hoping to do enough damage that his opponents lose heart and run. His tongues
  curse also kicks in during combat, and he shouts in Aklo like a madman.
Morale: >-
  On his own, Augustille fights only until it's clear his opponents won't back
  down, then casts sanctuary and attempts to flee. If defending his friends or
  under the effects of Berkanin's drugs, he fights to the death.
