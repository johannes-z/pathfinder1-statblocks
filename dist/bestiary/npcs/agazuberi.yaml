SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aligned Weapons (Su)
    description: >-
      A black jinni's natural weapons and any weapon she wields are treated as
      chaotic and evil for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      A humanoid or genie slain by a black jinni's melee attacks enhanced by her
      shocking touch rises 1d4 rounds later as an undead spawn. Humans rise as
      zombies, jann rise as ghuls (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 125), and djinn,
      efreet, shaitans, and marids rise as great ghuls (see page 51). Any spawn
      created by a black jinni are under her control.
  - name: Dust Vortex (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, as a full-round action, a black jinni can cause the
      obscuring cloud that surrounds her to become a vortex of electrically
      charged dust. This vortex is 20 feet high and radiates to a range of 30
      feet, with the black jinni at the vortex's center. The winds within this
      area are considered a windstorm (Core Rulebook 439). Creatures within the
      vortex that would normally be blown away are instead drawn toward the
      center to a square adjacent to the black jinni. A creature that ends its
      turn within the dust vortex takes 10d6 points of electricity damage
      (Reflex DC 23 half). Once the dust vortex is created, it remains
      stationary, allowing the black jinni to move around in it or even leave
      it. The vortex remains in place for 1d6 rounds, or until the black jinni
      dismisses it as a move action. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Obscuring Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      A black jinni is continually surrounded by a cloud of obscuring dust and
      scouring wind. This cloud gives her a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks
      while within a sandstorm or other area of blowing dust. In addition, a
      black jinni has concealment (20% miss chance) while the cloud is in
      effect. Any strong (or stronger) wind can suppress the obscuring cloud as
      long as the wind persists.
  - name: Shocking Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature hit by a black jinni's claw attack or its conductive falchion
      takes an additional 1d10 points of electricity damage-on a critical hit,
      this additional electricity damage increases to 2d10 points of damage and
      the creature must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or the electricity
      lingers on its body, dealing an additional 1d10 points of electricity
      damage each round on the start of the victim's turn for 1d6 additional
      rounds. Immersion in any liquid ends this ongoing damage, as does contact
      with a metal object of at least Medium or larger size that is in contact
      with the ground. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Stormwalk (Ex)
    description: >-
      A black jinni is able to move about in any storm of natural or unnatural
      origin of hurricane velocity or less without suffering any of its effects.
  - name: Vulnerability to Recitation (Ex)
    description: >-
      As cursed genies of evil and chaos, black jinn are strangely susceptible
      to recitations of certain holy tracts belonging to good or lawful deities
      or philosophies. These include the spells dictum and holy word, but also
      forceful recitations of nonmagical holy sermonizing. If a cleric or
      paladin of a lawful or good deity succeeds at an opposed Knowledge
      (religion) check against a black jinni's Knowledge (religion) check as a
      standard action, the black jinni must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or
      be instantly destroyed, leaving behind only a small spot of charred ash.
      If this save is successful, the black jinni instead takes 5d6 points of
      damage. Unlike most black jinn, though, Agazuberi is particularly patient
      and accepting of such recitations&#8211;she gains a +4 bonus on her
      Fortitude saves and Knowledge (religion) checks when reacting to this
      weakness.
Gender: Female
DuringCombat: >-
  Agazuberi prefers to avoid creating her dust vortex so that she can focus on
  moving about the room and take advantage of Spring Attack and Mobility. She's
  patient and would prefer to deny her enemies opportunities for full attacks
  anyway, believing that extending her time in battle will give her greater
  opportunities to spread out the pain and suffering she hopes to inflict to
  alleviate her boredom. If reduced to fewer than 120 hit points, though, her
  base nature begins to take over and she grows more feral and violent,
  activating her dust vortex in the center of the room to fill the entire area
  before focusing her attacks on the most wounded foes, now attempting to set up
  full attacks against her enemies in order to finish them off.
Morale: Agazuberi fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  +1 conductive falchion, ring of freedom of movement, gem encrusted gold
