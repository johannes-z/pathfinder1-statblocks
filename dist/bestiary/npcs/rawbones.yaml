SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Nauseating Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A rawbones emanates a sickening aura that reeks of death in a 20-foot
      radius. Any creature that comes within that area must succeed on DC 19
      Fortitude save or become nauseated for as long as it remains within the
      area and for 1 minute after leaving the area. A creature that makes a
      successful save is immune to the nauseating aura of that rawbones for 24
      hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Strangle (Ex)
    description: >-
      Rawbones have an unerring talent for seizing their victims by the neck. A
      creature that is grappled by a rawbones cannot speak or cast any spells
      that have verbal components.
  - name: Vomit Gore (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a rawbones can spit a blast of blood and gore in a
      20-foot cone that deals 6d6 points of damage (DC 19 Reflex save for half
      ). The save DC is Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The rawbones vomit gore to catch as many opponents as possible in its effects,
  then use their entrails lash to constrict and strangle their foes.
Morale: The rawbones fight until destroyed.
