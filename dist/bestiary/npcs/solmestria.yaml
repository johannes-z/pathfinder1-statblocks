BeforeCombat: Solmestria drinks a potion of barkskin +3 before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Solmestria uses studied target at the start of a fight to gain an advantage
  over the most dangerous-looking foe. On the first round of combat, she attacks
  a flat-footed foe, then in subsequent rounds relies on flanking or feinting to
  gain sneak attacks. Her preferred targets are humans or monstrous humanoids,
  and depending on the nature of her foe, she alternates which of her two bane
  swords functions as her primary attack. If she manages to blind a foe with a
  critical hit, she focuses her attacks on that target exclusively so she can
  take full advantage of her sneak attacks. Once reduced to fewer than 100 hit
  points, she uses Combat Expertise to enhance her Armor Class, but doesn't
  otherwise alter her tactics in battle.
Morale: >-
  Solmestria fights to the death to protect her allies or village. That said, if
  she is the last strix standing and she is reduced to 30 hit points or fewer,
  she prefers instead to flee the battle to return to her people rather than
  risk death in a fight that could leave her kin unprotected from the dangers
  they face.
