BeforeCombat: >-
  Narris Devane casts mage armor prior to  entering the Green Market and
  activates his ring of force shield before revealing himself to Zeeva.
DuringCombat: >-
  The sorcerer employs battlefield- and crowd-control spells and abilities to
  confound the PCs so the warriors can focus more easily on reaching Zeeva,
  their ultimate goal. Narris uses his lesser extend metamagic rod when
  necessary to exclude one of his allies from an area-of-effect spell.
Morale: >-
  If Devane is reduced to 15 or fewer hit points, or if all his enforcers are
  killed or surrender, he surrenders to the PCs and attempts to talk his way out
  of the situation instead.
