    description: >-
      A dhampir takes no penalties from energy draining effects, though he can
      still be killed if he accrues more negative levels then he has Hit Dice.
      After 24 hours, any negative levels a dhampir takes are removed without
      the need for an additional saving throw.
BeforeCombat: >-
  If the PCs make it known they are searching for Ruovarn or are investigating
  anything regarding slave-trading, the dhampir closest to the gangplank draws
  it up onto the ship's deck.
DuringCombat: >-
  On the first round of combat, the dhampir closest to gangplank draws it up
  onto the ship's deck if it is not already there, preventing escape. The other
  dhampir fights the PC closest to him.
Morale: >-
  The dhampir pirates, soon lusting for the blood of the adventurers, fight
  until they are incapacitated or dead.
