  Two goons wait in area 2 and another two in area 4. When they are sure the PCs
  are all inside area 1, they leap out and attack the PCs from two directions.
  One of the goons stays in the doorway to area 4 and hurls stingchucks at the
  PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  The goons work together to flank single PCs and bring them down one at a time.
  If brought down to 10 hit points or less, they drink their potion and try to
  get back into the action. Keep in mind that in this tier the goons' sneak
  attack damage also causes bleed.

  flee.

OtherGear: >-
  chain shirt, +1 cestus, daggers (3), stingchucks (3, only one of the goons has
