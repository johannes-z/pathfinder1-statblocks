SpecialAbilities: []
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  When Ilan hears the sounds of combat coming from outside, he casts magic
  circle against good on himself, and desecrate in the center of the inner
  sanctum. Neither of these effects is calculated into his stats. If time
  permits, he also casts eagle's splendor and divine power on himself, which are
  both reflected in his stat block.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ilan uses his rod to cast quickened blindness/deafness in concert with melee
  attacks and quickened bestow curse in concert with slay living. In melee, he
  uses a combination of slay living, energy drain, and his whip's special
  ability, draining blood when a target has been made helpless (such as with his
  hold person spell). He channels negative energy to heal himself and his allies
  as needed, only using it to damage his foes if he is the sole Feaster of the
  Heart still in the fight.
Morale: >-
  Ilan fights in his sanctum and knows there is nowhere he can go to escape
  utter destruction if he is defeated. Thus, he fights to the death to keep his
  cult alive.
Gear: lesser quicken metamagic rod, unholy water
OtherGear: >-
  +2 glamered scale mail, Lissala's Caress, cloak of resistance +1, headband of
  inspired wisdom +2, gold unholy symbol of Lissala (worth 100 gp), silver dust
  (worth 25 gp), 100 gp
