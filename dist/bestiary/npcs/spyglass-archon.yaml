    description: >-
      Three times per day, a spyglass archon can concentrate its attention as a
      swift action. For 4 rounds, the range of the spyglass archon's darkvision
      doubles, it gains a +6 bonus on Perception checks, and it gains blindsense
      out to a range of 15 feet.
BeforeCombat: >-
  Because the PCs are assumed to be evil, the benefits from the archons' magic
  circle against evil spell-like ability are included in their statistics.
DuringCombat: >-
  The archons generally avoid combat if at all possible, but should the PCs
  become involved in any action that endangers the people of Kantaria or the
  forces of the Glorious Reclamation, the outsiders move to engage the offenders
  and help any potential allies. The two archons work together and with allies
  to flank foes and make sneak attacks. Against lightly armored opponents, the
  archons prefer to deal nonlethal damage, attempting to take prisoners back to
  Oppian Nevilindor.
Morale: As long as innocents or allies are in danger, the archons fight to the death.
Gear: leather armor, mwk longsword, mwk short sword, shortbow with 20 arrows
