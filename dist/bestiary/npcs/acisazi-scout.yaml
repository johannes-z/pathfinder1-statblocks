DuringCombat: >-
  These Acisazi scouts prefer to fight with a trident and dagger, but lacking
  their equipment (as detailed here), they defend themselves as best they can
  with their fists.
Morale: >-
  An Acisazi scout won't abandon the other scouts, but when alone, a scout flees
  if reduced to fewer than 5 hit points.
