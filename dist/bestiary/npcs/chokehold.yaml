DuringCombat: >-
  If Melira is alerted to the presence of intruders, she sends Chokehold into
  the bilges (area A14). He can swim through the muck without penalty and knows
  to avoid Melira's traps. The snake takes a position halfway down the corridor,
  attempting to block the passage and grapple enemies before they can reach
  Melira.
Morale: >-
  While Melira lives, Chokehold fights until he is incapacitated. If Melira
  dies, the snake tries to flee when brought to fewer than 5 hit points.
