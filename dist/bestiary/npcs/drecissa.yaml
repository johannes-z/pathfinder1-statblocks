  During this encounter, Drecissa has already used most of her offensive spells
  for the day and is not prepared to fight against the sahuagin raiders. She
  keeps herself tucked into a pocket in the rocks and coral to protect herself.
  If the PCs are having trouble fighting the sahuagin, Drecissa may be able to
  assist them, but she doesn't take any risks. If any of the PCs are injured in
  the fight, Drecissa offers to heal them with her wand in return for saving
  her.
