BeforeCombat: >-
  Gerva cast mage armor on herself during the initial attack, and it remains
  active.
DuringCombat: >-
  If intruders ignore her warning, Gerva hurls her bang grenade to hopefully
  scare them off, then she opens fire with her laser pistol. Once the pistol's 4
  charges are depleted, she switches to her shortbow, reserving her shock arrows
  for any mechanical creatures or particularly difficult foes. Gerva uses the
  pod to her advantage, gaining improved cover while sniping at enemies.
Morale: Once combat begins, Gerva fights until slain or subdued.
