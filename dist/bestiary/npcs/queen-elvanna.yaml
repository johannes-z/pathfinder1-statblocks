SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Exceptional Resources (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a daughter of Baba Yaga, Elvanna holds mythic potential in her veins.
      As a result, her ability scores were generated using a 20-point build. In
      addition, as queen of Irrisen, Elvanna has access to all of that realm's
      resources, and she has the wealth of a PC rather than an NPC. These
      advantages increase her CR by +1.
  - name: Inherent Bonuses (Ex)
    description: >-
      Through the study of magical tomes such as a manual of gainful exercise
      and a manual of quickness of action, Elvanna has a +5 inherent bonus to
      her Dexterity and Constitution scores.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Elvanna casts greater false life and moment of prescience every day. She uses
  her cauldron of seeing to scry the entrance to the Witch Queen's Kurgan, and
  so has warning when anyone enters the kurgan. When invaders reach area M5,
  Elvanna uses the Icecrown of Irrisen to summon three elder ice elementals to
  defend her and uses Winter's Reach to cast ice body. She then casts death
  ward, foresight, and true seeing, and applies her flying ointment and stone
  salve.
DuringCombat: >-
  When opponents first enter the inner sanctum, Elvanna activates her boots of
  speed and uses the Icecrown to cast overwhelming presence while her allies
  engage foes. She casts unwilling shield on a fighter or rogue, and uses polar
  midnight, mass hold person, and waves of ecstasy to control the battlefield.
  Thereafter, Elvanna casts offensive spells to harm her opponents as much as
  possible, making use of the Icecrown, Winter's Reach, and her own prepared
  spells as necessary.
Morale: >-
  Elvanna is aware that her survival depends upon her success in this battle.
  She knows her fate if Baba Yaga is freed, and as a result fights to the death
  to defeat the PCs and complete her ritual.
