SQ: witch's familiar (lizard named Omb)
Source: PFS S2-01
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Xeanja casts mage armor, detect thoughts, false life, and see invisibility
  (already figured into her stats) on herself and fly on Omb well before the
  confrontation. She attempts to keep the PCs talking for at least 3 rounds
  before combat begins so she can probe their surface thoughts to learn who
  holds the key.
DuringCombat: >-
  Xeanja holds no hatred for the PCs and doesn't especially want to kill them.
  She begins combat by casting web. She then draws her wand of inflict light
  wounds and uses her misfortune hex on whichever PC appears to be the boldest.
  Every round thereafter, she cackles to maintain the misfortune effect and uses
  her wand to attack PCs within melee range. The threats and fight serve
  primarily as a distraction so Xeanja's lizard familiar, Omb, can sneak in
  close to the PCs and steal their key. Determining which character carries the
  key requires a DC 15 Perception check by the lizard (Perception +1), or an
  opposed check against the holder's Sleight of Hand if the PCs attempted to
  hide it. Once the key is located, Omb attempts to steal it with a DC 20
  Sleight of Hand check (Sleight of Hand +8), then quietly scurry away (Stealth
  +14). The PCs are entitled to Perception checks to notice Omb or the theft as
  normal. If discovered, Omb bites once out of spite, then flees.
Morale: >-
  Xeanja is looking for a quick buck, not the secrets of the universe. She
  surrenders if reduced below 6 hit points. She also flees into the woods if her
  familiar, Omb, manages to steal the key during the confusion.
