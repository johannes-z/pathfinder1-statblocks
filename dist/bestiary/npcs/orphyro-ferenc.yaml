BeforeCombat: >-
  Orphyro casts freedom of movement, eagle's splendor, shield of faith, and
  entropic shield (already included in his stats), in that order, at the first
  sign of trouble. He casts undetectable alignment at the start of every day,
  believing it's a prudent business precaution.
DuringCombat: >-
  Orphyro uses his spells to support his allies and channels negative energy to
  harm his enemies. He tries to keep his jiang-shi vampires between himself and
  the PCs.
Morale: >-
  Orphyro is not ready to die. If the PCs defeat Imelda and at least one of his
  jiang-shi vampires, Orphyro proposes a truce. He only surrenders if he
  believes he has a chance of surviving to see another day.
OtherGear: >-
