SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Damned (Ex)
    description: >-
      When Caggrigar dies, his soul is instantly claimed by the Abyss, where it
      transforms into a demon. Any character attempting to resurrect him must
      succeed at a caster level check equal to 21 or the spell fails. That
      character cannot attempt to resurrect Caggrigar again until the following
      day, though other characters can attempt to do so if they please.
  - name: Demonic Mark (Ex)
    description: >-
      Caggrigar bears the sign of Deskari as a tattoolike brand on the back of
      his left hand. Once per day, he can call upon the profane power of this
      mark to power a spell as he casts it. Doing so causes the spell to gain
      the chaotic and evil descriptors, and causes the spell not be expended as
      it is cast, allowing Caggrigar to cast the spell again at a later point in
      the day.
  - name: Energumen (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Caggrigar can open his soul to a demonic spirit as a free
      action. This spirit possesses him for 4 rounds, granting a +2 profane
      bonus to one ability score of the demoniac's choice. When the energumen
      ends, Caggrigar becomes confused for 4 rounds as the demonic spirit has
      its way with his mind. At the start of each round of confusion, he can
      make a DC 25 Will save to end the confusion effect immediately. Energumen
      is a possession effect, and is negated by protection from evil or
      protection from chaos. Caggrigar can prevent or end the confusion side
      effect by having one of these spells cast upon him when (or before) the
      energumen ends, but being affected by such a spell before the energumen
      has run its course also causes the benefits granted to end prematurely.
  - name: Obedience (Ex)
    description: >-
      Each day, as part of preparing his spells, Caggrigar must meditate while
      allowing insects or worms of any type to crawl upon his body-he generally
      uses his scorpion familiar. In return, he gains a +4 profane bonus on all
      saving throws against disease and against effects caused by vermin. If he
      should ever fail to perform this ritual, Caggrigar loses all abilities
      granted through his demoniac prestige class until he next performs the
      obedience.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Caggrigar cast threefold aspect on himself this morning and now appears as a
  young adult. Before leaving the safe house, he also cast spite with the
  vampiric touch effect. Once Caggrigar becomes aware of the PCs, he summons 1d3
  babaus to aid him in battle, and false life should time permit.
DuringCombat: >-
  Caggrigar sends his demonic servants to fight melee and ranged combatants,
  using black tentacles, cloudkill, and suffocation against casters.
Morale: >-
  Caggrigar fears death, knowing that he will suffer eternal torment at
  Deskari's hands. If reduced to fewer than 20 hp, he uses his energumen ability
  as a free action to boost his Constitution by +2 for 4 rounds, thus increasing
  his hit points by 22, and attempts to flee or parlay.
Gear: >-
  +1 scythe, amulet of natural armor +1, cloak of resistance +2, headband of
  intellect +2, ring of protection +1, 432 gp
