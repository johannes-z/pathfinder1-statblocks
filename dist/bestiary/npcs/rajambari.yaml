    description: >-
      A rajambari's method of creation makes it far easier to command, and when
      affected by any spell or effect that allows command over undead creatures,
      the duration of the effect is doubled. A rajambari can understand the
      spoken commands of any creature that successfully commands it, regardless
      of the language.
  - name: War Stomp (Su)
    description: >-
      Upon creation, a rajambari is infused with the ability to perform a war
      stomp. The mindless undead can perform a war stomp as a standard action
      once per minute, and they generally do so when first presented with the
      opportunity against a foe, regardless of whether the tactic is sound or
      not. When a rajambari war stomps, it slams its front two feet down upon
      the ground, creating a shock wave that can knock nearby opponents prone.
      The rajambari attempts a trip combat maneuver against all creatures
      standing on the ground within a 20-foot radius, including other rajambari.
DuringCombat: >-
  As long as no creatures attempt to damage them or the surrounding structure of
  the Gizzard, the rajambari remain passive. Once either of  these conditions
  ends, though, the undead mastodons immediately move to defend the Gizzard.
  Each mastodon skeleton can move up to 15 feet from its pillar to attack
  intruders; as they fight, the chains that attach them to the pillars move and
  shake, causing the rooms above to shake as well, but as long as the gears
  remain locked, the rooms above won't shift. If at least two of the skeletal
  mastodons are destroyed, the remaining ones are not strong enough to rotate
  the chambers of the Vivified Labyrinth above and the rooms remain stuck in
  their current configuration.
Morale: The skeletal elephants fight until destroyed.
