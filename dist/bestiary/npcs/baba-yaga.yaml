SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Exceptional Stats (Ex)
    description: >-
      Baba Yaga was born a perfect specimen of humanity. As a result, her
      ability scores were generated using 25 points, rather than using the
      standard 15 point buy used to create most NPCs. Additionally, Baba Yaga
      has much more gear than an NPC of her level would normally have. These
      modifications increase her total CR by 2.
  - name: Forceful Presence (Ex)
    description: >-
      Baba Yaga adds her Charisma modifier as an insight bonus to her Armor
      Class and on all of her saving throws. In addition, Baba Yaga uses her
      Charisma score as well as her Constitution score when calculating hit
      points. This ability increases her total CR by 1.
  - name: Hut Familiar (Ex)
    description: >-
      Baba Yaga built her Dancing Hut using a combination of the witch's hut hex
      and the sanctum mythic path ability, and over time expanded the artifact's
      powers to its present state. The Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga serves as Baba
      Yaga's familiar, and replaces the normal witch's familiar ability. Baba
      Yaga's life is forever intertwined with her Dancing Hut and parts of her
      essence reside within it. As long as the hut exists, this special
      connection grants her 300 bonus hit points, DR 10/epic and good, and
      regeneration 20. This ability increases her total CR by 1.
  - name: Immortal (Su)
    description: >-
      Baba Yaga has hidden her death to make herself even more difficult to
      kill. This functions as the base mythic ability (Mythic Adventures 13),
      but Baba Yaga always returns to life 24 hours later, regardless of how she
      is killed. In order to permanently kill Baba Yaga, her death must be found
      and released back into her body, at which point she can be killed with a
      coup de grace or critical hit made with an artifact. Long-Lived (Ex)
      Mystical arcane powers, mythic abilities, and complex arcane rituals have
      extended Baba Yaga's life. She gains the +3 bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom,
      and Charisma scores for having lived beyond venerable age, but she doesn't
      gain the penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution resulting from
      this advanced age. Baba Yaga's supernaturally empowered life grants her
      complete immunity to ability damage and drain, charm and compulsion
      effects, death effects, disease, energy drain, petrification, poison, and
      all forms of madness (including confusion effects and feeblemind). This
      ability increases her total CR by 1. Permanent Spells Through the use of
      permanency, Baba Yaga is constantly under the effect of the following
      spells: arcane sight, darkvision, read magic, see invisibility, and
      tongues. Baba Yaga has also devised a way to inscribe symbol spells upon
      her person. Baba Yaga has permanent symbols of death (DC 36) magically
      inscribed on the center of her chest, between her shoulder blades, upon
      the crown of her head, and on the soles of her feet. Only a few great
      beings have knowledge of the symbols' passwords (each symbol has its own
      unique phrase), and even fewer significant personalities have been attuned
      to the symbols.
  - name: Queen of Witches (Ex)
    description: >-
      As Queen of Witches, Baba Yaga knows all witch spells, as well as all
      sorcerer/wizard spells. Baba Yaga also has knowledge of many other spells
      that she has researched. Many of these are arcane versions of divine
      spells. In addition, Baba Yaga can create artifacts, and has done so to
      great extent, the greatest of which is the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga.
