SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cackle (Su)
    description: >-
      As a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, Malikadna
      can cackle madly. Any creature within 30 feet that is under the effects of
      her evil eye or misfortune hex has the duration of that effect extended by
      1 round.
  - name: Evil Eye (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity,
      Malikadna can use the evil eye to cause a visible foe within 30 feet to
      take a -2 penalty on one of the following (Malikadna's choice): AC,
      ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks. This effect
      lasts for 8 rounds. A DC 17 Will save reduces this duration to 1 round.
      This is a mind-affecting effect.
  - name: Misfortune (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity,
      Malikadna can cause a creature within 30 feet to suffer grave misfortune
      for 1 round. Anytime the creature makes an ability check, attack roll,
      saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse
      result. A DC 17 Will save negates this effect. A single creature cannot be
      targeted by this ability more than once per day. Witch's Familiar A witch
      forms a close bond with a familiar, a creature that teaches her magic and
      helps to guide her along her path. Instead of a spellbook, Malikadna must
      commune with her familiar each day to prepare her spells. A witch's
      familiar otherwise functions like the wizard's arcane bond class feature.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: Malikadna casts mage armor before entering into combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Malikadna prefers to avoid melee combat, instead using her spells and hexes to
  support the cannibals in a fight. If confronted on her own, she tries to use
  hideous laughter or cause fear to minimize attacks, but as soon as she takes
  damage, she uses her wand of vampiric touch to damage foes and heal her own
  damage.
Morale: Malikadna fights to the death.
Gear: wand of vampiric touch (8 charges)
OtherGear: quarterstaff
