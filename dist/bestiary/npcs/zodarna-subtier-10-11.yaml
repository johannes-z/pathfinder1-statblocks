BeforeCombat: >-
  Zodarna casts keen edge on her short sword in addition to see invisibility,
  nondetection, undetectable alignment, stoneskin, and shield of faith on
  herself. She activates her master's illusion domain ability once she believes
  the PCs are just about to enter the room.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zodarna waits for a moment to see if the PCs fall for her ruse and kill one or
  more of the captives. She then fights using her kyton allies, darkness, and
  allies to gain an advantage. If a PC's magical light source is especially
  problematic, she uses her scroll of dispel magic to end the effect.
Morale: >-
  If the PCs kill one or more of the captives, Zodarna fights until reduced to
  25 hit points or fewer before using shadow step to flee to the tunnel below
  and escape into the Darklands. Otherwise she fights to the death to secure
  vengeance in blood.
Gear: >-
  scroll of dispel magic (CL 11th), wand of countless eyesUM (9 charges), wand
  of restoration (3 charges)
OtherGear: short sword of venom (functions as a dagger of venom), +2 leather armor
Land: 1
BaseStatistics: >-
  Without shield of faith, Zodarna has AC 24, touch 17, flat-footed 17. Without
  stoneskin, she has no DR. Without keen edge, her sword short deals
  1d6+2/19-20.
