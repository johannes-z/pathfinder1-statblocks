BeforeCombat: >-
  Sarxa hopes to negotiate with any intruders, but keeps her potion of blur
  concealed in her palm just in case.
DuringCombat: >-
  Sarxa drinks her potion of blur and tries to slip behind her opponents while
  they engage her undead guards. She prefers to stay at range during combat, but
  doesn't mind using her claws in close quarters.
Morale: >-
  If both of her guardians are destroyed and Sarxa is reduced to fewer than 15
  hit points, she throws a smoke pellet and uses her quick runner's shirt to
  retreat. She falls back to join the duergar caravan (encounter F). If the
  caravan has already been destroyed, she retreats to Karexin Tower, where she
  may be encountered in Chapter 3.
