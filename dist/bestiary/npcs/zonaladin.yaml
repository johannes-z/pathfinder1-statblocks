BeforeCombat: >-
  Zonaladin begins combat with the fatigued condition, two negative levels, and
  only two remaining spells per level due to his long vigil and earlier battles
  against the cult of Lissala. The penalty to Str and Dex from fatigue and the
  reduction of maximum hit points and CMD from his negative levels have already
  been applied to his statistics. Additionally, he suffers a &#8211;2 penalty on
  ability checks, attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, saving throws, and skill
  checks from his negative levels, which has not been reflected in his stats.
  These penalties, which Zonaladin has no way to remove himself, reduce his
  Challenge Rating by 1.
DuringCombat: >-
  Zonaladin is a cautious fighter and attempts to slow as many enemies as
  possible before retreating to  one of the columns rising from the ravine.
  There he harasses the PCs with his breath weapon while physically
  incapacitating anyone who can reach him. He closes with serious ranged threats
  to trip and disarm them.
Morale: >-
  Zonaladin's enjoyment of combat lasts only so long as he is healthy and has an
  advantage. If reduced to 30 hit points or fewer or made incapable of fighting
  effectively, he flees back to his lair, hoping to heal and await the
  Pathfinders' exit from the Thousandth Spire.
