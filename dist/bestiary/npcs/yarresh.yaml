Source: Carrion Hill
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Yarresh relies on his surprise attack ability to disable an opponent on the
  first round of combat. He prefers hit-and-run tactics to merely slugging it
  out with the PCs, and either flees to the northeast (with the intent of
  sneaking up on them later) or hides in the water at area A11.
Morale: >-
  Yarresh would rather live and seek revenge than die at the hands of
  surface-dwellers. If brought below 20 hit points, he flees to the northeast...
  though he may return later and skulk about the city, possibly running into the
  PCs at an inopportune time.
