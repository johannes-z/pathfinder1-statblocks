SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bloodrage (Su)
    description: >-
      You can bloodrage for 15 rounds per day. These rounds are renewed after
      resting for 8 hours, although the hours of rest need not be consecutive.
      Entering a bloodrage is a free action. While in a bloodrage, you gain a +4
      morale bonus to your Strength and Constitution and a +2 morale bonus on
      Will saving throws, but you take a -2 penalty to Armor Class. You also
      gain 6 additional hit points, but these disappear when the bloodrage ends
      and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in bloodrage, you
      cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except
      Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires
      patience or concentration. You can end your bloodrage as a free action.
      When the bloodrage ends, you're fatigued for a number of rounds equal to
      twice the number of rounds spent in the bloodrage. You cannot enter a new
      bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but otherwise can enter bloodrage
      multiple times during a single encounter. If you fall unconscious, your
      bloodrage immediately ends.
  - name: Blood Sanctuary (Su)
    description: >-
      You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that you or an ally
      casts (such as fireball).
  - name: Uncanny Dodge (Ex)
    description: >-
      You cannot be caught flat-footed, even if an attacker is invisible, but
      you still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if you're immobilized or if an
      opponent successfully uses the feint action against you.
