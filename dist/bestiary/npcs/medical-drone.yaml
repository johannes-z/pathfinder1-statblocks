SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Injection (Su)
    description: >-
      Up to three times per day as a swift action when it damages a living
      creature with its claw attack, a medical drone can inject that creature
      with a potion, poison, drug, or pharmaceutical. The drones in this
      adventure inject a local anesthetic that causes a -2 penalty to Strength
      that lasts for 1 hour (Fortitude DC 11 negates). This penalty stacks with
      multiple injections, but the duration does not. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Repair Robot (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, a
      repair drone can repair damage done to either itself or an adjacent robot,
      healing the target of 1d10 points of damage.
DuringCombat: >-
  The drone speaks Androffan in a metallic voice as it attacks, spewing phrases
  like the following: "Please remain calm; you are to undergo a medical
  procedure," or "There is no reason to struggle, you are in safe hands," or
  "The doctor will be with you shortly." The drone tries to inject its target
  with an anesthetic, hoping to maneuver a "patient" up onto one of the surgical
  beds. It does not pursue foes from this room unless attacked from beyond the
  room via ranged weapons.
Morale: The drone fights until destroyed.
