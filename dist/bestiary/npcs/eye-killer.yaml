  - name: Death Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      By using natural or magical light that illuminates it (meaning the eye
      killer must be within the radius covered by a natural or magical light
      source), an eye killer can amplify the light and refocus it in a line that
      functions as a death ray to a range of 50 feet. The eye killer must make a
      ranged touch attack against its target as a standard action. If
      successful, the creature struck must make succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude
      save or perish. Even if the save succeeds, the victim takes 3d6 points of
      damage. An eye killer can use this gaze once per day. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Eye killers are immune to their own gaze attack and to
      the gaze attack of other eye killers. If the eye killer's gaze attack is
      reflected back upon it, it amplifies the intensity and projects it at a
      new target as an immediate action. The save DC to resist this gaze is
      increased by +2.
  - name: Sunlight Vulnerability (Ex)
    description: >-
      If natural sunlight (including a daylight spell) is brought within 5 feet
      of an eye killer, it immediately releases a grappled foe and attempts to
      move as far away from the source of light as possible. On subsequent
      rounds, an eye killer is dazzled as long as it remains within 5 feet of
      the light source.
