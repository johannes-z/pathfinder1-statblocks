DuringCombat: >-
  Grazuul attempts to remain in the water throughout the entire combat so he can
  continue enjoying the effects of his regeneration, but once he's brought below
  50 hit points, he drops his trident and switches over to using his claws to
  let his regeneration catch up with all the damage he'd been doing to himself
  by using the vicious weapon. If facing characters wearing heavy armor, he
  clambers out of his pool to try to bull rush them into the water if the
  opportunity presents itself.
Morale: >-
  Grazuul fights to the death, confident that his regeneration will save him if
  he's defeated. If, on the other hand, the PCs use fire or acid against him, he
  abandons Skull's Crossing once brought below 20 hit points and flees into area
  C14 and thence north into the Storval Deep.
