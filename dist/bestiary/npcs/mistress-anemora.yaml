SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Profane Gift (Su)
    description: >-
      Anemora is under the effects of a profane gift (+2 Con) granted to her by
      a succubus named Lelaxiss whom she has bound and imprisoned in a distant
      hidden locale.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Anemora casts magic vestment and heroes' feast daily. She casts greater spell
  immunity once she notices intrusion into her realm&#8211;since word of the
  PCs' tactics and abilities has spread, she can choose spells she knows her
  enemies favor. She casts true seeing, air walk, spell resistance, and freedom
  of movement (the last from her staff) before entering combat. Just before
  entering combat, she casts sending to alert Areelu Vorlesh that the PCs are
  attacking her, more out of courtesy than any hope that the witch will send
  help (she won't).
DuringCombat: >-
  Anemora remains out of melee combat, and augments her spells with the Quicken
  Spell metamagic feat each round. Her first act each round is to use a
  quickened wall of stone to wall off some of the PCs while also casting
  blasphemy in hopes of banishing at least one PC. Remember, her faith's reach
  mythic ability allows her to cast spells like quickened slay living, quickened
  poison, mythic harm, and spontaneously cast inflict spells at a range of 30
  feet. She saves her miracle for emergencies. If reduced below 200 hit points,
  she casts heal on herself; if reduced below 200 hp again, she uses her amulet
  of the planes to flee to Golarion, then uses her healing magic to restore
  herself before using the amulet again to return to the Rasping Rifts,
  whereupon she casts word of recall to return to area D11d to continue the
  fight.
Morale: >-
  Anemora uses her amulet of the planes to flee to Golarion if reduced to 50 hit
  points or fewer.
