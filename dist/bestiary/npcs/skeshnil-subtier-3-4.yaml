    description: >-
      A very young or older nightmare dragon can see the dreams of sleeping
      creatures.
DuringCombat: Skeshnil begins with his breath weapon before closing to melee.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, Skeshnil attempts to bargain with the
  PCs, offering them its services in exchange for its life. However, this offer
  is actually a lie; the dragon plans to kill the PCs in their sleep at an
  opportune moment.
