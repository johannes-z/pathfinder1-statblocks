  If the rogues are aware of intruders, they quaff their potions of
  invisibility. Otherwise, they lounge at their stations.
DuringCombat: >-
  The northernmost rogue ambushes the PCs using Point-Blank Shot and then moves
  into the secret corridor; as the PCs advance, the other rogue sneaks up from
  behind. The rogues continue these tactics until cornered, using their
  smokesticks to hide their movements.
