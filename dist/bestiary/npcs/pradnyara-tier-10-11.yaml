BeforeCombat: >-
  If Pradnyara is aware that the "thieves" approach, she casts greater magic
  weapon, owl's wisdom, bull's strength, and divine favor, in that order. Once
  the PCs enter the library, she detects evil.
DuringCombat: >-
  Pradnyara springs down on the PCs, and silently motions for them to surrender.
  If they do not, she attacks&#8211;always choosing to do nonlethal
  damage&#8211;using her flurry of blows whenever she gets a full attack.
  Otherwise, she attacks lightly armored PCs using Scorpion Style. She uses
  Stunning Fist and Vital Strike whenever possible, and smite evil against any
  summoned devils, demons, or other evil outsiders. Pradmyara does not summon
  her mount in the library.
Morale: >-
  If the PCs proclaim their innocence, Pradnyara immediately ceases combat to
  give them a chance to parley. Otherwise, she fights to the death to protect
  the library from the perceived thieves.
