    description: >-
      Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against an
      air elemental.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Iyasset leads off combat by creating a whirlwind to sweep up his foes,
  starting with the smallest targets. If he is facing the PCs, he attacks oreads
  before other enemies. If he reduces a PC to 0 hit points, he takes a round to
  attempt to demoralize the remaining PCs with his Intimidate skill. If Iyasset
  is on the PCs' side, he targets the fire elementals first. He mocks Elsharon,
  using his flight and movement speed to stay out of the earth elemental's
  reach.
Morale: >-
  Iyasset fights to the death against the Goanron representatives. If the PCs
  surrender, he mocks them for siding with Elsharon, but allows them to leave
  with their lives.
