SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Enemy of Dragons and Eagles (Ex)
    description: >-
      Halas are hated enemies of dragons and eagles. Those creatures gain a +2
      bonus on attack and damage rolls against hala demons.
  - name: Hailstorm (Su)
    description: >-
      A hala can call down hailstones from surrounding clouds once every 1d4
      rounds as a standard action. These hailstones deal 1d6 points of
      bludgeoning damage and 1d6 points of cold damage to all creatures within a
      20-foot radius that have no overhead cover. A DC 16 Reflex save halves
      this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. To use this ability, the
      hala must be outside and there must be clouds in the sky.
  - name: Stormwind Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Halas surround themselves with a buffeting shroud of supernatural,
      windstorm-force winds. These winds shield a hala from any other wind
      effects and form a shell of breathable air around it, allowing the hala to
      breathe underwater. Ranged weapons and gases directed toward a hala are
      affected as per wind wall.
  - name: Vengeful Wind (Su)
    description: >-
      Anytime a hala takes damage from a critical hit, a powerful blast of wind
      explodes forth in the direction of the attacker. This blast takes the form
      of a 60-foot-long gale, treated as a gust of wind spell, directed from the
      hala toward the opponent that scored the critical hit against it (if that
      creature is more than 60 feet away, the wind is aimed in its direction but
      doesn't come close enough to affect it). This wind is also charged with
      electricity. Any creature in or that enters the area of effect must make a
      DC 16 Reflex save or take 3d6 points of electricity damage. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Bozhithar tries to keep enemies at bay by using river of wind or gust of wind
  and sending hailstorms at them to soften them up. After a few rounds, he
  closes on the least-armored opponent to finish them in melee.
Morale: >-
  Bozhithar is unwilling to face Pazuzu's eventual wrath for failing in his
  duties. He fights to the death.
