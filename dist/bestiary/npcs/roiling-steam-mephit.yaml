SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Boiling Rain (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, an advanced steam mephit can create a rainstorm of boiling
      water in a 20-foot-square area. Living creatures within the area take 2d10
      points of fire damage (Fortitude DC 14 half; caster level 11th). This
      ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      An advanced steam mephit's breath weapon is a cone of steam that deals
      1d10 fire damage. The scalding water also causes living creatures to be
      sickened for 3 rounds. A Reflex save halves the damage and negates the
      sickened effect. Fast Healing An advanced steam mephit's fast healing only
      works in boiling water or steam. Steam Attacks Despite dealing fire
      damage, an advanced steam mephit's special attacks do not burn away the
      fog created by its obscuring mist spell-like ability unless the mephit
      wishes to do so.
BeforeCombat: >-
  If the mephits hear conflict, they hide in this area and cast blur on
  themselves if combat seems imminent.
DuringCombat: >-
  The mephits use a combination of their breath weapons, boiling rain, and
  hit-and-run claw attacks to harass their foes. A mephit uses obscuring mist if
  it's under serious threat from ranged attacks.
Morale: >-
  Once the PCs defeat one of the mephits, the other mephit only fights until
  reduced to 30 or fewer hit points before surrendering or fleeing. The mephits
  attempt to escape the combat earlier if it's clear their foes are unharmed by
  fire damage.
