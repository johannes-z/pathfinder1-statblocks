BeforeCombat: The thugs remain hidden, waiting for their boss to give the order to attack.
DuringCombat: >-
  The thugs open combat by each hurling a throwing axe at the nearest target.
  Then they draw another and leap into melee. They save the third throwing axe
  for fleeing targets. If reduced to fewer than 7 hit points, they always use
  their next action to retrieve and drink their potion of cure light wounds.
Morale: >-
  The thugs fight so long as their boss is alive. Should their boss fall, they
  flee if reduced to fewer than 5 hit points.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds
OtherGear: chain shirt, heavy wooden shield, throwing axes (3)
