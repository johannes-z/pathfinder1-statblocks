    description: >-
      Shaken, range 30 feet, Will DC 16 negates. This fear effect does not stack
      with itself. The save DC is Charisma-based. Ranseur As long as Davik
      Nettles continues to exist, his +1 ranseur cannot be taken from him. If
      disarmed of the +1 ranseur, or if he drops it, it melts into water-he can
      retrieve his +1 ranseur by pulling it out of any body of water as a
      moveequivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity. If Davik is
      put to rest permanently, his +1 ranseur loses this ability and can be
      claimed by someone else.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Davik Nettles wants vengeance, and the PCs are a handy tool. If they attack
  him, he continues to speak his request for the Stag Lord's death, and if the
  PCs cease their attack and agree to do as Davik commands, the undead creature
  breaks off his attacks, nods, and melts back into the river. While fighting,
  Davik relies on his hideous stench and fear gaze to disrupt organized attempts
  to surround him.
Morale: Davik fights until destroyed.
