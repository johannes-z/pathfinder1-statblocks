SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Drone (Su)
    description: >-
      The sound of a derakni in flight is a mesmerizing, unsettling drone that
      causes confusion in all non-demons who hear the sound. A derakni must fly
      at least 10 feet to activate this ability (which it can do as a free
      action as part of its move action). Any non-demon creature that begins its
      turn within 30 feet of a derakni that moved in this manner on its previous
      turn must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds.
      A creature that makes this save is immune to the drone of that derakni for
      24 hours. Demons are immune to this sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save
      DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite or sting-injury; save Fort DC 21; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds;
      effect 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
BeforeCombat: >-
  When the PCs arrive, the derakni is busy rummaging through the belongings left
  behind by Venture- Captain Nikolai Adonai when he and his agents abandoned the
  camp.
DuringCombat: >-
  The derakni prefers to stay out of reach for several rounds while it softens
  its enemies with spell-like abilities. It then uses its natural weapons to
  deadly effect. If it is having trouble dispatching the PCs, it falls back to
  summon additional swarms.
Morale: >-
  The derakni would rather not die on the Material Plane, and it attempts to
  teleport away if reduced to 30 or fewer hit points or if all of its swarms
  have dispersed.
