BeforeCombat: Fayaz casts gravity bow if she senses imminent danger.
DuringCombat: >-
  Fayaz initiates combat by flipping her table over as a move action and drawing
  her crossbow. She sends her goons into melee and uses her hunter's bond
  ability to confer on them her favored enemy bonus, then casts entangle
  centered on the flowstone column to hinder foes leaving or entering the room
  from either exit. She stays behind her desk and fires her crossbow at enemies,
  but if drawn into melee, she drinks her potion of enlarge person and takes to
  the fray with her heavy pick.
