BeforeCombat: >-
  Jando begins every day by casting endure elements on himself. If he believes
  he might be tracked by any animals (or other creatures with scent), he casts
  pass without trace on himself before beginning his daily patrol of Roslar's
  Coffer.
DuringCombat: >-
  If he holds an elevated position over his foes, Jando makes full attacks with
  his longbow. Otherwise, he attempts to stay on the move each round.
Morale: >-
  The half-orc ranger isn't foolhardy enough to throw his life away in a fight.
  If reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, he attempts to flee, taking to the
  trees if possible. If he is fighting undead or cultists of the Whispering Way,
  he doesn't retreat until reduced to fewer than 10 hit points.
Gear: potion of cure light wounds (2)
