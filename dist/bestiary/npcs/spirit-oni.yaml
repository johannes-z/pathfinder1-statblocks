SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mask Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A spirit oni is a living creature, but takes the shape of a limbless
      object, most often an evil-looking mask. If the oni remains stationary in
      such a form, it can attempt Stealth checks even while being observed. It
      appears to be an object. If a spirit oni serves as a familiar, its wearer
      does not gain a gore attack. This attack can only be made when the oni is
      moving on its own.
