SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Curse of Immortality (Su)
    description: >-
      Cursed by Torag with eternal life, Lokmorr does not age and his ability
      scores are unaffected by aging effects. He cannot die from old age,
      starvation, thirst, or suffocation, though he can still be slain by
      physical damage. This ability grants Lokmorr fast healing 10, but if he is
      reduced to -22 hit points or fails his saving throw against a coup de
      grace, he dies.
Gender: Male
DuringCombat: >-
  Lokmorr begins with an agonized wail to terrify his opponents, then
  indiscriminately attacks those creatures within the reach of Heartspit, using
  Power Attack and Bloody Assault.
Morale: >-
  Enraged and insane, Lokmorr continues fighting as long as his curse of
  immortality and Diehard feat allow him to. If he's finally slain, however,
  Lokmorr's body crumbles into dust as 707 years of aging finally catch up to
  him.
Gear: >-
  mwk breastplate, Heartspit (Large +1 giant-bane longspear; see page 12),
  Nargrym's steel hand (see page 13), elaborately braided dwarven beard
  decorated with three gold rings (worth 50 gp each) and an intricately engraved
  platinum beard clasp in the shape of a castle sitting atop a cloud (worth
  1,300 gp)
