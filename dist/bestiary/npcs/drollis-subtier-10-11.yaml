BeforeCombat: >-
  Drollis ate a sigil wafer that contained a fragment of a lethe house victim's
  soul 3 months ago. It gives him a +2 profane bonus to Dexterity. He drinks his
  potion of mage armor before interacting with the Pathfinders.
DuringCombat: >-
  Drollis initiates combat by pulling the cover off the symbol in the room, or
  he pulls it during the first round of combat. Drollis is lazy and doesn't like
  to move, even in combat. If forced to do so, he grudgingly waddles into
  position, grumbling the whole way. On a round he's limited to a standard
  action, Drollis expertly lobs a disgusting ball of chewing tobacco into an
  opponent's eyes (using the dirty trick combat maneuver to blind). The rest of
  the time, Drollis trips opponents so he can set up thugs to do his dirty work
  with sneak attack. Anytime he can make a full attack, Drollis spends a ki
  point to get an extra attack. Additionally, Drollis uses Stunning Fist on the
  first qualified attack each round.
Morale: >-
  Loyal to the cult, Drollis will give his life to prevent anyone from getting
  to the basement temple.

  potions of cure moderate wounds (3), potion of invisibility, potion of mage
  armor
