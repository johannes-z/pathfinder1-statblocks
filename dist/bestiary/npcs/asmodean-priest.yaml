DuringCombat: >-
  These priests protect their superiors; when in the presence of Aluceda or
  Corinstian, one priest moves to cast shield other on a superior while others
  move in to refresh the spell as their  colleagues die. They use sending to
  raise alerts, and air walk to pursue fleeing foes. Otherwise, the priests
  focus on channeling energy or using their attack spells. They switch to melee
  only when forced, or when doing so would prevent a foe from engaging a
  superior in melee. An Asmodean priest prefers to save his healing spells to
  aid his betters, but if reduced to 10 or fewer hit points, he casts sanctuary
  and then moves to support allies with healing rather than continue direct
  combat.
Morale: Asmodean priests fight to the death.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds (3), potion of cure serious wounds (2)
