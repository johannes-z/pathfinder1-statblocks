SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Corrupting Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      All ghosts gain this incorporeal touch attack. By passing part of its
      incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard action, the ghost
      inflicts a number of d6s equal to its CR in damage. This damage is not
      negative energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from
      supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this
      damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A
      Fortitude save halves the damage inflicted.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat:
      the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful
      spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently
      destroy a ghost is to determine the reason for its existence and set right
      whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with
      each spirit and may require a good deal of research, and should be created
      specifically for each different ghost by the GM.
