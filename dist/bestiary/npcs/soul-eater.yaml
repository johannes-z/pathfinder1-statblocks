SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Around Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A soul eater's entire body functions as its eyes. This allows it to see in
      all directions at once. It cannot be flanked.
  - name: Caster Link (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a soul eater is summoned to the Material Plane, it creates a mental
      link between itself and the caster who summoned it. If the soul eater's
      assigned target dies before the soul eater can devour its soul, the soul
      eater returns at full speed to the caster and attacks him. Likewise, if
      the soul eater is defeated in battle (but not slain) by its target, the
      creature returns to the caster and attacks him. So long as both the caster
      and the soul eater are on the same plane of existence, the soul eater can
      successfully locate the caster using its find target ability. If the
      caster leaves the plane, the link is temporarily broken. Once the caster
      returns or the soul eater enters the plane the caster is now on, the link
      is immediately restored.
  - name: Find Target (Su)
    description: >-
      When ordered to find a creature, a soul eater does so unerringly, as
      though guided by a locate creature spell that has no maximum range and is
      not blocked by running water. The being giving the order must have seen
      the creature to be found and must speak the target's name (this limits
      Vordakai's choices to PCs whose name he knows learned through observation
      via his familiar).
  - name: Soul Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      When a soul eater reduces a foe to 0 Wisdom, it can devour that creature's
      soul as a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. The
      victim can resist having his soul drained by making a DC 17 Fortitude
      save. If he does, he is slain but can be restored to life normally. If the
      victim fails, he is immediately slain and his soul is consumed by the soul
      drinker. A victim slain in this manner cannot be returned to life through
      clone, raise dead, reincarnation, resurrection, true resurrection, or even
      a miracle or wish. The victim's soul remains within the essence of the
      soul eater forever-unless the soul eater is slain while the victim's body
      is within 30 feet and the victim has been dead for no more than 1 minute.
      In that case, the victim's soul returns to the body and restores it to
      life (although at &#8211;1 hit point). This is a death effect. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Wisdom Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by a soul eater's claw must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude
      save or take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The soul eater prefers to attack its assigned target character. If detected
  before it reaches its foe, it attempts to kill guards in order to complete its
  dark errand.
Morale: The soul drinker fights to the death.
