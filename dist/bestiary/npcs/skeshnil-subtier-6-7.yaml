    description: >-
      Skeshnil can cast true strike 6/day and ghost sound at will. His spells
      have thought components in place of verbal components and emotion
      components in place of somatic components. Thought components do not
      require speech, but the DC of a concentration check to cast a spell with a
      thought component increases by 10 unless he spends a move action to center
      himself first. He cannot cast a spell with an emotion component if under
      the effects of a non-harmless effect with the emotion or fear descriptor.
      These components are introduced in Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures.
DuringCombat: Skeshnil begins with his breath weapon before closing to melee.
Morale: >-
  If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, Skeshnil attempts to bargain with the
  PCs, offering them its services in exchange for its life. This offer is a lie;
  the dragon plans to kill the PCs in their sleep at an opportune moment.
