SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bloodline Tattoos (Ex)
    description: >-
      Isabella's bonus bloodline spells are represented by tattoos on her body
      and are enhanced by her Varisian Tattoo feat, even if they belong to a
      different school.
  - name: Create Spell Tattoo (Su)
    description: >-
      Isabella can create a spell tattoo (Inner Sea Magic 16) with a touch as a
      standard action once per day. The recipient must be willing to receive the
      tattoo, which is a silent, spell completion item that only the bearer can
      activate with a touch. The spell tattoo must be of a spell she knows that
      has no material or focus component. The spell tattoo vanishes when
      activated.
  - name: Enhanced Varisian Tattoo (Su)
    description: >-
      Isabella gains Varisian Tattoo (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea
      World Guide 289) as a bonus feat. Drawing on her tattoos, she can cast
      geyser as a spell-like ability once per day at caster level 11th.
  - name: Familiar Tattoo (Su)
    description: >-
      Isabella gains a sea snake familiar named Moto as an arcane bond. Her
      familiar can transform itself into a tattoo on her body or back to its
      normal familiar form as a move action. In tattoo form, her familiar does
      not count as a separate creature, but it continues to grant its special
      familiar ability. It has no other abilities and can take no other actions
      except to transform from a tattoo into a creature.
Gender: Female
Bloodline: aquatic*
BeforeCombat: >-
  Isabella casts false life, mage armor, protection from arrows, and slipstream
  on herself before combat, and casts false life and invisibility on her
  familiar Moto (already included in its stat block on page 36) before
  transforming it into its tattoo form. She also creates a spell tattoo of
  vampiric touch on herself.
DuringCombat: >-
  Isabella casts obscuring mist to hide her longboats' approach to Tidewater
  Rock, then casts lightning bolts to breach the castle's door. While the
  pirates press their attack, Isabella casts fly and invisibility and flies to
  the top of the tower in an attempt to infiltrate it from above, casting summon
  monster IV to summon a salt mephit to cover her entrance into the tower. Once
  inside, Isabella calls forth her familiar Moto from its tattoo and designates
  it to deliver a vampiric touch spell. She then seeks out the leader of the
  tower forces and attempts to assassinate that character before attacking the
  tower's defenders from the rear. If attacked in the water, Isabella casts
  summon monster IV to summon fiendish sharks to attack foes.
Morale: >-
  Isabella believes in neither giving nor receiving quarter. She refuses to
  retreat, and if captured alive, she swallows a poison sea urchin spine hidden
  in a compartment in her false teeth, causing her death 1 round later.
Gear: spell tattoo of vampiric touch**
