SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Corrupting Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      The ghost is disfigured through age or violence, and has a gaze attack
      with a range of 30 feet that causes 2d10 damage and 1d4 Charisma damage
      (Fortitude save negates Charisma damage but not physical damage).
  - name: Ghostly Possessions (Su)
    description: >-
      A side effect of Igni's transformation was to imbue his armor and weapons
      with the ghost touch enhancement. However, Igni's gear is also considered
      incorporeal so only creatures on the ethereal plane can hold or wear
      Igni's sword, bow and armor.
  - name: Frightful Moan (Su)
    description: >-
      The ghost died in the throes of crippling terror. It can emit a frightful
      moan as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread
      must succeed on a Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a
      sonic mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves
      against the moan cannot be affected by the same ghost's moan for 24 hours.
  - name: Telekinesis (Su)
    description: >-
      The ghost's death involved great physical trauma. The ghost can use
      telekinesis as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds (caster level 12th
      or equal to the ghost's HD, whichever is higher).
Gear: >-
  +1 ghost touch full plate, +1 ghost touch heavy steel shield, +4 ghost touch
  longsword, +2 ghost touch longbow, 12 +1 ghost touch arrows
