    description: >-
      Moukadeem is filled with hatred for the world, and plots to destroy
      everything and everyone around him. He has become chaotic evil and has a
      +10 competence bonus on Bluff checks to hide his insanity.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  When the secret door to his chamber opens, Moukadeem casts see invisibility
  and obscuring mist.
DuringCombat: >-
  Moukadeem lashes out violently at the PCs, using cone of cold, elemental
  swarm, and ice storm as long as he has the room to safely cast. When the PCs
  engage him in melee, he resorts to physical attacks. If the PCs specifically
  avoid dealing lethal damage to Zahra or attempt to cure her insanity, give
  Moukadeem a DC 20 Sense Motive check each round to realize this. If he
  succeeds, he begins attacking her, recognizing that the PCs want her alive.
Morale: >-
  Moukadeem cannot flee the lantern vault due to the dimensional anchor and
  fights to the death.
