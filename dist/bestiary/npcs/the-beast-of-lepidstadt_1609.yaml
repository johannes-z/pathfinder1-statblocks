  - name: Rage (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Beast does not gain a bonus to its Constitution while in a rage, nor
      does it gain any extra hit points. Likewise, it is not fatigued after
      rage.
DuringCombat: >-
  If not under the control of the Bondslave Thrall, the Beast rages and attacks
  the Aberrant Promethean so that it can free Caromarc from his imprisonment.

  fights until destroyed. On its own, the Beast flees from battle if reduced to
  fewer than 30 hit points.
