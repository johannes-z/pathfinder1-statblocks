  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Leng Ghoul Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 23; onset immediate; effect
      1d3 Con and 1d4 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The Save DC is
      Charisma-based. A humanoid who succumbs to Leng ghoul fever becomes a
      normal ghoul unless it had 12 or more Hit Dice in life, in which case it
      rises from death as a Leng ghoul.
DuringCombat: >-
  The gendarmes are leery of spellcasters and prioritize them as targets with
  their firearms. If disarmed or in close combat, the gendarmes revert to full
  attacks with their claw and bite. They use their clubs only if they wish to
  deal nonlethal damage.
Morale: The gendarmes offer to surrender if reduced to 40 hit points or fewer.
