SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Brittle (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bludgeoning and sonic attacks can deal critical hits to a carnivorous
      crystal. A successful critical hit from such attacks causes the
      carnivorous crystal to split, even if the attack itself causes no damage.
      The crystal remains immune to precision-based damage, such as damage from
      sneak attacks.
  - name: Crystallize (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature entrapped by a carnivorous crystal's attack must succeed at a
      DC 22 Fortitude save each round or become helpless. If a helpless creature
      fails this save, it becomes petrified as its body crystallizes. In 1d4
      hours, the petrified victim shatters and a new carnivorous crystal emerges
      from the remains. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Razor Sharp (Ex)
    description: >-
      A carnivorous crystal's slam attack deals devastating piercing and
      slashing damage, and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19, or 20.
  - name: Subsonic Hum (Su)
    description: >-
      An active carnivorous crystal gives off supernatural sonic vibrations. Any
      living creature starting its turn within this aura must succeed at a DC 22
      Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. A creature that successfully
      saves cannot be affected by the same carnivorous crystal's subsonic hum
      for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
