    description: >-
      The Iron Lash of Meratt is a formidable beast. In addition to having the
      advanced simple template, the manticore has spikes that carry a metallic
      sheen and cause bleed damage when they strike a foe. In addition, the
      creature can make two secondary attacks with its wings, has the pounce
      special attack, and has light fortification. All of these features
      increase its CR by 2.
DuringCombat: >-
  While it would rather focus on the easy meal Moffis represents, the beast
  turns to engage the PCs upon taking any damage.
Morale: The Iron Lash fights until slain.
