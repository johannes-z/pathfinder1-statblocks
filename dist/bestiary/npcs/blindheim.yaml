  - name: Blinding Gaze (Ex)
    description: >-
      A blindheim's eyes emit bright light to a range of 30 feet. Any creature
      in that area must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 hour.
      Blindheims can see normally in the light generated by their eyes, which
      illuminates a 30-foot spread with bright light. Creatures with light
      blindness or light sensitivity take the normal penalties within 30 feet of
      a blindheim that is using its blinding gaze. A blindheim can activate or
      suppress this ability as a free action. The save DC is constitution based.
