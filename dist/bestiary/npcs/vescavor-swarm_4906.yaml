SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gibber (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature within 15 feet of a vescavor swarm or inside it must succeed
      at a successful 15 Will save or be confused for 1 round. This is a
      mind-affecting compulsion insanity effect. A creature that saves cannot be
      affected by the same vescavor swarm's gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Ravenous (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a vescavor swarm attacks an object or structure, it ignores up to 19
      points of hardness (hardness of 20 or higher applies in full). Every round
      a creature is in the same space as the swarm, the vescavors begin
      devouring one object on the creature. The object takes half its maximum
      hit points in damage and gains the broken condition. If the vescavors
      attack an object with the broken condition, it is destroyed. An attended
      or magic object can attempt a successful 15 Reflex save to negate this
      effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Traumatizing (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature that spends more than 3 rounds inside a vescavor swarm must
      succeed at DC 13 Will save or gain a type of madness (determined randomly
      from the list on page 250 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide). The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The vescavors surround any quarry to cut off retreat, all while singing the
  chorus of the Abyss to inflict madness on intruders with their gibber and
  traumatizing abilities. While swarming over opponents, they also devour any
  weapons and armor to further weaken those venturing into their lair.
Morale: A vescavor swarm fights to the death.
