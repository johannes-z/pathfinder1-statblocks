      A crazed creature's mind is shattered. A crazed creature no longer desires
      magical trinkets such as weapons, armor, or wondrous items. Instead, it
      seeks only to take trophies from those it kills, such as teeth or ears. It
      leaves behind anything of actual value. Typically, a crazed creature
      possesses one weapon and ratty leather or hide armor.
