SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Control Water Elemental (Ex)
    description: >-
      With a successful Intelligence check (DC 10), a water weird may control a
      single water elemental within 30 feet of it, as though it had summoned it
      with a summon monster spell. If the elemental is already under the control
      of another caster, the DC of the Intelligence check is instead 10 plus the
      Intelligence modifier of the creature controlling the elemental. Control
      lasts for a number of hours equal to the water weird's Hit Dice.
  - name: Drown (Ex)
    description: >-
      A water weird who successfully grabs an opponent attempts to pin it under
      water. A creature unable to escape the water weird's pin who fails its
      Fortitude save (DC 15) begins to drown. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Reform Body (Ex)
    description: >-
      When reduced to zero or fewer hit points, the water weird collapses. If it
      was on water at the time, it reforms at full strength 1d4+1 rounds later.
      A purify food and drink spell deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level
      (max 10d4), and any damage sustained in this manner is not regained when
      the water weird reforms.
  - name: Transparent (Ex)
    description: A water weird is effectively invisible in water until it attacks.
  - name: Water Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A water weird gains a +1 circumstance bonus to attacks and damage for
      every 4 Hit Dice it possesses if both it and its opponent touch water. If
      the opponent or water weird is on land, it instead suffers a -4 penalty to
      attack and damage. (The statistics block above does not include this
      bonus.)
