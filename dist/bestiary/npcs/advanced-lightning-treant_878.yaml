SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Double Damage Against Objects (Ex)
    description: >-
      A lightning treant that makes a full attack against an object or structure
      deals double damage.
  - name: Electric Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      Electricity damage heals a lightning treant 1 point of damage for every 3
      points it would otherwise deal. If the amount would cause the lightning
      treant to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as
      temporary hit points-these temporary hit points last for 2 hours.
DuringCombat: >-
  If a lightning treant can't reach the PCs, it uses its spell-like abilities to
  attack from afar, making sure to catch other treants in the area of effect if
  it can to provide healing.
Morale: The lightning treants fight to the death.
