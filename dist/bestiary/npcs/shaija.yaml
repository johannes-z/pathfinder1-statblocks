DuringCombat: >-
  Shaija coordinates with her fellow cyclopes, encouraging them to use their
  flash of insight abilities to swiftly take down battle-hardened opponents with
  critical hits and Power Attacks&#8211;or, in her case, with a single Vital
  Strike. If she's able to easily hit foes, Shaija attacks with both her axe and
  spiked shield, but she switches to Power Attacks with just her axe if she
  needs to inflict more damage.
Morale: >-
  Once Shaija falls below 40 hit points, or when only two of her cyclops
  partners remain, Shaija orders one of them to warn Ishtoreth in area G17,
  intent on buying the great cyclops time to prepare. She then relies on her
  ferocity to keep fighting her foes to the death.
Gear: >-
  masterwork hide armor, masterwork heavy spiked wooden shield, +1 battleaxe,
  masterwork heavy crossbow with 10 bolts
