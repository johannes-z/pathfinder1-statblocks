  Sabo prefers to use her judgment of healing during a fight; her fast healing
  gained by this judgment is included in the statistics above. She prefers to
  let her guards fight in melee while she holds back and uses spells at range or
  steps in to heal a wounded guard as needed. Once she's forced into melee
  herself, she casts shield of faith.
Morale: >-
  Sabo is fiercely loyal to the Church of Asmodeus&#8211; and thus her position
  as warden&#8211;and fights to the death.

  prison key, skeleton cell key, 318 gp
