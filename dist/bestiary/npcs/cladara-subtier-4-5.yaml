Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Cladara drinks her mutagen, improving her Constitution at the expense of her
  Charisma. She uses her concentrate poison discovery to apply 2 doses of Large
  scorpion venom to her dagger, then applies her violet venom to her +1 rapier,
  using her lasting poison trick to get two uses out of the dose. She drinks her
  false life and shield extracts, then drinks her elixir of hiding and hides
  behind the western table, hoping to get a surprise round when the PCs enter.
  While hiding, she drinks a true strike extract just before the surprise round.
DuringCombat: >-
  Cladara uses a surprise round to throw her poisoned dagger with Point-Blank
  Shot at a heavily-armored target within sneak attack range. She then throws a
  stink bomb before using a smoke bomb to provide concealment for herself,
  hiding in the smoke to snipe with her bombs or strike adjacent enemies with
  her poisoned rapier. If she misses often, she hides in the smoke and drinks
  her bomber's eye or true strike extracts to hit ranged or melee combatants,
  respectively.
Morale: >-
  Cladara drinks her cure light wounds extract if brought below 30 hit points,
  then fights to the death.
