SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mark of Wrath (Su)
    description: >-
      Highlady Athroxis wears the mark of her rulership on her flesh-a faintly
      glowing tattoo-like rune on her forehead that moves through the
      generations from one ruler to the next. The mark of wrath provides her
      with a +1 insight bonus to AC and on attack and damage rolls. Once per day
      as a swift action, she can call upon the mark to protect her with a fire
      shield (CL 15th). If she is slain in combat, the mark of wrath transfers
      to the brow of her defeater. It can only be transferred again on that
      character's death at the hands of another, but can be removed with a
      successful break enchantment against CL 20th. Once removed in this manner,
      it vanishes forever.
Gender: Female
ProhibitedSchools: abjuration, conjuration
BeforeCombat: >-
  Athroxis casts greater magic weapon and keen edge on her ranseur daily, and
  false life on herself. When she sees the PCs reach area K3, she casts fly and
  mirror image on herself as well.
DuringCombat: >-
  Athroxis casts haste immediately before combat begins, and then uses her cone
  of cold spells. She favors spells like blindness/deafness and her still
  spells, since they aren't impacted by her spell failure chance. When she
  engages in melee, she uses Combat Expertise&#8211;this penalizes her attack
  rolls by &#8211;4 but increases her AC by +4.
Morale: >-
  Athroxis fights to the death. If reduced to 15 or fewer hit points, she
  willingly sacrifices herself, centering a fireball on herself if doing so
  catches a number of PCs in the blast.
Gear: >-
  wand of clairvoyance/clairaudience (32 charges), wand of lightning bolt (CL
  10th, 25 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +4 mithral breastplate, +1 adamantine flaming ranseur, amulet of natural armor
  +2, belt of physical perfection +2, cloak of resistance +3, headband of vast
  intelligence +2, ring of protection +2, spell component pouch, spellbook
