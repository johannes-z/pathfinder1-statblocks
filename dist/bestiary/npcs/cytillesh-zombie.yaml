  - name: Cytillesh Symbiosis (Su)
    description: >-
      The cytillesh fungus infesting the host creature's body acts as the dead
      flesh's animating force. It grants the creature a +4 enhancement bonus to
      Strength and Dexterity and a poisonous touch. The slam of a cytillesh
      zombie releases spores that subject the creature to a mild dose of
      cytillesh poison. The creature must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or
      become dazed for 1d3 rounds as it suffers memory loss of the previous
      moments. Multiple poisoning effects do not stack, but rather only extend
      the duration.
  - name: Quick Strikes (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a cytillesh zombie takes a full-attack action, it can make one
      additional slam attack at its highest base attack bonus.
DuringCombat: >-
  A cytillesh zombie attacks any creature trying to interact with it verbally or
  physically. Once it targets an opponent, it continues attacking its target
  until the target or the zombie is dead or destroyed.
Morale: A cytillesh zombie fights to the death.
