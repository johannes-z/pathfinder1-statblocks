SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Divide (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a mustard jelly can split into two identical
      jellies, each with half the original's hit points (round down). A mustard
      jelly with 10 hit points or fewer cannot divide itself. When divided, each
      jelly moves at a speed of 40 feet.
  - name: Energy Absorption (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mustard jelly is immune to electricity and magic missiles. If targeted
      by such an effect, it gains temporary hit points equal to the damage that
      attack would have normally done. These temporary hit points last for 1
      hour.
  - name: Toxic Gas (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mustard jelly exudes an aura of toxic gas in a 10-ft.-radius spread. A
      creature in this area must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save each round or
      be slowed (as per slow) for as long as it remains in the area plus an
      additional 1d4 rounds. This is a poison effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
DuringCombat: >-
  The fiendish mustard jelly waits until someone tries to step more than 5 feet
  into the room to attack.
Morale: The fiendish mustard jelly fights to the death.
