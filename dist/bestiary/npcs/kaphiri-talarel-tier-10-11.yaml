DuringCombat: >-
  As soon as Kaphiri draws his khopesh, he is forced to attack the nearest
  creature until there are no living things within 30 feet. He is constrained to
  fight as follows: He must attack for lethal damage, he can't use the Combat
  Expertise or Power Attack feat, he must take attacks of opportunity and use
  the Step Up feat to follow up a foe, and he can't intentionally make trip
  attacks, but if he scores a critical hit, his Tripping Strike feat means he
  makes a trip attempt (and the follow-up attack of opportunity from the Greater
  Trip feat) against that foe. Apart from this, Kaphiri tries to help the PCs to
  put him down, giving them advice and trying to not attack downed foes if
  possible.
Morale: >-
  While under the effects of the berserking khopesh, Kaphiri is forced to fight
  to the death. If he is disarmed of the weapon, he immediately surrenders.
Gear: >-
  +2 full plate, +2 berserking khopesh, ring of protection +1, cloak of
  resistance +3, dagger
