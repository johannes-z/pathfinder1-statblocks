BeforeCombat: Nox summons a lemure to aid in any upcoming fight.
DuringCombat: >-
  Nox avoids using rage on herself (since she can't use dimension door while
  under its effects), but uses rage on her hell hound Mephiry as soon as combat
  begins. She uses her glaive to keep herself out of her foes' reach, and uses
  her pole fighting ability to attack adjacent foes if needed (remember that
  doing so imposes a &#8211;4 penalty on her attack rolls). When she's not using
  pole fighting, Nox instead uses Power Attack, taking a &#8211;2 penalty on
  attack rolls but gaining a +4 bonus on damage rolls.
Morale: >-
  Although she's confident in her regenerative powers, Nox isn't foolish; she
  knows that if she's knocked unconscious, survival is by no means guaranteed.
  If reduced to 10 or fewer hit points, she uses dimension door to reach the
  surface and flees to the opera house to report her failure to Thrune.
Gear: >-
  +1 chainmail, +1 glaive, throwing axes (4), cloak of resistance +1, bedroll,
  waterskin, diamond dust (worth 500 gp), mithral key (unlocks all doors in the
  complex, worth 150 gp), 9 pp, 70 gp
