SpecialAbilities: []
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  King Irovetti casts three alarm spells every morning (one at area Q1, one at
  Q10, and one at T3), along with undetectable alignment and unseen servant so
  he never has to take time to open doors on his own. If an alarm is raised, he
  also casts cat's grace on himself.
DuringCombat: >-
  King Irovetti activates his boots of speed at the start of combat, along with
  his inspire courage ability&#8211;both of these effects are calculated in the
  stat block above. For the first few rounds of combat, he lets his guards enter
  melee while he hangs back and casts displacement and various ranged attack
  spells. If he's still around after 3 rounds, his increased courage leads him
  to enter melee wielding his rod of razors. He always uses Arcane Strike when
  he attacks (this damage bonus is included in his stats above).
Morale: >-
  King Irovetti flees via his dimension door contingency if he ever takes more
  than 10 points of damage from a single attack. He also flees via dimension
  door to area T1 if he's reduced to 100 hit points or fewer or is otherwise
  hurt badly by a magical effect that doesn't do hit point damage. He resorts to
  greater invisibility and physical retreat if he can't teleport.
Gear: >-
  potions of lesser restoration (4), scroll of heal, scroll of restoration,
  scroll of teleport, wand of hold monster (CL 10th, 13 charges)
OtherGear: >-
  +5 mithral breastplate, rod of razors, amulet of natural armor +2, boots of
  speed, cloak of resistance +4, ring of protection +3, master key (unlocks all
  locks in the palace), mindrender baton
