SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoid creature that is slain by a barrow wight becomes a barrow
      wight itself in only 1d4 rounds. Spawn so created are less powerful than
      typical barrow wights, and suffer a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and
      checks, as well as -2 hp per HD. Spawn are under the command of the barrow
      wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which
      point they lose their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and
      free-willed barrow wights. They do not possess any of the abilities they
      had in life.
  - name: Insanity Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Anyone within 30 ft. that meets a barrow wight's gaze is affected as if by
      an insanity spell. A successful DC 16 Will save negates the effect and
      renders the target immune to the same barrow wight's insanity gaze for 24
      hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)
    description: >-
      A raise dead spell cast on a barrow wight destroys it (Will negates).
      Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.
