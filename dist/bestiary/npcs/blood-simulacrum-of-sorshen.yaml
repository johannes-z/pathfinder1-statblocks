SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Simulacrum (Su)
    description: >-
      Any divination spell that attempts to locate or otherwise target the real
      Sorshen is instead redirected to target this simulacrum. The caster of the
      divination spell can notice the redirection with a successful DC 40
      Spellcraft check as the divination spell is cast, but even if the
      redirection is noted, it is impossible to tell where the effect was
      redirected from. This effect also affects long-distance spells like
      demand, dream, nightmare, and sending, but not mental communication such
      as telepathy.
  - name: Everdawn Infusion (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sorshen calculates her hit points using her Charisma modifier rather than
      her Constitution modifier, and she is immune to bleed effects.
  - name: Exceptional Statistics (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sorshen's ability scores were generated using 25 points rather than using
      the standard 15. In addition, the simulacrum has much more gear than a PC
      of her level would normally have. These modifications increase her total
      CR by 1.
Gender: Female
ProhibitedSchools: necromancy, transmutation
BeforeCombat: >-
  Sorshen casts nondetection, unseen servant, and mage armor on herself just
  before meeting the PCs.
DuringCombat: >-
  Sorshen's first action in combat is to use her ring of invisibility to avoid
  the conflict if possible. If directly confronted, she casts dominate person
  and charm monster to secure temporary bodyguards before becoming invisible so
  she can safely cast mirror image and then relocate to a more advantageous
  position.
Morale: >-
  This simulacrum loses interest in any fight in which she's reduced to 50 or
  fewer hit points, whereupon she casts dimension door to return to the hidden
  domain deep under Korvosa where the real Sorshen can repair her.
Gear: potions of lesser restoration (8), ring of invisibility
