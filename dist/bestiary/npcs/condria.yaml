BeforeCombat: Condria is invisible when combat begins.
DuringCombat: >-
  She maneuvers from location to location, observing the PCs and psychically
  animating her petrified servants. If detected or if she can place herself in a
  position to affect more than three PCs with her petrifying gaze, Condria
  becomes visible (probably by casting slow on her enemies). She uses dimension
  door and invisibility to disappear from combat, repositioning herself for a
  deadly attack.
Morale: >-
  Condria does not flee, protecting her home to the death. If she is killed,
  Narven's curse reforms her mortal body at area M4 24 hours later. She cannot
  leave the Maze of the Open Road under any circumstances.
