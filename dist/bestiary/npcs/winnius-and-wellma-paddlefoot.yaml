DuringCombat: >-
  Winnius and Wellma focus on the same foe, flanking if possible. On the first
  round of combat, they each take a move action to gain Weapon Focus (unarmed
  strike) via martial flexibility (gaining a +1 bonus on attacks with their
  fists). As soon as one of them is brought to fewer than 7 hit points, both
  take move actions to change the feat they gain from martial flexibility to
  Dodge in order to receive a bonus to Armor Class.
Morale: >-
  The happy couple plans to fight to the death. But if one of them falls, the
  other panics and attempts to flee-if successful, the surviving halfling may
  come back to seek revenge on the goblins later, but does not return during
  this adventure.
