BeforeCombat: Knuckles applies bloodroot poison to his spiked gauntlets before combat.
DuringCombat: >-
  Knuckles wades into melee with his spiked gauntlets. He attempts to charge the
  enemy captain on the first round of combat, using his Charge Through feat to
  force his way through, if necessary.  Thereafter, he attempts to bull rush
  opponents overboard.
Morale: >-
  Knuckles has more bluster than courage, so if he is reduced to 25 hit points
  or fewer, he calls for parley, offering to surrender the Thresher to the PCs
  and join their crew as a loyal follower.
Gear: bloodroot poison (4 doses)
OtherGear: +1 breastplate, +1 spiked gauntlets (2), belt of giant strength +2
