DuringCombat: >-
  If faced in area D2, the Hellknights stand behind the barricades and fire
  arrows at the PCs. Otherwise, they prefer to fight in teams, attempting to
  flank foes if possible and using Greater Sunder with Power Attack to smash
  through enemy weaponry. They assume all PCs are chaotic and use smite chaos on
  their first targets unless they have the opportunity to use detect chaos and
  make more informed decisions.
Morale: The Hellknights fight to the death.

  +1 Hellknight plate, +1 heavy steel shield, +1 longsword, composite longbow
  (+2 Str) with 20 arrows, cloak of resistance +1, 315 gp
