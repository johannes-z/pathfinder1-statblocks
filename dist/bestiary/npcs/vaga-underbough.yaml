BeforeCombat: >-
  Vaga attempts to position herself in the most advantageous location while her
  disguise is still in effect. She ensures that her dagger is coated in a dose
  of shadow essence whenever possible so her first attack with the weapon will
  be deadly.
DuringCombat: >-
  Vaga prefers deception and capitalizing on her targets' moments of weakness
  rather than open combat, but when forced to fight, she does so with the fury
  expected of a killer of her renown. If adjacent to a flat- footed foe at the
  start of combat, she initiates with a sneak attack; otherwise, she activates
  her boots of levitation immediately, hovering above her enemies to avoid melee
  attacks. While she has a 10% arcane spell failure chance from her leather
  armor, she nevertheless knows that her strength is in her spellcasting rather
  than physical damage. Thus, she lets her yeth hound minion fight in her stead
  while she casts offensive spells from range. If the hound appears near death,
  Vaga casts summon monster II to bring a fiendish giant spider to her aid.
Morale: >-
  Vaga is overwhelmed by her urge to kill, and even when her carefully crafted
  plans fall apart, she can't bring herself to surrender or relent until all her
  enemies are dead. As such, she fights to the death.
Gear: >-
  potion of gaseous form, wand of misdirection (CL 12th, 6 charges), shadow
  essence (2 doses)
