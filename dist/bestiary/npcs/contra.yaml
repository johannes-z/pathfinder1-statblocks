  - name: Swarming (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ratfolk are used to living and fighting communally, and are adept at
      swarming foes for their own gain and their foes' detriment. Up to two
      ratfolk can share the same square at the same time. If two ratfolk in the
      same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that
      foe as if they were in two opposite squares.
