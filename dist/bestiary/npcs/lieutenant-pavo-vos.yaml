DuringCombat: >-
  If surprised, Vos blows his signal horn in an attempt to call any remaining
  hobgoblin forces to his side. Vos is a cagey fighter and prefers to have a
  wall at his back so that it is more difficult for others to flank him. He
  expects his allies to flank with him, and curses them loudly if they fail to
  do so.
Morale: >-
  Vos is no fool, and surrenders if his allies fall and he is brought to fewer
  than 15 hit points, offering the PCs not only the keep, but valuable
  information besides.
Gear: potion of cure moderate wounds
