    description: >-

      that uses freeze can take 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight
      as a stone statue.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Ajekrith enjoys perching among carved stone gargoyles and other city
  decorations, blending in and observing all who pass by. He sometimes waits
  above an alley or entrance to a spooky church, relying on stealth to give him
  an advantage against an unsuspecting victim.
DuringCombat: >-
  Ajekrith prefers to ambush lone prey, silently tracking his target from above.
  When a choice moment presents itself, he swoops down with a flyby sneak
  attack. Once a victim is bleeding, Ajekrith pulls back and follows his prey
  from a distance until it collapses from blood loss. Against foes who fight
  back, Ajekrith uses Flyby Attack to stay out of range of his opponents'
  weapons. He only lands to make full attacks if he thinks he can quickly put an
  opponent out of commission.
Morale: >-
  Ajekrith flees if reduced to below 20 hit points, to nurse his wounds and plot
  his revenge.
Gear: >-
  amulet of mighty fists +1, bracers of armor +1, ring of protection +1,
  masterwork thieves' tools, 1,274 gp worth of coins, gems, and jewelry
