SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Detect Thoughts (Su)
    description: >-
      Carnag can continuously use detect thoughts as per the spell (caster level
      9th; Will DC 18 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Guarded Thoughts (Ex)
    description: >-
      Carnag is immune to any form of mind reading, such as that granted by
      detect thoughts. This ability also grants a +2 racial bonus on all saves
      against charm effects.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sting-injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1 round; effect sleep for 2d4
      minutes; cure 1 save. Spells Carnag casts spells as a 10th-level sorcerer.
Gender: Male
BeforeCombat: >-
  Carnag slithers into hiding when he hears anyone descend the stairs, using
  cat's grace to improve his Stealth, but calls out to learn who is there. If
  the conversation goes poorly, he casts greater invisibility on himself before
  moving from his hiding place and uses detect thoughts to identify the
  cleverest of the group to target with his poisoned sting in the surprise
  round.
DuringCombat: >-
  Carnag uses his interposing hand, wall of ice, and web spells to separate a
  group, isolating single targets to confront. He alternates using his poisoned
  sting and damaging spells, but prefers to keep mobile and rarely makes
  full-attack actions, trying to use the deep pits to prevent himself from being
  flanked or overwhelmed
Morale: >-
  While Carnag would normally flee combat after losing half his normal hit
  points, his geas forces him to fight to the death. Once reduced below half his
  normal hit points, he begs for mercy while maintaining the attack.
