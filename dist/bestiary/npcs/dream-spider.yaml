SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dream Web (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dream spider has the web ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 305) but its
      webs carry an iridescent hue, making them easy to notice (Perception DC
      15). Any animal, humanoid, or monstrous humanoid that comes in contact
      with these webs experiences strange hallucinations, taking 1d6 points of
      Wisdom damage per round of contact. A successful DC 11 Fortitude save
      negates this damage. If the webs of a dream spider are burned, they create
      a spread of poisonous gas in a 10-foot radius. This gas deals 1d8 points
      of Wisdom damage to all creatures in the area (not just to those in
      contact with the webs). A successful DC 11 Fortitude save halves this
      damage. The cloud of colorful vapor remains for only a single round before
      dissipating harmlessly. The save DC is Constitution-based.
