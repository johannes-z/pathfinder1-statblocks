SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Combined Arms (Ex)
    description: >-
      When taking a full-attack action, the overlord robot can attack with its
      claws, battleaxe, and integrated laser rifle simultaneously.
  - name: Gravity Bomb (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a swift action once every 1d4 rounds, the overlord robot can fire a
      purple bolt of force from its eye. This bolt has a range of 120 feet and
      explodes on impact, dealing 20d6 points of force damage to creatures in a
      30-foot radius (Reflex DC 29 half). Creature that fail this save are
      encapsulated in a sphere of force, as resilient sphere, for 1d6 rounds
      (Fortitude DC 29 negates). The save DCs are Dexterity-based.
BeforeCombat: The overlord robot casts unholy aura on itself.
DuringCombat: >-
  The overlord robot relies on its physical attacks rather than spell-like
  abilities. It uses its gravity bomb as often as possible, as well as Deadly
  Aim and Power Attack. If foes are hitting it too often, the overlord swaps out
  the use of Power Attack for Combat Expertise and begins to use Flyby Attacks
  to try to limit full attacks against itself.
Morale: The overlord robot fights until destroyed.
