DuringCombat: >-
  After 3 rounds, the bizarre creatures complete their transformations,
  unfurling their concealed, misshapen wings before attacking. The chaos beats
  focus on separate targets if possible, swooping in for Flyby Attacks before
  returning to their perches between attacks. They temporarily abandon targets
  inflicted with corporeal instability in favor of unaffected prey, unless no
  stable targets are available.
Morale: >-
  The chaos beasts fight to the death, at which time they return to their stony
  forms, appearing as broken statuary.
