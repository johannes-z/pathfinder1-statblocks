SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Petrified Assumption (Su)
    description: >-
      Elacnida can assume the appearance and voice of any creature she has
      petrified, but only as a ghostly version. This otherwise works exactly
      like and replaces the assumption class ability provided by Elacnida's
      master spy class levels. Elacnida can also learn any piece of information
      known to the petrified creature by spending a move action.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      After her betrayal and death, Elacnida's covetous spirit clung to the
      physical world, anchored to the statues of Dendrak and those she has
      petrifi ed as a ghost. Only by eliminating all her anchors-either by
      returning them to fl esh and blood or else utterly destroying their stone
      forms-can Elacnida's tether to the mortal realm be severed, allowing her
      spirit to move on to the Boneyard.
  - name: Statue Sight (Su)
    description: >-
      As one of her ghostly abilities, Elacnida can see through the eyes of any
      creature she has petrified since her death. Activating this ability is a
      move action, and it can be maintained every round by spending a move
      action. Once per day, Elacnida can channel her petrifying gaze through a
      statue she is currently looking through. Creatures gain a +2 circumstance
      bonus on Fortitude saves to resist petrifying gazes performed in this
      manner.
Gender: Female
BeforeCombat: >-
  Elacnida prefers to trick and meddle with newcomers while disguised as her
  previous victims. She uses these images to confuse enemies, lead potential
  threats into traps, and weaken opponents before revealing her true nature.
DuringCombat: >-
  Elacnida suppresses her gaze attack while disguised, but immediately resumes
  it upon reverting to her true form. She uses her frightful moan to disperse
  enemies, and then chases after stragglers with her corrupting touch. She
  desperately wants to petrify at least one new victim to strengthen her hold on
  the living world, and if only one or two targets remain, she attacks solely
  with her petrifying gaze.
Morale: Elacnida is no longer fully lucid and fi ghts until she is destroyed.
