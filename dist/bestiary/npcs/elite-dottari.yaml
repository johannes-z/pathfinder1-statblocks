    description: >-
      An elite dottari gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat and can
      attempt a grapple combat maneuver check in place of the attack at the end
      of a charge. An elite dottari receives a +2 bonus on Perception checks and
      combat maneuver checks to disarm, grapple, or trip opponents. An elite
      dottari doesn't treat crowds as difficult terrain.
  - name: Badge (Ex)
    description: >-
      An elite dottari's badge is a powerful symbol of rules and authority. As
      long as he wears his badge, allies within 30 feet who can see him gain a
      +3 morale bonus on saving throws against charm, compulsion, and fear
      effects and a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls against targets the elite
      dottari has challenged.
  - name: Quick Interrogator (Ex)

  - name: Squad Commander (Ex)
    description: >-
      An elite dottari can spend 1 minute laying out a plan to activate the
      tactician ability without having it count against his number of uses per
      day. The ability must be triggered within 1 hour of the plan being made,
      and the benefits last for 10 minutes. An elite dottari can have only one
      plan at a time, and if he makes a new plan, any old plan is lost.
DuringCombat: >-
  The dottari work together to take advantage of teamwork feats like Coordinated
  Maneuvers and Lookout. They challenge individual foes, using their halberds to
  trip opponents, and then strike with Power Attack.
