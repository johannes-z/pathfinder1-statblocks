SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Pool (Ex)
    description: >-
      A blood weird's pool is a bubbling, flowing mass of dark, rich, red blood.
      Creatures pinned underneath the blood are subject to drowning (see below).
  - name: Drench (Ex)
    description: >-
      The weird's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other
      open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller.
      The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic cast by a
      sorcerer whose level equals the weird's HD total.
  - name: Drown (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a blood weird grapples a foe, it can fully immerses its victim in its
      blood pool as a free action. A victim completely immersed must hold its
      breath or drown. See the "Drowning" section in the Pathfinder Core
      Rulebook.
  - name: Reform (Ex)
    description: >-
      When reduced to 0 hit points or less, a blood weird collapses back into
      its pool. Four rounds later, it reforms at full strength minus any damage
      taken from fire-based spells and effects.
  - name: Siphon (Su)
    description: >-
      A blood weird that hits a foe siphons off a portion of its blood. This
      attack deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage each time the blood weird
      hits. A creature struck can make a successful DC 17 Fortitude save to
      negate the ability damage that round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
      Creatures without blood (GM's discretion) are immune to this effect.
  - name: Transparency (Ex)
    description: A blood weird is effectively invisible in its pool until it attacks.
Description:
  - >-
    Sages are unsure as to the exact nature of the blood weird. Though
    classified as a weird, its plane of origin is unknown. Does there exist
    somewhere within the great configuration of inner and outer planes a plane
    composed entirely of blood? Some say yes. Others doubt it.
  - >-
    Whatever the truth, sage cannot argue the existence of the creature known as
    a blood weird.
  - >-
    Blood weirds are virtually unknown and so are rarely encountered outside
    their native plane. When summoned to the Material Plane, great care must be
    taken, for these creatures cannot exist without a large source of blood.
    Before summoning this creature, casters often fill a large basin or font
    with the blood of slain foes or captives.
  - >-
    Blood weirds wait patiently in their pool for potential prey. When a foe
    wanders close, the weird lashes out and intertwines itself around the
    opponent. On the next round, it attempts to fall back into its pool,
    bringing the grabbed opponent with it. Grabbed foes are either drowned or
    subjected to its siphoning attack.
