Description:
  - >-
    Piscodaemons are found throughout the Lower Planes bullying and killing
    weaker creatures. They are often themselves used as cannon fodder or slaves
    by the more powerful races of the Lower Planes, particularly the
    arcanadaemons.
  - A typical piscodaemon stands about 7 feet tall and weigh 200 pounds.
  - >-
    A piscodaemon often opens combat with its spell-like abilities, usually
    using stinking cloud against its foes. It then moves in and slashes and
    rakes with its claws. If the piscodaemon can grab a foe, it hangs on and
    constricts.
  - >-
    A piscodaemon's natural weapons, as well as any weapons he wields, are
    treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
