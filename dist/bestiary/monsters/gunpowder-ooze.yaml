  This lurching mass of slime and gunpowder leaves a trail of shiny black
  residue in its wake, and shudders with the concussive energy of an explosive.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blast (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a gunpowder ooze can fire a concentrated blast of
      gunpowder from its body as a ranged touch attack, dealing damage equal to
      4d6 + the ooze's Constitution modifier (+7 for most gunpowder oozes). Any
      creature struck by this blast is also potentially exposed to the ooze's
      gunpowder residue (Reflex DC 27 negates). This attack has a range of 180
      feet with no range increment. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Combust (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because of the volatile nature of its composition, a gunpowder ooze is
      susceptible to combusting when an ignition source is present. Anytime a
      gunpowder ooze takes fire damage or damage from a ranged firearm attack,
      it spontaneously explodes, dealing 10d6 points of fire damage to all
      creatures and objects in a 30-foot-burst cone toward the damage source
      that ignited the ooze. If there is no method of determining the damage
      source's direction (such as a burst or spread centered on the ooze), the
      ooze instead combusts in a 15-foot-radius burst. A successful DC 27 Reflex
      save halves the damage taken from this attack. A gunpowder ooze that
      combusts automatically splits. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Gunpowder Residue (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a gunpowder ooze successfully strikes a creature with its blast
      or slam attack, the target must succeed at a DC 27 Reflex save to avoid
      being coated in sticky gunpowder residue. Though the residue is not
      harmful in itself, if a creature covered in the residue uses a firearm,
      wields any weapon capable of dealing fire damage, takes fire damage from
      any source, or is exposed to a suitable spark, the residue immediately
      ignites and explodes, dealing 5d6 points of fire damage to the creature.
      Creatures adjacent to the exploding creature take half damage (Reflex DC
      27 half). Gunpowder residue remains flammable for 24 hours, until it is
      ignited, or until it is scrubbed away (which requires soap, water, and at
      least 1 hour of bathing and washing). A creature can only be covered in
      one layer of gunpowder residue at a time. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.

    Common throughout the Mana Wastes, where wild magic and gunpowder are both
    more prevalent than elsewhere in the world, gunpowder oozes are the
    combination of these two dangerous and unpredictable elements.
