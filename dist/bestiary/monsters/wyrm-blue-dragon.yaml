    description: >-
      A blue dragon can cast create water at will (CL 26). Alternatively, it can
      destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids
      are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions)
      and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 30)
      or be destroyed.
  - name: Electricity Aura (Su)
    description: >-

      the dragon's turn.
  - name: Mirage (Su)
    description: >-
      A wyrm blue dragon can make itself appear to be in two places at once as a
      free action for 26 rounds per day. This ability functions as project image
      but the dragon can use its breath weapon through the mirage.
  - name: Sound Imitation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has
      heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive
      check.
  - name: Storm Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      A wyrm blue dragon can use its breath weapon to create a storm of
      lightning. This functions as call lightning storm, but the damage is 22d8.
      The dragon can call down 1 bolt per round as a free action for 1d6 rounds.
      The save DC is 30. Additional uses of this ability extend the duration by
      an additional 1d6 rounds.
Description:
  - >-
    Blue dragons are consummate schemers and obsessively orderly. In combat,
    blue dragons prefer to surprise foes if possible, and are not above
    retreating if the odds turn against them. They prefer to lair near those
    that they control, sometimes even within the confines of a city.
