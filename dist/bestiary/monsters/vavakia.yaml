Description_Visual: >-
  This reptilian monstrosity is larger than a bull elephant. With the lower body
  of a spine-backed quadrupedal dinosaur, complete with spiked tail, the demonic
  creature has the upper body of a muscular humanoid. Its powerful arms wield an
  immense ranseur while tremendous draconic wings unfurl from its back. The
  creature's head-part dragon, part saurian, part demon-is a nightmare of horns
  and fangs and cruel, glowing eyes.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a vavakia can breathe out a 60-foot cone of green
      fire that seems to writhe and coil with the tortured shapes of a thousand
      screaming ghosts. This green fire is akin to vomiting up the countless
      souls the vavakia has consumed, and these souls consume flesh as surely as
      they consume sanity. A creature struck by this breath weapon takes 20d6
      points of damage (DC 30 Reflex half )-this damage manifests as blackened,
      melted flesh and skin but is treated as raw profane power. Evil creatures
      take half damage from the breath weapon, but good creatures who take any
      damage from a vavakia's breath weapon are automatically staggered for 1
      round by the hideous sensation. In addition, any living creature that
      takes damage from a vavakia's breath weapon must also make a DC 30
      Fortitude save to avoid suffering 1d8 points of Wisdom drain as her sanity
      slips away into madness. Immediately after the vavakia expels this green
      "soulfire," the wailing flames flow in reverse back into the demon's
      gullet through its open maw. This heals the vavakia 1d8 points of damage
      for each creature that was damaged by its breath weapon. The Wisdom drain
      element of this breath weapon is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Smoking Wound (Su)
    description: >-
      The wounds caused by a vavakia's fangs result in tremendous and eerie
      wounds. Rather than blood, wisps of green smoke constantly weep from a
      vavakia's bite wound-a grim manifestation of the demon's effect on a
      mortal soul. Each time a vavakia bites a creature, it bestows two negative
      levels-the wounds continue to smoke as long as the victim suffers those
      negative levels. The smoking wounds cause the victim to become sickened
      because of the hideous sensation and rank smell of the vapors. An effect
      that removes this sickened condition only temporarily causes the wounds to
      stop smoking-they begin smoking again in 1d6 rounds and persist as long as
      the victim suffers from the associated negative levels. Nonliving
      creatures bitten by a vavakia are immune to its energy-draining bite and
      do not exhibit smoking wounds. The Fortitude save to remove these negative
      levels is DC 25. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Stun (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature struck by a vavakia's tail slap must make a DC 30 Fortitude
      save or be stunned for 1 round. On a critical hit, the stun effect lasts
      for 1d4 rounds on a failed save, and 1 round on a successful save. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Vavakias are immense demons of great power. Saurian in shape, appetite, and
    destructive power, they are most often encountered on the Material Plane not
    as demons conjured by spellcasters to serve, but as violent invaders come to
    the world through tears in reality or portals to the deeper rifts. On the
    Material Plane, a single vavakia is a formidable presence, for the strange
    demons are driven to feed on living souls and spread destruction-roles they
    were built to excel at.
  - >-
    A vavakia demon measures 30 feet in length and stands 15 feet tall, weighing
    in at 6,000 pounds. Vavakias form on the Abyss from particularly cruel
    mortal souls who, in life, practiced the vile act of extracting, enslaving,
    and even consuming other souls. When such a sinful creature arrives on the
    Abyss, it brings with it partially absorbed fragments of souls from its
    victims, resulting in a horrific transformation into one of the Abyss's most
    dangerous forms of demonic life.
  - >-
    Ecology The first vavakias were created eons ago by Lamashtu, who was
    unsatisfied with the raw physical might and monstrous shape of many of her
    earliest demonic minions.
  - >-
    In those early days, before she had become a deity, Lamashtu was already
    quite interested in the method by which the Abyss transformed the souls of
    sinful mortals into demons.
  - >-
    When she learned that this process had first been triggered by the daemons,
    she was at once intrigued and enraged- intrigued because she knew that
    anything the Horsemen of the Apocalypse could do, she could do, and enraged
    at the idea that she owed her very existence to the curiosity of a daemonic
    lord. Of course, Lamashtu herself rose from the Abyss spontaneously, shortly
    after the daemons first "taught" the Abyss how to process sinful souls, but
    that difference meant little to the Mother of Monsters. Fueled by this rage,
    she waged war against Abaddon for many years and captured two Horsemen of
    the Apocalypse-predecessors of those who hold those titles now. She murdered
    one of them, and forced from the other the secret method of manipulating
    souls and the Abyss before murdering him as well. Both murdered Horsemen
    were soon replaced on Abaddon, but by that point Lamashtu's wrath had been
    spent and all that remained was her own curiosity.
  - >-
    Most of Lamashtu's earliest attempts to create demonic life were hideous
    failures, but even in these failures Lamashtu found joy and delight. It
    wasn't until the demon used her own body as an incubator to shape and then
    eventually birth the first vavakias that she had her first real success.
    Lamashtu's early work in creating and manipulating the Abyss in this manner
    may have much to do with her resulting rise in power to the position of
    Queen of Demons-had not her escalating war with Pazuzu forced her attentions
    away from this hideous form of "art," there's no telling what other strange
    demonic races she might have birthed upon the world. Now that she is a true
    goddess, Lamashtu's interests expand far beyond the "curiosities" of the
    Abyss, and she has little time or desire to wallow in her home plane's
    fecund properties. Of course, other demon lords throughout the Abyss are
    eager to learn these secrets, but to date, none have managed to duplicate
    Lamashtu's feats of creation.
  - >-
    In any event, the vavakias themselves have proven a phenomenal success, and
    are among the Abyss's most dangerous demonic races today.
  - >-
    Habitat & Society Although they were originally created to serve as
    powerful, living weapons of war, the vavakias have long since established
    their own presence on the Abyss as warlords and conquerors.
  - >-
    While some pledge their service to powerful demon lords, most vavakias rule
    small empires of their own in the Abyss, typically in remote corners
    infested with swamps, jungles, and other primeval terrains.
