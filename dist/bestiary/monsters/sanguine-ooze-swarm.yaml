SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Euphoric Slime (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sanguine oozes are composed of congealed euphoric toxins. Any living
      creature that begins its turn affected by the swarm's viscous ability must
      make a DC 13 Fortitude save or erupt into uncontrollable laughter and be
      effectively staggered for that round. This is a mindaffecting effect.
      Creatures immune to poison are immune to this effect.
  - name: Viscous (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever an alchemical ooze swarm makes a swarm attack on a creature of
      Small size or larger, that creature must make a DC 13 Reflex save or be
      covered in patches of sticky ooze globules. Those who fail are entangled
      until the patches of ooze are removed. The ooze can be removed by spending
      a full-round action to fling off the globules-though this action might be
      impeded by the ooze's effects. If a creature affected by this ability
      takes any amount of cold damage, the ooze patches are immediately
      destroyed. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Formed from accumulations of runoff from arcane laboratories and regions of
    magical calamity, alchemical oozes are fist-sized blobs of volatile
    chemicals. Although composed of unpredictable compounds and toxins, these
    mobile oozes pose little threat individually, but in polluted quagmires and
    tainted sewers can collect in numbers great enough to threaten creatures
    many times their size. Swarms of the slimes linger in such contaminated
    areas and seek new accretions of vital solutions, like those found within
    the bodies of higher life forms, to fuel their erratic life cycles. Found in
    numerous varieties with a host of differing abilities, these weird, clinging
    oozes have been differentiated by likening them to the humors said to
    compose the bodies of living beings. Appearing at first to be a collection
    of tiny blobs of viscous, translucent fluid, alchemical oozes become far
    more terrifying once their hungry nature becomes apparent. Each swarm is
    composed of several hundred palm-sized balls of ooze that all scuttle along
    as a single unit.
