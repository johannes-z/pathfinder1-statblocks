Description_Visual: >-
  This hairless mountain of slick raw burning flesh seems to constantly sizzle
  and ooze with the stench of burning fat. Two long meaty arms sprout from a
  hugely obese frame; its head appears to be little more than a bald sloping
  brow with black pits for eyes. Its maw splits open to reveal cavernous jaws,
  teeth glowing like huge red hot coals.

  - name: Fast Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cherum heals only if it is touching a flame or lava pool that covers at
      least an area equal to its space (30-foot area).
Description:
  - >-
    The cherum is an abomination born of intense heat and crushing despair.
    Often making their homes in lava sprues, they are thought to be the rejected
    offspring of a fire deity (or at least the creation of said deity).
  - >-
    As such, they are often worshipped as divine beings by primitive folk who
    offer virgin sacrifices to appease the "God of the Mountain." The cherum
    greedily devours such gifts, demanding more and more delicate flesh to feed
    its insatiable appetite. A cherum's deific background subjects it to fits of
    rage that can be felt for miles (especially when the cherum goes on a
    rampage and destroys the countryside).
  - >-
    Though neutral by nature, cherum are often on decent terms with fire giants
    and other fire-based creatures that dwell near them. Though they do not
    trade with such creatures and rarely, if ever, aid them in time of need,
    they do not usually attack or demand homage from said creatures either.
    Cherum do not associate with dragons of any sort, especially red dragons for
    whom they have a great hatred.
  - A cherum stands about 70 feet tall and weighs well over 40,000 pounds.
  - >-
    Cherum are known to climb from a pool of molten magma, stretch forth their
    massive arms and devour everything in their grasp. They have little fear of
    dragons, demons, devils, or foolish adventurers who wander too close to
    their lair. They seek to grab and swallow everything smaller than
    themselves. If a fight goes against a cherum, it attempts to flee by diving
    into the nearest pool of lava and wait for its aggressors to leave as it
    heals.
  - Should this fail, it fights on to the death.
