SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Frigid Flesh (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature that successfully hits a shasalqu with a natural attack or an
      unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of cold damage.
  - name: Heat Absorption (Ex)
    description: >-
      Fire deals no damage to a shasalqu. Instead, the shasalqu absorbs the fire
      and gains 1 temporary hit point for every 3 points of fire damage it would
      have taken. These temporary hit points disappear after 1 hour.
  - name: Trapping Cold (Su)
    description: >-
      A shasalqu exudes a heat-sapping aura that makes the air temperature
      around it plunge. Any creature that begins its turn within 10 feet of a
      shasalqu takes 1d6 points of cold damage and becomes entangled. A
      successful DC 13 Fortitude save negates the damage and the entangled
      condition. An affected creature is entangled for as long as it is within
      the aura's area plus 1 round after leaving. Other shasalqus are immune to
      this aura, as are any creatures immune to cold damage or whose cold
      resistance causes them to take no damage from the aura. When a shasalqu
      dies, its trapping cold aura persists around its corpse for 1 hour.
Description:
  - >-
    While some reptiles bask in the sun's warm embrace to raise their body
    temperature, a shasalqu is ravenous in its search of warmth. Even in the
    deserts of the Inner Sea region, it never seems to have enough heat. Instead
    of just relying on the sun, a shasalqu gathers energy by sapping the heat
    from the air (and creatures) around it. An icy, saw-toothed ridge protrudes
    from its back, and its tail ends in a small club of accumulated ice. A
    shasalqu uses the intense cold generated from this heat absorption to trap
    its prey, which is often unprepared for the effects of blistering cold in
    the middle of the desert. Fighting shasalqus is dangerous business as their
    cold flesh damages any creature coming into contact with them. A shasalqu is
    3 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs about 40 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Most desert scholars believe that strange biology that fuels a shasalqu's
    heat absorption ability is the same as that of brown mold, and some even
    claim that the creatures carry brown mold spores in their bodies. This could
    account for shasalqus' ability to sap heat from their surroundings even
    after they die. Shasalqus have rough, gray-blue skin dotted with small beady
    extrusions much like those of a horned lizard. Because of their sandy
    environs and the drops of water that melt off their icy ridges, shasalqus'
    bodies are often caked in a layer of gritty mud. Motionless shasalqus are
    often mistaken for rocks or small muddy clumps from a distance-a mistake
    desert travelers quickly come to regret.
  - >-
    Shasalqus' ability to harvest heat from nearby creatures makes them one of
    the few types of lizards that actively hunt at night. They prefer eating
    warm-blooded creatures, so they prey upon nocturnal desert fauna such as
    rabbits, desert foxes, and nesting birds. By catching prey in their chilly
    auras, shasalqus can bring down animals that would normally have the
    advantage of speed. Occasionally, shasalqus creep up on encampments and kill
    travelers' camels while they sleep. Shasalqus prefer to eat larger animals
    since these creatures can provide food for days, but because they dwell in
    the resource-poor desert, they typically eat whatever they can. Shasalqus
    are particularly partial to fire elementals or other supernaturally warm
    beings, and may pursue such creatures for days in single-minded pursuit of
    heat and sustenance.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Shasalqus live primarily solitary existences. They are territorial creatures
    and mark off their territory with a unique scent, by which others of their
    kind can readily determine whether they have come across that particular
    shasalqu before. To maintain their territorial boundaries, shasalqus must
    walk the perimeter of their claimed land once every few days to ensure that
    their scent sticks. They deliver their scent through the droplets of water
    that melt off their hides (their "sweat") during their patrols. When a
    shasalqu comes across the territory markers of another shasalqu, it slowly
    follows the edge of the other's territory, giving ample time for a greater
    volume of its own droplets to permeate the ground and deliver a stronger
    scent. The difference between the scents of two shasalqu is almost
    imperceptible to other creatures, leaving many creatures unaware of
    territory wars between two or more shasalqus.
  - >-
    Shasalqus dwell in hidden places. Their rocky lairs can be found near oases
    or along trade routes where prey is likely to wander by. Near oases, they
    make their lairs far enough away to allow them to sneak up on drinking or
    bathing creatures and then retreat to their lairs with little effort. When a
    shasalqu finds a trade route within its territory, it also ensures that its
    lair is not so close to the route as to betray its presence.
  - >-
    Regardless of their location, shasalqu lairs are often extremely damp since
    the desert's heat melts the accumulated ice that crusts on shasalqus' hides.
    This makes shasalqu lairs breeding grounds for a variety of mosses and
    plants, especially those that can withstand colder temperatures. These tiny
    oases rapidly become too mossy for the shasalqu, forcing it to leave its den
    in search of a new one. Shasalqus frequently keep multiple dens within their
    territory and rotate between them.
  - >-
    In rare cases, brown mold forms in the darkened corners of the den, leading
    some naturalists to conclude that the strange lizards carry spores from this
    dangerous mold. This conclusion has led expeditions of naturalists into the
    blazing desert to locate abandoned shasalqu dens and collect samples of
    brown mold from them. To avoid entering shasalqu dens on their own, these
    naturalists use long-handled scoops that they prod into the shasalqu den to
    collect the dangerous mold. Since shasalqus are not immune to cold damage
    (merely resistant), they abandon their lairs when patches of brown mold
    form.
  - >-
    Sometimes shasalqus' moist and muddy lairs attract other thirsty desert
    creatures. Shasalqus can easily contend with the desert foxes and occasional
    weary traveler, but should a more powerful creature come across their dens,
    shasalqus either remain perfectly still, hoping the creature will drink and
    leave quickly, or else they slink away to avoid confrontations, only
    returning once the threat has passed.
  - >-
    Though shasalqus usually keep to themselves, some naturalists have recorded
    clusters of them in places with abundant food. In these rare situations, a
    hierarchy forms among these simple creatures, and the leader is invariably
    the shasalqu with the largest ice-club on its tail, a visible status
    indicator among shasalqus. Shasalqus that challenge the current alpha end up
    in quick brawls for superiority. In these fights the challenger often tries
    to ruin its icy spines or to chip off portions of the ice that has
    accumulated on the leader's tail, so its opponent has a less impressive
    display. Because of this behavior, and the fact that the clubs grow more ice
    eventually, the dominance of these rare clusters of shasalqus is in constant
    flux.
  - >-
    Desert nomads sometimes capture shasalqus and use them as sources of water.
    They dig pits to serve as enclosures for the lizards, and feed them captured
    rodents or birds. With the shasalqus safely ensconced in these makeshift
    wells, the nomads then harvest the resultant condensation as a slow but sure
    method of obtaining water in the desert. Because of the deadliness of the
    shasalqu's frigid aura, such hunters often try to catch the creatures with
    long nets or lassos, and even then only the hardiest and most desperate
    attempt the feat. For one far from the nearest oasis, the capturing a
    shasalqu could mean the difference between life and death by dehydration.
