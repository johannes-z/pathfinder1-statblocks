SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Desert Thirst (Su)
    description: >-
      A blue dragon can cast create water at will (CL 20). Alternatively, it can
      destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids
      are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions)
      and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 26)
      or be destroyed.
  - name: Electricity Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      An old blue dragon is surrounded by an aura of electricity. Creatures
      within 10 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the beginning of
      the dragon's turn.
  - name: Mirage (Su)
    description: >-
      An old blue dragon can make itself appear to be in two places at once as a
      free action for 20 rounds per day. This ability functions as project image
      but the dragon can use its breath weapon through the mirage.
  - name: Sound Imitation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has
      heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive
      check.
Description:
  - >-
    Blue dragons are consummate schemers and obsessively orderly. In combat,
    blue dragons prefer to surprise foes if possible, and are not above
    retreating if the odds turn against them. They prefer to lair near those
    that they control, sometimes even within the confines of a city.
