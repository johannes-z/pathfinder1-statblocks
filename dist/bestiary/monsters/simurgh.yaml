SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Peace (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures within a 50-foot spread from a simurgh feel a sensation of peace
      wash over them, as if affected by calm emotions, except the simurgh can
      choose which creatures are affected. A DC 28 Will save negates the effects
      of this aura for 1 round, but a new save must be made each round to
      continue to resist the effects. The saving throw is Charisma-based.
  - name: Banishing Swipe (Su)
    description: >-
      A simurgh can use its radiant tail to return creatures to their native
      planes. In addition to taking damage, any extraplanar creature touched by
      a simurgh's tail must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be affected as if by
      banishment. A creature that makes this save cannot be affected by the same
      simurgh's banishing swipe for the next 24 hours. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Glaring Ray (Su)
    description: >-
      A simurgh can blast a fiery ray of brilliant light from its eyes as a
      standard action to a range of 100 feet.
  - name: Radiant Feathers (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a simurgh can fan out its glimmering
      tail feathers and blast its foes with a 100-foot cone of radiant light
      from its tail. Aside from its size, this attack is identical to a
      prismatic spray (DC 28). The save is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Regarded as living legends, simurghs are held in high regard by desert
    dwellers. Those who live in the desert lands where these benevolent
    creatures sometimes reside consider it a lifetime's worth of luck even to
    spot one soaring through the sky. Simurghs prefer to keep to themselves,
    well out of the way of lesser creatures and their often dubious morals,
    though they can be relied upon for aid when called by those in true need and
    with a pure heart. A simurgh can live for thousands of years, and frequent
    mentions of these giant avian beings throughout a region's historical record
    are more often than not sightings of the same creature.
