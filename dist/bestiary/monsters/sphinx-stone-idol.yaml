Group: Stone Idol
Source: Tome of Horrors 4
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone idol is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. A transmute rock to mud
      spell slows a stone idol (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no
      saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit
      points. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the stone idol's
      structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1
      full round. A disintegrate spell deals +50% damage to a stone idol. A
      chaos hammer, holy smite, order's wrath, or unholy blight spell deals 1d4
      points of damage per two caster levels to a stone idol if the creator's
      alignment matches one of the aforementioned spells.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      Unless a stone idol's main body is shattered into small fragments and
      scattered to the winds, the creature reforms itself at full strength in
      1d4+2 days.
  - name: Site Bound (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone idol cannot travel more than 200 feet from a central point
      designated by its creator. Once this point is selected, it can never be
      changed. A stone idol taken outside the area ceases functioning until it
      is brought back into the area.
  - name: Roar (Su)
    description: >-
      A sphinx stone idol can roar up to three times per day as a standard
      action. Affected creatures become frightened for 2d6 rounds. A DC 17 Will
      save negates the effect. The roar is a mind-affecting fear effect and a
      sonic effect that fills a 100-foot-radius burst, centered on the stone
      idol sphinx. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again
      by the same sphinx stone idol's roar for one day. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A stone idol sphinx is about 15 feet long and weighs around 29,000 pounds. A
    sphinx stone idol often has the head of an animal considered sacred by the
    religion: jackal-headed, goat-headed, vulture-headed, and so on.
  - >-
    A stone idol sphinx attacks first using its roar and then using its vicious
    bite and slashing with its stony paws. It often takes to the air where it
    can gain an advantage on its foes.
  - Construction

    A stone idol sphinx is chiseled from a block of smooth stone that weighs at
    least 6,000 pounds. It must be of exceptional quality and have a value of
