Description:
  - >-
    Giant assassin bugs are an example of a large and varied class of hunting
    insects that live throughout Golarion. Assassin bugs partially bury
    themselves in the sand or hide among clusters of thorny bushes found near
    oases, waiting for the next palatable creature to approach. When prey
    arrives, the insects burst out of hiding and pierce their prey with their
    elongated mouthparts, injecting a potent toxin that paralyzes victims. Once
    prey is safely paralyzed, assassin bugs feed by siphoning the victim's
    fluids. Even if these bites don't kill their prey, they are extremely
    painful and cause swelling in the area.

    Giant assassin bugs lay eggs in places shaded from the sun at all times,
    such as shallow caves or the crevices between rocks, preferably in a place
    where food is readily available for the hatching young. The soft-bodied
    young that hatch resemble their mature counterparts in all ways but size,
    and are fully ready to hunt the moment they emerge, though they typically
    seek much smaller prey. An adult assassin bug is typically 4 feet long, and
    weighs 65 pounds.
