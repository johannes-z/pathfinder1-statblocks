    description: >-
      A trollhound's saliva is an infectious brew of contagion. Creatures bitten
      by a trollhound are often afflicted with bloodfire fever, a disease
      characterized by deep internal pain, as if the victim's blood were on
      fire. Additional symptoms include loss of muscular coordination,
      pus-filled blisters, and overall lethargy and fatigue. Trolls and
      trollhounds alike are immune to bloodfire fever, even though trollhounds
      often exhibit the pus-filled blisters that come with the disease.
      Bloodfire fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 14; onset 1 day; frequency
      1/day; effect 1d3 Str damage, 1d3 Dex damage, and target is fatigued; cure
      2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Slavering and voracious, trollhounds seem to be trolls in smaller canine
    form, and indeed, are often found as pets among gangs and tribes of trolls.
    Requiring vast amounts of food to fuel their regenerative metabolisms, packs
    of wild trollhounds range far and wide through the mountains of the north,
    their ravenous hunger driving them to hunt and consume any prey they can
    track down and kill.

    A typical trollhound stands 4 feet tall at the shoulder, has short but
    powerful legs, and weighs around 350 pounds. A trollhound's skin is somewhat
    scaly, with patches of rough, greenish-black fur. It has oversized jaws with
    a pronounced underbite, and its eyes are normally a dull, hateful orange.

    Trollhounds are believed to be the outcome of infusing particularly
    ferocious worgs with alchemically prepared troll blood. The resulting beast
    loses the worg's wicked intelligence but gains the ability to regenerate
    even the most grievous wounds, except those inf licted by fire or acid.
    Whatever their origin, trollhounds breed true and are often raised by
    trolls.

    Trollhounds are fearless on the hunt and in combat, relying on their ability
    to regenerate to carry them through. Not even the threat of fire is enough
    to repel them, as the beasts are too dull to recognize the danger it poses.
    Nevertheless, fire is one of the most effective tools in combating
    trollhounds, and canny hunters know to burn every last remnant of a slain
    trollhound, for as is true of trolls, even the smallest piece of trollhound
    flesh can eventually regrow back into a full-sized beast.
  - >-
    Trollhounds are most often found in the company of trolls, who breed the
    beasts as hunters, guards, pets, and food. Trollhounds seem to have an
    affinity for their savage masters, and tamed trollhounds always regard
    trolls as alpha members of the pack. A trollhound will never attack a troll
    without cause-although trolls often enjoy violent roughhousing with these
    creatures nonetheless.
