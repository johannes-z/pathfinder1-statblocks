SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Command Giant (Su)

      A rune giant gains a +4 racial bonus on the save DC of charm or compulsion
      effects used against giants.
  - name: Runes (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a free action, whenever a rune giant uses its spark shower or
      spell-like abilities, it can cause the runes on its body to flash with
      light. All creatures within 10 feet of the giant must make a DC 24
      Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round. The saving throw is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Spark Shower (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a rune giant can cause a shower of sparks to erupt
      out of one of the runes on its body. These sparks function as a breath
      weapon (30-ft. cone; 10d6 fire and 10d6 electricity damage; Reflex DC 29
      half; usable once every 1d4 rounds). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Magically crafted and crossbred from taiga and fire giant slaves by ancient
    wizards, rune giants are anathema to their own kind.
  - >-
    Given power to command and magically control other giants, the rune giants
    themselves served their even more powerful masters, and in so doing granted
    ancient empires armies of giants to command.
  - >-
    In the eons since these ancient empires collapsed, rune giants have
    persisted as a race of their own, little more than bogeymen, horrors
    whispered of late at night by superstitious giants.
  - >-
    Rune giants' charcoal flesh is decorated by dozens of runes-manifestations
    of their eldritch powers. Rune giants are 40 feet tall and weigh 25,000
    pounds.
