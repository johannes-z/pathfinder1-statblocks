Description:
  - >-
    Whereas the boar is ill-tempered and generally unfriendly, the towering
    daeodon (known as the dire boar to most commoners and hunters) is
    legitimately hateful and violent. Although omnivorous like its smaller kin,
    the daeodon prefers to feed on flesh, and its razor-sharp tusks and keen
    eyesight make it particularly well suited as a predator. While the daeodon
    is primarily a scavenger, it isn't averse to attacking smaller creatures it
    encounters while searching for easier meals, or those who stumble
    unwittingly into its territory. Particularly brave or skilled orcs are fond
    of using daeodons as mounts, and orc cavalry mounted on dire boars make for
    a fearsome force indeed. A typical adult daeodon is 10 feet long and 7 feet
    tall at the shoulder. It weighs approximately 2,000 pounds.
