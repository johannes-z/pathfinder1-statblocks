Description:
  - >-
    Sometimes termed the "knights" of the agathions, cervinals have gained a
    reputation throughout the Outer Planes for their battle prowess, noble
    natures, and admirable wisdom. They stand almost 11 feet tall with
    magnificent racks of antlers 4 feet across, and weigh over 2,000 pounds.
  - >-
    Cervinals manifest from the souls of good leaders, including military
    officers, regents, and church officials. In the good-aligned planes, they
    most often serve as generals in battles against fiends, but they also
    develop strategies to combat everyday evil in the multiverse, secure evil
    artifacts, and coordinate efforts between agathions and other celestial
    races.
