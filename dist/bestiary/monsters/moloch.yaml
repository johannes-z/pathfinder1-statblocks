Description:
  - >-
    Moloch rules the sixth plane of Hell, a flat, stinking plane of acrid smoke
    and soot. He is currently plotting to wrest control of the plane completely
    from its true ruler, Baalzebul, for Moloch is nothing more than a lieutenant
    in Baalzebul's infernal army or seneschal to Baalzebul's court. Yet before
    he puts in motion steps to secure his plane, he must first deal with the
    machinations of the Great Serpent, Geryon. Geryon and Moloch hate each
    other; their infernal armies are constantly warring with each other either
    openly or through subterfuge. Moloch stands 14 feet tall and weighs about
    1,200 pounds. Moloch attacks with either a claw/claw/bite routine or his
    whip and spell-like abilities. His whip is a long metal rod-like weapon with
    six 15- foot long pliable metal tails. Servants of Moloch Followers of
    Moloch are evil humanoids and usually consist of assassins, clerics,
    sorcerers, and wizards. Devout followers of Moloch are called Knights of
    Moloch and must sign a pact of evil with Moloch. Knights can receive spells
    from Moloch and are granted access to two of the following domains: Evil,
    Law, and Strength. Credit Moloch originally appeared in Dragon #75 (©
    TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and later in the First Edition Monster
