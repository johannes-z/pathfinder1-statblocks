    description: >-
      When a stench beetle dies violently, its body splits open and releases a
      deluge of nauseating fluids and gasses. Creatures within 10 feet must make
      DC 13 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds and sickened for 1d6+2
      minutes thereafter. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2
      racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Stench beetles are small, nocturnal hunters that sustain themselves on a
    diet of grains, fruits, vegetables, and leaves. In civilized lands they are
    considered a nuisance for the damage they cause, especially in larger
    groups, to crops and farmlands. If faced with extreme hunger, stench beetles
    eat cattle, small game animals, and the occasional child that wanders too
    far into the forests.
  - >-
    Stench beetles make their lairs in large hollow logs and fallen trees. A
    typical lair can contain almost twenty of these creatures with half that
    number in noncombatant young. Females lay up to a dozen eggs at a given
    time, usually once per year. Eggs are laid on leaves, and the female chews
    the ends of the leaves so it curls and folds around the eggs, concealing
    them from predators and protecting the eggs from the elements. Young go from
    larvae to adulthood in the span of a year. When they reach adulthood most
    stench beetles leave the lair.

    Stench beetles attack with their bite, seeking retreat if combat goes
    against them.
