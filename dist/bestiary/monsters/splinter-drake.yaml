Description_Visual: >-
  This creature looks like a wingless dragon about 12 feet long whose flesh is
  actually dark brown bark with a greenish hue. A bushy mane of twigs, branches,
  leaves, and vines circles its dragon-like head and a series of thorny spines
  runs the length of its back. Two backward curved horns, apparently constructed
  of the same hardened bark as its body, jut from the creature's head. A dark
  brown snake-like tongue flicks across its fangs as it advances.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Ex)
    description: >-
      A splinter drake has two breath weapons, both of which emit razor-sharp
      thorns. The main breath weapon, useable every 1d4 rounds, is a 40-ft. cone
      that deals 6d6 points of piercing and slashing damage. Its other breath
      weapon is a volley of thorns spit at a single target as a ranged attack
      for 3d6 points of piercing damage.
  - name: Improved Woodland Stride (Su)
    description: >-
      A splinter drake can move through any sort of undergrowth (natural thorns,
      briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its normal speed without
      taking damage or suffering other impairment. This includes thorns, briars,
      and overgrown areas that are magically manipulated to impede motion.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a free action, a splinter drake can regurgitate its
      poisonous stomach acids into its mouth and either use it in conjunction
      with a bite attack or release it along with either version of its breath
      weapon. The act of regurgitating the poison is a free action. Once it
      makes a successful bite attack or uses its breath weapon, the poison is
      used up (though the splinter drake can "reload" again on its next turn if
      it has any more uses of its poison attack left for the day). Splinter
      Drake Venom: Bite or breath weapon-injury or contact; save Fort DC 24;
      frequency 1/round for 5 rounds; effect 1d4 Con; cure 1 save.
Description:
  - >-
    Splinter drakes are plant creatures that resemble large wingless dragons.
    They haunt dense forests and make their lairs amid the tangled underbrush,
    generally in hard-to-locate places. Much like true dragons, splinter drakes
    are extremely territorial and attack creatures that wander carelessly into
    their domain and remain for an extended amount of time. A typical splinter
    drake's territory covers an area of several square miles around its lair.
    Unlike true dragons, splinter drakes do not value nor keep treasure. Any
    treasure found in or around their lairs are likely all that remains of a
    past meal. They generally keep company with evil fey, evil druids, and
    corrupt rangers. Such allies are allowed a bit of leeway when treading on a
    splinter drake's territory, but if certain boundaries are crossed or
    privileges abused, splinter drakes have no problems eating someone they once
    called friend. Splinter drakes generally do not associate with others of
    their kind, except during mating season (early spring) when a mated pair is
    likely to be encountered. During mating, the female splinter drake deposits
    a host of eggs (or seeds) into the ground. Within several months, 1d4 new
    splinter drakes grow from the ground. Splinter drakes reach maturity within
    1 year. A splinter drake is about 12 feet long and weighs around 800 pounds.
    Splinter drakes typically ambush potential prey whenever possible, striking
    from surprise with their thorny breath weapon and poison. Once it releases
    its first blast, it charges into battle and slashes and tears at its foes
    with its claws and bite. If outnumbered or combat turns against it, a
    splinter drake seeks the quickest means of exit possible unless cornered,
    defending its lair, or starving, in which case it fights to the death.
    Rarely, though not completely unheard of, a splinter drake takes levels in a
    class, almost always the druid or ranger class.
