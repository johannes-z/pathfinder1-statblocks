Description_Visual: >-
  A witch tree combines the features of a tall, beautiful woman and a willow
  tree looking somewhat like a female willow treant. Her hair and fingers form
  the fronds of the willow, her arms and parts of her hair, the branches. From a
  distance, the witch tree is almost indistinguishable from a normal willow
  tree. Its skin is thick and dark, resembling the bark of a tree. Its legs join
  together to form the roots.

Description:
  - >-
    Witch trees gain nutrients from the soil where they take root, but have a
    particular fondness for living flesh, particularly that of gnomes and orcs.
    As such, groves of these creatures can be found lairing near such
    settlements.
  - >-
    The origin of the witch tree is clouded; on one side, sages argue that the
    witch tree is a magical creation created by an insane spellcaster to do his
    personal bidding. On the other side, sages argue that the witch tree
    resulted from miscast magic or is the result of "magical leakage" perhaps
    created when a spellcaster attempting to create a magical wand or staff or
    other such item failed in his endeavors and cast aside the item, thereby
    allowing what magic it held to "leak" out into the surrounding soil.
    Regardless of the origin, the creature has multiplied significantly in
    numbers and shows no signs of becoming extinct anytime soon.
  - >-
    Some adventurers tell tales of a witch tree grove that lured the entire
    population of a small village to its death through magical charms and hexes.
    Such stories are not without merit, and most intrepid adventurers warn
    others of their kind when a witch tree grove has been discovered.
  - >-
    When a discovery is made, hunters, druids, and warriors move against the
    witch tree in an effort to remove the threat before villagers and livestock
    begin disappearing.
  - A witch tree sits unmoving until a potential target moves within range.
  - >-
    It first attacks using its spell-like abilities, attempting to charm or
    control its would-be assailants. Those that resist are attacked physically
    by the witch tree. A grabbed opponent is held until it escapes or dies or
    until the witch tree is killed.
