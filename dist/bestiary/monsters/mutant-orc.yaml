Description:
  - >-
    When long-term exposure to radiation doesn't result in a creature's death,
    it often mutates the creature into a twisted version of itself. Some of
    these mutations can be advantageous to the creature; others are
    unquestionably a hindrance to it. In either case, mutants are plentiful
    throughout Numeria, especially in the Felldales, where they band together
    into roving bands of loosely affiliated marauders, traveling the landscape
    in search of food, shelter, or whatever other things motivate their
    fractured and warped minds. Creating a Mutant "Mutant" is an acquired
    template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature. A mutant
    retains the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted
    here. CR: As base creature +1. Type: The creature's type changes to
    aberration. Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves. Defensive Abilities:
    Mutants are immune to radiation. Attacks: A mutant retains all the natural
    weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon and armor proficiencies of
    the base creature. Special Abilities: A mutant retains any extraordinary and
    supernatural qualities of the base creature. Mutations: A mutant gains one
    of the mutations below when it acquires this template, plus an additional
    mutation for every 4 HD it possesses. By taking an extra deformity, a mutant
    can add an additional beneficial mutation. Only the first extra deformity
    provides this benefit. A mutant that gains additional HD after acquiring
    this template does not gain additional special abilities. Armored (Ex): The
    mutant's natural armor bonus to AC increases by 2. This ability can be taken
    multiple times. Bulbous Eyes (Ex) The mutant has darkvision with a range of
    60 feet and low-light vision. Celerity (Ex): As a swift action, the mutant
    gains the benefits of haste for 1 round. This ability can be used once every
    1d4 rounds. The mutant has a +2 bonus on Initiative checks. Extra Arm (Ex):
    The mutant has an extra arm and gains Multiweapon Fighting as a bonus feat
    if this mutation brings its total number of arms above two. This ability can
    be taken multiple times, adding an arm each time. Fast Healing (Ex): The
    mutant has fast healing 5. Feral (Ex): The mutant gains a bite attack and
    one claw attack for each arm or forelimb. These natural weapons deal damage
    based on the mutant's size. If it already has these attacks, their damage
    improves by one size category. Gills (Ex): The mutant has the aquatic
    subtype, the amphibious special ability, and a swim speed equal to its base
    speed. Increased Speed (Ex): One of the mutant's speeds increases by 10
    feet. If this mutation is taken multiple times, apply it to a different
    speed each time. Leaping (Ex): The mutant gains Acrobatics as a class skill
    and a +10 bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump. The mutant always counts as
    having a running start when jumping. Mental Armor (Su): The mutant generates
    a protective field as mage armor while conscious. If its mental armor is
    removed, the mutant can restore it as a swift action. Radiation Affinity
    (Ex): The mutant gains the advanced simple template when in areas of medium
    or stronger radiation (see page 26). Rage (Ex): The mutant gains the ability
    to enter a manic rage, as the barbarian rage class feature. The mutant uses
    its HD as its barbarian level. energy type. This special ability can be
    selected multiple times, for the same or different types. Selecting it twice
    for one energy type grants resistance 20; taking it three times for the same
    energy type provides immunity. Rugged (Ex): The mutant has DR 5/-. Sealed
    Mind (Ex): The mutant is immune to mindaffecting effects. Slam (Ex): The
    mutant gains a slam attack for each arm or forelimb. These attacks deal
    damage based on the mutant's size. If the mutant already has a slam attack,
    its slam damage improves by one size category. Sonar (Ex): The mutant has
    blindsense with a range of 30 feet and gains Blind-Fight as a bonus feat.
    Spell-Like Ability (Sp): The mutant has one of the following spell-like
    abilities, usable at will unless noted otherwise: charm monster, charm
    person, chill metal, deep slumber, dimension door (3/day), dominate person
    (dominating a new character frees any previous dominated creature), heat
    metal, mirror image, modify memory, rage, shocking grasp, shout, sleep,
    suggestion, telekinesis. The mutant's caster level is equal to its HD. The
    mutant can choose only spells with a level no higher than half its hit dice.
    This ability can be taken multiple times, choosing a different spell each
    time. Stench (Ex): The mutant has the stench ability, with a duration of 1
    minute. Telepathy (Su, Sp): The mutant has telepathy with a range of 100
    feet as a supernatural ability and detect thoughts as a spell-like ability,
    usable at will. Wings (Ex): The mutant gains wings, granting it a fly speed
    of 40 feet with average maneuverability. Deformities: Each mutant has one of
    the following deformities. It can take a second to gain an extra special
    ability as detailed above. If a deformity would not disadvantage the mutant,
    it cannot be taken. Blind (Ex): The mutant cannot see, and gains the blinded
    condition unless it possesses a means of seeing other than normal vision,
    darkvision, or low-light vision. This blindness cannot be magically removed.
    Deaf (Ex): The mutant can't hear, and gains the deafened condition. This
    deafness cannot be magically removed. Fragile (Ex): When the mutant fails a
    Fortitude save, it is staggered for 1 round. Fractured Mind (Ex): When the
    mutant fails a Will save, it is confused for 1 round. Lame (Ex): The
    mutant's stunted legs reduce its base speed by 10 feet. This deformity
    cannot be taken if the mutant's base speed is already slower than 20 feet.
    Light Blindness (Ex): The mutant has the light blindness special ability.
    This deformity cannot be taken in conjunction with the blind deformity.
    Mindless (Ex): The mutant gains the mindless trait. A mindless mutant has no
    Intelligence score, loses all feats and skills, and is immune to
    mind-affecting effects. A mutant with class levels retains its hit points,
    base attack bonus, and base saves from its class levels, but loses all
    weapon and armor proficiencies and other class abilities. This deformity may
    prevent the mutant from being eligible to take certain special abilities or
    using some of the base creature's abilities, at the GM's discretion.
    Misshapen (Ex): Humanoid mutants only. The mutant cannot wear armor
    (including magical armor) fashioned for humanoid creatures. Armor made to
    fit the mutant costs twice as much. Poor Ability (Ex): The mutant takes a -4
    penalty to one ability score in addition to the normal ability score
    penalties applied by the template. Spasms (Ex): When the mutant fails a
    Reflex save, it loses its Dexterity bonus to AC, on ranged attack rolls and
    attack rolls with finesse weapons, and on ability checks and skill checks,
    and it cannot take attacks of opportunity or immediate actions for 1 round.
    Useless Arm (Ex): One of the mutant's arms is malformed and useless.
    Vulnerability (Ex): The mutant is vulnerable to one energy type. If the base
    creature has innate resistance or immunity to that energy type, it loses
    those abilities. Abilities: A mutant gains a +4 bonus to two ability scores
    of its choice and takes a -2 penalty to two ability scores of its choice.
    Skills: A mutant gains Climb, Intimidate, Knowledge (any one), Perception,
    Sense Motive, Survival, and Swim as class skills.
