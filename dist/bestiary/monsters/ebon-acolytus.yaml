Description_Visual: >-
  A chilling statue strands behind a dark altar, both smeared with evidence of
  grisly sacrifices. The monstrous statue, sculpted as a perverse amalgam of
  both man and beast, raises a wickedly curved sacrificial dagger above its
  head, its bejeweled eyes seeming to glint with murderous zeal.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Prostration (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an ebon acolytus can attempt to force any creature
      it is currently grappling into a sacrificial position. The construct must
      make an additional combat maneuver check against its target to reposition
      it into an advantageous position. If it succeeds, and the victim remains
      grappled at the beginning of the construct's next round, the ebon acolytus
      may make use of its sacrifice ability. An ebon acolytus gains a +2 bonus
      on its CMB for the purposes of making this check if it is adjacent to an
      altar or similar site of ceremonial bloodletting.
  - name: Sacrifice (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, an ebon acolytus may make a coup de grace attack
      with its dagger against any target currently grappled into place using its
      prostration ability. The target is affected by the coup de grace attack
      and must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die as
      normal. If the target is killed by this attack, his soul is sent straight
      to the plane of the being to which the altar is dedicated, regardless of
      alignment, and cannot be raised from the dead except by a cleric sworn to
      the same deity or by a miracle or wish spell. A creature under the effects
      of a protection from evil spell-or similar spell that opposes the
      alignment of the god the ebon acolytus is crafted to serve-may be
      resurrected as normal.
Description:
  - >-
    Dedicated to dark gods, fiends hungry for the souls of innocents, and even
    more monstrous beings, ebon acolyti- sometimes called altar golems-are
    terrifying constructs, for they are not designed merely to kill, but to aid
    in the often bloody work required in the service of foul divinities. Carved
    from a single block of stone or other sturdy material, these constructs
    resemble towering statues, crafted to appear as servants of specific deities
    and often etched with icons sacred to their worship. In addition to its
    fearful body, an ebon acolytus is typically crafted with a companion altar,
    upon which it might aid its master or an unholy congregation in dark rites
    and ritual bloodletting. The exact height and weight of an ebon acolytus
    varies, largely depending on the shape of its body and the quality of the
    stone used in its creation, though most rise to around 14 feet tall and
    weigh around 2,500 pounds. Some carry Large sacrificial weapons other than
    daggers, but these prove rare and vary between faiths. Ecology As artificial
    creations, ebon acolyti have no bodily needs or functions. This allows them
    to perform well as both grim altar attendants and as defenders of unholy
    sites. Clandestine cults often go to great lengths to create ebon acolyti
    just for this reason, as such groups' survivals rely upon the secretiveness
    of their worship. In some rare instances, especially old and well-used ebon
    acolyti have been known to defy their creators, but only when such masters
    have defied the will or tenets of their deity. Religious figures claim such
    rarities are not a sign of devotion from the constructs themselves, though,
    but instead a manifestation of a deities' will operating through a
    convenient medium. Habitat & Society Altar golems are typically found in
    places of dark worship, from the expected locations like depraved dungeons
    and temples consecrated in the name of sinister gods to hidden shrines under
    the homes of supposedly reputable neighbors or secret mountain hollows.
    Wherever the perverse will of foul deities takes root, there ebon acolyti
    might be found. An ebon acolytus's most feared ability is its power to
    sacrifice living creatures to the dark entity to whom it is devoted. This
    foul capability rises from a series of profane rites conducted as part of
    the construct's creation, during which it is bound to a specific patron. A
    ebon acolytus cannot be reconsecrated to a different deity, and those it
    sacrifices always appear in the same extraplanar realm. The being an ebon
    acolytus is created to serve must be of at least deity-level power, and all
    attempts to create servants that direct souls to a lesser or more vague
    source fail. Thus, ebon acolyti are typically found dedicated to evil gods,
    demon lords, archdevils, one of the four horsemen, or similar beings. Those
    killed by an ebon acolytus prove exceedingly diffcult to recover, except by
    the power of those devoted to the deity to whom the victim was sacrificed.
    As such, foul priests often employ ebon acolyti to gain bargaining chips,
    having their construct minion sacrifice a being and demanding some service
    should the victim's loved ones wish him returned. Alternately, worshipers of
    notorious deities often face worldly retribution, but might escape tenacious
    pursuers by sacrificing themselves to their deity, their sacrificial deaths
    allowing them to forever elude the magic and vengeance of their foes.
    Occasionally, there are those who seek to track down and reclaim souls
    wrongfully slain by ebon acolyti. Many quests to unholy realms have been
    undertaken in the attempt to rescue such damned souls, though few meet with
    any success. Although most discussion of ebon acolyti connects them with
    foul deities, such need not be the case. Tools first and foremost, these
    constructs might serve non-evil gods, though in most cases their murderous
    aptitudes are ill suited to such worship. In some cases, particularly in the
    instances of exotic and little-known deities who prove both benevolent and
    bloodthirsty, ebon acolyti might be found in the service of goodly faiths,
    though such instances are exceedingly rare. Construction An ebon acolytus is
    chiseled from a single block of dark stone, often black granite or marble,
    jade, or some other lustrous material, and weighing at least 4,000 pounds.
    The stone must be of exceptional quality and costs at least 6,000 gp. Ebon

    Ebon Acolyti on Golarion Though rare, ebon acolyti have been found
    throughout Golarion, consecrated to a host of foul patrons. While many watch
    over temples and holy sites of Rovagug, Lamashtu, and Asmodeus-and
    peripheral shines to his archdevils-they are more commonly found in squalid
    holes where demon and daemon worshipers enact their blasphemous ceremonies.
    Below are two particularly infamous ebon acolyti. The Altar of Angazhan:
    Deep in the Mwangi Expanse lies an ebon acolytus dedicated to the demon lord
    Angazhan, the Ravener King and Lord of Apes. Carved from obsidian, the altar
    resembles Angazhan himself, a brutish ape with savage tusks and six long,
    slender fingers. Unlike other altar golems, the Altar of Angazhan speaks
    through the Voice of Angazhan, the animated and endlessly furious skull of a
    massive gorilla that serves as the construct's head. Although the skull
    possesses only the intellect of an average ape, it "leads" a pack of
    charau-ka that worships it as their god. The tribe's shamans interpret their
    lord's will in his endless grunts and howls, directing their people to scour
    the Expanse for food, riches, and sacrificial victims. The Midnight Temple
    of Egorian: Found in Cheliax's infernal capital, this massive, marble-carved
    ebon acolytus is known as the Black Altar. Shaped into the likeness of a
    humanoid devil with sweeping horns and monstrous wings, the Black Altar
    seems to be carved straight from the layers of Hell itself. At the stroke of
    midnight on the first day of every ninth week, nine slaves are sacrificed
    here to the God Fiend, the Black Altar absorbing their blood and sending
    their souls screaming to Asmodeus. When the altar prepares to kill its
    victims, its great wings close so none can see the final blow, and when they
    open again, nothing of the sacrifice remains.
