SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Explode (Ex)
    description: >-
      If an arachnid robot is destroyed or takes damage while below half its
      maximum hit points, it must attempt a Fortitude saving throw with a DC
      equal to the amount of damage taken. If it fails, the robot explodes,
      dealing 2d4 points of plasma damage to all targets in a 10-foot-radius
      burst (Reflex DC 10 half). Half the damage dealt by plasma is fire damage,
      and half is electricity damage. This destroys the robot if it was still
      animate. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Fragile (Ex)
    description: >-
      When badly damaged, arachnid robots function poorly. An arachnid robot
      reduced to fewer than half its maximum hit points is staggered and moves
      at half speed. Further damage may cause the robot to explode.
  - name: Plasma Torch (Ex)
    description: >-
      An arachnid robot can use its arm-mounted plasma torch in two ways. First,
      it can use the torch to make a ranged touch attack against a target within
      15 feet, dealing 1d6 points of plasma damage on a successful hit.
      Alternatively, the robot can emit a 15-foot cone from its torch, dealing
      1d4 points of plasma damage to all targets in the area of effect (Reflex
      DC 10 half). The robot's plasma torch requires 1 full round to recharge
      between uses. Half the damage dealt by plasma is fire damage, and half is
      electricity damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Ubiquitous pets of Numerian technologists, arachnid robots also serve as
    sentinels and spies. Arachnid robots come equipped with a plasma welding
    torch that resembles a scorpion's tail stinger and doubles as a weapon.
    Under stress, an arachnid robot's plasma core can overload, destroying the
    robot in a fiery blast. This tendency inspired the practice of using the
    robots as suicide drones.
  - >-
    An arachnid robot is intelligent enough to have a sense of
    self-preservation, however, and one can be made to undertake such a mission
    only through trickery.
  - >-
    Despite their scorpion-like appearance, arachnid robots' ability to use
    their claws as an additional pair of legs when climbing or moving quickly
    has earned the robots the name "spiderbots" among Kellid natives.
  - >-
    Their small size makes them the most likely robots to be found outside of
    Numeria, as they are the ones most easily smuggled past watchful Technic
    League agents.
