Description_Visual: >-
  This massive creature stands almost three times as tall as a human and has the
  head of a donkey. It shuffles with a hunched gait as it moves.  Large
  downward-curving horns protrude from its head. Its body is covered with
  blackish hair. Its feet are splayed and its eyes are stark white with hollow
  black pupils.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Feed (Su)
    description: >-
      When a ghaddar slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on the corpse,
      devouring both flesh and life force, as a full-round action. Feeding
      destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising and
      resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that
      a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a devoured victim
      to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the
      creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic. A ghaddar
      advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion. For every three
      suitable corpses a ghaddar devours, it gains 1 Hit Die, and its Strength,
      Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its attack bonus and saves
      improve as normal for an outsider of its Hit Dice, and it gains skill
      points, feats, and ability score improvements normally. The ghaddar only
      advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose Hit Dice or levels
      are equal to or greater than its own current total.
  - name: Vorpal Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a ghaddar scores a natural 20 on its attack roll with its bite attack
      and confirms the critical hit, it severs the foe's head.
Description:
  - >-
    The terrible and mighty ghaddars roam the planes of Hell devouring the
    unfortunate souls of those they encounter. They also consume the essence and
    being of any outcast devils and dukes that cross their path.
  - A typical ghaddar stands 15 feet tall and weighs 6,000 pounds.
  - >-
    A ghaddar assails its foes with a barrage of claw attacks. A grabbed
    opponent is bitten and, if slain, devoured. Ghaddar are not strategists, and
    unless directed by a commander or captain, they attack with little
    organization and finesse. The ferocity of the ghaddar is unparalleled in
    combat.
