IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ice Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A young white dragon can shape ice and snow at will. This ability
      functions as stone shape, but only targets ice and snow, not stone. A
      white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice.
  - name: Ice Slick (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ice and slush persists from a mythic juvenile white dragon's breath
      weapon, coating all surfaces in the area and turning the area into
      difficult terrain for 1 minute per age category. The dragon can breathe at
      a location beyond its breath weapon range, coating it in ice and slush,
      instead of damaging creatures, in a radius equal to half its breath weapon
      range and at a range of 30 feet per age category (a 15-foot burst up to
      120 feet for a mythic juvenile white dragon).
  - name: Icewalking (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the
      dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without
      penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on
      ice.
  - name: Power Slide (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a mythic juvenile white dragon deals trample damage to one or more
      opponents on ice, snow, frozen tundra, or a similar slippery surface, it
      can expend one use of mythic power to attempt an awesome blow combat
      maneuver against each damaged target, as if it had the Awesome Blow
      monster feat (Bestiary 314).
  - name: Snow Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy
      conditions. A white dragon does not take any penalties on Perception
      checks while in snow.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic white dragon's powers over ice and snow make it a perfect predator
    for its environment. Its hunger is barely kept in check by its human-level
    intelligence. It is fond of crashing into enemies and knocking them into
    ravines so they can be found and eaten later.
