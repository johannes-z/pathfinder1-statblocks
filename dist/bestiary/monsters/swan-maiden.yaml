Description:
  - >-
    Swan maidens are fey shapechangers who vow to protect unspoiled wilds from
    the encroachment of civilization or evil. They live in small flocks along
    secluded lakeshores. Because stealing a swan maiden's cloak robs her of her
    shapechanging ability, most maidens avoid humanoids and take up armor and
    weapons to defend themselves.
