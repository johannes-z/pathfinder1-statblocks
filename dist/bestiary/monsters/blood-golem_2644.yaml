  - name: Blood Consumption (Su)
    description: >-
      Each time a blood golem hits a living opponent with a slam attack, it
      gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. These
      bonus hit points are added to the blood golem's total even if the addition
      takes it above its current maximum hit points. A blood golem cannot gain
      more hit points than the maximum hit points allowed by its HD (not
      including any bonus hit points it may have from its Con score). For
      example, a 7-HD blood golem cannot gain more than 56 hit points. If a
      blood golem successfully hits an opponent with both of its slam attacks in
      a single round, that opponent suffers catastrophic blood expulsion, taking
      2d4 points of Constitution damage (DC 15 Fortitude save for half). A blood
      golem gains 5 hit points per point of Constitution damage it deals. The
      save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. When a blood
      golem reaches its maximum hit points for its Hit Dice, it divides (see
      cell division, below).
  - name: Cell Division (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a blood golem absorbs enough blood to raise its hit points to the
      maximum for its HD, it splits into two identical blood golems, each with
      half the original's hit points. For example, a 7-HD blood golem that
      reaches 56 hit points splits into two 7-HD blood golems with 28 hit points
      each.
  - name: Vulnerability to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A blood golem is slowed (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds by any cold-based
      attacks or effects. A purify food and water spell deals 1d6 points of
      damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to a blood golem. A blood golem can
      attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + caster's ability score modifier)
      to reduce the damage by half.
Description:
  - >-
    Blood golems, contrary to their name, are not constructs: they are
    slugshaped clots of living blood, animated by some ancient ritual by a now
    unknown and unremembered spellcaster. A typical blood golem is 10 feet long
    and weighs 700 pounds. When living prey is detected, the blood golem rises
    up and appears as a slug-like headless humanoid. It attacks with its arms.
    When a blood golem reaches its maximum hit points for its Hit Dice, it
    splits into two identical golems. A blood golem's natural weapons are
    treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
