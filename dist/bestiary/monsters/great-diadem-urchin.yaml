    description: >-
      A great diadem urchin's spines can swivel to face any approaching
      creature. Any creature that attacks a great diadem urchin with an unarmed
      strike or a natural attack, or any Large or smaller creature that attacks
      with a one-handed weapon or light weapon, is automatically attacked by the
      hunter urchin's spines as an immediate action. If the spines hit, they can
      poison the target as well.

  - >-
    Enormous and brilliantly colored diadem urchins are often sought after by
    terrestrial collectors or aquatic creatures seeking to simultaneously
    decorate and defend their throne rooms, yet such beasts are never truly
    trainable, and attack anyone who comes close.
