    description: >-
      Upon each successful sting attack, the giant botfly implants an egg in the
      victim subcutaneously. Each implanted egg reacts to the warmth of the
      victim's body, triggering its hatching. One day later, the egg releases a
      pupa that devours the host's flesh as it develops, growing to the size of
      a small mouse, at which point it reaches its larval stage. If left
      untreated, the larva continues to develop until it kills the host or 1
      week has passed, at which point it burrows out of the body and drops to
      the ground, where it transforms into an adult giant botfly. Individual
      larvae may be squeezed or cut out of the host with a DC 10 Heal check,
      though each attempt inflicts 1d4 points of damage whether or not it's
      successful. A cure disease spell destroys all larvae without further harm
      to the host. Giant botfly larvae: infestation; save Fort DC 10; onset 1
      day; frequency 1/day for 1 week; effect 1 Con damage per larva.
Description:
  - >-
    Botf lies are perhaps the most disgusting vermin native to the Expanse.
    Explorers tell sickening tales of removing maggots from living hosts-or
    worse, comrades eaten alive by larvae. Once a botf ly finds a warm-blooded
    host, it uses its proboscis to insert eggs into the host's flesh. When the
    eggs hatch, the larvae feed upon the host until they mature into adult flies
    and exit.
