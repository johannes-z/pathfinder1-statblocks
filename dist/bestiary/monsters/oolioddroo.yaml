SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Oviposition (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action once per day, an oolioddroo can use its tongue to
      implant its eggs into the brain of a helpless, sleeping, unconscious, or
      willing creature, dealing 1 point of Intelligence damage. Typically, the
      oolioddroo uses modify memory immediately after an oviposition, making its
      victim forget the violation. The egg gestates in the victim's brain for 24
      hours, after which a small caterpillar-like larva emerges and nestles
      painlessly into the victim's brain. At this point, the oolioddroo can
      track the victim's location as if the victim were under the effect of a
      status spell, can communicate telepathically with the victim across any
      distance, and can use its detect thoughts, modify memory, and suggestion
      spell-like abilities through the link to target the victim. The larva (and
      link to its oolioddroo) becomes inert whenever the victim and the
      oolioddroo are on separate planes. Victims carrying this larva detect as
      chaotic and evil. Anyone who reads the victim's thoughts, such as via
      detect thoughts or telepathy, can attempt a Sense Motive check opposed by
      the oolioddroo's Bluff check to notice the presence of a second, alien set
      of thoughts in the target's mind. Dispel chaos and dispel evil immediately
      ends the oviposition- the implanted larva melts into harmless fluid and is
      absorbed by the victim's body. This is not a disease effect, though, so
      heal or remove disease offer no aid in ending the effect. As an immediate
      action, an oolioddroo can use its feeblemind spell-like ability on the
      carrier-it uses this "scorched earth" tactic if it fears that the host is
      about to be rescued or cut off from its influence, such as occurs when the
      effects are ended via dispel chaos or dispel evil. Using feeblemind in
      this way automatically destroys the larva, regardless of whether or not
      the victim saves against the feeblemind effect, so an oolioddroo typically
      waits until the last moment to use this ability.
  - name: See Thoughts (Su)
    description: >-
      An oolioddroo can see a creature's thoughts, interpreting them as a
      shifting mass of images, colors, and shapes that infuse a creature's aura.
      An oolioddroo gains the effects of see invisibility against creatures with
      an Intelligence score as a result of this unusual sense. This ability also
      grants the oolioddroo a +8 racial bonus on Sense Motive checks. When it
      uses detect thoughts, it does not have to study an area or subject to gain
      all 3 rounds of information-it gains all of this information on the 1st
      round of using the ability. In addition, it gains a +4 racial bonus on the
      save DC of its detect thoughts spell-like ability. A blind oolioddroo
      loses the ability to see thoughts.
  - name: Shadow Mantle (Su)
    description: >-
      The supernatural shadows that wreathe an oolioddroo grant the creature a
      +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks and a +4 deflection bonus to its Armor
      Class.
  - name: Thought Siphon (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever an oolioddroo damages a creature with its tongue attack, it can
      drink away one of the creature's thoughts or memories. A creature can
      resist this attack with a successful DC 23 Will save. On a failed save,
      the oolioddroo chooses to target the victim with one of the following
      effects. The save DC is Charisma-based. Memory Drain: The victim is
      immediately affected by the oolioddroo's modify memory spell-like ability.
      The oolioddroo can adjust up to 5 minutes of memories immediately-it does
      not need to increase the spell's casting time to match the duration of the
      modified memory. Skill Drain: The victim loses all skill ranks in a skill
      of the oolioddroo's choosing for 24 hours. Lost skill ranks can be
      recovered immediately with a restoration or greater restoration spell.
      Spell Drain: The victim immediately loses one prepared spell or one unused
      spell slot of the oolioddroo's choice; this lost spell or spell slot can
      be replenished normally. Wisdom Drain: The victim takes 2 points of Wisdom
      drain.
  - name: Tongue (Ex)
    description: >-
      An oolioddroo's tongue attack is a primary attack that does piercing and
      slashing damage. Whenever an oolioddroo damages a foe with its tongue, it
      can use its thought siphon attack.
Description:
  - >-
    Oolioddroos, known also as moth demons, are a particularly insidious breed
    of fiend that can infest the brain of a living creature with their eggs,
    allowing them to manipulate creatures' thoughts and minds from afar.
    Sometimes an oolioddroo's victim can go for months or even years before the
    demon capitalizes on the link and forces the victim to undertake a
    particularly nefarious or vile deed. In the worst cases, the victim can
    commit crimes or heinous acts at the oolioddroo's bidding and then
    immediately forget about these acts, creating the perfect sleeper agent who
    not only unknowingly does the oolioddroo's bidding, but might even be
    significantly involved in efforts to oppose the acts of sabotage and
    terrorism the oolioddroo commands. To the oolioddroo, the torment, shame,
    and despair a victim feels upon realizing he's been at least somewhat
    responsible for the actions is as delicious and delightful as the pain and
    suffering caused by the acts themselves.
  - >-
    An oolioddroo appears as a skeletally thin woman with gray flesh. Its shadow
    mantle typically appears in the form of a flowing, diaphanous, black gown,
    but the demon can control the shape of this supernatural defense to make it
    appear as regular black clothing or simply its own shadow. The oolioddroo's
    face is that of a horned moth, and her tongue, while flexible, can penetrate
    flesh and bone with ease. An oolioddroo stands 6 feet tall, but only weighs
    100 pounds. These sinister demons form from the souls of those who used
    brainwashing, mind-control, and similar techniques, either magical or
    mundane, to trick or force the innocent into committing terrible acts of
    brutality.
  - >-
    An encounter with an oolioddroo can be rather complex, especially if a PC is
    its intended victim. If an oolioddroo attempts to seize control of a lone
    PC, one tricky tactic is to simply ask the character's player to attempt all
    the necessary rolls and checks beforehand. Typically, one of these demons
    attempts to implant eggs in a sleeping or lonely character, so you can just
    have that character make a Perception check (at a -10 penalty if the
    character is sleeping) and a saving throw against the modify memory spell-if
    both fail, you can continue with the assumption that the implanted egg
    hatches without the player noticing. Thereafter, the source of the strange
    voices and compulsions in the character's thoughts, as well as the source of
    the periodic suggestions and other magical attacks, can be as frighteningly
    mysterious to the player as well as the character. Of course, you should
    take care not to go too far with this-if the PC or an ally uses detect evil,
    for example, don't forget to give them the clue that something strange is
    going on when a normally non-evil PC radiates an unexpected aura!
