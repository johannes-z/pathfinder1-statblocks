SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blinding Pulse (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a move action, the prismatic orrery can set its lenses to refract the
      light of the prismatic sphere at its center, granting it a gaze attack
      that causes blindness in all targets that fail a DC 19 Fortitude saving
      throw. This gaze attack can be disabled as a move action, and is
      automatically disabled if the orrery uses its prismatic refraction ability
      or if the prismatic sphere is temporarily dispelled. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Dispel Resistance (Su)
    description: >-
      The prismatic sphere at the center of the orrery (CL 20th) can be
      dispelled with a targeted dispel magic spell, but only temporarily. As the
      sphere is fueled by the elemental energies within the Prismatic Lantern's
      demiplane, it reappears after 1d3 rounds. While the prismatic sphere is
      inactive, the prismatic orrery cannot use its blinding pulse and prismatic
      refraction abilities.
  - name: Prismatic Refraction (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, the prismatic orrery can position its many rings and
      lenses such that the magical energy of the prismatic sphere at its center
      is aimed in a series of beams at all targets within 60 feet. These beams
      take the form of a prismatic spray spell (CL 13th); determine the color of
      each ray randomly with a roll of 1d8 as indicated in the spell. A
      prismatic refraction ray is a ranged touch attack with a +17 bonus to hit
      and a save DC of 21. It takes the prismatic orrery 1d4 rounds to
      recalibrate its lenses to recharge this ability. The save DC is
      Dexterity-based.
Description:

    wielder of a crystal control rod.
