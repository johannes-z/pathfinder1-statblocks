SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Spores (Ex)
    description: >-
      The chief is the only vegepygmy with a spore attack. As a standard action,
      a chief vegepygmy can release a cloud of spores in a 40-foot spread. A
      living creature caught within the cloud must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude
      save or be paralyzed for 2d6 rounds. After the paralysis wears off, the
      character must succeed on another DC 17 Fortitude save or take 3d6 points
      of Constitution damage. This save DC is Constitution-based. At
      Constitution 0 a creature dies, and rises as a 4 HD vegepygmy bodyguard in
      one day. If a remove disease spell is cast on a paralyzed victim before
      the paralysis wears off, he does not have to attempt the second Fortitude
      save and takes no Constitution damage.
Description:
  - >-
    When a living creature is slain by russet mold (see that entry), it rises as
    a vegepygmy commoner. Vegepygmies are low-intelligence plants that make
    their home deep in the forests or underground away from most settled areas.
    They are hunters and scavengers, and carnivorous, preying on living
    creatures weaker than themselves. A vegepygmy ranges from two feet to four
    and a half feet tall. Though they do not seem to have ears, it is well known
    that vegepygmies can hear. Vegepygmies do not speak, but communicate with
    others of their kind by thumping their chest or rapping their spears on
    rocks, earth, or some other solid surface. It is not known if or how they
    communicate with other creatures. Vegepygmies attack with claws or weapons,
    usually either a longspear or club. They prefer to ambush opponents, using
    their coloration to blend with their natural surroundings. Credit The
