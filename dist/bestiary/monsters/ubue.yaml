SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Multiple Personalities (Ex)
    description: >-
      The three heads of an ubue rarely get along with each other. Due to this
      division of personalities, there is a 15% chance in any given situation
      (usually once per encounter) that the heads get into an argument. An ubue
      engaged in an argument with itself takes a -2 circumstance penalty on
      attack rolls, Reflex saves, and to AC for the duration of the encounter,
      or until they can reach some sort of accord. In a non-combat situation, an
      opponent can coerce an ubue into a self-argument by making a Charisma
      check opposed by the ubue's Wisdom check. If the ubue wins the opposed
      check, the character cannot attempt to coerce that ubue again for one day.
  - name: Superior Multiweapon Fighting (Ex)
    description: >-
      An ubue fights with a club in each of its three hands. Because each of its
      three heads controls an arm, the ubue does not take a penalty on attack or
      damage rolls for attacking with three weapons.
Description:
  - >-
    Ubues are a bizarre race that is among the rarest of intelligent races. They
    are so rare, in fact, that most people believe their existence to be only
    legend. At first sight, many adventurers assume that ubues are a race of
    three-headed ettins or trolls. Adventurers who have actually seen these
    strange creatures claim that the middle head of an ubue is a different sex
    from the other two. This is not true, however, and is in fact merely a side
    effect of the bizarre biology of these creatures. Ubues are very primitive
    and clothe themselves in unfinished animal hides, weave bones and sticks
    into their hair, and utilize only the crudest of tools and weapons. Ubues
    attack with savage brutality as if in an animalistic rage. Ubue Society
    Ubues have a very primitive social system: simply put, the strongest male of
    any ubue tribe is the leader. Any adult male ubue has the right to challenge
    the tribal leader in a non-lethal ritual combat-usually a wrestling match or
    other test of strength. If the challenger loses, he is banished from the
    tribe for a period of one full year. His immediate family is also banished
    with him: ubues cannot tolerate weakness. Should the leader be deposed, he
    becomes an elder of the tribe and acts as an advisor to the new leader.
    Female ubues usually give birth to only a single child. If twins are born to
    an ubue couple, this is seen as an ill omen: thus, one child is slain by the
    tribal shaman as a sacrifice to their god. The shaman casts bones or sticks
    to determine which child is to be the sacrifice. Because ubue society is
    strongly male-dominated, if one twin is male and the other female, it will
    always be the female child that is sacrificed. Ubue Characters Ubues are
    simple thinkers, and prefer simple choices when advancing in a class,
    particularly favoring the barbarian and fighter classes. All ubues have the
    following racial traits. +6 Strength, -2 Dexterity, +4 Constitution, -2
    Intelligence, +2 Charisma: Ubues are sturdy and powerful creatures. Large
    Size: -1 penalty to AC, -1 penalty to attack rolls, -4 penalty on Stealth
    checks, +1 bonus on CMB and CMD, lifting and carrying limits double those of
    Medium creatures. Space/Reach: 10 ft./10 ft. Low-Light Vision: Ubues can see
    twice as far as humans in dimly lit conditions. All-Around Vision: Because
    each head thinks independently, ubues can see in all directions, and can't
    be flanked. Racial Hit Dice: An ubue begins with three levels of humanoid,
    which provide 3d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +2, and base saving throw
    bonuses of Fort +3, Ref +1, and Will +1. Racial Skills: An ubue's humanoid
    levels give it skill points equal to 3 x (2 + Int modifier). Racial Feats:
    An ubue's humanoid levels give it two feats. AC: +6 natural armor bonus.
    Natural Weapons: Ubues can fight with slam attacks that deal lethal damage
    (1d6). Special Attacks: Superior multiweapon fighting (see above). Special
    Qualities: Multiple personalities (see above). Weapon Familiarity: Ubues are
    proficient with simple weapons. Armor Familiarity: Ubues are proficient with
    light and medium armor and with shields (except tower shields). Languages:
    Ubues begin play speaking Giant. If an ubue has an Intelligence of at least
    10 it also knows Common. Ubues with high intelligence can choose from among
    the following bonus languages: Aklo, Gnoll, Goblin, Orc, Undercommon. Credit
