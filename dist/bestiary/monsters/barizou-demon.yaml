      As a free action, a barizou can alter its coloration to blend with its
      surroundings. This grants the barizou a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks
      (included in its stat block).
  - name: Sneak Attack (Ex)
    description: >-
      Anytime a barizou's opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, or when
      a target is flanked by a barizou, the creature deals an extra 2d6 points
      of damage on a successful hit.
Description:
  - >-
    Called assassin demons or infiltrator demons, the barizou are employed as
    such because their small size allows them to move unseen in many places
    larger demons cannot go. The typical barizou stands 3 feet tall and weighs
    about 60 pounds.
