SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burn (Ex)
    description: >-
      The body of a magmoid is composed of molten rock and elemental fire. Any
      melee hit deals 2d6 points of fire damage initially and 1d6 points of
      damage for the next 1d3 rounds. Creatures attacking a magmoid unarmed or
      with natural weapons take fire damage each time one of their attacks hits
      just as if the magmoid had hit with a melee attack.
  - name: Magma Blast (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a magmoid can release a line
      of magma to a range of 40 feet. This deals 2d6 points of damage in the
      round it hits a foe (DC 17 Reflex save for half), and 1d6 points of damage
      for another 1d3 rounds (no save).
  - name: Melt Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any metal weapon that strikes a magmoid must make a successful DC 17
      Fortitude save or melt away into slag. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:

    Magmoids are giant balls of elemental magma that destroy or burn anything
    and everything they come in contact with. Though they are typically only
    found on the Planes of Earth or Fire or the Plane of Molten Skies (see the
    City of Brass by Necromancer Games for details on this demiplane),
    occasionally one slips through a portal or nexus into the Material Plane
    (usually in the heart of a volcano) where it wreaks havoc upon all things
    that cross its path; be it creatures, structures, or anything else not
    immune to fire. Attempts by arcane spellcasters (foolish arcane spellcasters
    some would say) to control or harness the power of a magmoid, thus far have
    failed. Magmoids seem to serve no purpose in the Ecology of their native
    plane and are thought to be a living extension of the plane itself. Small
    bubbling pockets on the magmoid's form serve as sensory organs. A giant
    magmoid, measuring 30 feet across is thought to exist near the Sea of Fire,
    though none have ever seen it. A magmoid attacks by spraying a blast of
    superheated magma at opponents or by slamming into and rolling over them. It
    often targets weapon-wielding creatures first and moves close enough where
    they can hit with their weapons. The magmoid knows that more than likely
    should a weapon hit its fiery form, it will be turned into a pile of slag in
    short order. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
