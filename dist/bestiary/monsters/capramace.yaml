      cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Rage Call (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a capramace can open its mouth and emit
      a horrible, earpiercing scream to call for its herd. Maintaining a rage
      call on any round after the first round is a free action and there is no
      limit to the duration of a sustained rage call. Non-capramaces within 120
      feet that fail a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw are deafened for as long as
      the capramace maintains its call and for 1d4 minutes afterward. Any other
      capramaces within 1 mile can hear this high-pitched cry regardless of
      external noise conditions, and they instinctively react by sprinting to
      the capramace in need, moving as fast as possible toward the capramace for
      as long as it maintains its rage call. A capramace moving toward the
      source of a rage call is treated as though it possessed the Run feat. Any
      capramace that comes within 60 feet of another capramace's rage call goes
      wild with fear and anger, stomping about and attacking the nearest
      creature in sight for as long as the rage call lasts. Sound-mitigating
      effects such as silence or a muzzle of suppression (see page 26) can
      prevent a capramace from performing its rage call, as can effects that
      suffocate a capramace. Similarly, a capramace with the deafened condition
      cannot be affected by the rage cry of another capramace. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Capramaces are wild, monstrous beasts native to the Mana Wastes. While their
    exact origins are unknown, scholars speculate that they are an unholy
    abomination resulting from some combination of goat, human, and the Mana
    Wastes' mutative energies. Farmers must be careful when removing them from
    farmlands for fear of startling them and awakening their terrible, deafening
    screams. Brave inhabitants of remote Mana Wastes settlements sometimes use
    capramaces as work animals, but most regard this a foolish endeavor at best.
