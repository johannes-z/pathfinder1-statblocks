Description_Visual: >-
  This humanoid creature's skin is scorched brown and pulled taut against its
  bones. Flames flicker in its hollow eye sockets.

Description:
  - >-
    Most creatures that die in the desert are consumed by roaming scavengers or
    buried forever by sand, yet those who avoid such a fate bake under the
    merciless sun. Such desiccated corpses near pyramids or other areas with
    strong necromantic magic sometimes rise as sunbaked zombies. With their
    corporeal bodies warped by the sun, and their innards but a dry facsimile of
    living organs, sunbaked zombies use the gifts of the sun to lash those who
    cross their paths. A sunbaked zombie is the same size as its original form,
    but typically weighs less than half its original weight.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Other than the dry, leathery skin clinging to the creature's bones, the most
    striking physical difference between a sunbaked zombie and a normal zombie
    is the sunbaked zombie's flame-filled eye sockets. Though it lacks
    functioning eyes-those having long since shriveled to dust-the sunbaked
    zombie can see as well as any other zombie, and the flames in its dried
    sockets can set enemies afire. With its dried, taut skin and taut and
    insides reduced to dust, it retains a normal zombie's resistance to damage.
    When its animating spark is extinguished, a sunbaked zombie's corpse bursts
    into a cloud of poisonous gas, choking those around it.
  - >-
    So long as the sun shines, sunbaked zombies move about as if with purpose.
    At night, however, they wander in circles until the sun blazes across the
    morning sky
  - >-
    once more. The faint light given off by their eye sockets, combined with
    their stumbling movement, has led some desert nomads to claim they are
    desert will-o-wisps.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Sun-baked zombies most often rise near pyramids and other burial sites in
    hot deserts, where latent necromantic energy lingers from countless arcane
    rituals and restless spirits. As such, sunbaked zombies are primarily found
    among the dunes of Osirion and the other nations that make up northern
    Garund. Typically animated in isolation, sunbaked zombies rarely form hordes
    like normal zombies, but when entire caravans fall to thirst and the desert
    sun, all of its members might rise as these terrible undead.
  - >-
    When one intentionally raises a sunbaked zombie using animate dead, the body
    to be raised must be left out in the sun's rays for a full 12 hours and must
    be salted every hour during this time to hasten its desiccation. Spell
    effects that produce light work for this purpose only if they count as
    actual sunlight, and even then they must be combined with desecrate. Casting
    the animating spell at night always fails; the sun must be out and directly
    beating down on the corpse. Without the intense magical focus of a spell, it
    takes many days for the corpse to absorb enough sun and necromantic energy
    to rise spontaneously.
  - >-
    Creating a Sunbaked Zombie "Sunbaked zombie" is an acquired template that
    can be added to any corporeal creature (other than undead), referred to
    hereafter as the base creature.

  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: A sunbaked zombie loses the base creature's defensive
    abilities and gains DR 5/slashing and resist fire 10 (or immunity to fire if
    it has 11 HD or more), as well as all of the standard immunities and traits
    granted by the undead type.
  - >-
    Speed: Winged sunbaked zombies can still fly, but their maneuverability
    drops to clumsy. If the base creature flew magically, so can the sunbaked
    zombie. Retain all other movement types.
  - >-
    Attacks: A sunbaked zombie retains all natural weapons, manufactured weapon
    attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam
    attack that deals damage based on the sunbaked zombie's size, but as if it
    were one size category larger than its actual size (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary
    301-302).
  - >-
    Special Attacks: A sunbaked zombie retains none of the base creature's
    special attacks, but gains the following.
  - >-
    Death Throes (Su): When a sunbaked zombie is destroyed, its body explodes in
    a burst of stale dust. Adjacent creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save
    or be staggered for 1d4+1 rounds. The DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the sunbaked
    zombie's Hit Dice + the sunbaked zombie's Cha modifier. Creatures that don't
    breathe are immune to this effect.
  - >-
    Fiery Gaze (Su): A sunbaked zombie's eye sockets flicker with a small flame
    that gives light equivalent to that of a candle. As a standard action, a
    sunbaked zombie can direct its gaze against a single creature within 30 feet
    of it. A creature targeted must succeed at a Fortitude save
  - >-
    or take 1d6 points of fire damage. If the sunbaked zombie has 5 or more Hit
    Dice, its fiery gaze deals 2d6 points of fire damage, and this damage
    increases by an additional 1d6 points of fire damage for every 4 additional
    Hit Dice the sunbaked zombie possesses. A creature damaged by this effect
    must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire. Each round, a burning creature
    can attempt a Reflex save to quench the flames; failure results in another
    1d6 points of fire damage. Flammable items worn by a creature must also save
    or take the same damage as the creature. If a creature is already on fire,
    it suffers no additional effects from a fiery gaze. The save DC is
    Charisma-based.
  - >-
    Abilities: Str +2. A sunbaked zombie has no Con or Int score, and its Wis
    and Cha become 10.
  - 'BAB: A sunbaked zombie''s base attack bonus is equal to 3/4 of its Hit Dice.'
  - 'Skills: A sunbaked zombie has no skill ranks.'
  - >-
    Feats: A sunbaked zombie loses all feats possessed by the base creature and
    gains Toughness as a bonus feat.
  - >-
    Special Qualities: A sunbaked zombie loses most special qualities of the
    base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve
    its melee or ranged attacks.
