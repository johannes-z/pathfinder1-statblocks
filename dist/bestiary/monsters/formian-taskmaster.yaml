      7th-level bard (typically 20 rounds/day). The taskmaster's performance is

      telepathic range.

Description:
  - >-
    Formian taskmasters are merchants, traders, diplomats, and spies, and
    particularly talented taskmasters may even advise the queen. Taskmasters can
    often be found outside the hive engaging in commerce or routine diplomatic
    missions. While traveling, a taskmaster is usually accompanied by 3-5
    workers and at least 5 warriors. When dealing with other creatures, formians
    recognize that their telepathy can be off-putting and use normal speech,
    although their mandibles are not well suited for the task and their voices
    are often hoarse and diff icult to understand. Like myrmarchs, taskmasters
    are highly competitive and take great pride in their successes. Notable
    accomplishments are carved into their carapaces and highlighted with the use
    of bright inks, precious metals, or gems. Formian society is largely free of
    the crime that is common in other humanoid societies, but formians do have
    occasional duels within a caste. Two taskmasters might have a duel over
    promotions, a trade route, or an insult. These duels are rarely lethal for
    fear of weakening the hive, and taskmasters who are too aggressive attract
    the wrong kind of attention from the myrmarchs. Dueling victories are often
    recorded on taskmasters' carapaces alongside their other major
    accomplishments.
