    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a skin stealer may steal the skin of a creature of
      Small, Medium, or Large size with a roughly humanoid shape. The target
      creature must be dead, helpless, or willing. If the target creature is
      alive, the skin stealer must make a successful coup de grace attack to
      steal its skin. The skin stealer can don or remove a stolen skin as a move
      action. When wearing a stolen skin, the skin stealer takes on the likeness
      of the skin's original owner, including the victim's voice, build, and
      size, but gains none of the creature's abilities. The stolen skin grants
      the skin stealer a +10 bonus on Disguise checks, with none of the usual
      penalties for different gender, race, age, and size. Stolen skins are
      preserved and remain as supple as living skin. A skin stealer may only
      steal and use a number of skins equal to its Charisma score. The skin
      stealer may choose to discard unwanted skins to make room for new ones at
      any time; discarded skins rot and decay normally.
Description:
  - >-
    A sadistic being from the realm of the fey, a skin stealer is a terrifying
    sight to behold. These blood-red creatures resemble horrid, emaciated humans
    without skin, their yellowish eyes and teeth suggesting malnourishment or
    disease. Skin stealers suffer from no ailment, however, except for their
    insatiable lust for chaos and their hunger for flesh.
  - >-
    Hailing from the First World, skin stealers are fey bent on destruction and
    gruesome murder. When left to their own devices, these gangly beings are
    unpredictable and spontaneous; when assigned duties from some higher,
    stronger power, however, skin stealers prove adept at performing complex
    assassinations and spy work.
  - >-
    A skin stealer is a little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds,
    though it can adjust its size to inhabit many different creatures' skins.
  - >-
    Ecology Nightmares can come true just as readily as dreams in the First
    World, and the skin stealer is proof of this. A manifestation of
    inhabitants' fears and disdain, a skin stealer's primary desires are to
    deceive, murder, and rob. In a world where inconsistency is the law and
    little can be trusted anyway, these evil denizens only add to the
    overwhelming sense of paranoia many travelers feel when thrust into the
    magical realm of the fey.
  - >-
    When a powerful inhabitant of the Material Plane experiences intense
    feelings of distrust and maliciousness, she can unintentionally draw out a
    skin stealer from the First World-often whilst sleeping-under the guise of a
    nightmare. Thus, an unwitting evoker of such a dark being awakens cold and
    sweaty, unaware of the chaotic fey now causing mayhem outside her chamber
    walls-assuming the bandit hasn't already made off with her flesh yet.
  - >-
    Skin stealers possess few items of their own, as they derive absolutely no
    pleasure from material goods, and often times the only thing one will carry
    is a sharp object.
  - >-
    Though their claws-thick and unsightly as they are- are formidable weapons,
    they are not ideal tools when it comes to flaying victims. Thus, many skin
    stealers use rusty knives or crude blades as their scalpels. Most skin
    stealers would revel in the agony that skinning victims alive would cause,
    but the simple fact of the matter is that stripping a subject's flesh is too
    difficult while the victim is still alive. It is out of convenience, rather
    than any sense of mercy, that a skin stealer slays a target before
    performing its barbaric reinterpretation of surgery.
  - >-
    Though most think of skin stealers as nothing more than mindless killing
    machines with a quirky habit of peeling the skin off victims, the truth is
    grimmer. In addition to their affinity for grisly murders, skin stealers
    also possess a love of trickery, delighting in the chaos they can create
    through impersonating political leaders they have slain or the havoc they
    can wreak while wearing the flesh of a trusted guard or advisor. Where a
    skin stealer goes, there is not only death, but confusion as well.
  - >-
    The techniques skin stealers employ while preparing a hide for use would
    inspire the envy and admiration of fur trappers if the act were not so
    heinous. Even more remarkable than their style of flaying, perhaps, is their
    supernatural ability to preserve the flesh of victims for lengthy periods of
    time. Skin stealers fold the fleshy suit of a victim into an impressively
    compact pouch that they can fit into any fist-sized pocket or pouch.
    Realizing the benefits of possessing multiple hides, skin stealers tend to
    wear clothes with numerous compartments, making adventurers and traveling
    merchants particularly susceptible to having their skins and outfits stolen.
  - >-
    Skin stealers' own flesh looks similar to the muscular layer beneath most
    humanoids' epidermis. This outer layer is so taut that it allows skin to
    perfectly adhere to it. The malleable vocal cords of a skin stealer are
    located on the outside of its throat-when it dons the flesh of another
    being, it captures that creature's voice's tone and inf lection by shaping
    its own neck muscles so as to fit its host's perfectly. The slightest bump
    or agitation may disturb the sensitive vocal lining, however, and one of the
    most common giveaways of a skin stealer in disguise is an abrupt crack in
    its speech or a shift in register.
  - >-
    A skin stealer does not die of old age; instead, it continually wanders
    whatever plane it may have found itself upon until it is slain, at which
    time it returns to the First World to be reborn into the cosmic energy
    comprising its native realm.
  - >-
    Habitat & Society Often used by powerful entities of the First World as
    spies, assassins, and agents of havoc, skin stealers excel at espionage as
    well as cold-blooded murder. On the Material Plane, skin stealers are much
    more difficult to partner with, their lust for flesh only heightened by the
    plethoric array of new available suits. However, if one can garner the
    respect of a skin stealer (usually only possible through intimidation or
    coercion), one has found a powerful ally.
  - >-
    When a skin stealer emerges from the First World onto the Material Plane, it
    immediately tries to find a host for its horrid form, knowing full well that
    exposure could lead to its swift eradication. Fortunately for the wretched
    fey, it usually arrives via the unhindered emotions of a hapless dreamer
    rapt in torturous visions or night terrors.
  - >-
    This helpless subject makes for an easy first target, and a skin stealer may
    inhabit this individual's flesh for several days while it gathers its
    bearings and studies the immediate world around it.
  - Skin stealers rarely stay in one spot long, however.
  - >-
    Their love of mayhem often turns a place of peace into one of bedlam, and it
    behooves a skin stealer to continue alternating between different suits of
    skin, both to perpetuate chaos and to mask its identity. When people begin
    to suspect the gruesome bandit or catch it in its gory work, it hastily
    leaves the area in search of new, unsuspecting victims.
  - >-
    Skin stealers do not collaborate or work together unless a higher power
    forces them to do so. Their self ish predispositions and individualistic
    tactics make teamwork diff icult, and planned assassinations tend to go
    better when performed by a lone skin stealer.
  - >-
    Just as useful, though, are skin stealers who remain at their master's side,
    so adept are they at identifying doppelgangers and other skin stealers. As
    skin stealers are masters of disguise as well as flaying, few can bypass
    their perceptive gaze.
