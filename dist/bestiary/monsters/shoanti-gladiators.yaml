Description:
  - >-
    Easily the most popular public venue in Magnimar, the massive hippodrome
    known as Serpent's Run hosts a number of spectacles and events year-round to
    entertain both the citizens of Magnimar and visitors to the city. In
    addition to magic performances, circus acts, and sporting events, this
    enormous arena also plays host to the most impressive mock gladiatorial
    battles in western Varisia. Competitions take the form of duels or massive
    battles royal wherein participants use lethal weapons to deal their
    opponents felling blows.
  - >-
    Many of the most successful gladiators in Magnimar are of Shoanti descent.
    Their unique fighting style and unusual weapons bring numerous spectators to
    gladiatorial events, and their strength, skill, and fearlessness make them
    exciting to watch. Outside the ring, Shoanti gladiators live well. Tavern
    owners gift brawlers with free drinks and meals after a successful bout, and
    canny bartenders often sponsor gladiatorial warriors, using their local
    celebrity to drum up more business and set their establishment apart from
    the rest. Such subsidized fighters are usually garnered from among the many
    toughs that frequent Magnimar's dives, and one can never be sure when an
    accidental bar brawl might turn into a potential business opportunity.
