SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Implant (Ex)
    description: >-
      A deadfall dweller can inject 1d3 larvae into a helpless creature as a
      full-round action. Excretions from these larvae have a paralyzing effect,
      leaving the host helpless until the larvae mature into young deadfall
      dwellers that erupt from the host's body, killing it. Each day, an
      impregnated host must attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save. If the host succeeds
      at the saving throw, it is no longer helpless, but is still impregnated.
      If it fails, it takes 1 point of Constitution drain and remains helpless
      for another day. All of the larvae in an impregnated creature can be
      destroyed with a remove disease spell. Alternatively, a creature can take
      10 minutes to attempt a DC 20 Heal check to remove a single larva. This
      check can be attempted multiple times, but each attempt deals 1d6 points
      of damage to the host. The save DC is Constitution-based.

  - name: Spittle (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a deadfall dweller can emit a stream of corrosive
      spittle at one target within 30 feet. On a successful attack, the target
      takes 1d6 points of acid damage, and must save to avoid being entrapped by
      the solidifying mucus.
Description:
  - >-
    Deadfall dwellers are dangerous ambush predators most commonly encountered
    in the old forests and forgotten marshes of eastern Avistan. They make their
    homes among fallen stands of trees, where they take advantage of a unique
    form of camouflage. Hungry deadfall dwellers fold their many sticklike legs
    under themselves, collapsing against large tree trunks or simply lying on
    the ground. When a warm-blooded creature happens by, a deadfall dweller
    straightens its legs to pursue, and bellows out a spray of acidic mucus that
    paralyzes the victim in its tracks. The beast then advances to attack with
    its poisonous bite and sharp, scraping appendages.
  - >-
    Deadfall dwellers reproduce by immobilizing prey with repeated applications
    of acidic spray, then implanting a clutch of eggs within the paralyzed host.
    The larval dwellers keep their host immobilized while they absorb moisture
    from its body. After the dwellers grow in size, they emerge from the husk of
    their host, whose flesh by that point resembles the shriveled bark of a dead
    tree.
  - >-
    Most deadfall dwellers have a mottled green-brown carapace, the better to
    fit into their typical surroundings. A few have been reported in colder
    climates, with white-gray exoskeletons and freezing spittle. An average
    deadfall dweller stretches 11 feet long, stands 6 feet tall, and weighs 600
    pounds.
