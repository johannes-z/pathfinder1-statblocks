  Scurrying from the sands rises a monstrously-sized spider. Standing taller

  agitation.

    description: >-
      The front four legs of a sand stalker are hollow. When a gust of air or
      wind blows across them, they create a hypnotic sound that can be heard by
      all creatures within a 100-foot spread. Those hearing this sound must make
      a successful DC 15 Will save or become entranced. This is a sonic,
      mind-affecting effect. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be
      affected again by the same sand stalker's attraction for one day. The save
      DC is Constitution-based. An entranced victim takes the most direct route
      possible, walking toward the sand stalker. If the path leads into a
      dangerous area, (fire, over a cliff, and so on), that creature gets a
      second saving throw. Entranced creatures can take no actions other than to
      defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the sand stalker stands there
      and offers no resistance to the monster's attacks. The effect continues
      for as long as the sand stalker's legs are subjected to wind. A bard's
      countersong ability allows the entranced creature to attempt a new Will
      save.

Description:
  - >-
    Sand stalkers are agile, 12-foot-long, aggressive, hunting spiders with
    voracious appetites. Thankfully they are found only in deserts and usually
    away from civilized areas. The sand stalker is a wanderer; though some do
    occasionally build lairs. These consist of an open hole constructed in areas
    where the ground is hard enough to prevent a flood of sand and debris from
    filling the lair. Some sand stalkers cover their burrows with a "trapdoor"
    (noticeable with a DC 20 Perception check). If the ground is unsuitable for
    burrowing, the stalker takes up residence in whatever shelter is available,
    such as an abandoned temple or beneath a rocky outcropping.

    Sand stalkers are typically solitary creatures though on some occasions a
    few of the creatures nest together. A typical nest consists of 1d4+1 sand
    stalkers, usually two males, and two females with the female sand stalkers
    being the dominate forces in the nest.
  - >-
    Sand stalkers are carnivores and hunt all manner of desert-dwelling or
    desert-traveling creatures. Aggressive predators, they prefer to use stealth
    to attack by surprise. They burrow just beneath the surface of the sand,
    leaving their front forelegs exposed where the wind catches them and plays
    an eerie flute-like sound. They use this deception to attract prey.
  - >-
    Creatures that are affected by the hypnotic sound are attacked as soon as
    they come close. If hungry or threatened, a sand stalker uses its superior
    speed to run down its prey.
