  This small robot is reminiscent of a beetle with a pair of pincers extending
  from the front of its body.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    description: >-
      An observer robot's outer shell contains color-shifting screens that allow
      the creature to blend into the background. Though not truly invisible,
      they are hard to pinpoint. While using this ability, an observer robot
      gains a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks and has concealment from
      creatures more than 5 feet away.
  - name: Transmit Senses (Ex)
    description: >-
      Though observer robot swarms still maintain the ability to transmit their
      senses to a receiver like a normal observer robot, these rogue robots
      rarely do so.
Description:
  - >-
    Observer robots were sometimes deployed in groups that were dependent on
    each other. Their instruments were networked to form a web of sensors spread
    out over a wide area to retrieve superior surveillance for their masters.
    Years after these networked robots ceased receiving orders, numerous
    observer robots rewrote their programming and assembled into collectives
    that numbered up to 1,000 individual observer robots. These swarms emerge
    from buried wreckage in dangerous metallic clouds that scour, confound, and
    burn creatures they attack.
  - >-
    While swarms are typically chaotic, roiling clouds of creatures, observer
    robot swarms are highly organized, with hundreds of the tiny robots moving
    in synchronized patterns as they fly through the air. When observer robot
    swarms attack, the screens on their outer hulls flicker with disorienting
    colors that leave their enemies nauseated. They can also organize themselves
    into a matrix to display composite images across the screens on their
    collective shells. Treating their individual screens like pixels, observer
    robot swarms can form moving images of things that they have recorded such
    as displaying the terror-stricken face of their last victim. These robot
    swarms even cleverly use this technique to disguise themselves as churning
    clouds, flickering fires, or even other swarms such as bats or wasps.
  - >-
    Since observer robot swarms spend much of their processing power
    transmitting and sharing senses with other robots in the swarm, they rarely
    transmit to other devices. Their recordings are shared among the collective,
    making harvesting recorded data from them extremely difficult.
