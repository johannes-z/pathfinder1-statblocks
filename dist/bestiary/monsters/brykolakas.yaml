SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      A humanoid or monstrous humanoid killed by a brykolakas rises as a lacedon
      in 1d4 days under the control of the brykolakas that created it.
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When reduced to 0 or less hit points, a brykolakas is destroyed and its
      body changes into a pool of deadly poison that quickly (1 round) fills a
      10-foot cube (if its in the water when destroyed). The poison disperses in
      the next round. Creatures in the area are exposed to the poison. If a
      brykolakas is slain on land, its body collapses into a puddle of briny
      liquid that quickly covers a 10-foot square area. The puddle lasts for 1d2
      rounds before dispersing. Creatures touching the puddle are exposed to the
      poison. Brykolakas poison-Contact; save Fort DC 16; onset 1 minute;
      frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d6 Dex damage; cure 1 save. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      A brykolakas's claw attacks deliver a virulent disease that breaks down
      the victim's internal organs (causing internal bleeding and a darkening of
      the skin). This supernatural disease is called brykolakas fever. The save
      DC is Charisma-based. Brykolakas fever-Claw; disease, save Fortitude DC 16
      negates, onset 1 minute, frequency 1/day, effect 1d4 Con and 1d4 Dex
      damage, cure 1 save.
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A brykolakas can remain in an alternate form until it assumes another or
      until the next sunrise.
  - name: Water Dependency (Ex)
    description: >-
      A brykolakas can survive out of the water for 6 hours. After that, its
      body begins drying out and within 1 hour, the brykolakas crumbles into
      dust unless it can reach saltwater before the hour passes.
Description:
  - >-
    Brykolakas are undead creatures that inhabit sunken cities or underwater
    caves. Their true origin remains a mystery to even the most learned of sages
    though stories among the learned speak of dark necromantic arts involving
    ancient magicks and packs of ghouls.
  - >-
    Brykolakases spend much of their time swimming the waves and terrorizing
    seafarers, boarding ships at night and carrying away unsuspecting passengers
    and crewmembers. Entire ships have docked in coastal towns, cargo intact,
    without a single clue as to the whereabouts or fate of the crew. When such
    an event occurs, a brykolakas is often blamed, its name being spoken in
    hushed whispers by the superstitious lest they anger such a creature and
    bring its wrath to bear on the town.
  - >-
    Some of these creatures lair near coastal towns or villages and occasionally
    raid such settlements at night, whisking away livestock, children, and the
    like. Events such as this are rare, but do happen from time to time.
  - >-
    A typical brykolakas stands between 6 to 7 feet tall and weighs 200 to 250
    pounds. Its eyes, though gray and dull, often flash with a spark of hatred
    (usually when it encounters living creatures). The creature most often
    dresses in flowing and rotting robes and gowns of grays, greens, or blues.
  - >-
    A brykolakas likes to attack its foes when they don't suspect it. A single
    brykolakas has been known to follow a slow-moving ship of living creatures
    for miles waiting for the right moment to strike. It enters melee slashing
    and tearing at its foes using its diseased claws. If fighting a land-based
    creature (such as a humanoid swimming in the water), the brykolakas likes to
    grapple the foe and quickly dive under the waves, victim in tow, in an
    attempt to drown its opponent. If encountered with a retinue of lacedons, a
    brykolakas hangs back while its minions soften up the opponents. The
    brykolakas then moves in and finishes them off with its claws.
  - >-
    A brykolakas is not a foolish creature. If faced with overpowering odds, it
    flees at the first opportunity, though sometimes the creature feigns such a
    retreat to lure its victims in where it springs to the attack again.
