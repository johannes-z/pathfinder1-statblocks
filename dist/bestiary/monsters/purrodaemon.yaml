SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Weapon Steep (Su)
    description: >-
      A purrodaemon can sheathe a weapon in its flesh as a swift action. This
      does no damage to the daemon. If a weapon remains sheathed in its body for
      at least 24 hours, the weapon absorbs some of its essence and gains
      magical enhancements. A purrodaemon can have up to a dozen weapons lodged
      in its body at a time, but only one can possess magical enhancements at a
      time. The total enhancements cannot exceed a +4 effective enhancement-most
      purrodaemons opt to create +2 wounding weapons in this manner. A weapon's
      enhancements vanish as soon as the purrodaemon dies or releases the
      weapon. A purrodaemon gains Weapon Focus and Improved Critical as bonus
      feats as long as it wields a weapon benefiting from its weapon steep
      ability.
Description:
  - >-
    Deacons of War, purrodaemons ravage the planes as generals of massive
    battles. They employ creative tactics and never launch an assault without
    carefully looking over the plans or surveying the battlefield themselves. A
    purrodaemon is 12 feet tall and weighs 1,300 pounds.
