  This disembodied female torso flaps through the air on batlike wings, her
  fanged face a hateful mask.

    description: >-
      During the day, a manananggal looks like a living human woman. She does
      not detect as undead during the day, but is still an undead creature. At
      night, her upper torso rips away (this is a full round action that occurs
      at sunset), leaving her lower torso behind. Her lower torso is helpless,
      but her upper torso gains its fly speed and natural attacks at this time.
      The upper and lower portions share the same pool of hit points (despite
      any intervening distance), and if the helpless lower portion is damaged,
      the manananggal is immediately aware of the attack. Since manananggals can
      be destroyed by damage to their lower bodies, they prefer to hide their
      lower torsos when separated. A manananggal must return to its lower torso
      and reattach to it (a full-round action) within the hour before
      sunrise-each round a manananggal remains separated after sunrise, it takes
      1d6 points of damage until it rejoins its lower torso or it crumbles into
      dust.
Description:
  - >-
    Horrid undead, manananggals walk among the living by day and prey upon them
    at night. These creatures delight in spreading fear and distrust. By day,
    they tend to stay inside because of their light sensitivity. They mask this
    odd behavior by either living just outside villages as reclusive hermits or
    by obtaining roles within the community that explain away or justify their
    eccentricities.
  - >-
    Manananggals pass themselves off as normal people, usually posing as mad old
    women, midwives, hedge witches, or mystics. This allows the undead creatures
    to select their prey from within the community. Manananggals particularly
    enjoy feeding upon pregnant women, targeting them in their sleep so the
    undead may feast on the blood of both mothers and the children they carry.
    These foul creatures drain blood via their long, black, hollow tongues.
    Manananggals despise the scent of garlic and strong spices like cloves and
    anise.
  - >-
    As they fly through the night, manananggals make a ticking or clicking
    sound, leading some villagers to call the creatures "tik-tiks." Once
    separated, a manananggal's mobile torso has a 6-foot wingspan.
