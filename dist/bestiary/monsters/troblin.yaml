      The regenerative ability of a troblin does not function as well as those
      of its trollish parent. Sometimes when an injured troblin regenerates, its
      body warps in an inexplicable fashion. A severed arm may regrow as two
      arms, or a scar may grow to cover the troblin's entire body in thick skin.
      Further, if a troblin suffers a critical hit in melee, it has a 25% chance
      of gaining a mutation once it is fully healed. See the sidebar for random
      mutations. Troblin Mutations Each troblin has the potential to possess 1d2
      random mutations brought about by its bizarre regeneration. Roll on the
      table below for each mutation. d20 Mutation 1-2 Dual forearm; claw damage
      increased by one die type (claw damage 1d6+3) and it gains the benefits of
      wielding a twohanded weapon with that arm. 3-4 Dual foreleg; +2 racial
      bonus to Acrobatics checks, +2 racial bonus on CMD to resist being bull
      rushed or tripped when standing on solid ground. 5-6 Massive scarring;
      natural armor bonus increases by +1. 7 Multiple muscles; +2 Strength. 8
      Shortened tendons; +2 Dexterity. 9 Redundant vital organs; +2
      Constitution. 10 Third leg; +4 racial bonus to Acrobatics checks, +4
      racial bonus on CMD to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing
      on solid ground, +10 to Speed. 11 Two arms on one side; gains an
      additional claw attack when making a full attack and gains the benefits of
      wielding a twohanded weapon with that arm. 12 Two heads; Gains Superior
      Two-Weapon Fighting ability (see below) and a +2 racial bonus on
      Perception checks. 13-20 No mutation. Superior Two-Weapon

      Troblins with two heads automatically gain this ability. Because each of
      its two heads controls an arm, a troblin does not take a penalty on attack
      or damage rolls for attacking with two weapons.
Description:
  - >-
    A troblin is a twisted creature, born of the union of a troll and a goblin.
    Due to the horrid side effects of their diminished regenerative abilities,
    the overall appearance of a troblin is difficult to quantify. No two
    troblins look exactly alike. One troblin may be covered in tough scars that
    have thickened its skin, while another may have two forearms sprouting from
    the elbow of one arm. Other troblins may have two arms on one side, or two
    feet on one leg. Troblin bands build their lairs in forested areas away from
    more civilized lands. They are hunter-gatherers and use the land as a means
    of survival, hunting deer, elk, moose, and other game animals. In general,
    troblins stand 5 feet tall, with crooked noses, long arms and legs, and
    large flapping feet. A troblin shares in the characteristics of both its
    parents, resembling a very tall goblin with troll-like facial features. Its
    skin is blotched in shades of green, grey, and dull yellow. Its eyes range
    from pale red to an ochre color. Troblins dress in drab-colored clothing and
    furs made from the hides of animals. Troblins are a disorganized lot, and
    rarely engage in any sort of formal tactics or strategy. When a troblin war
    band encounters opponents, they simply attack with as much strength and
    ferocity as they can muster. Troblins are even more craven and cowardly than
    goblins, and a lone troblin usually runs from any combat in which it is
    outnumbered. Troblin Society Troblins have no real society to speak of. They
    congregate in looselyorganized bands lead by a single strong chieftain, but
    they are nomadic and never remain in one place for very long. The life of a
    troblin is short and brutal, and only the strongest and meanest survive to
    adulthood. Troblin children that misbehave or speak out against the current
    tribe chieftain are usually thrown into cooking fires and eaten by its
    betters. Any troblin that has become so deformed and twisted by multiple
    regenerative mishaps that it is no longer of any use to the tribe generally
    receive the same fate. The leadership of a troblin tribe is determined by
    might alone, so combat prowess and strength are required of any troblin that
    would dare call itself chief. Troblin Characters Troblin clerics have access
    to the Chaos and Evil domains, but clerics are rare in this outcast and
    wretched race. Most troblin spellcasters are adepts or sorcerers. Troblin
    characters possess the following racial traits. Strength +6, Dexterity +2,
    Constitution +4, Intelligence -2, Charisma -4. Darkvision: Troblins can see
    in the dark out to 60 feet. Racial Hit Dice: A troblin begins with three
    levels of humanoid, which provide 3d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +2,
    and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +1, Ref +3, and Will +1. Racial
    Skills: A troblin's humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 3 x (2 +
    Int modifier, minimum 1). Racial Feats: A troblin's humanoid levels give it
    two feats. AC: +2 natural armor bonus. Natural Weapons: Troblins fight with
    2 claws (1d4) and a bite (1d6). Special Qualities: regeneration 2 (acid or
    fire), mutation (see above). Languages: Troblins begin play speaking Giant
    or Goblin. Troblins with high Intelligence scores can choose from the
    following languages: Common, Gnoll, Orc. Copyright Notice Author Erica
