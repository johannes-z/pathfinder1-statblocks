SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Strength Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      The bite of a shadow wolf deals 1d4 points of Strength damage to a living
      foe. A creature reduced to Strength 0 dies.
  - name: Trip (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shadow wolf can assume a corporeal form as a free action and bite (as a
      standard action) a foe in an attempt to trip the opponent. A shadow wolf
      that hits with its bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent as a free
      action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of
      opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the
      shadow wolf. Shadow wolves use their Dexterity modifier on trip attacks.
      The shadow wolf remains corporeal (i.e., it loses its incorporeal traits)
      for the entire round in which it attempts to trip an opponent. It can
      assume its incorporeal form on its next turn as a free action.
  - name: Shadow Blend (Ex)
    description: >-
      In any condition of illumination other than full daylight, a shadow wolf
      can disappear into the shadows, giving it total concealment. Artificial
      illumination, even a light or continual flame spell, does not negate this
      ability; a daylight spell, however, will.
Description:
  - >-
    Shadow wolves are nocturnal hunters and hate all living creatures. Their
    eyes flash with a crimson fire when prey is sighted. Shadow wolves prefer to
    attack from ambush, using the shadows and darkness to their advantage. When
    prey wanders nearby, a shadow wolf leaps to the attack. A shadow wolf pack
    leads its prey into an ambush and then strikes when opponents are completely
    unaware. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
