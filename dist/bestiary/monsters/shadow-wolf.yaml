Description:
  - >-
    Shadow wolves are nocturnal hunters and hate all living creatures. Their
    eyes flash with a crimson fire when prey is sighted. Shadow wolves prefer to
    attack from ambush, using the shadows and darkness to their advantage. When
    prey wanders nearby, a shadow wolf leaps to the attack. A shadow wolf pack
    leads its prey into an ambush and then strikes when opponents are completely
    unaware. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
