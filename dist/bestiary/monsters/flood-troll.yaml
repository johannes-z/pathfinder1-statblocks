    description: >-
      A flood troll's flesh is highly resilient to the stresses of long dry
      periods. A flood troll who has gone without touching flowing water for at
      least 24 hours gains a +2 natural armor bonus to AC. A flood troll who has
      touched water within the last 24 hours gains cold resistance 5 instead.

      A flood troll's hands are larger than its body would suggest. Flood trolls
      can wield Large weapons without penalty.
  - name: Rain Regeneration (Ex)
    description: >-
      A flood troll's regeneration functions as long as the flood troll is
      touching flowing water or precipitation. Even a slight drizzle is enough
      to activate the flood troll's regeneration. However, any acid or fire
      damage dealt to the flood troll suspends its next round of regeneration.
Description:
  - >-
    Flood trolls are the mutated runts of scrag broods, cast out by their
    mothers and destined to haunt the lonely valleys and river basins beneath
    Avistan's frosty peaks. They lurk amid the craggy hills of Belkzen, Varisia,
    and other wildlands of northern Avistan, and serve as a menace to orc
    raiders and human adventurers alike. While smaller and less organized than
    true scrags, flood trolls' solitary nature and desperation for food often
    drives them to commit atrocities upon
  - >-
    unsuspecting humanoid populations-atrocities that almost invariably end with
    the flood trolls' eventual capture and execution.
  - Flood trolls average 7-1/2 feet tall and weigh 250 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Flood trolls are not actual trolls in the truest sense of the word. Although
    flood trolls-like their scrag parents- are distantly related to mountain
    trolls, the species are distinct. Most humanoid societies, however, are
    content to simply refer to both scrags and trolls using the umbrella term
    "troll," linking the species because of overlapping myths and their similar
    regenerative abilities.
  - >-
    Scrag mothers birth anywhere from two to six younglings in a single brood,
    and every brood has a small chance of including what the scrags call an
    aruk-taii-"half-scrag" in the Giant tongue-known to many civilized peoples
    as a flood troll. Scrags with larger broods have a higher chance of
    producing flood trolls among their young. These runts are invariably smaller
    and more frail than true scrag younglings, and their growth rate is
    significantly slower than their non-mutated kin. This makes them undesirable
    to their scrag mothers and more likely to be eaten by their stronger
    siblings. Those flood trolls who aren't simply abandoned to the wilds by
    their mothers are raised as lesser beings, and live in the shadows of their
    scrag brothers and sisters. Most flood trolls flee their aggressive
    broodmates before coming of age, preferring to fend for themselves in the
    terrors of the wilderness rather than deal with their cruel, savage family
    members.
  - >-
    The mutation that results in a flood troll stymies many of the racial
    abilities typical to scrags. For one, flood trolls lack the amphibious
    special quality, making them much less suited to hunting underwater.
    Unfortunately for them, flood trolls still rely on exposure to water to
    enable their regenerative properties, meaning they must dwell near water but
    never wholly within it. Not just any water will do, either-only water that
    is continually refreshed with minerals and oxygen can regenerate flood
    trolls. Stagnant or relatively still waters such as small lakes and ponds
    cannot provide the nutrients flood troll regeneration requires, which means
    these monsters tend to stay near active waterways and areas with high
    precipitation where they can find the flowing water and rainfall that helps
    them to survive.
  - >-
    The mutation that results in a flood troll also affects the creature's
    reproductive organs, rendering it sterile. Because they cannot reproduce,
    flood trolls rarely seek out mates or even partners to aid in the hunt.
    Instead, they lead solitary existences steeped in ire for all living things;
    they are born amid hatred and rejection, and expect to die the same way.
  - >-
    In rare instances, a scrag mother may produce flood troll twins. In keeping
    with their primitive superstitions, scrags believe the arrival of two flood
    trolls is a dire omen that signals the coming of storms and floods, and
    cannot be dealt with by simply tossing the younglings away. Instead, the
    scrags believe, in order to appease the dread deities that they believe
    control the weather and the flow of rivers into their aquatic homes, the
    scrags must raise aruk-taii twins, aruk-taikii, as they would raise their
    true scrag offspring. The scrag mother-along with the other female scrags in
    her group-raises and nurtures the twins as best as she is able, albeit with
    grudging reluctance. In fact, the association between aruk-taikii and
    inclement weather in these old scrag myths is what originally inspired human
    adventurers to name the beasts flood trolls.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Flood trolls are monstrous nomads-wandering hunters who follow the herds of
    game and pay close attention to humanoids' travel patterns as they journey
    between the distant settlements of northern Avistan. They are cunning by
    necessity, since they are smaller than their brethren and must often
    surprise their prey to earn their meals. While not afraid to pounce on their
    victims once they can catch them, most flood trolls prefer to use stealth
    tactics and crude traps to put prospective victims in hazardous situations
    before attempting an ambush.
  - >-
    Scrag mothers eject their flood troll spawn from the brood as soon as the
    youngling's hormonal mutation makes itself known, which typically occurs a
    couple of years after the brood is born. Abandoned aruk-taii younglings
    survive in the wilds by sticking close to a river or freshwater source, and
    those who fail to find fresh water typically fall prey to wolves or other
    predators. Solitary by circumstance, flood trolls are seen in pairs only
    rarely, and usually because the two are twins. Because flood troll twins are
    pampered and treated with care by their scrag mother (rather than being
    abused and ostracized), these specimens tend to be more intelligent and
    creative than their solitary kin. Some flood trolls even learn how to wield
    arms or poison daggers; woe betide anyone who feels the sting of an
    aruk-taii rogue's dirk-if not for the blade, then for the savage claws that
    come afterward.
  - >-
    Because they can survive in arid environments for longer periods, flood
    trolls are much more common in Belkzen than their scrag forebears. The orcs
    of Belkzen claim that flood trolls wander over the Mindspin and Kodar
    mountain
  - >-
    ranges, fleeing their scrag families in the Mushfens and Varisia's other
    wetlands. In the frigid Lands of the Linnorm Kings and Irrisen, scrags
    dwelling along the coast of the Arcadian Ocean and in Glacier Lake drive
    their flood troll offspring south along the Marblef low River or east toward
    the Gullik River. While they are most commonly encountered in Avistan, flood
    trolls may be found around the world, wherever scrags carry the aruk-taii
    mutation, though their physical features vary somewhat depending on where
    they originate. The Zenj tribes of the Mwangi Expanse speak of blue-skinned,
    humanoid horrors-jeburo in the Polyglot tongue-that stalk the jungle's
    riverbeds during the dry season and boldly attack villages as the storm
    season approaches. A number of these flood trolls make their way into the
    Sodden Lands. Never lacking for the rain that allows for their regeneration,
    these flood trolls terrorize the few remaining enclaves of humanity in that
    drenched land.
