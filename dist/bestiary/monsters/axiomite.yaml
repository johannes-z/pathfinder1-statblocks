SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Crystalline Dust Form (Su)
    description: >-
      An axiomite can shift between its solid body and one made of golden,
      crystalline dust as a free action once per round. In dust form, the
      axiomite looks like a shifting mass of glowing mathematical symbols and
      equations. In this form it can fly and gains the incorporeal quality; it
      can use spell-like abilities but cannot make physical attacks. In its
      solid form, an axiomite cannot fly. Both shapes are the axiomite's true
      form, and it does not revert to a different form if killed. A true seeing
      spell reveals both forms simultaneously.
  - name: Summon Inevitable (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day, four axiomites may join hands to summon a single zelekhut
      inevitable as a full-round action.
Description:
  - >-
    Stewards of ancient, colossal cities on lawful planes, axiomites represent
    the fundamental search for order. According to their own history, the first
    axiomites sprang from the raw mathematical underpinnings of the cosmos long
    before the first gods began to stir-they are personifications of a
    primordial reality made flesh in an attempt to understand itself. New
    axiomites are formed from souls much like celestials or fiends, with spirits
    drawn across the planes to one of the axiomites' humming crystal monoliths,
    emerging later as purified creatures of law and theory.
  - >-
    A particular axiomite may look like any humanoid-shaped creature, though the
    particular form does not affect its abilities in any way. Beneath this form,
    all axiomites are the same-clouds of glowing, crystalline dust that
    constantly swirl and congeal into complex tangles of symbols and equations,
    making them literally creatures of pure mathematical law.
  - >-
    Axiomite society is broken into three divisions, each with its own duty and
    purpose. One devotes itself to the construction and maintenance of
    inevitables, another to the expansion and construction of their capital
    city, and the third to continuing the exploration and calculation of the
    laws and constants that underlie all of reality. Their leader is a gestalt
    mind formed by the greatest individuals of their race, forming when needed
    and then dispersing into its component axiomites to put the god-mind's plans
    into action.
