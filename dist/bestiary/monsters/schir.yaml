Description_Visual: >-
  This goat-headed humanoid is covered in a mangy gray hide that only partly
  covers its gaunt but muscled frame.
Group: Demon
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 3
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      A schir gnaws constantly at the ends of its halberd. This infuses the
      blades with disease from the demon's filthy spittle. Any creature struck
      by a schir's halberd must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or contract
      gray pox-a frightening disease that causes weakness, gray splotches on the
      skin, and eventual catatonia. The save DC is Constitution-based. Gray Pox:
      Halberd-injury; save Fort DC 15; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6
      Str damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Description:
  - >-
    A schir resembles a tall, muscular humanoid with the head and hooves of a
    demonic goat. A ragged hide covers patches of a schir's body, usually around
    the forearms
  - >-
    and lower legs, with a crestlike patch running down from the creature's
    crown to the nape of its neck. Schir demons are 7 feet tall, though they
    usually stoop and so appear shorter, and weigh 300 pounds.
  - >-
    Also known as spite demons, schirs are among the most violent and
    vile-tempered inhabitants of the Abyss. Schirs are formed from the souls of
    mortals who either committed or framed others for heinous crimes-acts
    committed for the sole purpose of petty retribution. Despite such origins,
    schirs occupy one of the lowest orders in the demonic hierarchy, often
    serving as front-line infantry in demonic armies or as guards for minor
    demonic commanders.
  - >-
    Although not especially intelligent, schirs are cunning warriors and able
    sentries. Although they prefer to charge into combat, a schir's natural
    jumping ability makes it a nimble enemy, capable of using its surroundings
    astutely. A schir will often jump on top of rocks, crumbling walls, or any
    other high place to hack with its disease-ridden halberd. For all of schirs'
    capabilities, their spitefulness makes them distrustful of any creature that
    has not proven its greater power and strength numerous times.
  - >-
    A schir set loose upon the Material Plane quickly seeks to set itself up as
    a leader of its own army- often, schirs seek out tribes of savage humanoids
    and attempt to replace the current leaders. They are particularly fond of
    infiltrating gnoll tribes.
