    description: >-
      A soldier thermite reduced to 0 or less hit points explodes in a ball of
      elemental flame dealing 3d6 points of fire damage to all within a 10-ft.
      radius. A successful DC 15 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Thermites are extraplanar vermin that dwell on the Elemental Plane of Fire.
    They are rarely encountered anywhere else (save the Paraelemental Plane of
    Heat occasionally). Once in a rare while a gang or band of these creatures
    stumble through a vortex and sets up their nest on the Material Plane. Such
    a nest is always located near a massive heat source (such as a volcano).
  - >-
    On their home plane, thermites build large underground nests. The bulk of
    the colony is maintained by the workers-whose job it is to construct the
    nest, forage for food, feed the queen and soldiers, and repair the nest.
    Soldiers defend the nest against intruders and trespassers. About a week
    after the nest is finished, the queen takes a king (use the worker
    thermite's statistics) and they construct a reproduction chamber where she
    lays 10-20 eggs each day over a period of a week. Young thermites are
    helpless and depend solely on the queen and workers for food, protection,
    and so on. Young become independent after several months, and the
    reproductives (winged thermites) fly off to form their own nests.
  - >-
    The cycle above then repeats. (Winged thermites have a fly speed of 50 feet
    with average maneuverability.) Thermites are red in color and about 5 or 6
    feet long with large biting mandibles and segmented antennae. Soldiers are
    slightly larger than workers and have slightly larger heads with oversized
    mandibles. The queen can reach a length of 12 feet or longer and as she
    ages, she becomes bloated, resembling a giant reddish colored maggot.
    Reproductives resemble workers and soldiers but are slightly darker in color
    and have translucent reddish wings.
  - >-
    Thermites are generally passive creatures except when their nest is
    attacked. In such an event, the soldiers move to defend the young and the
    queen. Workers join in the melee fighting off any would-be interlopers.
  - >-
    Thermites attack by biting with their mandibles. Slain creatures are often
    dragged into the lair and fed to the queen and the young.
