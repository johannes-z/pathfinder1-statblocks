Description_Visual: >-
  Ornate diamond shaped patterns cover the flesh of this serpentine horror. The
  most noticeable feature of his humanoid torso is its arms-they end in snake
  heads rather than hands. Its snake arms and heads have a distinctive
  triangular shape with a pit above the nostrils and before the slit-like eyes.
  This creature has no legs but instead has the lower half of a monstrous
  rattlesnake complete with a foot long rattle which twitches ominously at the
  tip.

Description:
  - >-
    Rattler inphidians are one of the more powerful sub-races of inphidians and
    are often found in leadership roles such as commanders (though never
    generals or overseers) and tribal leaders (in the less-civilized inphidian
    nests). They are wicked killers who care nothing for life, valuing their own
    survival above anyone else's. This alone would seem to make them poor
    leaders (and has in some instances), but what they lack in compassion for
    others, they more than make up for with their leadership skills, instincts,
    and ability to ferret out spies, intruders, trespassers, and others who seek
    to disrupt the inphidian culture. A rattler inphidian is 6 feet tall and
    about 8 feet long. It appears as an inphidian with the lower torso of a
    giant rattlesnake. Colors vary along the spectrum but most are brown, black,
    or dark gray with bands and diamond-shaped patterns covering its entire
    body. Like all inphidians, its hands are non-existent, a viper head being in
    its place. A rattler's eyes, as well as the eyes on its snake-hands are an
    iridescent red. Cool calculating observers of their foes, rattlers are
    intelligent enough to pick their battles and fight only at a time and place
    of their own choosing. If overwhelmed or outnumbered, a rattler attempts to
    save itself, even using its allies as fodder if necessary. In combat, a
    rattler relies on its physical attacks and death rattle to vanquish its
    foes. A particular nasty tactic of a rattler is to paralyze a foe with its
    poison and then leave it to bake in the hot desert sun. Rattler Inphidian
