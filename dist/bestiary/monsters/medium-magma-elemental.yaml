SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burn (Ex)
    description: >-
      A magma elemental's burn DC includes a -2 racial penalty, as their fires
      don't burn quite as hot as true elemental flames.
  - name: Earth Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A burrowing magma elemental can pass through stone, dirt, lava, or almost
      any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through
      water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create
      any ripple, though the area it passes through feels warm for 1 round
      afterward and often retains a strangely smooth texture, as if the stone
      had been polished. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a
      burrowing magma elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the
      creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.
  - name: Lava Puddle (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a full-round action, a magma elemental can vomit forth a
      puddle of lava (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444) that fills its space to
      a depth of 2-3 inches and counts as difficult terrain. Any creature that
      moves through this puddle of lava takes 2d6 points of fire damage. This
      damage continues for 1d3 rounds after the creature leaves the lava pool,
      although then it only inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage per round. The
      lava puddle solidifies and is safe to touch after a number of rounds equal
      to the elemental's Hit Dice. At the GM's discretion, this puddle of lava
      could start secondary fires.
Description:
  - >-
    In the border areas between the Plane of Earth and Plane of Fire, volcanoes
    and continent-sized lava flows are commonplace. Elementals in this area tend
    to have aspects of both planes, and the typical sort is the magma elemental,
    an earth elemental with a core of liquid fire. Magma elementals generally
    have a somewhat feral or bestial appearance.
