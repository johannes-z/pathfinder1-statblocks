Description:
  - >-
    Giant crab spiders are dangerous ambush predators that live in dense forest
    vegetation. Though crab spiders are not web spinners, they are truly gifted
    climbers and use this talent to clamber up into places where they can
    observe wide areas from on high. Named for their curious scuttling walk and
    wide-legged stance, giant crab spiders are rarely larger than a typical
    adult half ling.
