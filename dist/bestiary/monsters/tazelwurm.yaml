SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ambush (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a tazelwurm catches an opponent flatfooted it gains a +4 circumstance
      bonus to its attack roll for that round.
  - name: Frightening Exuviation (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a tazelwurm is hit by a fire attack or effect that deals at least 10
      points of damage, it takes no damage, but instead allows its scales,
      flesh, and fur to be consumed and burned away in a single round, exposing
      its skeletal structure. A creature viewing this must make a successful DC
      15 Will save or paralyzed with fear for 1d3 rounds. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected
      again by the same tazelwurm's frightening exuviation for one day. This has
      no effect on other tazelwurms.
Description:
  - >-
    A tazelwurm is an aggressive, flesh-eating monster with a serpentine body,
    feline head, and two long powerful arms that end in razor-sharp claws. They
    haunt mountain passes and prey on travelers passing through their territory.
    Tazelwurms are masters of camouflage and are nearly indistinct from their
    rocky surroundings. They enjoy striking from ambush and downing unsuspecting
    prey. They are diurnal hunters and are most active in the morning hours.
    Their hunting grounds often cover several square miles of rocky terrain and
    should a tazelwurm enter another's territory, it is quickly driven away if
    detected. Tazelwurms eat just about anything that comes near, but they are
    especially fond of mountain lions and mountain goats. When the tazelwurm
    kills its prey, it drags it to its lair which takes the form of a
    well-hidden and nearly inaccessible depression or cave. The kill is devoured
    over a period of several days. Tazelwurms rarely interact with other
    creatures; including their own kind. When more than one is encountered, they
    are usually a mated pair. Young are born live and left to the care of the
    mother. Young tazelwurms reach maturity around two years of age and leave
    the lair to go out on their own. Very old tazelwurms may even have lichens
    and mosses growing on them, enhancing their rocky appearances. A tazelwurm
    lies in wait for its meals. Using its tremorsense ability, it senses
    vibrations in the rocks where it hides and springs to attack when prey draws
    near. Tazelwurms generally avoid large groups of travelers, preferring to
    attack a straggler or a member of a party that happens to have gotten lost
    or separated. A hungry tazelwurm though, will attack just about anything
    that comes near it. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
