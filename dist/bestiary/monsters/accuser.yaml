    description: >-
      A zebub records all that it sees and may pass its visions on to another
      creature. By remaining in contact with a willing creature, it can replay
      up to 24 hours of witnessed events, or shorter incidents if it so chooses.
      It takes a zebub 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images, which the
      target receives in a flash of information, without sound or other sensory
      information. After relaying its findings, the zebub cannot replay its
      visions of those events again. A zebub cannot replay its visions for an
      unwilling creature or as an attack, no matter how horrific the events it
      might have witnessed.
Description:
  - >-
    Childlike souls tormented and scoured of innocence by the flames of Hell and
    then reshaped by the mad whims of the archdevil Baalzebul, accuser devils
    embody the foul, merciless, and pervasive corruptions of the infernal host.
    From the depths of the Pit they rise in buzzing, shrieking plagues unleashed
    to taint the land, despoil weak flesh, and reveal exploitable secrets. En
    masse they display little of the cunning or subtlety typical of devilkind,
    spreading ruin at the will of their fiendish masters. Alone, though, a zebub
    is a craven, deceitful thing, lurking in darkness and filth, endlessly
    spying and vying for the petty favors of greater evils.
  - >-
    Accuser devils are almost exclusively formed amid the cesspits of frozen
    Cocytus, the seventh layer of Hell.
  - >-
    Within the Pit they serve countless infernal lords as messengers and spies,
    with droves being unleashed upon myriad mortal worlds with a mandate to seek
    out souls ripe for corruption or those whose sins might lead to greater
    damnations. Many zebubs overstep the freedoms of such vague missions,
    seeking to manipulate weakwilled or easily intimidated mortals into all
    manner of trivial evils, dispensing shrill orders in their buzzing,
    childlike voices. Despite the fact that many zebub plots end in the zebubs'
    own revelation and destruction, few diabolical lords allow the slaying of
    their spies to go unpunished.
  - >-
    The zebub's ability to grant other creatures visions of what it has
    witnessed makes it an unusually useful creature to many conjurers.
    Relatively easy to conjure with a spell like lesser planar ally or lesser
    planar binding, an accuser devil can be an invaluable spy. One simply orders
    the foul little devil to become invisible and then inf iltrate an area where
    visual information is hidden, with orders to teleport back to its point of
    origin to grant visions of what it observed to its master. Those who make
    use of accuser devils in this manner should take care to watch their own
    actions or what they reveal, of course, for such a creature can just as
    easily be bribed or intimidated into revealing visions that some conjurers
    might not want being made public. It's common practice among conjurers to
    kill their accuser devils once they've completed their missions of inf
    iltration and observation.
  - >-
    These lesser devils stand just over 2 feet tall and rarely weigh more than
    25 pounds.
