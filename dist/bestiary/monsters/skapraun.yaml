    description: >-
      A skapraun is particularly skilled at crafting traps that mimic natural
      hazards. A skapraun doesn't require gold to build its traps, merely time.
      Rules for crafting traps can be found in Chapter 13 of the Pathfinder RPG
      Core Rulebook, and examples of traps typically built by skaprauns are
      provided on page 89.
Description:
  - >-
    Because of their mighty horns, cloven hooves, and aggressively territorial
    behavior, skaprauns are often mistaken for hellspawn or other minions of
    evil. Although these fey actually have a deep sense of honor, even those who
    know them for what they are generally view them with suspicion-their
    stubbornness and isolationist traditions leave little room for alliances or
    friendships
  - with other creatures. Skaprauns stand 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 60 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Much like the animals that they resemble, skaprauns have beards, short
    tails, and long, curved horns. Their fur has a fine, woolly layer and a
    longer layer of hollow guard hairs, offering protection against wind and
    cold temperatures. Their feet have inner pads and sharp dewclaws to prevent
    slipping, and their cloven hooves can spread apart to ensure a better grip
    on uneven surfaces.
  - >-
    Skaprauns are mainly herbivorous, but they supplement their diet with meat
    from animals they hunt and with clay to obtain minerals. They eat animals
    primarily for ritualistic purposes rather than out of necessity. Their main
    purposes for hunting are to maintain balanced animal populations within
    their territory, to obtain raw materials such as bone and sinew for building
    tools and weapons, and to hone their combat tactics.
  - >-
    Although skaprauns have mortal lifespans averaging 18 years, they are in a
    sense immortal. The death of a skapraun triggers a form of reincarnation
    that occurs inside the body of the dead skapraun. The new skapraun leeches
    proteins and other nutrients from its precursor's body to build its own.
    When the newborn skapraun crawls out-a process that takes roughly 4
    weeks-only a withered, fragile husk remains of the precursor's body. The
    horns of the precursor remain fully intact, however.
  - >-
    A newborn skapraun is hairless, hornless, and nearly helpless, but it learns
    to walk within 5 minutes of its birth. The skapraun remembers nothing of its
    former life, but it instinctively knows to collect the horns of its
    precursor and protect them at all costs so it can later build a bow from
    them. A skapraun usually reaches full maturity within 2 months of its birth,
    but it may take longer if the precursor's body was badly damaged.
  - >-
    A skapraun is not identical to the one from which it was born, but its
    psyche and physique are always shaped in some way by the decisions its
    precursor made-and particularly by how the precursor met its end.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Skaprauns make their homes in rocky, mountainous areas where their physique
    gives them a distinct advantage over less agile beings. They live almost
    exclusively above the treeline, where their enemies have less of a chance to
    find shelter from their arrows. However, the territory of a skapraun tribe
    extends far below the treeline; the creatures hunt and gather plants and
    other resources in these lower regions.
  - >-
    To skaprauns, the concept of holding the higher ground is a central cultural
    aspect and a matter of great pride, and it also makes them fiercely
    territorial. They often do not allow
  - >-
    any other intelligent beings to inhabit a higher location on the same
    mountain and do not tolerate intruders near their homes, even travelers who
    just passing through. However, skaprauns do not usually resort to violence
    unless stern warnings fail to remove the threat.
  - >-
    While the inhospitable terrain skaprauns live in is enough to keep most
    intruders away, they take great care to fortify the slopes of their mountain
    homes against attacks. They build traps in natural choke points and prepare
    many defensive fighting positions from which they can shower any attacker
    with a rain of arrows. The defensive positions have rocks piled as low
    walls, camouf laged to look like naturally occurring piles of rubble. These
    are usually difficult to reach from below, but if the enemies are
    particularly mobile, the skapraun sentries retreat into another defensive
    position farther up the mountain rather than risking a melee that may go
    against them.
  - >-
    When a tribe of skaprauns ends up in a prolonged conf lict, the fey also
    employ offensive tactics that mostly involve quick hit-and-run attacks or
    feigned retreats in order to lead the enemy into an ambush. They also study
    weather patterns and use the treacherous mists of the mountains to their
    advantage, advancing when the mists rise and retreating when they recede.
  - >-
    Skapraun chieftains are born from the deaths of heroic individuals. The
    chieftains often have unusual physical traits that marks their births, such
    as very large horns, snow-white fur, or a greater stature. Skapraun leaders
    often take class levels in barbarian, druid, hunter, oracle, ranger, or
    shaman.
  - >-
    The birth of twins is considered a very auspicious sign in skapraun society.
    It is the only way in which a skapraun tribe can grow, and the twins are
    often uniquely gifted with oracular powers. Each inherits one of the
    precursor's horns and builds a spear instead of the usual recurve bow. These
    twin-oracles often speak in unison and seem to share a single mind. Any
    later generations born of the twin-oracles are usually normal skaprauns,
    however.
  - >-
    On the bottom rung of skapraun society are arkas- outcasts who are allowed
    to perform only the most menial tasks within a tribe. A skapraun becomes an
    arka if it loses and cannot recover its weapon. Similarly, a skapraun who
    for some reason cannot extract its precursor's horns or make a weapon out of
    them is marked an arka. Rather than facing the shame of not being considered
    a warrior, it is common for an arka to go on a self-imposed exile. Over
    time, these lone skaprauns lose their supernatural connection to nature,
    including their ability to reincarnate. They may find themselves in the
    company of humanoid creatures, getting along best with dwarves, perhaps
    because of dwarves' similarly dour dispositions and love of mountains.
