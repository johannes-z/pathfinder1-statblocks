Description:
  - >-
    According to some fey ballads, gathlains were one of the first peoples
    awakened in the primal world of fey. They were created from the seeds of an
    enormous magical tree, with the tree's mistletoe grown into their flesh
    forming their strange wings. Mischievous and capricious, these creatures
    have discordant temperaments. They act purely to entertain themselves and
    sate their immense curiosity about the world around them. That very
    curiosity has caused many to migrate to the Material Plane and adventure
    there. These gathlains seek out and attempt to mingle with gnomes. However,
    gnomes often find gathlains too undisciplined, random, and foolish for their
    tastes.
