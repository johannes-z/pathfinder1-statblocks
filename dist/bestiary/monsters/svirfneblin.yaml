Description:
  - >-
    Svirfneblin, or "deep gnomes," are a reclusive offshoot of the gnome race.
    They dwell underground in hidden cities, safe from dark elves and other
    subterranean races. They have skin the color of gray or brown stone. Males
    are bald, and females have stringy gray hair. A svirfneblin's ties to the
    eerie realm of the fey are much stronger than those of their
    surface-dwelling gnome kin, and this makes them either strangely detached
    from their emotions or violently random in their outbursts. Svirfneblin have
    long fought wars against the duergar, and have a difficult time seeing the
    difference between duergar and other dwarves. Svirfneblin Characters
    Svirfneblin are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit
    Dice. A svirfneblin's CR is equal to his class level. Svirfneblin have the
    following racial traits. -2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, -4 Charisma:
    Svirfneblin are fast and observant, but relatively weak and emotionally
    distant. Small: Svirfneblin are Small creatures and gain a +1 size bonus to
    their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty to their CMB and
    CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks. Defensive Training: Svirfneblin
    gain a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class. Senses: Svirfneblin have darkvision
    120 ft. and lowlight vision. Fortunate: Svirfneblin gain a +2 racial bonus
    on all saving throws. Skilled: Svirfneblin gain a +2 racial bonus on Stealth
    checks; this improves to a +4 bonus underground. They gain a +2 racial bonus
    on Craft (alchemy) checks and Perception checks. Hatred: Svirfneblin receive
    a +1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the reptilian and
    dwarven subtypes due to training against these hated foes. Stonecunning:
    Svirfneblin gain stonecunning as a dwarf (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 21).
    Spell Resistance: Svirfneblin have SR equal to 11 + class levels.
    Svirfneblin Magic: Svirfneblin add +1 to the DC of any illusion spells they
    cast. Svirfneblin also gain the spell-like abilities listed above; caster
    level equals the svirfneblin's class levels. Languages: Svirfneblin begin
    play speaking Gnome and Undercommon. Those with high Int scores can choose
    from the following bonus languages: Aklo, Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Elven,
    Giant, Goblin, Orc, or Terran.
