Description:
  - >-
    A giant amoeba is a shapeless mass of living, liquid protoplasm. Though
    naturally translucent with darker interior spots, its surface is slightly
    sticky and tends to collect dirt and other debris from its environment;
    therefore, a moving giant amoeba looks like muddy water. A weaker cousin of
    creatures such as the gray ooze and black pudding, a giant amoeba is
    actually a mutated version of a harmless creature too small to be seen by
    the naked eye, grown dangerously large in size. Although happy to prey on
    creatures smaller than it, the giant amoeba's constant hunger often drives
    it to attack larger prey, such as humanoids.
