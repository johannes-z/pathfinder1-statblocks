Description:
  - >-
    The shifty noble represents any one of the dozens of aristocrats vying for
    power and wealth in Magnimar. Some nobles may hail from families with a long
    lineage in the city, while others might trace their power to one of
    Magnimar's numerous merchant houses, and still others might have used
    inherited or hard-earned wealth to buy their way into the Council of Ushers.
    In Magnimar, money often speaks louder than words, and those with the coin
    to spare inevitably rise to power either within the ranks of the council or
    through the city's various other facets of political strength. While the
    council is primarily made up of long-lived families who have ruled Magnimar
    for years, new money has managed to grasp some political power in recent
    times as Magnimar's importance in trade continues to increase throughout the
    region.

    When the citizens of Magnimar established their formal government in 4608 ar
    and instated the Council of Ushers as a means of checking and balancing the
    power of the lord-mayor, they scarcely thought their seemingly simple
    political structure would become the convoluted mess it is today. What were
    originally 15 seats on the council belonging to the most inf luential and
    significant families of Magnimar have since ballooned into 117 seats filled
    by blasÃ© nobles, scheming aristocrats, and avaricious merchants. Though
    there remain some honest members of the council who faithfully seek to
    represent the will of Magnimar's citizenry, such honorable endeavors are
    more often than not stopped up in the city's byzantine political machine.
  - >-
    While most of the city's day-to-day business runs on the up and up,
    corruption and bribery find their way into numerous facets of the
    city-state's governing body. Spies and aristocratic messengers from Korvosa
    often travel to Magnimar bearing ill will or financial threats against its
    councilors, swaying corrupt politicians to aid their cause as the rival
    city-state to the east attempts to absorb one or more of Magnimar's
    holdings. Many of the representatives in the Council of Ushers work toward
    improving Magnimar's holdings and status, though some seek instead to
    undermine progress and sabotage their counterparts' efforts, putting
    personal goals and aspirations before the good of the citizens. Agents from
    Cheliax and Korvosa spend a significant amount of coin in their attempts to
    subvert the council and sow seeds of destruction among Magnimar, and these
    traitors to the City of Monuments are easily among the most prominent
    threats to the city.
