SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acidic Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      The bite of a serpent creeper deals 1d6 points of acid damage initially
      and 1d2 points of acid damage each round thereafter. A DC 16 Fortitude
      saving throw or a DC 16 Heal check ends the ongoing acid damage. Multiple
      bites are cumulative. The save DC and check DC are both
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Lure (Ex)
    description: >-
      A serpent creeper has a special air sac in its throat that it can turn
      inside out. By doing so, the air sac appears to be a piece of low-hanging
      fruit. A serpent creeper uses this ruse to draw its prey in closer. When a
      serpent creeper does this, it gains a +8 bonus on Disguise checks beyond
      its normal racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Serpent creepers are dangerous carnivorous plants that resemble 12-foot long
    pythons. When at rest, their green and brown coloration and the leafy
    patterns on their scales make them hard to distinguish from ordinary vines.
    Whether these creatures are naturally occurring or some weird magical cross
    of serpent and plant is unknown.
  - >-
    Serpent creepers are typically 12-15 feet long. Their bodies are green and
    brown scales covered with various leaf-like patterns to aid them in their
    camouflage. Some serpent creepers can change the color of their scales
    slightly to better match their surroundings, adding to the ruse. Young
    serpent creepers are rarely encountered, but have been spotted. They appear
    as smaller versions of the adults, about 3 feet long. Reproduction and life
    cycles of serpent creepers are unknown.
  - >-
    Serpent creepers are quintessential ambush hunters. When hunting, a serpent
    creeper hangs from a tree and puffs out its air sac, disguising it as a
    fruit indigenous to the local area. When prey moves in to examine or pluck
    the fruit, the serpent creeper springs to life and quickly coils around the
    target while biting it. Slain prey is dragged to a safe place and devoured
    over the course of several hours. An unfinished meal is left to forest
    scavengers. Serpent creepers have a particular like for the flesh of goblins
    and halflings.
