Description_Visual: >-
  This human-sized creature looks like a cross between a large bat and a giant
  mosquito. Its wings are leathery and gray and its skin is drawn tight across
  its bones. The creature has eight pincer-like legs and a long needle-like
  snout. Its eyes glow pale blue.

Description:
  - >-
    A ghoul-stirge resembles a large stirge with rotting flesh and broken wings.
    The origin of the ghoul-stirge has been lost, but it is believed to be the
    result of a failed magical experiment conducted in ages past by a group of
    evil and (thought to be) insane necromancers.
  - >-
    Though they can generally be encountered anywhere, ghoul-stirges seem to
    favor desolate places such as ruins and caverns or dungeons deep
    underground. Being undead they do not have to eat, but seem to draw
    sustenance from the blood of enemies (much like a vampire).
  - >-
    A ghoul-stirge is about 5 feet long with a wingspan almost twice its length.
    Ghoul-stirges seem to understand Common, but apparently cannot (or choose
    not to) speak it.
  - >-
    A ghoul-stirge attacks by swooping down on its opponent and attempting to
    paralyze it with its bite attack. Opponents that resist its paralysis are
    attacked again, while paralyzed opponents are drained of their blood at the
    first opportunity. (A ghoul-stirge won't ignore other foes to drain the
    blood from a paralyzed enemy.) Credit The Ghoulstirge originally appeared in
    the First Edition module L1 The Secret of Bone Hill (Â© TSR/Wizards of the
    Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.
