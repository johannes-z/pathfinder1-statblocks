      sulfuric gas in a 30-foot cone. Affected creatures must make a successful

      checks and saves for 1 minute (10 rounds) due to fits of coughing and
      choking. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description:
  - >-
    Volcano giants make their homes in the many twisting caves and subterranean
    rooms of volcanic cones, enlarging and reinforcing them for comfort and
    convenience. Clothing for a volcano giant usually consists of little more
    than a simple wrap of fire lizard skin. A volcano giant wears ornaments made
    of bone, shell, and obsidian, and their general culture and society is
    similar to that of humanoid civilizations on tropical islands. Such island
    societies often get along well with local tribes of volcano giants, engaging
    in trade and peacefully coexisting. Should a tribe of volcano giants form an
    allegiance with a human tribe, the giants warn the humans of possible
    eruptions of their volcano to allow them time to escape the destruction.
    Although volcano giants can be described as good-natured and peaceful
    people, their demeanor can change quickly. At a real or imagined affront, a
    volcano giant can erupt with a passion that is rivaled only by the fire and
    fury of the volcano in which it lives. Volcano giants feel that their shadow
    is actually their soul, and do not tolerate any creature that dares to trod
    upon it. Volcano giants usually use Gargantuan longspears in combat. They
    are fierce and brave warriors, not backing down from any adversary. Many
    choose to open combat with their breath weapon so as to soften up their foes
    before attacking. Volcano Giants Characters +22 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +12
