SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Chill (Su)
    description: >-
      A lich shade's claws inflict an additional 1d6 points of cold damage on a
      hit, and any creature that takes this additional cold damage must make a
      DC 20 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round by the numbing chill. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When a lich shade is destroyed, it explodes into a burst of choking dust.
      All creatures within 10 feet must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 1d6
      points of Constitution damage from the violent choking and necromantic
      scouring of this supernaturally vile dust. Those who fail the save are
      also nauseated for 1d6 rounds, while those who succeed are merely sickened
      for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Spell Leech (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a spellcaster within 50 feet of a lich shade casts a spell, the
      spellcaster must make a DC 20 Will save or the spell is lost, as if it
      were counterspelled. The lost spell's energy is transferred to the lich
      shade, who can use the magical energy in one of the following three ways.
      A lich shade can only store the energy of one spell at a time. Cast: A
      lich shade can cast the spell on his turn at caster level 11th. When
      casting spells in this manner, he ignores the spell's material component
      requirements, but not its focus requirements. Eldritch Bolt: A lich shade
      can release the spell as an eldritch bolt of pure magic energy as a
      standard action (range 50 ft., ranged touch +12, 1d6 damage per 2 levels
      of the spell used to create it). Healing: A lich shade can absorb the
      spell's energy to heal hit points equal to the spell's level x4. Hit
      points in excess of his maximum are instead gained as temporary hit
      points. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour before fading.
  - name: Spell Sense (Su)
    description: >-
      A lich shade can automatically pinpoint the location of any spellcaster
      within 100 feet who has cast a spell within the previous round. It can
      also identify spells as they are being cast and all existing spell effects
      as if it were under the effects of greater arcane sight.
Description:
  - >-
    The road a spellcaster travels in his or her quest for lichdom is not
    without danger. During the dark rituals invoked to achieve lichdom, the
    caster sometimes errs in his or her calculations or unleashes mystic forces
    best left untapped. When such an event occurs, the spellcaster is usually
    destroyed outright. Other times, something is born as a result of this
    failed ritual-a lich shade.
  - >-
    Lich shades are evil creatures who attempted to achieve lichdom but failed
    for whatever reason. The creature is not destroyed, nor does it become a
    lich, it becomes something in between-something in between mortal life and
    eternal unlife.
  - >-
    Lich shades retain portions of their life's memories, and always retain full
    memory of the dark ritual they attempted while trying to become a lich.
  - >-
    For this reason alone, they have grown to hate the living and particularly
    living spellcasters whom they blame (in some warp twisted way) for their
    current condition. A lich shade always attacks any opponents who have a
    spellcaster in their midst, often targeting that individual directly above
    all others.
  - >-
    A lich shade stands about 6 to 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 160 pounds.
    The robes and gowns it wears often denote its previous life's profession
    (wizardly robes or priestly vestments for example).
  - >-
    A lich shade attacks with its powerful claws, rending and tearing at its
    foes. If facing a spellcaster and it leeches one of its spells, it usually
    releases the first spell leeched as an eldritch bolt against its closest
    foe.
  - >-
    Further leeched spells are used to heal the lich shade or cast back against
    its foes. If faced with certain defeat, a lich shade wills its own
    destruction, invoking its death throes ability, hoping to take several of
    its opponents with it.
  - >-
    A lich shade's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose
    of overcoming damage reduction.
