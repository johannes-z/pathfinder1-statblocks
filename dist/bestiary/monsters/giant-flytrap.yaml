  This towering plant is a mass of vines and barbs. Several stalks are horribly
  mobile, each ending in a set of green, toothy jaws.

    description: >-
      If a giant flytrap begins its turn with an opponent at least two size
      categories smaller than itself grappled in one of its mouths, it can close
      its jaws completely around the foe by making a new combat maneuver check
      (as though attempting to pin the foe). If it succeeds, it engulfs the prey
      and inflicts 1d8+7 points of damage and 2d6 acid damage as the cavity
      floods with digestive enzymes. The seal formed is airtight, so an engulfed
      creature risks suffocation. Engulf is a special form of pinning, and an
      engulfed creature can escape in the same way as he can from being pinned,
      but since an engulfed creature is contained wholly inside the plant's
      jaws, the flytrap's victim cannot be targeted by effects or attacks that
      require line of sight or line of effect. A giant flytrap that is grappling
      or pinning a foe cannot attack other targets with that bite, but is not
      otherwise hindered.
Description:
  - >-
    A hardy plant that grows in areas with poor soil but abundant animal life,
    this dangerous predator is an immense version of its more common (and much
    smaller) kin. Whereas the smaller flytraps supplement their growth by
    catching insects, the giant flytrap does the same with animals, humanoids,
    and anything else foolish enough to draw too near. Local legends call this
    plant names like "mancatcher," "snapperjaw plant," "dragonleaf plant,"
    "cowbiter," and "green gulper," but adventurers know it simply as the giant
    flytrap.
  - >-
    As the giant flytrap's prey are generally much smarter than insects, this
    huge plant has evolved into a much more aggressive hunter than its smaller
    brethren. It can lumber slowly along the ground, using its writhing roots
    like tentacles to relocate to more populous hunting grounds, and is quite
    canny at blending in with the surrounding foliage. A giant flytrap's jaws
    and stalks are swift-moving-it reaches out and snaps at passersby with
    lightning speed. The plant itself even has a modicum of intelligence, and is
    capable of limited tactical choices, such as knowing when to break off an
    attack against a powerful foe.
  - >-
    While most giant flytraps have four sets of jaws, some can have as few as
    one, and others eight or more.
  - >-
    As a general rule, you should increase a giant flytrap's HD by 2 and its
    natural armor bonus by +1 for each additional bite attack you give it,
    increasing its CR by +1 for each time you increase its attacks and HD in
    this manner. If you increase the plant by more than 3 or 4 bites (and thus
    by more than 6 or 8 Hit Dice), consult Table 1-1 on page 291 to make sure
    that the plant's CR remains appropriate.
  - >-
    A giant flytrap's stalks are 20 feet long, but generally sprawl relatively
    close to the central mass-a set of full-grown flytrap jaws is 7 feet across.
    A giant flytrap weighs 9,000 pounds.
