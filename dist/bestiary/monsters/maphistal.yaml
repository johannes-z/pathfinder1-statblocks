Description_Visual: >-
  A stinking aura of death and decay lingers in the air around this
  feral-looking humanoid. Two great horns protrude upward from its oval head. 
  Huge leathery, bat-like wings sprout from its shoulders, and its lower torso
  sports two massive legs that end in soot-colored hooves. Short, coarse black
  hair covers its entire body, except its face and clawed hands.

SpecialAbilities:

    description: >-
      Each time a living creature is hit by a weapon wielded by Maphistal, it
      must succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Dexterity
      damage as its bones fuse together. Creatures without bones or skeletal
      structures (such as oozes and plants) are immune to this effect.
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Demon Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 31; onset 1day, frequency 1 day,
      effect 1d6 Con damage and target must make a second Fort save or 1 point
      of the damage is Con drain instead, cure 2 consecutive saves. Vox:
      Maphistal's unique weapon is a +3 unholy crushing heavy mace. The crushing
      special quality crushes the skulls of those it strikes. Upon a successful
      critical hit, the weapon crushes the opponent's skull (if it has one)
      instantly killing the target. Some creatures, such as many aberrations and
      all oozes, have no skulls, others, such as golems and incorporeal undead,
      are not affected by the crushing special quality. Most other creatures,
      however, die when their skull is crushed.
Description:
  - >-
    Maphistal is a lieutenant in the employ of Orcus, Demon Prince of the
    Undead. He makes his home on a stinking, smoldering Abyssal plane where he
    commands his troops from his great castle, Maalstege (The Keep of Bones-so
    called because it is believed to be constructed from the skeletal remains of
    those slain by Maphistal). He is loyal to no one but Orcus. He does not
    trust Sonechard, the General of Orcus's undead legions, and seeks to
    discredit him at any opportunity, though he does not do this openly for fear
    of rebellion by his troops or punishment by Orcus.
  - >-
    His machinations against Sonechard are primarily through his agents and
    spies in Sonechard's camps.
  - Maphistal stands 9 feet tall and weighs 700 pounds.
  - >-
    Maphistal is rarely, if ever, encountered alone, and usually has a retinue
    of undead with him. When he enters combat, he usually opens with his
    spell-like abilities, immediately using his circle of death ability to
    affect as many targets as possible. In melee, he batters an opponent with
    his mace. An opponent whose skull is destroy (and who is therefore slain) or
    an opponent brought to Dexterity 0 (and not rescued by his comrades) is
    carried back to the Keep of Bones where it is transformed into an undead
    creature or becomes part of the Keep itself.
