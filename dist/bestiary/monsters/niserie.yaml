SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Water Form (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a niserie can turn into a mobile pool of water. This
      functions like gaseous form, except that the niserie cannot fly in this
      form. It retains its own base speed, and its swim speed doubles to 80
      feet. The niserie can remain in her water form for a number of minutes
      equal to twice her Constitution bonus and can end this ability as a
      standard action. A spell with the cold descriptor inflicts no damage on a
      niserie in its water form, but instead automatically slows the creature as
      per the spell for 1d6 rounds or until she leaves her water form. A spell
      with the electricity, fire, or sonic descriptor inflicts normal damage on
      a niserie in its water form.
Description:
  - >-
    Niserie (also called undine or true undine) are playful and mischievous fey.
    On occasion they are malicious, taking great pleasure in luring sailors to
    their watery graves. Also known as sea nymphs, niserie prefer trickery to
    combat and flee if presented with overwhelming odds.
  - >-
    Niserie stand from 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh around 130 pounds. They are
    always female; there are no male niserie (that scholars are aware of). While
    most niserie have golden hair, the rare niserie has seaweed green hair with
    moss green eyes.
  - >-
    If forced into combat, a niserie defends herself with her spell-like
    abilities and dagger, seeking escape at the earliest convenience by changing
    into water and flowing away.
