SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Feast (Su)
    description: >-
      When a creature within 30 feet of a feeder in the depths takes bleed
      damage (including ongoing damage), the feeder heals an equal amount of
      damage.
  - name: Deadly Bleeding (Su)
    description: >-
      A feeder in the depth's bite causes bleeding wounds that resist healing.
      The first bite that damages a creature deals 1d4 points of bleed damage,
      and each subsequent bite increases the amount of bleed by 1d4. Stopping
      the bleeding requires a successful DC 20 Heal check or the application of
      any magical healing. However, anyone attempting to cast a healing spell on
      a creature suffering from deadly bleeding must succeed at a DC 20 caster
      level check or the spell doesn't affect the bleeding creature. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Keen Scent (Ex)
    description: >-
      A feeder in the depths can notice creatures by scent in a 180-foot radius
      underwater, and can detect blood in the water at a distance of up to 1
      mile.
  - name: Swift Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      When making a full attack, a feeder in the depths can make a second bite
      attack at a -5 penalty.
Description:
  - >-
    Feeders in the depths closely resemble ordinary sharks, but they are faster,
    stronger, and far more intelligent and malevolent. Feeders in the depths
    begin life as ordinary sharks, raised under the care of sahuagin
    priestesses. A would-be feeder feasts on the flesh of merfolk, sea elves,
    and other aquatic humanoids. As it dines on these sacrifices, the priestess
    chants blasphemous rituals, infusing the shark with malign power and the
    stolen intelligence of its victims. Over the course of 13 feedings over 13
    midwinters, a new feeder in the depths arises.
  - >-
    Feeders in the depths view themselves as equals to sahuagin, not as
    servants. They have no special affection for sharks, and can't communicate
    with them. Feeders act as loyal companions as long as they're respected and
    given the freedom to hunt. If not treated well, they rip their would-be
    masters apart and descend into the lightless depths of the ocean. Although
    able to breed, feeders in the depths give birth only to monstrosities or
    normal sharks, never to other feeders. A typical feeder in the depths is 24
    feet long and weighs 5,500 pounds.
