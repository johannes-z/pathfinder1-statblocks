    description: >-
      Slam-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1
      Dexterity damage and 1 Constitution damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. If an opponent failed a save against the poison, one
      week after suffering the effects of the mercury poisoning, if the target
      has not received the benefits of a neutralize poison during that time
      span, then he must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be affected as if by an
      insanity spell (caster level 10th). The effects can be removed by the
      successful casting of a greater restoration, heal, miracle, or wish spell.
Description:
  - >-
    Created by some bizarre and broken arcane experiment in ages past, the
    mercury ooze is a monster best left alone. The mercury ooze is about 8 feet
    long and 6 inches thick. It can compress its body to a thickness of 1 inch
    to slip into cracks and crevices.
  - A mercury ooze attacks by grabbing and squeezing its prey.
