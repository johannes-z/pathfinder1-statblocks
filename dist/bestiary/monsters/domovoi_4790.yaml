    description: A domovoi killed by violence rises in 1 hour as a poltergeist.
  - name: Telekinesis (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once per turn, a domovoi can use telekinesis. This
      ability functions as the telekinesis spell with a CL equal to the
      domovoi's Hit Dice (CL 4th for most domovoi). A typical domovoi has a
      ranged attack roll of +5 when using telekinesis to hurl objects or
      creatures, and can use this ability on objects or creatures of up to 75
      pounds. If a domovoi attempts to hurl a creature with this ability, that
      creature can resist the effect with a successful DC 13 Will save. The save
      DC is Strength-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Domovoi are wicked fey found at the forests' edge, in underground caves, and
    in small cities and towns, usually dwelling in ruined buildings or in attics
    and crawlspaces of occupied residences. They are capricious and violent
    creatures and take great delight in inflicting harm on those that cross
    them-and sometimes on those that don't.
  - >-
    Domovoi stand just over 2 feet tall and weigh around 60 pounds. Their
    clothes are usually dirty and smelly, but other than that seem to be well
    kept (no holes, no tears, for example). The creature's hair is dark and
    wildly unkempt. Males have long dirty beards the same color as their hair.
    No females or young domovoi have been encountered.
  - >-
    Domovoi prefer to attack from ambush, startling their opponents with sudden
    attacks and catching them unaware. A favored tactic is to stay hidden and
    assault a target with random objects through the use of the domovoi's
    telekinesis.
