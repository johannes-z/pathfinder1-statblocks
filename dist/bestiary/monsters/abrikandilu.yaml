SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Destructive Attacks (Ex)
    description: >-
      An abrikandilu's natural attacks can threaten and confirm critical hits
      against objects. In addition, they gain a +5 racial bonus on Strength
      checks made to break or destroy objects.
  - name: Hatred of Mirrors (Ex)
    description: >-
      An abrikandilu loathes the sight of its own reflection. Using a mirror
      grants a +5 bonus on Intimidate checks against an abrikandilu. An
      abrikandilu adjacent to a mirror or attacked by a mirror-carrying creature
      (at the GM's discretion, some shields could be considered mirrors) must
      attempt a DC 15 Will save at the start of its turn. If it fails, it must
      focus all of its actions that round on attempts to destroy the mirror.
  - name: Mutilation (Su)
    description: >-
      An abrikandilu's bite causes hideous, ugly wounds that not only mar beauty
      but supernaturally diminish a creature's sense of self-worth. A creature
      bitten by an abrikandilu must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or gain a
      -1 penalty on all Charisma-based checks. This penalty can stack as high as
      a -5 penalty with multiple bites and failed saves, and lasts even after
      the wounds are healed. The penalty reduces by 1 point every 24 hours. This
      is a curse effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Known as wrecker demons, abrikandilus delight in destroying beauty, be it
    the rending a fine painting to shreds, reducing a magnificent statue to
    rubble, or scarring a lovely face. Abrikandilus form from the souls of those
    who in life vandalized art or destroyed objects of beauty, particularly from
    those whose acts of destruction were born from jealousy. All abrikandilus
    loathe only one thing more than beauty-their own ref lection. Curiously, the
    countenances of other abrikandilus do not vex a wrecker demon, but the sight
    of its own deformed shape drives it into a furious anger.
  - >-
    Abrikandilus are used often as ground troops in demonic wars, for they are
    excellent brutes on the battlefield and do not require weapons or armor to
    excel at combat. Their penchant for destroying works of art brings a
    demoralizing element to battle, for little remains after abrikandilus attack
    works of beauty. Even when they are defeated, the damage they've dealt
    endures, a constant reminder of the infinite value of what they destroyed.
  - An abrikandilu stands 4 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.
