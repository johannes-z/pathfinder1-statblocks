      A hunter urchin's spines can swivel to face any approaching creature. Any
      creature that attacks a hunter urchin with an unarmed strike or a natural
      attack, or any Medium or smaller creature that attacks with a one-handed
      weapon or light weapon, is automatically attacked by the hunter urchin's
      spines as an immediate action. If the spines hit, they can poison the
      target as well.

Description:
  - >-
    Much more dangerous than their smaller kin, giant sea urchins are dangerous
    predators of opportunity. With the exception of the hunter urchin, giant sea
    urchins lie in wait for food to come to them, typically carried within reach
    of their attacks via ocean currents or, more commonly, tides. Hunter
    Urchins: These urchins can adjust their spines to effect an awkward method
    of locomotion on land. They actively seek prey, and possess long, rasp-like
    tongues that can whip out and pull food to them. Spear Urchins: These
    brightly colored creatures can fire spines like javelins, relying upon
    poison to slow down prey or eventually immobilize it so they can crawl over
    to feed. Glass Urchins: So named for their transparency, these beautiful
    creatures shimmer like delicate crystals. Yet for all the damage their
    spines can inf lict, victims of glass urchins generally do more damage to
    themselves or their allies due to the potent hallucinatory effects of this
    urchin's venom. Sea Urchins as Difficult Terrain The giant sea urchins
    presented here are fantastic evolutions of their much more common, smaller,
    and less offensive kin. Yet even the smaller common urchins can pose a
    problem for unwary adventurers. Sea urchins live in vast colonies on tidal
    rocks, and moving across a field of urchins can be quite awkward and
    painful. Their thousands of spines are just as sharp as those possessed by
    their larger kin, and they function as caltrops to anyone that walks over
    them. Worse, these spines are venomous, and can poison those who take damage
    from them. Those who succumb to the poison suffer searing pain that can
    sicken them for several minutes. Though uncomfortable, fortunately this
    venom doesn't actually inf lict either ability damage or ability drain. Sea
    Urchin Venom: Spines-injury; save Fort 11; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes;
    effect victim is sickened for 1 minute; cure 1 save.
