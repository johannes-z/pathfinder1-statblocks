SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Howl (Su)
    description: >-
      The howl of a church grim causes any evil creature within its limited
      domain (its churchyard; see below) to make a successful DC 16 Will save or
      become panicked for 2d4 rounds. Good or neutral creatures are completely
      unaffected by the howl as long as they are not there to steal from the
      dead or attack the church. Whether or not the save is successful, a
      creature cannot be affected by the same church grim's howl for one day.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Know Alignment (Su)
    description: >-
      A church grim makes automatically knows the alignment of any creature that
      enters its churchyard. This ability can be dispelled, but the church grim
      can reactivate it the following round as a free action. It cannot extend
      this ability beyond the limits of its domain, however.
  - name: Limited Domain (Ex)
    description: >-
      The realm of a church grim encompasses only the churchyard it defends; it
      can wander freely in its cemetery and any adjoining church grounds, but it
      cannot move beyond; it must stop at the boundary of consecrated land.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      It is difficult to destroy a church grim through simple combat. A slain
      church grim restores itself within 24 hours. Even the most powerful spells
      are often only temporary solutions. A church grim that would otherwise be
      destroyed returns to its churchyard with a successful level check (1d20 +
      the church grim's HD) against DC 16. The only sure way to get rid of a
      church grim is to raze the church it protects and cast unhallow on the
      churchyard.
  - name: Soul Defender (Su)
    description: >-
      It is the sacred duty of a church grim to defend the bodies and souls of
      those buried in its churchyard. Any attempts to cast an animate dead or
      similar spell to create undead within the confines of an area guarded by a
      church grim requires the caster to make a successful DC 20 caster level
      check. If the check fails, the spell fizzles away just as if it had been
      cast. Whether the check succeeds or not, the caster incurs the full wrath
      of the church grim immediately.
  - name: Wisdom Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      The incorporeal bite of a church grim deals 1d6 points of holy damage and
      1d4 points of Wisdom damage to the target. A successful DC 14 Fortitude
      save negates the Wisdom damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. On each
      successful attack that does Wisdom damage, the church grim gains 5
      temporary hit points.
Description:
  - >-
    Church grims are good spirits that guard cemeteries from those who seek to
    steal from the dead, or those who wish to desecrate the sanctity of the
    graves there. The eyes of a church grim see all evil that crosses into its
    territory, and it spares no mercy for such trespassers.
  - >-
    The precinct of a church grim is the cemetery and church it has chosen to
    protect, and it cannot leave that holy ground around. A church grim cannot
    truly be destroyed, for it is not a mortal creature of flesh and blood.
  - >-
    If dispatched, a church grim will return the following night to resume its
    duties.
  - >-
    A church or temple dedicated to a good deity is 25% likely to have attracted
    a guardian church grim; this chance increases to 75% if the church or temple
    grounds have been hallowed.
  - >-
    A church grim does not attack or harm anyone that enters the churchyard or
    the cemetery if they are there to worship or pay their respects. It only
    attacks evil creatures and those who enter the churchyard to rob from the
    dead. Church grims always attack undead creatures on sight.
