SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Discorporate (Ex)
    description: >-
      A junk golem can break apart into its constituent pieces as a standard
      action, becoming a swarming mass of Tiny parts. It gains the swarm
      subtype, its space changes to 10 feet, and its reach changes to 0. In this
      form, it gains a swarm attack that deals 1d6 points of damage and inflicts
      disease, but loses its slam attacks. It can revert back to its normal form
      as a full-round action.
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Tetanus: Slam-injury; save Fort DC 12; onset 1d6 days; frequency 1 day;
      effect 1d4 Dex damage. Each time someone takes Dexterity damage from
      tetanus, there's a 50% chance his jaw muscles stiffen, preventing speech
      and the use of spells with verbal components for 24 hours; cure 2
      consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A junk golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against a junk golem, as noted below. • A shatter spell causes
      a junk golem to discorporate and dazes it for 1 round. • A grease spell
      affects the junk golem as if it were haste for 1d6 rounds and ends any
      slow effect on it. • An arcane lock or hold portal spell affects the junk
      golem as if it were a slow spell for 1d6 rounds and breaks any haste
      effect on it. • A wood shape or rusting grasp spell deals 2d6 points of
      damage to a junk golem.
  - name: Junk Repair (Su)
    description: >-

      of debris, such as a refuse heap or the area created by another junk
      golem's discorporate ability.
