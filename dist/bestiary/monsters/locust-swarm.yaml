      A locust swarm causes damage to unattended objects in its space each round
      as though they were creatures. It even damages inedible objects.
Description:
  - >-
    Under crowded conditions, these normally inoffensive relatives of the
    grasshopper change color, breed uncontrollably, ravenously consume any
    available vegetation, and wreak vast destruction to farms and settlements.
    The largest swarms, known as plagues, can include billions of locusts and
    cover hundreds of square miles. Locusts in these swarms are larger and more
    aggressive than common ones, making the swarm a true danger to everything
    edible in their path and even to inedible objects as well.
