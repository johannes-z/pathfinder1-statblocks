SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Petrification (Su)
    description: >-
      A mythic cockatrice's bite causes flesh to calcify and harden-multiple
      bites can cause a living creature to fossilize into stone. Each time a
      creature is damaged by a mythic cockatrice's bite attack, it must succeed
      at a DC 13 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity damage as its
      flesh and bones stiffen and harden. If a creature's Dexterity score is
      reduced to 0 by a cockatrice's bite, that creature immediately turns
      completely to stone, as if petrified by a flesh to stone spell. Every day,
      a creature petrified by a cockatrice in this manner can attempt a new DC
      12 Fortitude save; if it succeeds, the victim recovers from the
      petrification with a Dexterity score of 1 (and thereafter can be restored
      to full Dexterity by natural healing or magic as normal). If a petrified
      creature fails three of these Fortitude saves in a row, the petrified
      state becomes permanent. A creature restored to flesh via magic has any
      Dexterity damage caused by cockatrice bites removed, but not any existing
      Dexterity damage from other sources. A cockatrice is immune to the
      petrification ability of itself and of other cockatrices, but other
      petrification attacks affect them normally. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.

    description: >-
      A creature within 30 feet of a mythic cockatrice on its turn must
      successfully save or be subjected by petrification as if it had been
      bitten.
  - name: Stone Plumage (Su)
    description: >-
      Any weapon that strikes a mythic cockatrice takes 1d6 points of damage
      that bypasses the weapon's hardness. Any creature attacking the cockatrice
      with natural weapons or unarmed strikes takes 1d6 points of damage.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic cockatrice is infused with stone, perhaps because of some aspect of
    its aging process, or its body has absorbed minerals from countless stony
    foes, or its incessant grooming has slowly petrified its own flesh. Even
    more aggressive and territorial than non-mythic kin, a mythic cockatrice
    recklessly attacks anything that intrudes on its territory.
