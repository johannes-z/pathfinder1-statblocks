Description:
  - >-
    A mythic cockatrice is infused with stone, perhaps because of some aspect of
    its aging process, or its body has absorbed minerals from countless stony
    foes, or its incessant grooming has slowly petrified its own flesh. Even
    more aggressive and territorial than non-mythic kin, a mythic cockatrice
    recklessly attacks anything that intrudes on its territory.
