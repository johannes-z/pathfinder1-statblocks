Description_Visual: >-
  A beast leapt forth from the flames of Hell, this gigantic, threeheaded hound
  howls a sound like the cacophony of a raging wildfire. Large enough to heft a
  horse in its monstrous maws, this terror bears no flesh, its body merely a
  thing of exposed bone and charred musculature. From its three fanged mouths
  leap tongues of flame, and crimson saliva leaks from the terror's skeletal
  jaws.

Description:
  - >-
    The mythical watchdogs of Hell, cerberi bear the bodies of terrible,
    powerful hounds and the essences of fiends. Relied upon by villains and
    frightful beings as guardians and gaolers, these three-headed canine
    abominations possess far greater cunning than their flensed, bestial
    appearances would suggest-a terrible intellect they pour largely into malice
    and enjoyment of their victims' tormented ends. Cerberi draw upon a
    legendary pedigree, all reputedly tracing their lineage to a single
    primordial evil beast said to still guard the foundations of some forsaken,
    deathly realm. Brethren to hell hounds, cerberi loathe their distant kin,
    viciously attacking such hellspawn if not kept at heel by a tyrannical
    master. Such are the cruel devices of Hell, though, that brazen hatred
    breeds ingenuity and new evils. Thus, within the depths of the infernal
    realm, amid the indomitable pits and fortresses of Malbolgia, devils work at
    nightmarish beast pens, forcibly breeding monstrous hybrids. Born in fury
    and profanity, Malbolgian cerberi rage forth, ferocious three-headed hell
    hounds the size of bulls and more than willing and capable of slaughtering
    their loathed Nessian warhound kindred. A typical cerberi stands a broad 4
    feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds, while a Malbolgian cerberi can reach
    over 6 feet in height and weigh upward of 400 pounds. Ecology Denizens of
    Hell, cerberi embody the ferocity and covetousness of that realm. Bent to
    service as watch beasts or guardians at the gates of the Pit, cerberi
    possess unique abilities predisposing them to such grim service. Bearing
    some measure of mastery over souls and their fundamental ability to shift
    between planes, these infernal hounds easily trap their victims, preventing
    them from escaping to the safety of more favorable realms. This ability
    allows the beasts to prey upon both spirits and the denizens of the outer
    planes, which every so often attempt to leap between realms to avoid danger.
    Physically, cerberi appear akin to mortal canines, though in truth they hold
    little in common. As natives of Hell, they resemble devils more than the
    wolves and hounds of the Material Plane, their fleshless figures and three
    monstrous heads making this obvious at anything less than extreme distances.
    Despite the differences in physiology between mortal beasts and these keen
    hunters of souls, cerberi frequently find themselves treated like unthinking
    animals-largely due to their inability to speak. Such a mistake often proves
    deadly, as cerberi possess alert minds and genuine cunning. While most
    willingly accept the commands of more powerful masters and gory
    compensations for their efforts, cerberi are intelligent enough to know when
    they've been slighted and viciously turn on creatures who mistakenly think
    themselves their masters. Habitat & Society In their natural infernal
    environments, cerberi might be found anywhere powerful fiends have need for
    guardians. This makes them frequent fixtures among the dark vaults of
    Erebus, the estates of Dis, and the fortresses of Avernus. Capable trackers,
    especially adept at detecting the scent of wayward souls, cerberi also might
    be found among the legions of the first layer of Hell hunting the freshly
    arrived damned alongside other devils. Yet, beyond all other tasks, these
    three-headed hounds excel as captors and minders of the dead, assuring that
    none of Hell's charges escape their eternal fates. Cerberi's incredible
    ability to trap victims on planes and track the dead make them highly
    coveted servants across the multiverse. The live markets of Dis teem with
    cerberi for sale, both ravenous pups and tested hunters. Daemons and night
    hags especially covet cerberi and pay high prices for whole packs of the
    soul-hunting hounds. The hounds' bestial appearances and love of slaughter
    often cause those who consider themselves cerberi owners to forget the
    deviousness of their allies, a development that often ends poorly, if not
    bloodily, for the unwary and the weak. Outside of the devil-tamed reaches of
    Hell and other foul extraplanar wildernesses, small groups of cerberi gather
    in harsh, pack-like communities. Typically dominated by the strongest or
    wiliest member, such packs form swift and deadly tides, stalking trespassers
    upon their vast hunting grounds and doggedly pursuing any scent of lost
    souls. Although cerberi gain no sustenance from attacking the dead, as
    befits their infernal nature, all gain a vicious satisfaction at the feeling
    of an immortal essence discorporating forever within their deadly jaws.
