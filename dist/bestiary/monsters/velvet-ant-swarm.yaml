Description:
  - >-
    Velvet ants are not really ants at all but a form of wasp. The females are
    wingless while the males have wings. Velvet ants have a bright red abdomen
    and thorax and a black head and black legs. Its thorax and abdomen are
    covered with short, coarse, red hairs. Typical adults reach a length of 1
    inch.
  - >-
    Velvet ants feed on the nectar of flowers, though on some occasions, the
    adults have been known to feed on other wasps and bees, particularly
    bumblebees or honey bees. Other such insects are generally left alone.
  - >-
    Velvet ants typically make their lair in bee hives or nests they have taken
    over. Generally an assault is short and quick, with the velvet ants swarming
    the bees and quickly gaining the upper hand, slaying all bees in a single
    nest. Slain bees are kept as food for the velvet ant larvae.
  - >-
    Velvet ants are generally inoffensive. Most encounters are with a swarm
    moving from one location to another, and most attacks happen when a careless
    individual wanders into the swarm. Male velvet ants are completely harmless.
    Females compose any swarm encountered and they attack with a painful sting.
