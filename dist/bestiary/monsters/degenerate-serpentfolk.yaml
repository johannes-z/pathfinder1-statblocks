Description:
  - >-
    The majority of serpentfolk today are degenerates who have devolved to the
    point of primeval savagery and have lost much of their magical legacy-more
    civilized serpentfolk generally regard these degenerates with shame and
    disdain.
  - Degenerates are 5 feet tall but weigh 200 pounds.
