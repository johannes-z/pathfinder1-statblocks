Description:
  - >-
    Barrow rats are scavengers by nature and prefer to feed on dead animals or
    rotting corpses, even going as far as to gnaw through a wooden coffin to eat
    the flesh of a newly dead and buried creature. Food that is not immediately
    devoured is ripped into smaller pieces that can be carried and is whisked
    back to the barrow rat's nest and stored for later consumption or fed to the
    newborn barrow rats.
  - >-
    Barrow rats are 15-inch long brownish-gray rats with long gray or brown,
    hairless tails. Their underbellies are lighter in color than their fur often
    appearing white in some rare species, but usually appearing light brown or
    slate. Some barrow rats have a dark brown or black stripe on their dorsal
    side that runs the length of their body.
  - >-
    Barrow rats are not as numerous or populous as their normal relatives and
    are generally only encountered near barrow mounds or graveyards. Most
    encounters are at night as the rats sleep in underground burrows during
    daylight hours. A typical barrow rat nest holds 10-40 of the creatures with
    an additional 10-40 noncombatant young. One or two males dominate the nest.
    Typically there are two or three females that dominate the colony, but
    remain subordinate to the dominate male(s). Young are born live and a female
    typically gives birth to 3d8 young. The typical gestation period for a
    barrow rat is 1 month and young reach maturity in 3 months. Young are born
    blind and hairless and are completely dependent on their mother for several
    days thereafter. Young open their eyes around 20 days and the mother weans
    her young after about one month. Young barrow rats gain the stone skin
    ability at 30 days after birth.
  - >-
    Barrow rats rarely engage in combat with creatures much larger than
    themselves, preferring to flee when confronted. Smaller creatures are
    attacked from ambush and swarmed by the rats.
  - >-
    If threatened or cornered, a barrow rat activates its stone skin ability for
    defense and either attacks with its bite or simply flees. Multiple barrow
    rats swarm an opponent. If their nest or young are threatened, barrow rats
    fight to the death.
