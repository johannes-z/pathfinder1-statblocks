    description: >-
      An entropic ooze can automatically detect the location of any living
      creature within 120 feet. It also senses the strength of their life force
      automatically, as if it had cast deathwatch.
Description:
  - >-
    An entropic ooze is a dangerous and deadly protoplasmic creature thought to
    have arrived on the Material Plane from another dimension or time. Its sole
    purpose seems to be the collection and destruction of the souls of the
    living. Some tales spoken only in whispers say the entropic ooze is the
    creation of an insane god, sent to destroy life so that the gods may remake
    creation. Others conjecture that the entropic ooze is the creation of some
    vile and evil spellcaster warped on the perverseness of its own destruction
    and that of the world around it. Whatever its true purpose, the entropic
    ooze is a deadly creature that seems to have no useful purpose in the
    ecosystem, save perhaps to those of a destructive nature.
  - >-
    Entropic oozes can be found just about anywhere, though most are found in or
    near locations frequented by living creatures. They prefer areas of
    darkness, such as subterranean caves, dungeons, and the like, where their
    naturally dark coloration allows them to blend into the natural darkness.
  - >-
    An entropic ooze is an amorphous and swirling mass of black protoplasm that
    covers an area of 10 feet or more. Its form resembles that of a black
    pudding and it is often mistaken for said creature. The entropic ooze is
    naturally cold to the touch and those that have contacted the ooze (and
    lived), speak of the unnatural energy they felt flowing through it.
  - >-
    The screams of those that have been absorbed are thought to be heard
    emanating from the creature's form as it undulates along.
  - >-
    A entropic ooze is driven by its hunger and need to absorb souls. It attacks
    by forming pseudopods from its protoplasmic form or by simply rolling over
    its opponents and absorbing them into its form. After devouring the soul of
    an engulfed creature, the entropic ooze ejects the creature's physical body,
    now a dried and crumbling husk. An entropic ooze prefers to absorb as many
    creatures as it can into its body, and then pummel those that avoid being
    engulfed with its powerful pseudopods.
