Description_Visual: >-
  The air fills with the sound of hissing snakes as a giant, severed snake's
  head floats into view, with a gaping mouth and twin fangs dripping virulent
  poison. Its eyes are milky and blind, but its forked tongue constantly tests
  the air for fresh scents. Below the head, where a body should be, numerous
  hissing serpents thrash like tendrils of torn flesh. Blood drips from the
  severed head, sizzling as it burns like acid through anything it touches.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acidic Gore (Su)
    description: >-
      The Emperor of Scales' giant severed head continually drips blood and gore
      that burn like acid. Any creature within 10 feet of the Emperor of Scales
      must make a DC 25 Reflex save or be sprayed by droplets of acidic blood,
      taking 2d6 points of acid damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Command Snakes (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a free action, the Emperor of Scales can command any snake or serpent
      with the animal or magical beast type, as the dominate animal spell. The
      target can resist the command with a DC 25 Will save.
  - name: Immunity to Vorpal Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Emperor of Scales is essentially a giant head with no body. As a
      result, its head cannot be severed, and vorpal weapons have no additional
      effect on it.
  - name: Maddening Hiss (Su)
    description: >-
      The Emperor of Scales' numerous snake heads constantly hiss in a maddening
      cacophony as a free action. Any creature within 100 feet of the Emperor of
      Scales must make a DC 25 Will save or be confused for 1 round. This is a
      mind-affecting compulsion insanity effect. A creature that saves cannot be
      affected by the Emperor of Scales' maddening hiss for 24 hours. The save
      DC is Charisma-based.

Description:
  - >-
    In the earliest days of the Age of Serpents, when the great serpentfolk
    empire was young, the serpentfolk were ruled by a single, powerful
    priest-king. When Ydersius took his rightful place as god of the
    serpentfolk, he exalted this priest-king above all others, raising the king
    up to become his foremost servant and herald. With his original name long
    lost to memory, the first king of the serpentfolk empire became known as the
    Emperor of Scales.
  - >-
    With Ydersius's still-living head entombed beneath the earth and his
    mindless body endlessly wandering the Darklands, the Emperor of Scales is
    the snake-god's primary representative on Golarion. Unable to take direct
    action on his own, Ydersius relies upon his herald to enact his will on the
    Material Plane. The Emperor of Scales embodies the fall of the mighty
    serpentfolk empire from its previous heights, and personifies the rage of
    Ydersius himself, trapped and sundered into two lesser parts. But he also
    represents the god's immortality, for even in defeat Ydersius was not slain,
    and even without a body, the Emperor of Scales still serves.
  - >-
    The Emperor of Scales does not speak, but it can communicate telepathically.
    Snakes and serpents of all kinds and sizes flock to the Emperor of Scales,
    who can enslave them to his will. The Emperor of Scales appears as a giant
    snake's head about 20 feet long, and weighs close to 5 tons. His serpentine
    tendrils extend another 15 feet behind and around his head.
  - >-
    Ecology When Ydersius was whole and walked Golarion as the god of the
    serpentfolk empire, the Emperor of Scales appeared as a giant serpentfolk
    warrior clad in golden scale armor who strode across ancient battlefields
    wielding spells and blade with equal precision. When Ydersius was beheaded
    by the Azlanti heroine Savith and cast down, the Emperor of Scales suffered
    his own mutilation. In a sympathetic ref lection of his master's fate, the
    Emperor's head tore itself free from his body, growing to monstrous size
    while his humanoid body quickly withered away. His eyes clouded over,
    blinding the herald, but the tendrils of flesh that once attached his head
    to his body transformed into a multitude of hissing, poisonous vipers. The
    Emperor of Scales has kept that form since, but the faithful of Ydersius
    believe that when the snake-god is restored, so too will his herald return
    to his original form and once more lead the serpentfolk armies to victory.
  - >-
    Originally born on Golarion, the Emperor of Scales is a native outsider. He
    sleeps like any normal creature, and when not called upon to serve, spends
    most of his time in a dream-filled torpor, much like the severed head of
    Ydersius himself. Unlike other native outsiders, however, the Emperor of
    Scales does not need to eat. As he no longer has a body to process and
    digest food, he gains sustenance from his divine link with Ydersius. On
    other planes, the Emperor of Scales gains the extraplanar subtype, and
    requires neither food nor sleep.
  - >-
    Habitat & Society At the height of Ydersius's power, the Emperor of Scales
    divided his time between Golarion and Ydersius's planar realm, the pocket
    plane of Sydrixus deep in the unending chaos of the Maelstrom. Since
    Ydersius's defeat, that realm has been closed to both the god and his
    servants, and like Ydersius, the Emperor of Scales has been confined to the
    Material Plane. In the millennia since, the Emperor of Scales has traveled
    throughout the Material Plane, alternately searching the Darklands of
    Golarion for the sundered skull and body of Ydersius, or sleeping for
    centuries, dreaming of his master's restoration and return.
  - >-
    The Emperor of Scales has been encountered numerous times over the ages in
    various abandoned cities of the ancient serpentfolk, both on Golarion, and
    some say, on other worlds as well. Powerful priests of Ydersius have been
    known to wake the Emperor of Scales when they find him and request his aid.
    Such alliances are usually short-lived, however, as the herald inevitably
    moves on in search of his lost master.
  - >-
    The Emperor of Scales is known to work with demons on occasion, though those
    fiends serving Abraxas are viewed as enemies, and the herald does not
    hesitate to attack and destroy them, returning them to their Abyssal realm.
  - >-
    In his original form, the Emperor of Scales frequently mated with mortal
    serpentfolk and left behind countless semidivine progeny. What happened to
    these paragons of the serpentfolk race after the fall of the serpentfolk
    empire is unknown, although many powerful serpentfolk priests claim descent
    from the herald to bolster their own inf luence. These days, exceptionally
    large or particularly strong snakes are said to be the brood of the Emperor
    of Scales, remnants of his serpentine tendrils that were severed in battle
    and took on a life of their own. Whether or not these claims are true is of
    little importance-certainly the Emperor of Scales himself seems unconcerned
    with such potential offspring.
