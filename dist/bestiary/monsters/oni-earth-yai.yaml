  rocky skin, making it appear to have burst forth from rugged stone.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Spiky Skin (Ex)
    description: >-
      An earth yai may grow spikes from its stony skin at will as a free action.
      These spikes are treated as armor spikes that deal 1d10 points of damage.
  - name: Stony Missile (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, an earth yai can fire an incredibly dense stone from
      its third eye. This attack has a range of 200 feet, with no range
      increment, and deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage. Upon striking the
      target, the stone immediately makes an Awesome Blow attempt against the
      target using the earth yai's CMB.
Description:
  - >-
    Although they possess the rocky physiques and near indestructibility of
    stone giants, earth yai scorn that race's humble ambitions, and instead
    prove as brutal and destructive as avalanches. For them, physical force and
    destruction are the ultimate demonstration of power. This belief doesn't
    necessarily require them to be the strongest or to go on gory rampages,
    though. After all, what is mere strength if a soldier can fire a catapult
    that brings down an entire tower, or an emperor can give the decree
    beginning a war that ravages an entire empire, using both their tools and
    words to sow ruin. Such ability to cause calamity grants one power over
    others; those who have the potential to cause the greatest devastation have
    the greatest power. Earth yai endlessly seek to hold the greatest power,
    leading many to become brutal warlords or bandit kings, but some to embrace
    more subtle, long-term machinations in their pursuit of gradual and
    far-reaching ruin.
  - >-
    In its natural form, an earth yai stands 16 feet tall and weighs 3,000
    pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Earth yai possess forms similar to the rocky bodies of the stone giants
    their otherworldly shapes mimic. While stone giants often appear to be
    sculpted from rock, earth yai tend to have a more rugged appearance, with
    features that seem to have been clawed from mountainsides, teeth and claws
    like sharp stones, and three eyes like angry red gems. Their skin is always
    as hard as rock, the cracks and ravines that riddle their bodies having no
    impact on their formidable resilience.
  - >-
    Like their yai brethren, earth yai possess an unnerving third eye that
    serves as a portal through which destruction passes. Whenever one so
    chooses, it can cause a shard of stone to blast from its eye at the speed of
    a catapult shot. Those struck risk being crushed by the rock, but might also
    be thrown aside by the sizable projectile. Earth yai typically use this
    incredible ability not only to annihilate those who oppose them and
    intimidate witnesses, but also to tear down larger structures or sow greater
    devastations, like by using it to start landslides, break dams, or destroy
    bridge supports.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Earth yai dream of conquest like many other oni, but how they pursue victory
    tends to vary from individual to individual. While all would agree that
    victory is only attained when one's foes are crushed and shattered, the
    methods used to accomplish this goal range from brute displays of power to
    the slow erosion of a foe till nothing remains. The scope of an earth yai's
    ambitions also seems largely dependent on its age, with younger oni proving
    content to raid territories and subjugate peasant villages, while older
    individuals seek greater conquests and the destruction of whole lands.
  - >-
    Earth yai enjoy the moment when their long-term plans reach fruition, and
    might spend decades reveling in past successes before moving on to new
    conquests. An earth yai who manages to conquer a community or subjugate a
    region might spend this time acting as a brutal tyrant, installing itself in
    a palace or fortress and demanding that its slaves supply its every whim.
    Those who refuse are dramatically murdered. While one of these oni would
    never give up past conquests, most earth yai eventually grow bored and seek
    new challenges-if such opportunities don't present themselves during the
    oni's rule. These oni might move on to find new opponents, but still
    regularly return to their past holdings to reinforce their control and
    instill dread among their prisoners.
  - >-
    While an earth yai does not have the greatest intelligence and cannot
    necessarily outwit a wise hero, most possess deep wells of patience and
    centuries of experience. An oni who finds itself bested time and time again
    might wait out foes or opposing alliances. Their ages of experience mean
    that earth yai can generally discern the amount of time they must wait
    before a threat to them passes- perhaps with the help of a few inconvenient
    disasters to accelerate an enemy's decline.
  - >-
    When two or more earth yai encounter one another, they invariably engage in
    an extended strategic match, seeking to undermine and outdo each other in
    acts of cleverness and violence. All earth yai know that a battle between
    two of their kind must end in a face-to-face confrontation and brutal
    combat. Occasions for assassination or impersonal defeats might arise in
    such conf licts, but they are never exploited. These oni see a final battle
    between members of their kind as a form of honor, and all seek to avoid
    slighting even their weakest or most reviled kindred.
  - >-
    Although all earth yai dream of being the masters of regal citadels
    dominating lands filled with fearful servants, few actually achieve this
    goal. Those still campaigning for their despotic dreams typically find lairs
    in mazelike mountain ravines and in large caverns near the earth's surface.
    These hideaways can prove notoriously difficult to uncover, as the oni often
    make use of their passwall ability to sink through solid barriers or walk
    past gates that don't appear to be portals at all. There they meditate and
    plot, seeing all the threads of probable events in their minds and
    determining which ones they need to pull on to shape the future to their
    liking. If any creature interrupts an oni in its lair, the oni violently
    attacks, viewing intruders as not just dangerous, but dishonorable, as they
    trespass upon the oni's private home. This obsession with privacy extends
    not just to yai in their secret lairs, but also to those with greater
    holdings. Most earth yai only tolerate creatures of living stone to share
    their homes, and only bear the intrusion of lesser creatures when they
    themselves demand the lesser creatures' presence.
  - Earth Yai Daifu
  - >-
    Just as stone giants develop a variety of special abilities related to their
    age, so too do earth yai grow in power as their years mount upon them. Known
    as daifus, such earth yai have Charisma scores of at least 20 and can use
    the following spell-like abilities once per day: stoneskin, summon monster
    XI (earth elementals only), wall of stone. Most earth yai daifus are
    sorcerers or oracles with abilities tied to the earth or destruction. Earth
    yai daifus add +1 to their CRs.
