  - name: Fiery Regeneration (Su)
    description: >-
      A kyrana does not take damage from fire-based attacks. Additionally, when
      a kyrana would normally take fire damage, it heals that number of hit
      points, to a maximum of 5 hit points per round. A kyrana can't use its
      breath weapon to heal itself.
Description:
  - >-
    Kyranas are large, iguana-like relatives of true dragons, with low
    intelligence and an aff inity for fire. Though quite weak as dragons go,
    kyranas are still dangerous enough to command the fear and respect of
    kobolds, who often encounter the fire-breathing dragons while digging deep
    tunnels.
  - >-
    Kyranas are primarily subterranean creatures, though they can occasionally
    be found on the surface in extremely hot or volcanic areas. Healed
    supernaturally by contact with fire, they often spend their time swimming in
    volcanic calderas or underground lava lakes, taking in geothermic energy and
    storing it in order to release it on their prey as lines of fiery breath.
  - >-
    If kyranas stayed confined to their magma homes, they would present little
    problem to other races. Unfortunately, they're extremely territorial, even
    toward their own offspring. Kyranas are born in clutches of six to 12 eggs,
    and raised by both parents. As soon as the creatures reach adulthood at the
    age of 18 months, however, the parents turn on their offspring and drive
    them from the nest. The exiled kyranas then split up and wander the
    surrounding tunnels, traveling hundreds of miles in search of any source of
    heat. That means they often come waddling into inhabited areas, snorting and
    ready to burn anyone standing between them and the hearth. Adventurers may
    find their campfires claimed by a greedy kyrana, or end up being followed
    for their torchlight. Kobolds often use these barely intelligent dragons as
    heavy artillery, employing fire arrows and flaming traps to lure them into
    conf lict with enemies.
  - An adult kyrana is 5 feet long and weighs 300 pounds on average.
