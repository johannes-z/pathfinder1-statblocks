Source: PFRPG Bestiary 4
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Drain Memory (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a hyakume can make a touch attack with
      either its hands or one of its eye probes to drain a target of its
      memories. The target loses the majority of memories relating to life and
      identity, and the hyakume can control the creature as if it were subject
      to a charm monster spell until those memories are regained (Will DC 28
      negates). The hyakume absorbs the memories and can store and use them. It
      can store the memories of a number of creatures equal to its Intelligence
      bonus (typically 4) at one time. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save
      DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Eye Probe (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a full-round action, a hyakume can detach up to six of its
      eyes and send them on missions. An eyeball has AC 22, hp 5, and a fly
      speed of 60 ft. with perfect maneuverability. A hyakume can see through
      all of its eye probes, and can make drain memory attacks with them. If a
      hyakume's eyeball is destroyed, the hyakume takes 5 points of damage. An
      eye probe can't stray farther than 1 mile from a hyakume or the eye is
      destroyed (dealing 5 points of damage). Monk Abilities The hyakume's
      Stunning Fist feat and slam attacks function as though it were a
      15th-level monk. It can also use the quivering palm class feature once per
      day (Fortitude DC 25). The save DC is Wisdom-based.
  - name: Transfer Memories (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a hyakume can touch a willing creature
      with either its hand or one of its eye probes to transfer memories it has
      stored to the creature touched. This is a mind-affecting effect.
Description:
  - >-
    Hideous and corpulent, with numerous eyes dotting their bodies, hyakumes are
    mystics of malevolence. They steal and collect the memories of other
    intelligent beings to increase their own knowledge.
