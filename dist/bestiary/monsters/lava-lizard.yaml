Description:
  - >-
    Lava lizards make their lairs in or near active volcanoes, spending their
    days swimming in the boiling magma. These creatures have few predators, save
    for some red dragons and fire giants. Lava lizards prefer to hunt during the
    day and sustain themselves on a diet of large game animals or whatever
    happens to wander close to their lair. Most prey is killed and carried back
    to the lair to be devoured later. Lava lizards often store their prey in
    magma pools as they prefer high temperature food.
  - >-
    Lava lizards are about 10 feet long and weigh around 600 pounds. Their skin
    is always a shade of cherry red and their eyes are pale yellow. These
    creatures reproduce once per year on average with the female laying 4 to 6
    large reddish eggs. These eggs are usually tucked away beneath a lava pool
    to not only incubate them, but also deter predators. Eggs hatch within 60
    days and young reach maturity with 3 years. Lava lizards live about 100
    years.
  - >-
    Lava lizards generally avoid combat unless provoked, threatened, or hunting.
    In combat they assault their prey with their bite attempting to incinerate
    it as quickly as possible. Lava lizards that are outmatched flee if
    possible, seeking refuge in nearby magma pools or lava tubes where most
    attackers dare not venture.
