Description:
  - >-
    To the serpentfolk, the pursuit of knowledge and magic is the highest goal.
    Their legends speak of how humanity rose to power only through the theft of
    serpent magic, a legend that may form the basis of the hatred toward
    humanity most serpentfolk harbor. They view themselves as the undisputed
    masters of magic, be it arcane or divine. Yet despite this, the majority of
    serpentfolk today are degenerates who have devolved to the point of primeval
    savagery and have lost much of their magical legacy- more civilized
    serpentfolk generally regard these degenerates with shame and disdain.
    Serpentfolk are 6 feet tall and weigh 120 pounds. Degenerates are only 5
    feet tall but weigh 200 pounds. All serpentfolk are quite long-lived, and
    generally live to the age of 500. Advanced Serpentfolk When a serpentfolk
    gains class levels, several of its abilities increase as well, as detailed
    below. • Spell Resistance equals total Hit Dice + 10. • Poison bite save DC
    equals 10 + Con modifier + 1/2 total Hit Dice. • When it is 4th level in any
    class combination, it gains two spell-like abilities usable once per day
    each: dominate person and major image. When it reaches 9th level in any
    combination, it gains two more usable once per day each: mass suggestion and
    teleport. • A serpentfolk's racial ability score modifiers are as follows:
    Str -2, Dex +10, Con +6, Int +8, Wis +4, Cha +6. Degenerate Serpentfolk
    Degenerate serpentfolk possess the same statistics as normal serpentfolk,
    save for the following adjustments. • They have no spell-like abilities. •
    They lose the +4 racial bonus on Use Magic Device checks, but gain a +4
    racial bonus on Perception checks. • Their natural armor bonus increases
    from +3 to +7. • They have the following ability score modifiers: Str +10,
    Dex +2, Con +8, Int -6 (minimum 3), Wis +2, Cha -4. A typical degenerate
    serpentfolk's ability scores are Str 20, Dex 13, Con 19, Int 4, Wis 13, Cha
    6.
