Description_Visual: >-
  A wiry figure approaches, its hairless body inhumanly slender and frail
  looking. It has two sets of arms, a smaller pair of stunted normal looking
  arms and a longer primary set knotted with wiry muscle with malformed forearms
  ending in long cartilaginous blades.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Flurry of Blows (Ex)
    description: >-
      Similar to a monk, a slaughterford can make a flurry of blows attack at
      the expense of accuracy. It can make one extra attack per round as a full
      attack action, but each attack receives a -2 penalty.
  - name: Rend Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a slaughterford hits with both arm blades, it pulls apart any armor
      worn by its foe. This attack deals 2d8+6 points of damage to the
      opponent's armor. Creatures not wearing armor are unaffected by this
      special attack. Armor reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed. Damaged armor
      may be repaired with a successful Craft (armorsmithing) check.
Description:
  - >-
    Sometimes known as reaperborn, slaughterfords were bred from unknown
    humanoid stock by long-forgotten wizards in ages past. They typically dwell
    underground in burrows or caves and only venture to the surface world at
    night. They are not harmed by sunlight, but do not like it.
  - >-
    Slaughterfords move with an odd grace, capable of inhuman feats of agility
    and flexibility. Their faces are twisted mockeries of human expression,
    bearing reddish eyes, large noses, and perpetual sneers of evil and rage.
    Their secondary arms are much weaker and are only used for simple
    manipulation, never for combat. When the slaughterford is engaged in combat,
    it keeps its secondary arms folded against its belly.
  - >-
    A slaughterford strikes with its arm blades. In melee it relentlessly
    slashes and stabs until either it or its opponent is dead. It can use both
    of its arm blades with equal proficiency. Heavily armored opponents are
    subjected to its armor rending ability before being slashed and stabbed. A
    slaughterford gang works in concert to slay their foes, though when faced
    with overwhelming odds, slaughterfords attempt to flee.
