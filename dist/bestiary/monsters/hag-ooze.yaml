SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Spell Channel (Su)
    description: >-
      A hag creator of a hag eye ooze can see through the embedded hag eye as if
      she were looking from the ooze directly. This ability requires that the
      hag creator and the hag eye ooze be on the same plane in order to
      function. If the hag that created the hag eye ooze is part of a coven, the
      following spells have a 5% chance per caster level of operating through a
      hag eye ooze: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect
      magic, message, read magic, and tongues. A non-hag that controls a hag eye
      ooze can't cast spells through the ooze, nor can it see through the
      creature, but it can target the hag eye ooze with a
      clairaudience/clairvoyance spell and view through it in that manner.
  - name: Suction (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hag eye ooze can create a powerful suction against any surface it
      climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. It can
      establish or release suction as a swift action, and as long as it is using
      suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a hag eye ooze
      gains a +10 bonus to its CMD to resist bull rush attacks, awesome blow
      attacks, and other attacks and effects that attempt to physically move it
      from its location.
  - name: Transparent (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hag eye ooze is difficult to discern from its surroundings in most
      environments. A successful DC 15 Perception check is required to notice a
      hag eye ooze. Any creature that fails to notice it and walks into it
      automatically suffers damage as if struck by the hag eye ooze's slam
      attack.
Description:
  - >-
    Some hags create hag eye oozes to serve as scouts and spies, favoring them
    over humanoid servants due to the ease of control. With their ability to
    blend in with their surroundings and climb nearly any surface, these
    creatures patrol the hag's lair and surrounding territory. Hag eye oozes
    seem to be imbued with a sliver of the cautious side of their creator's
    personality, watching intruders from a distance and avoiding combat unless
    directed to attack. Once given a command, these creatures pursue their goal
    mindlessly until a countermand is given.
  - >-
    Hag eye oozes have gelatinous, transparent bodies that can sometimes grow
    larger than 5 cubic feet, though most are smaller, taking up roughly half
    that space. To date, no specimens have been found weighing more than 500
    pounds.
  - Creating a Hag Eye Ooze
  - >-
    The process of creating a hag eye ooze is a strange blend of cooking in a
    cauldron and the magic rituals involved in sparking simulated life into a
    construct. For more information on hag eyes see Pathfinder Campaign Setting:
    Classic Horrors Revisited.
  - >-
    Creating a hag eye ooze requires 2 weeks. This time is reduced if the brewer
    is working cooperatively. For each additional member of a coven involved in
    the process, the creation time is lessened by 2 days, to a minimum creation
    period of 3 days. During this period, various nutrients and ingredients must
    be added to the cauldron in which the ooze is brewed. As the ingredients are
    added the hag must consult strange texts and foul recipes to assure proper
    creation. If she misses a step or poorly measures a reagent, the necessary
    arcane energies to create the hag eye ooze do not properly bind to the
    creature's nascent form. If successful, she then begins a 24-hour ritual,
    during which the cauldron holding the brewing ooze is bombarded with spells.
    This ritual and spellcasting culminates in the addition of a hag eye-
    preferably from the hag creator. If the ritual is successful, the hag eye
    ooze animates fully formed and able to serve as a minion. The hag eye ooze
    is under the control of the creator, but in cases where a coven takes part
    in creating the ooze, control goes to the hag that supplied the hag eye.
