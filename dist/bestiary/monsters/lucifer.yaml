Description_Visual: >-
  This exquisitely handsome humanoid stands at least 10 feet tall . His hair is
  long and jet black as is his neatly-trimmed and forked beard. His hands end in
  wicked claws and his feet are cloven. A long snake-like, stinger-tipped tail
  dances behind him and intertwines itself around the massive triple-pronged
  pitchfork he carries. Two oversized and backward-curving blackened horns jut
  from his head. He is cloaked in a suit of banded armor that glistens with the
  color of the night sky.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gaze Weapons (Su)
    description: >-
      Lucifer has two gaze weapons. He may use one each round as a standard
      action. Each gaze weapon has a range of 30 feet and has a save DC of 47
      (CL 39th). The save DC is Charisma-based. Descent into Evil: Any creature
      meeting Lucifer's gaze must make a successful Will save or have his
      alignment shift one step toward lawful evil on the law-chaos axis or the
      good- evil axis. A lawful evil creature is unaffected by this gaze attack.
      A successful save renders a creature immune to this gaze weapon for one
      day. Curse: Any creature meeting Lucifer's gaze must succeed at a Will
      save or be affected as if by a double-strength bestow curse spell (-12 to
      one ability score or -6 to two ability scores; or -8 enhancement penalty
      on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks; or each
      turn the target has a 25% chance to act normally, otherwise he takes no
      action; Lucifer chooses the curse when he uses this special attack). A
      successful save renders a creature immune to this gaze weapon for one day.
      This curse can be dispelled by making a caster level check against DC 50.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sting-injury; save Fort DC 48; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 2d6
      Con damage; cure 3 consecutive saves.. The save DC is Constitution-based.
      Rod of Infernus Lucifer's black iron rod functions as a Huge +6 trident
      that he can wield without penalty. It has the following abilities:
      Annihilation Ray: Once per round, and no more than five times per day, the
      rod can fire a ray to a range of 60 feet. A creature struck by this ray
      must succeed on a DC 40 Fortitude save or be annihilated instantly-not
      even a trace of dust is left behind. No form of mortal magic can restore
      life to a creature annihilated by this ray. Lucifer or a deity can restore
      the annihilated creature to life using magic. Rod of Rulership: The rod
      has all of the abilities and powers of a rod of rulership. Trap the Soul:
      Once per round, and no more than three times per day, the rod can fire a
      ray of hellish-red energy to a range of 60 feet that functions as a trap
      the soul spell (CL 20th). A target can make a DC 40 Will save to resist
      the effects. If failed, the victim's soul vanishes into Lucifer's rod. Up
      to 10 such souls can be held in the rod at one time. A trapped soul may be
      freed by grasping the rod and speaking a command word. Any non-devil that
      touches the rod takes 10d8 points of electricity damage per round of
      contact (no save) and gains two negative levels each round it touches the
      rod. The Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 40 and can
      result in actual level loss on a failed save. The negative levels cannot
      be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the rod is
      wielded. Any goodaligned creature that touches the rod takes 3d6 points of
      Constitution drain each round it touches the rod (DC 40 Fortitude save for
      half). Hell's Redoubt: Hell's Redoubt is Lucifer's Large suit of +5 heavy
      fortification banded mail that has no armor check penalty, speed penalty,
      and no chance for arcane spell failure. It was personally crafted for him
      the hands of Cheshimiboth, Armorer of the Nine Hells, just prior to the
      Great Uprising. To reward this unique devil's genius for crafting, Lucifer
      had him murdered in the first moments of the Uprising to prevent him from
      ever revealing any vulnerability in the armor he fashioned or ever again
      crafting its equal. In addition to its fortification qualities, three
      times per day, Lucifer can cause the fires of Hell to spring forth
      stationary once called forth). These fires last for 3 rounds and deal 10d6
      points of fire damage per round (DC 40 Reflex save for half) and ignore
      all fire resistance and fire immunity. Only the wearer of the armor is
      immune to their effects. Those slain by these fires are completely
      destroyed (including their equipment) and cannot be returned to life
      through anything short of divine intervention. Hell's Redoubt functions as
      +1 banded mail and bestows five negative levels for as long as it is worn
      if worn by anyone other than Lucifer unless the wearer defeats Asmodeus
      and gains the Throne of Hell. At that point it resumes its ordinary
      function. Anyone wearing the armor is filled with the overwhelming urge to
      attempt to do that very thing no matter the cost. The negative levels
      disappear if the armor is removed.
Description:
  - >-
    Lucifer has many names: The Prince of Lies, The Prince of Darkness, The
    Adversary, The Prince of Light, and Satan. It is believed that Lucifer was
    the first devil in existence, having been cast down from the heavens when he
    challenged the rulings of the gods of law and good. After being cast down,
    Lucifer constructed a plane he called Hell. There he built his palace of
    iron and basalt on the lowest and darkest region of Hell. He divided this
    realm into nine distinct regions and appointed his closest allies to rule.
    Each lord was allowed to mold and shape his domain as he saw fit, but all
    paid homage to Lucifer. A millennia passed and Lucifer reigned supreme in
    Hell. During this time, one of the lieutenants (each of which had now become
    known as arch-devils or rulers) decided he could do a much better job of
    running Hell than Lucifer could. Asmodeus coveted the Throne of Hell and
    wanted it for himself. Using his powers of persuasion, he promised each and
    every other arch-devil that stood with him and challenged Lucifer a larger
    role in the "new" Hells. Those that stood against him, he said, would be
    destroyed or cast out of Hell along with Lucifer when the end came. This
    time in Hell's history became known as the Great Uprising. Asmodeus managed
    to sway every single arch-devil, save one. Belial refused to stand with
    Asmodeus and barely escaped capture at the hands of the other arch-devils.
    When the battle for Hell's Throne commenced, Belial, Lucifer, and their
    allies stood fast against the mighty armies of the other arch-devils. In the
    end however, the sheer numbers of devils that fought against Lucifer
    overwhelmed his armies and those that stood with him. Lucifer and his allies
    were forced to flee Hell or face destruction. The sole exception was Belial.
    Near the end of the war when he saw that Lucifer would likely lose the
    Throne, Belial turned and joined Asmodeus' ranks and helped oust Lucifer
    from Hell. Cast out, Lucifer wanted vengeance. But vengeance required power,
    and he was tired, injured, and weakened from the time spent battling in
    Hell. He needed a place to rest, a place to grow in power, and a place to
    plan. Thus he created Infernus, a plane of eternal and everlasting fire and
    suffering: one plane, one ruler; created by his own hands, his own blood,
    and a portion of his very essence. From his great keep, Malefacta, Lucifer
    waits for the day he can challenge for the Throne of Hell again. Lucifer is
    said to be one with the plane. As the gods of law are to the planes of good,
    so is Lucifer to Infernus. Nothing goes unnoticed by him on Infernus. All
    movements are seen, all whispers are heard. A plan is not hatched or
    contrived without Lucifer's knowledge. When people speak of Infernus, they
    speak of Lucifer and vice versa. No creature, it is thought, stands a chance
    against Lucifer on Infernus, not even the arch-devils that stood against him
    during the Great Uprising. But Lucifer knows that when the battle comes, he
    will have to fight the arch-devils on their own planes, not on Infernus, and
    he is preparing for just that. By sending his agents to the Material Plane
    to corrupt good-aligned beings and convert those currently paying homage to
    Hell's rulers, Lucifer grows in strength. And this strength gives him power,
    power that surpasses any he ever had- including his near deific powers he
    possessed in the planes of good. And when his power finally reaches its
    pinnacle, he will travel to Hell and destroy it and every single inhabitant.
    Lucifer stands 10 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds. Lucifer rarely engages in
    combat (and even less rarely does he engage in melee combat), preferring to
    summon pit fiends to fight his would-be challengers. If he does enter
    combat, he fights with his Rod, spells, spell-like abilities, gaze attacks,
    poison, and acid. Slain foes are either left in the "care" of his minions or
    taken to Xaphan and used to stoke the hellish furnaces that power Malefacta.
    Servants of Lucifer Followers of Lucifer are far and wide and consist of
    evil humanoids; usually clerics, necromancers, sorcerers, and wizards.
    Devout followers of Lucifer are called Dark Cardinals and must sign a pact
    of evil with Lucifer. Dark Cardinals can receive spells from Lucifer and are
    granted access to two of the following domains: Evil, Law, Strength, and
    War. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
