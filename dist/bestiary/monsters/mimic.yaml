SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adhesive (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding
      fast any creatures or items that touch it. An adhesive-covered mimic
      automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack.
      Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the mimic is alive without
      removing the adhesive first. A weapon that strikes an adhesivecoated mimic
      is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. A
      successful DC 17 Strength check is needed to pry off a stuck weapon.
      Strong alcohol or universal solvent dissolves the adhesive, but the mimic
      can still grapple normally. A mimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and
      the substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies. The save DC is
      Strength-based.
  - name: Mimic Object (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mimic can assume the general shape of any Medium object, such as a
      massive chest, a stout bed, or a door. The creature cannot substantially
      alter its size, though. A mimic's body is hard and has a rough texture, no
      matter what appearance it might present. A mimic gains a +20 racial bonus
      on Disguise checks when imitating an object in this manner. Disguise is
      always a class skill for a mimic.
Description:
  - >-
    Mimics are thought to be the result of an alchemist's attempt to grant life
    to an inanimate object through the application of an eldritch reagent, the
    recipe for which is long lost. Over time, these strange but clever creatures
    have learned the ability to transform themselves into simulacra of man-made
    objects, particularly in locations that have infrequent traff ic by small
    numbers of creatures, thus increasing their odds of successfully attacking
    their victims. Though mimics are not inherently evil, some sages believe
    that mimics attack humans and other intelligent creatures for sport rather
    than merely for sustenance. The desire to completely fool others is thought
    to be a part of their being, and their surprise attacks against others are a
    culmination of those desires. A typical mimic has a volume of 150 cubic feet
    (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet) and weighs about 900 pounds. Legends and tales
    speak of mimics of much greater sizes, with the ability to assume the form
    of houses, ships, or entire dungeon complexes that they festoon with
    treasure (both real and false) to lure unsuspecting food within.
