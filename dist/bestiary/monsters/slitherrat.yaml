Description_Visual: >-
  These rodents have a long three to four foot long snakelike body covered in
  fur, with four almost vestigial legs on each side. The long body tapers into a
  rat-like tail at the end, adding another foot to the creature's overall
  length. The head, although large, is clearly that of a giant rat; but the long
  front teeth glitter, for they are made of thin, sharp diamond.

      as if they were not even present, leaving no trace of their passage.
Description:
  - >-
    Slitherrats are a bizarre variant of the giant rat, sometimes found in
    places with heavy crystalline mineral deposits. These strange creatures use
    their teeth to dig through earth and solid rock when they encounter such
    obstacles.
