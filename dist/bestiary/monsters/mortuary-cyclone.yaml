SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any living creature slain by a mortuary cyclone's necrocone attack or
      energy drain attack becomes an undead creature in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are
      under the command of the mortuary cyclone that created them and remain
      enslaved until its destruction. See the sidebar for the type of undead
      creatures a mortuary cyclone can spawn.
  - name: Desecrating Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A mortuary cyclone emanates an aura of desecration within a 50-foot radius
      centered on its body. This functions as a desecrate spell (caster level
      18th) as if the mortuary cyclone where a permanent fixture dedicated to
      its own deity. Clerics in the area take a -6 profane penalty on turning
      checks, undead within the area gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls,
      damage rolls, and saves, and undead created within the area have +2 hit
      points per HD. Further, anyone casting animate dead within 50 feet of a
      mortuary cyclone creates as many as double the normal amount of undead (4
      HD per caster level instead of 2 HD per caster level). A consecrate spell
      cast on a mortuary cyclone by a caster of 18th level or higher nullifies
      its desecrating aura for 1 minute per caster level.
  - name: Necrocone (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a mortuary cyclone can blast forth a mass of bone
      fragments, debris and negative energy in a 30-foot cone. Creatures caught
      in the cone take 6d6 points of damage. Half this damage is piercing
      damage, but the other half is from negative energy and is not subject to
      resistance or immunity (unless the opponent is resistant or immune to
      negative energy effects). An affected creature that succeeds on a DC 27
      Reflex save reduces the piercing damage by half. Undead within the area of
      a necrocone heal a number of hit points equal to the amount of negative
      energy damage (3d6) the attack would otherwise deal. An undead creature
      cannot gain temporary or bonus hit points from a mortuary cyclone's
      necrocone. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Unholy Grace (Su)
    description: >-
      A mortuary cyclone adds its Charisma modifier as a bonus on its saving
      throws and as a profane bonus to its Armor Class. (The statistics block
      already reflects these bonuses.)
Description:
  - >-
    A mortuary cyclone is an undead creature born when living creatures tamper
    with or desecrate a mass grave (either magically or naturally).
  - >-
    Though not evil by nature, the destruction a mortuary cyclone deals and
    leaves in its wake is legendary. These creatures simply decide on a
    direction to move, and much like a natural occurring tornado, they move in
    that direction without regard to who or what stands in their way. A single
    mortuary cyclone is more than capable of destroying a village or small town
    in a very short time if left unchecked.
  - >-
    A mortuary cyclone appears as a 20 foot tall or taller tornado composed of
    grave dirt, bone fragments, and body parts all swirling around in its
    whirlwind form.
  - >-
    Mortuary cyclones feed on the energy of living creatures. Such creatures
    caught in the path of a mortuary cyclone are sucked into its central form
    and pummeled by high speed winds, bone fragments, and negative energy. Slain
    creatures are deposited on the ground where they rise as undead "slaves" in
    command of the mortuary cyclone.
  - >-
    A mortuary cyclone attacks by forming pseudo-fists from its whirlwind form
    and pummeling its foes or by absorbing them into its whirlwind (its favored
    method of attack). A mortuary cyclone simply has to move into a creature's
    space to pull it into it cyclonic form. It continues raining its fists down
    on creatures that avoid its whirlwind, all the while, firing a burst of bone
    fragments and negative energy at foes attempting to keep their distance.
  - >-
    A mortuary cyclone's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
  - >-
    Mortuary Cyclone Spawn A creature killed by a mortuary cyclone's necrocone
    rises as an undead creature in 1d4 rounds. The type is based on the
    creature's total HD.
  - >-
    Total HD Opponent Rises as Less than 10 Zombie or skeleton 11-15 HD Wraith
    16-20 HD Spectre 21+ HD Dread wraith
