SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animate Rocks (Su)
    description: >-
      A stone maiden can animate rocks within 180 feet at will, controlling up
      to two rocks at a time. Animated rocks are vaguely humanoid-shaped (most
      often resembling a stone maiden) and use the same statistics as stone
      maidens. They do not possess a stone maiden's animate rocks ability,
      spell-like abilities, or veil special quality. They can move through a
      spike stoned area unimpeded and without taking damage. An animated rock
      loses its ability to move if the stone maiden that animated it is
      incapacitated or moves out of range.
  - name: Earth Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone maiden gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and
      its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne,
      the stone maiden takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These
      modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)
  - name: Immunity to Earth Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone maiden is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and
      supernatural effects with the earth descriptor, including spells of the
      Earth domain.
  - name: One with the Earth (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone maiden is so closely tied with the earth that any damage it takes
      from the natural attacks of an earth or stone creature (one formed of
      earth or stone or one with the earth subtype) is considered nonlethal
      damage.
  - name: Veil (Su)
    description: >-
      Each stone maiden is mystically bound to her veil and never lets it out of
      her possession. If she is ever more than 1,000 feet from it, she weakens
      (-4 effective penalty to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution) and dies
      within 4d6 hours, crumbling to dust. If her veil is ever destroyed
      (hardness 3, hp 10) shed ies within 1 minute. A stone maiden's veil does
      not radiate magic.
Description:
  - >-
    Stone maidens are reclusive creatures of elemental earth thought to be
    somehow related to dryads and other fey creatures of earth and nature. How
    sages came to this conclusion is unknown (but one can venture a guess and
    say it is because like many fey creatures, such as nymphs, dryads, and
    nereids, the stone maiden is a strikingly attractive female creature). They
    spend almost of their time on the Elemental Plane of Earth, rarely venturing
    into the Material Plane, unless summoned. If summoned by a spellcaster, a
    stone maiden performs the task asked of her (if she can and if it does not
    go against her alignment) and quickly returns to her home plane.
  - >-
    Stone maidens rarely associate with other races, preferring to deal only
    with those of their own kind (meaning earth creatures). They are often found
    in the company of geons, non-evil vilstraks, and earth elementals.
  - >-
    (It is rumored the Elemental Lord of Earth has a personal harem of stone
    maidens in his private palace.) A stone maiden's features are delicate and
    smooth. Her hair (almost always hidden by her veil) is long and flowing, and
    generally darker than her grayish "skin." A typical stone maiden stands
    about 6 feet tall.
  - >-
    A stone maiden can be summoned using a summon monster VII, planar ally (or
    greater), or planar binding (or greater) spell.
  - >-
    A stone maiden is reluctant to enter combat unless pressed. Once engaged, a
    stone maiden defends itself with its longsword (or slam attack if unarmed)
    and an array of spell-like abilities.
  - >-
    A stone maiden usually opens combat by animating a section of nearby rock
    and directing the animated rocks to attack her nearest opponents. Next, she
    uses spike stones to turn the ground between herself and her foes into a
    field of razor-sharp points (and remember, because of her immunity to earth
    magic, a stone maiden can move through a spike stoned area unimpeded and
    without taking damage). Creatures making their way through the spike stoned
    area are usually met with a wall of stone or a hail of magic stones.
  - If combat goes against a stone maiden she uses meld into stone to escape.
