SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dancing Evasion (Ex)
    description: >-
      The sentinel hut's dancing and hopping movements give it a +3 bonus on all
      Reflex saves.
  - name: Immune to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sentinel huts are immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance, with the exception of spells with the fire descriptor,
      which affect it normally.
  - name: Stir Crazy (Su)
    description: >-
      A victim swallowed whole by a sentinel hut is trapped in a plain,
      10-foot-square room. A trapped creature is not considered grappled, and
      can move freely about the room. Every round, it is bombarded with a
      powerful psychic force that causes 1d2 points of Wisdom damage. To escape,
      the victim must deal damage on the sentinel hut's door (AC 15, 12 hp).
      Damage dealt to any part of the interior other than the door still adds to
      the damage dealt to the construct overall, but won't free the victim. If
      sufficient damage is dealt to the hut to destroy it (from without or
      within), the trapped creature is freed, but must succeed at a DC 22 Will
      save or be afflicted by insanity (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 250).
      Victims who break through the door from within are not subject to this
      latter effect.
Description:
  - >-
    Though few have seen Baba Yaga's Dancing Hut and lived to tell the tale,
    many scholars believe that these bizarre constructs, created by the White
    Witches of Irrisen, were modeled after their mother's miraculous artifact.
    Used primarily as sentinels on Irrisen's borders, these quaint hovels on
    stilt-like legs surprise passersby when they move in an almost comical
    dancing strut.
  - Construction
  - >-
    A sentinel hut must be made of the wood from a tree grown in Irrisen's
    eternal winter (an extraordinarily rare commodity) and thatch for the roof.
    Both wood and thatch must be treated with magical ointments and powders
    worth 1,000 gp.
