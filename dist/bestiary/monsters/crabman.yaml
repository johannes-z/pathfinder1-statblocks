Description:
  - >-
    Crabmen inhabit coastal waters, hunting fish and gathering food. Crabmen
    communicate with others of their race through a series of hisses and clicks.
    A typical crabman stands about 9 feet tall. They speak their own language,
    and those with an Intelligence of 12 or higher often speak common. Crabman
    Society Crabmen make their homes in sea caves and coastal cliffs, venturing
    forth occasionally in search of food. They spend most of their time hunting,
    filtering algae for food, or scavenging the shores and beaches.
    Occasionally, they will gather wet sand from the seashore and filter it
    through their mouths, sucking out all organic material and plankton. The
    remainder is a hardened, dry ball of sand approximately 1 inch across; these
    pellets inadvertently give away the presence of a crabman community. Crabmen
    live in coastal caves, but some communities will excavate more expansive
    burrows into the cliff face. Within such a warren, each individual has a
    lair set off from a centralized meeting area. Each crabman tribe is lead by
    an elder that can be of either sex. Most crabman tribal elders are at least
    3rd-level warriors. Crabmen have no regular breeding or mating cycle, and
    each female seems to have her own periods of fertility and infertility. A
    fertile female will produce about 100 eggs within a two-week period. Crabman
    eggs are released into the ocean, hatching into translucent larvae with soft
    shells. These larvae vaguely resemble the adults, but may be mistaken for
    normal crabs given their size. After 6 months, crabman larvae molt and
    develop the harder shell required for life on land. Before their first
    molting, crabman larvae are practically defenseless. Crabmen rarely engage
    in commerce with other humanoid communities around them, including other
    crabman tribes. Crabman artisans produce only ephemeral goods made of
    driftwood, shells, and seaweed, and are quite capable of producing what
    other more aesthetic races would call works of art. Crabman Characters
