SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Intelligence Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      Lorthact drains 1 point of Intelligence each time he hits with a weapon or
      natural weapon (Will DC 39 negates). Alternatively, he can make a single
      melee touch attack per round, dealing no hit point damage but draining 2d4
      points of Intelligence (Will DC 39 half). After draining Intelligence from
      a creature, Lorthact gains the benefit of foresight (as the spell) against
      that creature for 1 minute.
  - name: Scholastic Masquerade (Su)
    description: >-
      When targeting a dominated wizard with his spell reservoir ability,
      Lorthact can also steal a school power from that wizard's chosen school.
      He can steal one of the wizard's 1st-level school powers by using three
      levels of his spell reservoir, both 1st-level school powers at a cost of
      six levels, and all school powers at a cost of nine levels. While Lorthact
      retains these powers, the target wizard cannot use them. The stolen powers
      function at the target wizard's level. Lorthact can steal school powers or
      a prepared spell from a dominated wizard, but not both. He may steal
      school powers from multiple schools if he has multiple wizards dominated.
  - name: Spell Reservoir (Su)
    description: >-
      Lorthact can drain prepared arcane spells from the mind of a creature he
      has dominated and store them for later use, similarly to a ring of spell
      storing. Draining a spell requires 1 full-round action if he is able to
      touch the target, or 1 minute to perform through the mental link provided
      by the dominate effect; in either case, no saving throw is allowed. He can
      hold no more than one stolen spell from each dominated caster in his spell
      reservoir, and the total level of stolen spells cannot exceed 25. These
      stolen spells take effect at the original caster's level.
  - name: Temporal Anomaly (Su)
    description: >-
      Lorthact exists slightly outside of the normal timestream. Spells that
      predict the future-such as augury, divination, foresight, and moment of
      prescience- cannot perceive him and provide no benefit against him or
      information about him. In addition, whenever a creature within 60 feet of
      him uses time stop, Lorthact can act normally within the duration of the
      time stop, as if he had cast it himself. As neither Lorthact nor the
      caster are frozen in time with respect to each other, each can target and
      affect the other with attacks, spells, or other effects they create,
      though they cannot affect other creatures within the duration of the time
      stop. This ability functions even if Lorthact is flat-footed or unaware of
      his opponent.
Description:
  - >-
    Lorthact the Unraveler, also named the Dwimmerlaik, the Ur-Magius, and the
    Diabolus Mystere, was once a high-ranking duke of Hell. Atypically, he was
    not solely bound to the service of a single archdevil, instead serving
    openly at various times as a mystical advisor and consultant on magical
    matters under both Geryon and Mephistopheles. Some believed him to be
    secretly a favorite of Asmodeus himself; this supposed favor provided some
    measure of protection from his jealous rivals. His last mistress in Hell was
    Eiseth, Whore-Queen of the erinyes, but when Eiseth uncovered a plot to
    reverse their positions-Lorthact arrogating himself to lordship and reducing
    her to mere consort-her wrath was enormous and eternal. Lorthact's allies
    deserted him lest they taste the fury of the erinyes. Lorthact proclaimed
    his innocence, but he saw condemnation awaiting and fled, racing across the
    planes with the whips of the erinyes at his heels.
  - >-
    After several planar refuges proved no shelter from his relentless pursuers,
    Lorthact sought solace in the mortal realms. Laying several false leads, he
    then doubled back to the diabolists of Cheliax, the first place his pursuers
    looked for him on Golarion. But after they had moved on, he slipped back
    into places they thought already thoroughly scoured. Adopting a succession
    of guises, he kept his presence hidden for years, but he never felt truly
    comfortable under the gaze of so many potentially unfriendly eyes. Seeking a
    more remote locale, he traveled to the farthest reaches of Chelish
    sovereignty: the Varisian city-state of Korvosa. There he found the perfect
    patsy in the vain and corrupt Lord Volshyenek Ornelos. Rebuffed by House
    Thrune in his quest to restore his youth and vigor, Volshyenek was easy prey
    for Lorthact's inveigling. The devil bound him in a web of lies and stole
    not only his soul but also his life. Impersonating Lord Ornelos for over 200
    years, he became a dominant figure in Korvosa, shadow-master of the Acadamae
    and sire of a great house. Meanwhile, he sought ways to rebuild his diabolic
    power and his store of souls so one day he might buy his way back to ducal
    favor in Hell.
  - >-
    In the end, Eiseth's diabolic assassins found him at long last, and he was
    forced to fake his own death. Yet he still dominates Korvosa from the
    shadows, controlling the Acadamae through his descendant Toff Ornelos.
    Little happens in the city without his knowledge, and he plays the part of
    the mage through shadow-magic, illusions, limited wishes, and the stolen
    magic of others. However, casters who delve too deeply into his or Korvosa's
    secrets find themselves at odds with the deadly duke, his powers honed by
    centuries of exile to undermine and destroy mages who might uncover his
    identity or unravel his schemes.
