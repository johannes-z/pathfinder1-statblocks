SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aerial Charge (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a snallygaster charges downward at an angle of 45 degrees or more,
      its bite attack deals double damage (or triple damage on a critical hit).
      Bleed damage is not multiplied for this attack.
  - name: Sucking Tentacles (Ex)
    description: >-
      A snallygaster uses its retractable tentacles to suck blood from its
      victim's bleeding wounds. If a target has a bleed effect and the
      snallygaster grabs it with tentacles or maintains a grapple against it,
      the target takes double the normal bleed damage at the beginning of its
      next turn. When the snallygaster is using its tentacles, it cannot make
      bite attacks.
Description:
  - >-
    The snallygaster is a hideous amalgamation of lizard and bird that preys on
    unwary travelers. Its claws and beak have an almost metallic sheen to them,
    hinting at their sharpness and strength. Black stripes run the length of its
    scaly blue hide all the way to the tip of its long, sinuous tail. The
    snallygaster's serpentine neck terminates at a small, birdlike head with a
    single eye set in the center of the forehead. In place of a tongue, its long
    throat contains a slobbering mass of tentacles that twist and squirm
    grotesquely whenever the creature extends them.
  - >-
    A typical snallygaster measures 9 feet from the tip of its tail to the point
    of its beak, with a wingspan of 15 feet and a weight of approximately 200
    pounds. The snallygaster is an ambush predator, attacking its prey from
    above. Once it spots a potential victim, it dives toward its unsuspecting
    foe, using the fall to build up momentum. Once its foe lies dead or
    unconscious, the snallygaster uses its tonguelike tentacles to slurp up the
    victim's blood. The only thing a snallygaster craves more than blood is
    alcohol, and it spends much of each autumn scouring its territory for
    fermenting fruit, on which it gorges itself until thoroughly inebriated.
    Intoxicated snallygasters are extremely aggressive. Snallygasters prefer to
    nest in wooded, mountainous regions. They are primarily active during the
    day, which they spend searching for food or scaring off rivals. Whether or
    not a female snallygaster finds a mate, it lays one to two eggs per year.
