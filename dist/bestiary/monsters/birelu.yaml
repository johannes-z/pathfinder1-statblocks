Description_Visual: >-
  This figure seems caught at the moment of transformation between human and
  animal. Though its bearded face seems like a man's, its head is crowned with a
  rack of antlers, and its hunched body is covered in patches of sleek black
  fur.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Force of Nature (Su)
    description: >-
      A birelu channels the raw power of nature into its attacks. Its natural
      attacks are considered to have the ghost touch special ability, and each
      of its natural attacks deals an additional 2d6 points of force damage.
      This damage is doubled when a birelu makes a powerful charge.
  - name: Spirit Walk (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round as a standard action, a birelu can merge itself with a
      single humanoid or animal. This ability is similar to the magic jar spell
      (caster level 13th), except it doesn't require a receptacle. To use this
      ability, the birelu must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist
      the attack with a successful DC 20 Will save. A creature that successfully
      saves is immune to the same birelu's spirit walk ability for 24 hours. The
      save DC is Charisma-based. Additionally, a creature affected by this
      ability undergoes a physical transformation, growing either more beastlike
      or more humanlike, depending on its original form. A humanoid affected by
      this ability is affected as by greater animal aspectUC. The birelu chooses
      the aspect gained from this effect. This aspect can't be changed, though
      the birelu can select a new aspect if it merges with the same creature
      again at a later time. An animal affected by the spirit walk ability is
      affected as by anthropomorphic animalUM. Either effect lasts for as long
      as the creature remains possessed by the birelu, ending once the birelu
      leaves the creature's body.
Description:
  - >-
    In ages past, humans didn't live apart from nature as they do now. They had
    no cities, no farms, and no metal tools. In this primitive time, humans
    lived as beasts, hunting and foraging in the savage wild, living and dying
    by the cruel whims of nature. To these early humans, a successful hunt
    sometimes meant the difference between the life of the tribe and utter
    extinction. For this reason, the land and the animals who lived on it
    commanded great respect among the tribes. The environment represented more
    than just food or clothing or territory; it was an ally, an enemy, or even a
    god unto itself.
  - >-
    There was need in those days for people who could pass from the physical
    world and into the world of the spirits, where they could intercede with the
    spirits of the land and the animals to ensure the tribe's survival. From
    this need came the birelus, manifestations of humankind's desire to bridge
    the boundary between humans and nature. These ancient beings served as
    guardians and travelers of the paths between worlds.
  - >-
    A birelu seems to both stand upright and walk upon all fours at the same
    time, its form shifting and flowing incomprehensibly between the two poses.
    Even while partially hunched in this manner, a birelu stands over 7 feet
    tall when in its natural state.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Birelus are ancient beings, having existed since time immemorial. It may be
    that they were born at the very dawn of time, champions of a unity between
    humankind and nature that would not exist on the Material Plane for eons
    hence, and simply waited to intrude upon the world when it was ready for
    them. More likely, they owe their existence to humankind itself, springing
    to life as the manifestation of ideas held sacred by the early mortal races.
    Whatever the case, birelus came to Golarion when the mortal races were still
    young. In those primordial times, they acted as guardians and guides,
    teaching the first mortal shamans how to cross the boundaries
  - >-
    between the physical world and the spirit world, and bringing terrible
    destruction upon those who violated that sacred boundary. These early
    birelus sought to guide humanity, to groom its growth in harmony with nature
    as a way to restrict the destructive tendencies of civilization. Despite
    these efforts, humanity marched forward through time to establish cities,
    discover arcane magic, and usher in the destruction that the early birelus
    had attempted to hinder.
  - >-
    As outsiders, birelus don't need to eat or drink to survive, though they
    take great pleasure in hunting and feeding on wild prey. Most often they
    hunt while possessing the body of an animal, usually the apex predator of
    the local environment. Occasionally, a birelu stalks its prey in the
    possessed body of a humanoid, though typically this is done to honor the
    humanoid host. As much as they delight in such behavior, birelus never
    over-hunt an area, and they seem to have an innate sense about the state of
    the local Ecology.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Birelus have no set habitat, nor do they hold territory, preferring instead
    to wander the wild places of the world. Birelus don't often intrude upon
    inhabited areas, though when they do, the results are often disastrous. They
    find the trappings of civilized life distasteful, even blasphemous, and
    focus their attentions on destroying the objects of their ire. Often they
    accomplish this by possessing people and turning them against their own
    homes and their fellow citizens. Birelus can sometimes be reasoned with and
    convinced to depart in peace, but this is rare, as their attacks are often
    confused for the actions of lycanthropes, and are met with violence rather
    than diplomacy by mortal humanoids.
  - >-
    For the most part, birelus are solitary creatures. They don't scorn the
    company of their own kind, but neither do they delight in it or seek it out.
    Birelus who meet in passing are more likely to ignore each other than to
    interact in any meaningful way. Some have speculated that there may in fact
    be only one birelu, and that those specimens encountered on Golarion emanate
    from it or serve as its avatars.
  - >-
    A birelu's attentions are drawn to animals more often than to any other kind
    of creature, earning them the title "spirits of the beasts" in some
    cultures. Birelus seem to delight in possessing animals and using their
    bodies to explore and interact with the world. Upon entering new territory,
    a birelu uses its call animal spell-like ability to draw in
  - >-
    potential hosts, choosing the strongest and fastest of the native creatures
    to inhabit. Birelus are very protective of their wild animal hosts, and they
    abandon a creature's body if the animal is at grave risk rather than
    fighting to the host's death. Domesticated animals-or those serving as
    animal companions to the birelu's enemies- don't receive the same
    consideration.
  - >-
    Birelus' interactions with humanoids are more complicated. Civilized peoples
    hold no interest to them, and in fact often earn their scorn. Birelus react
    with hostility toward those who openly bear the signs of civilization, such
    as worked metal or agricultural tools. A birelu's attitude is much softer
    toward less civilized humanoids. Primitive tribes of hunter-gatherers and
    those who shun the cities of the world and live in communion with nature are
    often able to make peaceful contact with a birelu. In return, the birelu
    might draw in prey animals to feed the tribe, or guide them to more fertile
    lands in times of scarcity. It may even join the tribe's warriors in combat
    against their enemies, leaping from warrior to warrior in order to grant
    them the benefits of greater animal aspect.
