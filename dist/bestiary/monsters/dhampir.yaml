    description: >-
      A dhampir takes no penalties from energy draining effects, though he can
      still be killed if he accrues more negative levels then he has Hit Dice.
      After 24 hours, any negative levels a dhampir takes are removed without
      the need for an additional saving throw.
Description:
  - >-
    Cursed from birth, dhampirs result from the rare and unnatural union of
    vampires and humans. Although not driven to consume blood for survival as
    their undead progenitors are, dhampirs nonetheless know a lifelong desire
    for blood that nothing else can truly sate. Those who survive their early
    years face a life of fear and mistrust, their unnatural beauty and
    incredible ref lexes marking them as scions of the night just as surely as
    their sensitivity to light. Although polluted by undeath, dhampirs do grow
    old and die, aging at a rate similar to elves.
