SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mucus (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a flail snail can excrete a trail of mucus that covers
      its space and lasts for 10 minutes. This mucus comes in two types: slimy
      and sticky. A character who attempts to move through an area covered in
      slippery mucus must make a DC 14 Reflex save each round or fall prone.
      Sticky mucus transforms squares into difficult terrain. Only one type of
      mucus can be in effect at a time in any one square. Flail snails can move
      through either type of slime with ease. A square of mucus exposed to a
      fire source dries and reverts to normal. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Retraction (Ex)
    description: >-
      A flail snail can pull its fleshy parts into its shell as a swift action,
      increasing its natural armor bonus by +6, but it cannot move or attack
      while retracted. It can return to normal as a free action.
  - name: Slime Rope (Ex)
    description: >-
      A flail snail can turn its mucus into a ropelike strand up to 60 feet
      long, and can use this rope to hang itself and up to 1,000 extra pounds
      from the ceiling indefinitely, or to lower itself safely at a speed of 20
      feet per round. It can climb back up this rope at a speed of 10 feet per
      round. Once the snail breaks contact with the rope, the slime decomposes
      in 1d4 rounds. While the slime rope exists, other creatures can climb the
      rope with a DC 20 Climb check.
  - name: Suction (Ex)
    description: >-
      A flail snail's foot adheres to surfaces so well that its 10-foot climb
      speed applies even to perfectly sheer surfaces and ceilings, with no
      chance of the flail snail falling off unless it is actively pinned and
      peeled away as part of a grapple.
  - name: Warp Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      Anytime a spell targets a flail snail, there is an 80% chance that it
      produces a random effect instead of affecting the snail. Only spells that
      directly target the flail snail are warped; area effect spells are not
      affected. If a spell is warped, roll 1d10 and consult the following table.
      1-3 Spell misfires. For the next 1d4 rounds, the caster must make a DC 15
      concentration check to successfully cast spells. 4-6 Spell misfires. The
      creature nearest the flail snail is affected as if the spell had been cast
      on it instead. 7-9 Spell fails. Nothing happens. 10 Spell rebounds on
      caster (as spell turning).
Description:
  - >-
    Flail snails are intelligent gastropods that subsist on fungus, mold, and
    vermin, though they may attack larger creatures in self-defense. Known for
    their magic-warping shells and club-like tentacles, flail snails roam slowly
    through subterranean caverns writing great epics in their slime trails.
