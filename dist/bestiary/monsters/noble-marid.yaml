Description:
  - >-
    Marids are genies from the Plane of Water. The most powerful of all the
    genie races, they are said to possess the strength of the ocean's currents
    and teeth made of pearl. A marid stands about 16 feet tall and weighs nearly
    2,500 pounds. The marids are perhaps the most unpredictable and capricious
    of the genies, a quality that the others (particularly shaitans) find to be
    both aggravating and embarrassing to the entire genie culture. Many marids
    become dancers, storytellers, performers, or other types of artists, and
    often travel to the Material Plane in disguise to seek out new audiences.
