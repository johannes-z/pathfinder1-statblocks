    description: >-
      A gecko's feet allow it to climb virtually any surface, no matter how
      slick or sheer. In effect, geckos are treated as constantly being under a
      natural version of the spell spider climb.
Description:
  - >-
    These lizards are mostly docile and shy away from attacking creatures larger
    than a cat or dog. Despite their shyness, they are ultimately curious
    creatures, and often approach bigger creatures simply to investigate. Of
    course, a giant gecko is more than capable of defending itself, biting
    creatures that react violently to the lizard when fleeing is not an option.
  - >-
    Some humanoids train giant geckos as bestial guardians. Smaller humanoids
    (in particular, goblins) can even use the creatures as mounts, taking
    advantage of their superior climbing skills to attack from seemingly
    impossible positions and angles. A giant gecko measures 8 feet from nose to
    tail and weighs 120 pounds. Coloration among giant geckos can vary wildly,
    though most are some shade of green.
