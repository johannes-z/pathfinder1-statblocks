      A slime mold looks like a normal patch of fungus when at rest. It takes a
      DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks
      in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of
      Perception to notice the ooze. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice the
      subterranean version.

      A slime mold can wrap a creature of up to one size smaller in its body as
      a standard action. If a slime mold succeeds a Combat Maneuver check to
      grapple an opponent, it establishes a hold and deals slam damage each
      round the hold is maintained. Attacks that hit an engulfing slime mold
      deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.
Description:
  - >-
    Slime molds are found in forests, swamps, and underground; any place natural
    fungi and mold grows. A slime mold lies dormant among the growths soaking
    nutrients from them, and waiting for living creatures to wander too close to
    it.
  - >-
    Slime molds are often mistaken for plant creatures because their forms are
    completely covered with molds, fungi, and in particular mushrooms of varying
    hues, shapes, and sizes. This gives the monster the appearance of an
    undulating mass of plant matter when actuality they are a rare form of
    non-acidic ooze. Something in the creature's protoplasmic substance causes
    mushrooms, molds, mosses, and other fungal plants to take root and grow on
    its surface in a symbiotic relationship.
  - >-
    A slime mold attacks from surprise anytime it detects a living creature
    within 10 feet of it. It lashes out with a pseudopod and then attempts to
    wrap its body around the victim. The slime mold relies on its natural
    ability to appear as a patch of mushrooms to foil potential prey. Slime
    molds inflict an opponent with fungal rot if they hit with a slam attack.
  - >-
    Fungal rot causes a darkening of the skin and small patches of fungus and
    mold to sprout at random locations on the victim's body.
