SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Terminal Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Every round, any creature within 50 feet of a memitim that has -1 or fewer
      hit points but is stable must succeed at a DC 23 Will saving throw or be
      affected by the spell bleed. Any dying creature within range of this aura
      does not receive a Constitution check to stabilize, but can still be
      healed as normal-though it may be affected by bleed in subsequent rounds
      if it is not restored to 0 or more hit points. Any creatures with fast
      healing or regeneration must also succeed at a DC 23 Will save every round
      or that ability does not function for 1 round. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Soldiers know memitims as the angels of death, the black-winged specters
    whose own ominous hosts compose a third impartial legion fielded in the
    clouds above the bloodiest battlegrounds. As combatants shed their mortal
    forms in droves, memitims ready their weapons, prepared to drive back all
    manner of monstrous, soul-hungry scavengers that lurk just beyond the veil
    of death. While daemons, night hags, and undead number among their most
    persistent foes, memitims strike against any who would deny the dead passage
    into the River of Souls or who would cut a life short to harvest its
    essence. While most memitims impartially preside over bloodshed and
    massacres, their full wrath manifests against any who would cut numerous
    lives short in unnatural pursuit of their souls.
