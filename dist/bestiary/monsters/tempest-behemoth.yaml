Description_Visual: >-
  Three pairs of wings beat rhythmically, churning up hurricane-force winds
  around this vast, birdlike monstrosity.
Group: Behemoth
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 3
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gale (Su)
    description: >-
      A tempest behemoth can generate winds of up to hurricane force as a free
      action, blowing in as many as three different directions at once. The
      winds blow either away from or directly toward the behemoth in a
      30-foot-wide path that extends for 1,000 feet.
  - name: Scales (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tempest behemoth can hurl up to six scales from its wings (range
      increment 100 feet) as a standard action.
  - name: Thunderbolt (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action once every 1d4 rounds, a behemoth can shoot a bolt of
      lightning that deals 15d6 points of electricity damage and 15d6 points of
      sonic damage, and that causes permanent deafness in a 200-foot line. A DC
      34 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the deafness. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Riding the winds on a triple set of wings, tempest behemoths fly above all,
    death riding in their shadows. In battle, they snatch up foes only to cast
    them away from great heights, smash enemies with their wings, or hurl
    razor-edged scales at distant targets. A tempest behemoth's divine heritage
    wards its body, mind, and soul against harm. Only the most powerful magic or
    attack can pierce its defenses. Serene in their immortality, tempest
    behemoths fear no other being.
  - >-
    As living forces of divine retribution, tempest behemoths are sent forth
    into the world to raze far-f lung cities, ravage towns with mighty storms,
    level remote mountain temples, and tear apart siege fortresses impregnable
    from the ground.
  - >-
    The advent of a tempest behemoth is generally presaged by foul weather and
    terrific storms that drive flocks of birds before their headwinds. The day
    before the behemoth arrives, the storms suddenly abate-ironically
    encouraging victims to emerge into the open just as the behemoth strikes.
