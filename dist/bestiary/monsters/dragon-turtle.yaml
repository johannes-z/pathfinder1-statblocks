      Cloud of steam 20 feet high, 25 feet wide, and 50 feet long, once every
      1d4 rounds, damage 12d6 fire, Reflex DC 20 half; effective both on the
      surface and underwater. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Capsize (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dragon turtle can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a
      charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the
      result of the boat captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is
      higher. For each size category larger than the dragon turtle's size, it
      takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.
Description:
  - >-
    Dragon turtles make their homes in both salt and fresh water, where they
    rank among the biggest threats to sailors and those who travel by ship
    through the waterways of the world. Skilled mariners know the territory
    dragon turtles claim and frequently make offerings of gold and magic for
    safe passage or avoid the area entirely. For its part, a dragon turtle
    quickly grows to appreciate and even expect such tithes and gifts, and a
    dragon turtle that expects gifts but is ignored is a dangerous foe indeed.

    A dragon turtle's shell varies in color between individuals. Some have dull
    shells of brown and rust red, while others have carapaces of a deep
    green-blue color with silver highlights across the rocky ridges. The
    coloration of the head, tail, and legs is slightly paler than the shell and
    contains golden streaks along the crest and spines.
  - >-
    Dragon turtles claim vast territories in the open seas, encompassing regions
    often in excess of 50 square miles.
  - >-
    Here, these dangerous beasts capsize ships that fail to respect their
    territories, adding the sunken wrecks and their valuable cargoes to their
    lairs. Dragon turtles generally make their homes in deep caves only
    accessible through the water, and often decorate their lairs not only with
    the wealth seized from ships they've sunk, but the wrecks of these
    unfortunate ships themselves. Their territorial natures and fondness for
    these types of lairs put them in direct conf lict with other undersea races
    such as merfolk and sahuagin.
  - >-
    Large fish, such as tuna, sturgeons, and even sharks, rank among dragon
    turtles' favorite foods, but being omnivores, they also sometimes feed on
    large undersea fields of seaweed. They certainly aren't above supplementing
    their diets with the passengers of ships they sink, although such feeding is
    not borne of any intrinsic evil or cruelty. Dragon turtles possess shells 15
    feet in diameter, with their appendages stretching a few feet further, and
    measure over 25 feet long from the tip of their noses to the ends of their
    powerful tails.
