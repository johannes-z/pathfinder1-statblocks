SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a fjord linnorm can expel a
      120-foot line of icy fluid, dealing 16d8 points of cold damage to all
      creatures struck (Reflex DC 27 for half damage). The freezing liquid
      quickly hardens to sheets of ice, causing any creature that takes damage
      to move at only half its normal speed for 1d4 rounds. A DC 27 Strength
      check made as a full-round action allows a character to break free of the
      ice before this duration expires. The save DC and Strength check DC are
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Death Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      Curse of Drowning: save Will DC 26; effect creature can never gain the
      benefit of water breathing, and if it possesses this ability, loses it as
      long as it suffers the curse. In addition, the creature can hold its
      breath only half as long as normal, and whenever the cursed creature holds
      its breath, it functions as if sickened.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 27; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 3d6
      cold damage and 1d6 Con drain; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Description:
  - >-
    Fjord linnorms dwell among the deep waters that grace northern coastlines
    where fingers of land create complex rivulets, venturing out to sea to feed
    on sharks and whales when they cannot find settlements or traveling caravans
    to savage. As their favored haunts often overlap with coastal trade routes,
    regions known to be within the territory of a fjord linnorm are often
    avoided by ships. Fjord linnorms are not particularly adept at capsizing
    ships, as are some other large aquatic monsters, but one might argue that
    such tactics are unnecessary for a creature the size and power of a fjord
    linnorm in the first place.
  - >-
    Both the curse and poison of a fjord linnorm are extremely dangerous for
    those who frequent the waterways of the north. The fjord linnorm's curse is
    particularly devastating to aquatic creatures, and such beings are careful
    to avoid any possible conflict with such linnorms.
  - A fjord linnorm is 60 feet long and weighs just over 10,000 pounds.
