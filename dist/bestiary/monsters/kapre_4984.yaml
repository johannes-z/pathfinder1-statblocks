    description: >-
      A kapre can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns,
      briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its normal speed and
      without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns,
      briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede
      motion still affect it.
Description:
  - >-
    Kapres are peaceful forest- and mountain-dwelling creatures that make their
    homes in the dense, thick treetops of large trees. If threatened or
    provoked, however, kapres do not hesitate to fight (especially if their lair
    or young are threatened). They exist on a diet of plants, small forest game,
    and nuts and berries. They are adept hunters and fishermen and prefer
    rabbit, deer, and boar above all other meats. Though they appear to some to
    be primitive savages, kapres do not eat humanoids and have no love for human
    flesh. (Rumors speak of a degenerative race of kapres who do in fact enjoy
    the taste of flesh; these rumors are believed to be stories told by other
    humanoid races to their children in order to keep them from wandering into
    the forests alone.)
  - >-
    Kapres stand about 7 feet tall with dark hair and dark skin. Clothes are
    usually well maintained and match the color of their surroundings. Kapres
    live for up to 250 years.
  - >-
    In battle, a kapre uses its confusion and then attacks with a large wooden
    club, or if unarmed, slashes with its claws. It seeks to drive off its foes
    rather than kill them if possible. If a battle goes against a kapre, it
    attempts to take to the trees and flee. If its homeland, mate, or young are
    threatened however, it fights to the death. Some kapre also wear magical
    belts that grant them the ability of invisibility.
