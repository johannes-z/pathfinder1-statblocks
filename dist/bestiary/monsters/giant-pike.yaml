      If a giant pike surprises an opponent, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to
      its attack roll in that round of combat.
Description:
  - >-
    Giant pikes are highly aggressive predators swimming the waters of
    freshwater lakes and rivers, attacking any living, moving creatures that
    come nearby. Giant pikes are highly adaptable and can be found in the
    coldest to the warmest waters. A saltwater variety exists and can be found
    in inland seas and saltwater lakes and rivers.
  - >-
    Giant pikes, like their smaller counterparts, are voracious and often attack
    prey much larger than themselves. Their diet consists mainly of soft-finned
    fish, trout, perch, frogs, mice, ducks, birds, and small humanoids. Larger
    prey includes humanoids, other giant fish, deer, and sheep or goats. Giant
    pikes have no qualms about eating those of their own kind, especially when
    food is scarce.
  - >-
    The giant pike averages about nine feet long and can grow to a length of 20
    feet. Its coloration varies from dark green to brown and its body is covered
    in lighter colored spots. It has a single dorsal fin and a white or
    cream-colored underbelly.
  - >-
    The giant pike hides in weeds, behind rocks, or some other such cover,
    waiting for potential prey to wander nearby. It coils its body into an "S"
    position, and when prey passes by, strikes with blinding speed, biting with
    its sharp teeth. If the pike gets a hold on prey smaller than itself, it
    swallows it.
