Description_Visual: >-
  Floating before you is a horrid, shriveled human fetus nested within a
  translucent sphere of dark energy. Its jet-black eyes glitter with intensity
  as it twitches and spasms slightly, as if in great pain.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      As a final cruel jest to the individual that puts a mordnaissant out of
      its misery, the slayer must make a DC 20 Will save or suffer from a
      terrible curse that reduces all subsequent experience points awarded by
      50%. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Lash of Fury (Su)
    description: >-
      The mordnaissant can lash out with its negative energy powers and directly
      attack the vitality of living creatures, in the form of a twisting stream
      of black energy. The mordnaissant must make a ranged touch attack against
      its target as an attack action. If the ray hits, the victim must make a DC
      22 Fortitude save for half damage or duration, depending on the specific
      effect chosen by the mordnaissant. The save DC is Charisma-based. The lash
      of fury has a range of 30 ft. with no range increment. The mordnaissant
      can pick from three possible lashes; it must make its choice prior to
      rolling the attack. The three options are: whip the flesh (as inflict
      moderate wounds, 2d8+9 damage), whip the mind (1d4 points of Intelligence
      damage), or whip the soul (stun 1d4+1 rounds). A critical hit doubles the
      damage rolled or the duration, in the case of whip the soul.
  - name: Lifesense (Su)
    description: >-
      A mordnaissant notices and locates living creatures within 60 ft., just as
      if it possessed the blindsight ability.
  - name: Pain Wail (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, the mordnaissant can produce a terrible wailing sound
      that reflects the pain it experiences every moment of its existence. All
      living creatures within 20 ft. must make a DC 20 Will save or be dazed for
      one round. For every 20 points of damage the mordnaissant takes, the save
      DC increases by +1.
  - name: Shield of Agony (Su)
    description: >-
      A mordnaissant harnesses the pain of its existence to shield it. It adds
      its Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to its AC and CMD.
Description:
  - >-
    Occasionally when a gravid woman dies violently in a place infused with
    unholy or negative energies, the unborn child within her does not perish,
    but instead continues to grow, vitalized by dark power, until it is capable
    of clawing its way free from its dead mother. This horrible creature, known
    as a mordnaissant, lives an existence of eternal pain, loneliness and
    suffering, relived only by its ability to inflict harm on those around it.
    Mordnaissants avoid bright light if they can, though they suffer no ill
    effects from it.
