Description:
  - >-
    Ice trolls are somewhat smaller than normal trolls, but they possess greater
    intelligence and cunning and are just as voraciously hungry. They display
    the typical hunched posture of trolls, combined with long arms tipped with
    sharp claws and the distinctive troll underbite. Like normal trolls, ice
    trolls possess amazing regenerative powers that enable them to recover from
    almost any wound. Unlike most trolls, ice trolls often use weapons in
    battle, but in the heat of combat, they often cast aside weapons in favor of
    their rending claws. An ice troll stands about 10 feet tall and weighs up to
    900 pounds.

    Because of their greater intellects, ice trolls sometimes work as
    mercenaries, and often serve as soldiers in monstrous armies. They
    frequently ally with frost giants, and may even be found among northern
    barbarian tribes, as long as they are well fed and well paid.
  - >-
    Ice trolls enjoy the taste of human flesh, and those not working with humans
    frequently set traps near civilized areas to catch their favorite prey. They
    will also raid isolated settlements for food, often bringing captured humans
    back to their icy lairs, where the unfortunate victims are caged and
    fattened up before finally being devoured by the voracious trolls.
  - >-
    In combat, ice trolls are more cautious than normal trolls. They do not
    normally rush headlong into battle, instead focusing on weaker foes or those
    bearing fire. They do not hesitate to attack opponents armed with fire, but
    work together to defeat such enemies before they can bring their dangerous
    weapons to bear.
  - >-
    Ice troll society is more patriarchal than normal troll society, and while
    males may form gangs to hunt or raid, most ice trolls live in small family
    groups comprised of a male, a female, and their offspring.
