SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Trained (Ex)
    description: >-
      An einherji is proficient with all armor. Armor never impacts an
      einherji's speed, nor does an einherji take armor check penalties on Ride
      checks.
  - name: Challenge of Single Combat (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an einherji can choose a single target within sight
      to challenge by attempting an Intimidate check to demoralize that
      creature. If the check succeeds, the target is shaken and the einherji
      gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against that target. For
      the duration of the challenge, the einherji must attack that target, and
      takes a -2 penalty to its AC, except against attacks made by the target.
      The challenge (and the shaken condition) remains in effect until the
      target successfully attacks the einherji in melee combat, the target is
      dead or unconscious, or the combat ends.
  - name: Thirst for Battle (Su)
    description: >-
      As long as an einherji is in battle (i.e., each round it makes an attack
      roll), it gains fast healing 5. An einherji loses this ability outside of
      combat or if knocked unconscious.
Description:
  - >-
    Some warriors who die glorious deaths in battle find that there is a call
    for their skill and prowess even after death. Chosen by valkyries
    (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 277) from among the slain on the battlefield,
    they become einherjar, outsiders who fight for the gods and other powerful
    extraplanar beings in battles across the multiverse. Like valkyries,
    einherjar can serve a variety of deities, not just gods of war, conflict,
    and valor, but also those of love, beauty, life, and others not thought of
    as combative. Einherjar pride themselves on prowess in battle, and forever
    seek to prove themselves by challenging worthy foes. Einherjar can be either
    male or female, and normally appear as muscled, battle-hardened humans,
    dwarves, or elves. A typical einherji stands 7 feet tall and weighs around
    300 pounds.
