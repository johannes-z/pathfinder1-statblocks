SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Wood (Ex)
    description: >-
      A woodwose is unaffected by wooden weapons (such as clubs or
      quarterstaffs) and spells or effects that generate or use wood-type
      effects (such as a wall of thorns for example). Weapons with damaging
      parts that are primarily metal (or some other material) such as arrows,
      spears, and so on, damage a woodwose normally.
  - name: Plant Passivism (Ex)
    description: >-
      No plant creatures willingly attack a woodwose. They can be forced to do
      so through magical means however. If attacked by a woodwose or one of its
      allies, the effect is broken and the plant creature can attack the
      woodwose normally.
  - name: Plantsense (Ex)
    description: >-
      A woodwose can automatically sense the location of anything within 60 feet
      that is in contact with vegetation. Spells A woodwose casts spells as a
      9th-level druid.
  - name: Spines (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a woodwose can cause sharpened wooden spines to protrude
      from its body. Any creature in contact with the woodwose or grappling with
      it takes 1d6 points of piercing damage each round it remains in contact
      with the woodwose. In addition, any creature attacking a woodwose with
      natural weapons or unarmed attacks takes the same 1d6 points of damage.
Description:
  - The woodwose or green men are wicked male counterparts of the dryad.
  - >-
    Guardians and protectors of forests and woodlands, woodwose have a cruel
    streak, feeling it better to bury an intruder amongst the trees than ever
    let them leave their forested sanctuaries again. Due to their malign nature,
    woodwoses do not associate with dryads, most sprites, or other benign
    woodland creatures. They do however sometimes form bonds and alliances with
    other evil fey creatures (such as redcaps and quicklings).
  - >-
    Woodwoses have great magical powers like those of a druid, whom they seek to
    thwart and destroy when given the opportunity.
  - >-
    A woodwose stands 5 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds. Its skin is dark
    brown and rough and course to the touch. Its hair is dark greenishbrown.
  - A woodwose's eyes are deep chestnut brown.
  - >-
    Woodwoses primarily fight using spells and spell-like abilities. In melee
    combat they lash out with powerful slam attacks or use thick wooden clubs
    and cause great spines to sprout from their body after the manner of a
    porcupine.
