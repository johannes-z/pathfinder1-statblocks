SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Spit Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a dromosphinx can spit a line of highly caustic
      saliva at a single target within 20 feet. The target takes 6d6 points of
      acid damage. A successful DC 18 Reflex save reduces the damage by half.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Some of the strongest and smartest of the sphinxes, dromosphinxes are
    treacherous and merciless, caring little for anything and anyone. All
    dromosphinxes are male. Dromosphinxes detest androsphinxes and attack them
    on sight. Unlike the smaller and weaker hieracosphinxes, dromosphinxes can
    generally hold their own against androsphinxes. They are indifferent against
    the other sphinxes and often bully the smaller hieracosphinxes into serving
    them for a period of time.
  - >-
    Dromosphinxes are highly territorial and do not take intrusions lightly.
    Trespassers are quickly disposed of when encountered. Since dromosphinxes
    love riddles, when intelligent creatures are encountered, they often present
    them with a riddle. If the targets answer incorrectly or cannot answer,
    dromosphinxes attack and attempt to devour the victims. Those answering the
    riddle correctly are allowed to continue on their way, much to the
    dromosphinx's dismay.
  - >-
    When combat begins, a dromosphinx spits its acid at the closest foe. It next
    pounces on the next closest foe, and disperses its opponents with a
    combination of claws, bites, and acid. During combat, it often takes to the
    air and uses a series of diving attacks to rid itself of its opponents while
    keeping them off balance.
