Description:
  - >-
    Wiry and quick, these slime green orcs have long ears, smallish tusks, and
    coyote like eyes. They shoot first and eat later. Greenskins are a wicked
    orcish species of arboreal hunters. More stealthy and agile than their
    common cousins they are slighter of build but suffer no penalties from
    daylight or bright light. They are generally open and friendly to other evil
    humanoid races and often set up trade routes with said creatures. They make
    their homes among the dense foliage of the forest building their wooden huts
    from the trees and branches. Some tribes even build their entire village
    among the treetops (as a defense measure against land-based adversaries).
    Greenskin orcs stand about 6 feet tall. Females are slightly smaller. Hair
    color is always black or greenish-black. Eye color varies, but is usually
    dark brown, dark green, or occasionally deep, rich blue. Greenskins are
    highly proficient in the use stealth and surprise, attacking with their
    ranged weapons when an enemy is sighted. They seek to disable and weaken
    foes with arrows before closing to finish the job with their wicked
    longswords. Greenskin Orc Society Greenskins tend to get along well with
    most other species of orcs being smart enough to take orders and wise enough
    to keep their mouths shut. They often serve roles in mixed tribes as scouts
    and skirmishers. Greenskins are mortal enemies of elves and the bane of fey
    and enchanted woodland creatures. They torture such beings mercilessly
    should they manage to take one alive. Despite their skill with the longbow,
    greenskin warriors are equally proficient with the longsword and hunting
    knife. Greenskins tend to hunt in packs, using their scent ability to track
    their quarry. Their hunting packs are competitive with one another, each
    member seeking to be the one to make the kill. Greenskins are likely to have
    1d2 trained worgs among them. Greenskin lairs often have as many as two
    dozen of these foul creatures living and sleeping amongst their masters
    filthy sleeping rags. Greenskin tribes are known to hire themselves out to
    civilized masters as scouts and even irregular and regular missile units.
    They are also likely to serve evil druids and despotic ranger lords.
    Greenskin Orc Characters Greenskin leaders tend to be rangers or druids.
