Description:
  - >-
    Taer are shaggy, primitive, naked humanoids that may be related to the yeti.
    They resemble prehistoric humans but are more bestial and apelike. Their fur
    is coated with an oily, fatty substance excreted through the pores, which
    protects them from cold. Taer can see clearly even in heavy snowstorms due
    to a second transparent eyelid that protects the eye from blowing winds and
    heavy snow. Taer never wear clothing, although they do sometimes wear
    necklaces and bracelets of tooth and horn. Taer do not have a formal
    language as such; they communicate with one another through grunts, hooting,
    and yelling, as well as a body language similar to that of apes. Taer attack
    with their fists and bite, but occasionally use stone spears in combat. They
    are fierce creatures and very territorial, attacking any living creature
    that wanders into the area. Taer use their knowledge of the land to their
    advantage during combat by creating avalanches, burrowing under snow and
    attacking from surprise, and using snow-covered pits to trap their prey.
    They prefer to drive intruders off rather than kill them. Taer Society Taers
    are nomadic creatures that band together in clans for protection, hunting,
    and social reasons. During the day, adults hunt for food, which consists of
    fruits, berries, nuts, insects, and game (goat, sheep, rodents, and the
    like). Though they do eat meat, taer do not hunt or eat humans or humanoids.
    Taer are extremely superstitious and fear metal and clothing and those that
    use and wear them. No taer ever wields or wears items of cloth or metal.
    Taer clans worship a snow-god to whom they offer sacrifices for protection
    and guidance. Each clan has a large stone idol of this snow god that is
    often located in the very heart of the clan or near the clan leader's cave.
