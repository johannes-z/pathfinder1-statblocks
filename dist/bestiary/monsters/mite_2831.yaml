SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hatred (Ex)
    description: >-
      Mites receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls against creatures with the dwarf
      or gnome subtype due to special training against these hated foes.
  - name: Vermin Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy, save that a mite can
      only use this ability on vermin. A mite gains a +4 racial bonus on this
      check. Vermin are normally mindless, but this empathic communication
      imparts on them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing mites to
      train Medium vermin and use them as mounts. Vermin empathy treats swarms
      as if they were one creature possessing a single mind-a mite can thus use
      this ability to influence and direct the actions of swarms with relative
      ease.
Description:
  - >-
    Descended from even smaller fey, the mites are among the most pitiful and
    craven dwellers of the dark. Hideously ugly, even goblins have been known to
    mock mites for their homely appearances-mockery most mites take to heart and
    nurture for weeks, months, or even years in their tiny homes until their
    distress and anger finally overcome their natural cowardice and impel them
    forth on short-lived bouts of bloody vengeance from the doubtful safety of a
    spider's back. Mites, once closer to the strange realm of the fey, have
    grown larger and stockier after countless generations spent on the Material
    Plane. Yet still, their stature places them at the bottom of the pile in the
    dangerous caverns in which they live. Their traditional enemies are dwarves
    and gnomes, particularly the svirfneblin of the deep underground caves. The
    one thing that gives them a significant edge over an enemy in a fight is
    their natural ability to empathize with normally mindless vermin-mites are
    particularly fond of spiders, centipedes, and cave fishers, and a mite
    colony usually has a few of these far more dangerous monsters on hand to
    defend the group. A mite is 2 feet tall and weighs 25 pounds. Trickery and
    surprise are the forte of the mite. They avoid direct melee with opponents,
    preferring to attack from ambush. Often, the first telltale signs that mites
    may be nearby is the plethora of traps, snares, and tripwires encountered.
    Mites prefer to attack those they feel they can overpower or dispose of
    quickly. Extremely tough or powerful opponents are ignored and left to pass
    through unabated or swarmed by a massive number of mites. Though considered
    unintelligent and stupid by other races, there is a sort of weird
    cooperation and strategy to mite tactics (that only mites can understand). A
    typical mite ambush has the creatures digging narrow tunnels that parallel a
    dungeon's corridors. When a foe traverses these corridors, the mites burst
    from the walls and tunnels and strike quickly with their daggers. Opponents
    are rarely killed, but any knocked unconscious are relieved of coins,
    weapons, or any other item of value. If forced into melee, mites seek escape
    at the first possible opportunity. Mites attack with daggers and a bite in
    combat. Although they have lost the supernatural ability to tinker with
    magic items or mechanical objects possessed by their more sinister and
    dangerous gremlin kin, mites retain the ability to perform minor magical
    tricks, and often use these tricks to annoy their enemies. When faced with
    dangerous foes, a mite uses its doom ability to hex a foe. A mite's eyes
    bulge hideously open when it uses this spell-like ability. Mite Society
    Mites make their homes underground in deep, dark dungeons and caverns where
    they survive by stealing from those unfortunate enough to wander near their
    lair. A mite lair is often a large central room or cavern from which many
    small and winding tunnels lead. A mite lair is a filthy place littered with
    garbage and refuse. Cleanliness and sanitation are virtually unknown in a
    mite community. Mite young are almost never encountered, but a typical lair
    contains a number of noncombatant young equal to the number of adult mites.
