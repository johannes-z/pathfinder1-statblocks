SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When reduced to 0 hit points or less, a voltar explodes in a blinding
      flash of electricity that radiates outward and deals 5d6 points of
      electricity damage to everything within 30 feet. A DC 16 Reflex save
      reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Lightning Bolt (Su)
    description: A voltar's lightning bolt has a range of 100 feet.
  - name: Vulnerable to Water (Ex)
    description: >-
      A voltar submerged in enough water to cover its entire body is immediately
      reduced to 0 hit points and explodes just as if it had used its death
      throes ability.
Description:
  - >-
    Voltars are organic creatures semi-composed of lightning that hail from the
    Quasi-Elemental Plane of Lightning. Though rarely encountered on other
    planes, they do enjoy traveling to the Material Plane from time to time,
    journeying to the plane via lightning storms and riding the lightning bolts
    to the ground.
  - >-
    On the Material Plane, voltars make their lairs near civilized areas, but
    not close enough to draw attention to them. Most such lairs consist of
    well-hidden and camouflaged caves or caverns in dense forests or hilly
    areas. They enjoy watching natives of the Material Plane and often make
    forays into nearby civilized areas to observe the locals.
  - >-
    Voltars are nocturnal hunters, preferring to hunt during thunderstorms,
    rainstorms, and especially lightning storms. A voltar's diet consists
    primarily of whatever it can catch and kill supplemented with a mix of
    berries, nuts, and fruits.
  - >-
    A voltar appears as a milky-white slender and lithe humanoid standing about
    6-1/2 feet tall. Its body, armor, and weapon is covered in dancing and
    arcing crackling electricity of blue and white. Its eyes are white and empty
    (save for the small sparks of electricity that seem to play in them). Its
    head is long and rectangular and its mouth long and wide. No teeth seem to
    be present in its mouth.
  - >-
    A voltar speaks its own tongue consisting of clicks and guttural sounds. It
    seems to understand Common, but does not appear to be able to speak it.
  - >-
    A lone voltar does not attack if outnumbered (unless it is cornered and
    cannot escape). When more than one voltar is present, however, they often
    attack creatures that wander too close to their lair. In combat, a voltar
    attacks with its electrically-charged fists, weapon, or by hurling a bolt of
    lightning at an opponent.
