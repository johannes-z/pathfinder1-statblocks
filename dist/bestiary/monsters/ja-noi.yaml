    description: >-
      A ja noi is extremely disciplined and maintains its focus even in the
      midst of combat. Once per day as an immediate action, a ja noi may reroll
      a Will save.
Description:
  - >-
    A ja noi is an oni spirit that takes the form of a hobgoblin, and differs
    physically from the hobgoblins in a variety of ways, most notably its
    unearthly strength and distorted appearance. A ja noi's skin blazes a fiery
    red rather than a drab gray, and the oni bears prominent ridges on its brow
    and forehead.
  - >-
    Ja noi live to fight. While not as physically powerful as most oni, ja noi
    nonetheless have an insatiable thirst for combat that drives them to pursue
    the trials of battle
  - >-
    and bloodshed. The sensation of hot blood splattering on a ja noi's skin
    provokes an adrenaline rush that only fuels its lust for the kill. Its
    broad, tightly muscled physique and prowess in combat inspire awe within
    typical hobgoblins, who see the ja noi as a leader who ensures victory in
    their conquests.
  - >-
    Towering over the hobgoblins it resembles, a ja noi stands a little over 6
    feet tall and weighs about 220 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    All oni believe the Material Plane's inhabitants fail to take advantage of
    the wealth of sensations they have at their disposal. While most of these
    evil spirits inhabit shells and rise to power by working behind the scenes-
    manipulating others into doing most of their foul deeds for them-ja noi take
    a more direct approach, conquering and slaughtering any who would stand
    against them and their armies. Ja noi embrace the carnal joys of slaughter,
    and no situation is more pleasant to a ja noi than the heat of combat upon a
    war-ravaged battlef ield. These hardened oni often recognize the inevitable
    outcome of their warlike tendencies, knowing that death could always be just
    around the corner; this knowledge, however, only further stimulates their
    greed for sensation, inspiring them to embrace every fight, as they know it
    could be their last. A ja noi silences its mind and ignores everything else
    while on the battlef ield, reveling in the current moment and the sensations
    of combat: the crunch of bones beneath a worn club, the spray of dying foes'
    blood, and the scattered guts and heads of fallen brawlers.
  - >-
    Like other oni, ja noi possess the ability to change shape, and often use
    this ability to confuse enemies in the midst of battle, altering their
    appearances to look like allies, only to bash in an unsuspecting foe's head
    before the victim knows what's happened. This brutish trickery is usually
    the extent of a ja noi's guile, however, as the hobgoblin oni are hardly
    known for their cunning. Even in regard to tactics, ja noi usually implement
    only the basest plans of action, simply relying on their weaker minions to
    take the brunt of an opposing army's blow while they target the commanders,
    always seeking the most worthy challenger and forever striving for that
    feeling that comes just as one is fighting for one's life. The most powerful
    ja noi are exceptions to this rule, however, and tales tell of expert ja noi
    leaders who excel in both physical prowess and tactical wit. These
    commanders quickly reach the status of generals, and work alongside other
    oni to manipulate vast armies of soldiers, both humanoid and goblinoid.
  - >-
    Once they take physical form, ja noi rarely last more than a couple years on
    the Material Plane, their deadly lifestyle often a limiting factor in this
    regard. They either
  - >-
    die in battle or at the hands of mutinous troops or allies, minions who
    realize that they are merely pawns in the game of war that the ja noi is
    constantly playing. Thus, most of these oni practice their battle skills
    constantly against one another, their strongest hobgoblin followers, and
    their adroit adversaries, always fighting and becoming more powerful. While
    they care little for the arcane, ja noi hone some magical abilities in order
    to inf lict maximum damage on the battlefield, and a few even seek out
    magical items to bolster their strength.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Whereas many oni prefer to act alone and in secret, ja noi recognize the
    concept of strength in numbers, and understand that banding together is
    often a surer way to glorious victories than lone pursuits. The rare lone ja
    noi may seek out renowned heroes and martial senseis to challenge in
    one-on-one combat, but most of these creatures know the best way to
    demonstrate their prowess is in the midst of the chaotic battlefield in
    front of other oni, especially fellow ja noi. Often, when ja noi work
    together to bring carnage to the field of war, they keep track of each
    other's kills, ranking one another in terms of strength and skill. An
    individual who shows cowardice repeatedly or does not prove a useful ally
    swiftly meets the blade of a supposed comrade, as ja noi have little
    patience for weak accomplices.
  - >-
    Ja noi are seen as lowly and primal by other oni, but they possess immense
    amounts of authority among the lesser hobgoblins around them, and so they
    surround themselves with these minions, viewing them as useful fodder for
    the battles to come. During the fight, a ja noi's amateur hobgoblin warriors
    combat the masses of the opposing army, allowing the prideful oni to engage
    the commanders. Having found what they consider an ideal
  - >-
    militaristic race, ja noi prefer to use hobgoblins for their war campaigns
    if possible, though they settle for other soldiers if doing so clearly
    benefits the oni and they have the mortals' unquestioning loyalty. More
    often, a ja noi will employ non-hobgoblin minions to serve as slaves or some
    other form of chattel, putting them to work crafting armor and weapons or
    cleaning up during the aftermath of a successful battle.
  - >-
    In rare cases, more powerful oni ask ja noi to lead armies against
    particularly stubborn groups of opponents. Ja noi rarely refuse such
    requests, knowing that much blood will be shed in the ventures-and that
    denying the requests of stronger oni is a sure path to a quick death. Like
    all oni, ja noi despise and seek out kami, reveling in the destruction of
    minor spirits and hunting the more powerful individuals for the sheer
    challenge of it. Because of the strictures of the Laws of Golden Perfection,
    ja noi cannot directly slay kami, and so they work to direct their vicious
    hobgoblin armies to complete the task instead.
  - >-
    In extremely rare cases, when they have no campaigns to wage and no humanoid
    enemies to battle, ja noi simply disappear into the wilderness to fight the
    mightiest creatures they can find. Laying waste to big game such as bulettes
    and owlbears can distract a ja noi between large-scale battles, but it
    doesn't take long before the natural warrior quickly feels the lust for
    battle surge within it once again. Given too much time between skirmishes, a
    ja noi might turn its violent attention toward its followers, slaughtering
    entire hobgoblin tribes out of frustration and madness. Canny hobgoblins in
    service to a bloodthirsty ja noi are wise to find opposing groups for the
    oni to battle, that the resulting conf lict might temporarily sate the ja
    noi's incessant desire for war.
