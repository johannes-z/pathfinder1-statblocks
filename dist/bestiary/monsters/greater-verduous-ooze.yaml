  A pool of greenish muck, blossoming with weird vegetable-like growths and
  sap-seeping boils, twitches into unnatural motion as a pseudopod springs
  outward, dragging the entire grotesque mass forward with an ameboid life.

Description:
  - >-
    Verdurous oozes are animate masses of protoplasm of a sickly green hue. At
    rest, their flat bodies stand roughly 5 inches tall and can stretch out to a
    wide diameter, their surfaces blossoming into what look like thick tangles
    of mossy roots and gnarled vegetation as they lie still. Known to emit
    invisible but dangerous chemicals, these masses of slinking muck cause
    nearby plants to writhe and coil as if alive, while shocking animals into a
    temporary but deathly torpor. As such, they rarely must hunt to find food,
    instead sensing passing creatures and preying upon them after they succumb
    to the oozes' sleep aura. Always ravenous, the powerful acids that comprise
    these oozes quickly dissolve the flesh of their meals. A verdurous ooze
    typically weighs 300 pounds and can easily spread to fill a 5-foot-square
    area. While moving, such crawling muck rises only a few inches tall, though
    its structure might grow and boil up to a height of 2 or 3 feet if let
    undisturbed for a matter of days. Spontaneously grown structures collapse
    and melt back into the ooze's body as soon as it begins moving again.
    Ecology Verdurous oozes settle in locations with abundant food, rarely
    moving far except to feed upon comatose prey that has come too close or to
    reproduce. Verdurous oozes primarily gain sustenance from the small birds,
    mammals, and insects that fall prey to their sleep aura, but also prove well
    suited to devouring larger creatures that fall asleep nearby. Every 2 or 3
    years, verdurous oozes collect deep in forests and swamps, clustering in
    secluded locales tainted by reeking natural compost or the escape of natural
    gases from the land. As many as 10 oozes might gather during one of these
    grotesque moots. To reproduce, four verdurous oozes merge to become a
    greater verdurous ooze. Greater oozes are far more active and hungry than
    their lesser kin, constantly wandering, feeding, and growing. After several
    months, the greater verdurous ooze splits into 10 to 15 new verdurous oozes.
    These new verdurous oozes grow to full size within 6 months. Habitat &
    Society Verdurous oozes primarily live in temperate forests and plains among
    high grasses or cultivated crops, though they might also be found in warm
    plains and jungle environments. As mindless creatures, they pay little
    attention to others of their kind, save when drawn to reproduce. A notable
    fact about verdurous oozes is that they beneficially impact nearby plant
    life; their secretions act as a kind of natural fertilizer. Trees, grass,
    flowers-all flora benefits from the existence of a nearby verdurous ooze.
    Over time, this can lead to an increase in the fauna in the area, as they
    seek to enjoy the rich, lush plants that make up their diet and in turn
    become prey for the stealthy ooze. Thus, another sign that a verdurous ooze
    is, or has been, in a particular area is the skeletons of animals that it
    has consumed, which are left behind once the flesh has been absorbed.
    Resourceful evil humanoids sometimes take advantage of verdurous oozes'
    relative lassitude and difficultly escaping from simple pits or other
    containers, trapping them near the entrances to their lairs. In such
    instances, the oozes' chemical secretions provide an extra defense for those
    aware of their presence and the dangers of coming too close. Greater
    Verdurous Ooze Greater verdurous oozes are formed when several green oozes
    merge together as part of their reproductive process. They are similar in
    form but much larger, and while still green, exhibit white and red lines
    that resemble veins running through them. They are even more voracious and
    dangerous than standard green oozes, as they eat and eat to gain enough mass
    to reproduce. A greater verdurous ooze typically weighs 2,400 pounds and can
    easily spread to fill a 10-foot-square area.
