Description_Visual: >-
  This creature is a man-sized monster resembling a tree trunk with six long
  sinewy tendrils spaced evenly around the upper portion of its body.  Six
  smaller tendrils located at the base of its trunk seem to aid it in
  locomotion. Its body is dark grayish-green and its tendrils are dark gray
  changing to dark green at the tips.

Description:
  - >-
    The kampfult is a tree-like creature that haunts subterranean realms in
    search of prey, grabbing any living creature that passes by. Creatures slain
    by a kampfult are slowly absorbed into the base of the trunk and digested.
  - A kampfult stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 600 pounds.
  - >-
    A kampfult attacks from surprise, waiting until its prey moves within reach
    and then lashing out with its tendrils, attempting to grab and entangle its
    prey. A kampfult rarely attacks creatures larger than itself unless it is
    extremely hungry. It fights until either it or its opponent is dead.
