    description: >-
      By burrowing into the base of a corpse's skull and attaching itself with
      its pincers, a parasite clockwork can animate the creature (similar to an
      animate dead spell). The animated creature uses its own HD, base attack,
      saves, and hit points. It has an effective Wisdom of 10 and Charisma of 1.
      It does not have an Intelligence score. The host loses all skills, feats,
      class abilities, supernatural abilities, and spell-like abilities
      (including the ability to cast spells) it possessed in life. It retains
      its AC and any natural attacks it possessed, including proficiency with
      weapons. A host retains any proficiency with armor and shields it
      possessed while alive. Spells such as detect undead or detect magic do not
      reveal the presence of the parasite or host. So long as the parasite
      clockwork remains in contact with the host, the control remains in effect.
      A host brought to 0 or less hit points is destroyed, but can be repaired
      by the clockwork parasite using its self-repair ability (though this only
      works if the host is brought to 0 or less hit points; a host does not gain
      the self-repair ability of the parasite while "alive"). Self-Repair (Ex) A
      clockwork parasite regains 1 hit point per round. Damage dealt from acid,
      cold, or fire effects cannot be self-repaired. If reduced to 0 or less hit
      points, it regains 1 hit point per round (but still cannot repair damage
      caused by acid, cold, or fire effects).
Description:
  - >-
    Clockwork parasites burrow into the skulls of the recently dead and
    reanimate the body using electrical impulses to control and direct the
    corpse. The animated corpses look like zombies at first glance, but a closer
    inspection reveals the fist-sized hole in the back of the head, wherein
    lurks the parasite. The host creatures, much like clockwork warriors, rely
    on numbers and overwhelming force to defeat their enemies. Parasites often
    attack from ambush, however. Parasite clockworks were designed to swarm over
    a battlefield, take control of the corpses lying on the field, and then
    ambush any enemies who moved across the field, rising from the ground to
    attack en masse.
