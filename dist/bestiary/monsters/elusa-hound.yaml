SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Arcane Sight (Su)
    description: >-
      Elusa hounds can detect magical auras in a 120-foot radius, as per the
      arcane sight spell cast by a sorcerer at 6th level. This ability can be
      dispelled, but the elusa hound can restart it as a free action on its next
      turn. Using this ability, the elusa hound can instantly identify any
      spellcaster within range.
  - name: Aura Tracking (Su)
    description: >-
      If an elusa hound has "tasted" the magical aura of a living creature (a
      creature it has successfully used its arcane sight ability against or a
      spell it has successfully detected that was cast by such a creature), it
      gains a +10 competence bonus to its Survival check when tracking that
      target. The aura must be fresh ("tasted" within the last 3 hours) or the
      elusa hound does not gain this bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Elusa hounds are used by different creatures for different reasons; though
    ultimately there have but one purpose: tracking (and often killing)
    magic-wielders. These creatures can detect the emanations given off by
    arcane and divine spellcasters and use this scent to track them. The origins
    of the elusa hounds have mystified even the most learned of sages, for
    though they seem to be born of magic, no spellcaster in his or her right
    mind would ever create such a beast.
  - >-
    Renegade bands enthralled with the idea of ridding the world of spellcasters
    sometimes employ them. Civilized towns and cities likewise use them in
    places where magic is forbidden or policed by the local government. In other
    instances, they are used by spellcasters to ferret out rivals.
  - >-
    When given instructions to track and kill their target, a pack of elusa
    hounds uses tactics similar to other canine animals: circle the prey and
    attack simultaneously from the front, rear, and flanks. These beasts can
    easily be trained to pin or hold a foe rather than kill it. This tactic is
    often employed by military or government units when they wish to capture and
    interrogate a renegade spellcaster. When using these tactics, the elusa
    hound attempts to trip its foe and then pins it with a bite.
  - >-
    Elusa hounds radiate a moderate aura of divination magic if examined with
    detect magic or the like.
