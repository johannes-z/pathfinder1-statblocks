  - name: Swooping Charge (Ex)
    description: >-
      A charging criosphinx deals 4d4+12 points of damage with its gore attack.
      A flying criosphinx who drops at least 20 feet in altitude as part of a
      charge deals 6d4+18 points instead.
Description:
  - >-
    Perhaps the least leonine of all sphinxes, the ram-headed criosphinx lacks
    the intellect of androsphinxes and gynosphinxes, but still outmatches the
    dim-witted hieracosphinxes. Like hieracosphinxes and androsphinxes,
    criosphinxes are always male. At the start of a battle, a criosphinx lowers
    its horns and crashes into foes, clawing enemies it has engaged. It favors
    charging down on foes from great heights.
  - >-
    Criosphinxes crave wealth over nearly all other things, habitually extorting
    tolls for safe passage from any who pass their lands. Groups who cannot pay
    must yield one of their
  - >-
    number or a pair of mounts for the criosphinx's meal- single travelers must
    fight or die. Unlike gynosphinxes, no mere riddle suffices-only the shine of
    metal or the gleam of jewels can satisfy a criosphinx. Little can convince a
    criosphinx to part with even a single coin save the lust that its kind bears
    for the gynosphinx. Criosphinxes crave mating with gynosphinxes above all
    else, and pay well for the whereabouts of a female, or better yet, a
    well-crafted riddle that might impress one. For their part, gynosphinxes
    prefer to have little to do with what they mock as the sheep of sphinxes,
    though they sometimes lower themselves to a brief assignation in the rare
    event a criosphinx manages to impress them with wealth or wit.
  - >-
    Some criosphinxes set themselves as soothsayers of the desert, trading upon
    the storied wisdom of androsphinxes and gynosphinxes to deceive gullible
    travelers. Like their more blustering brethren, they seek wealth from
    passersby, but for the purposes of dispersing information rather than in
    exchange for safe passage. Such reliable information as they possess usually
    comes from idle conversation with the creatures of the desert, with
    criosphinxes using their inborn ability to speak with animals. A criosphinx
    lacking in sound information usually fabricates a pleasing lie.
  - >-
    Criosphinxes detest hieracosphinxes, regarding them as little more than
    beasts and a disgrace to their noble race. They drive off their
    falcon-headed cousins with mock-charges and posturing, escalating to full-f
    ledged attacks if ignored. Androsphinxes they view with mixed fear and
    respect, and gynosphinxes with disdain and lust.
