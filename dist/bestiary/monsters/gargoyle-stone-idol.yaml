SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone idol is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. A transmute rock to mud
      spell slows a stone idol (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no
      saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit
      points. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the stone idol's
      structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1
      full round. A disintegrate spell deals +50% damage to a stone idol. A
      chaos hammer, holy smite, order's wrath, or unholy blight spell deals 1d4
      points of damage per two caster levels to a stone idol if the creator's
      alignment matches one of the aforementioned spells.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      Unless a stone idol's main body is shattered into small fragments and
      scattered to the winds, the creature reforms itself at full strength in
      1d4+2 days.
  - name: Site Bound (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone idol cannot travel more than 200 feet from a central point
      designated by its creator. Once this point is selected, it can never be
      changed. A stone idol taken outside the area ceases functioning until it
      is brought back into the area.
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      The stone gargoyle's breath weapon is a cone of superheated steam and
      water. Creatures of an alignment opposite that of the cleric that created
      the stone gargoyle are also sickened 1d4+3 rounds if they fail their save.
      The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Stone gargoyles stand 7 feet tall and weigh about 600 pounds. Though they
    have wings, they cannot fly. They can give the appearance of flight by
    leaping from high places and flapping their stone wings.
  - Construction
  - >-
    A stone gargoyle's body is chiseled from a single block of hard stone, such
    as granite, weighing at least 2,000 pounds. The stone must be of exceptional
