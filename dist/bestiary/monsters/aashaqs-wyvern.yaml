      Once every 1d4 rounds, an Aashaq's wyvern can emit a cloud of noxious fire
      in a 30-foot cone that deals 6d6 points of fire damage. Creatures that
      take damage are also temporarily blinded by the fumes as though by
      glitterdust for 4 rounds. A DC 19 Reflex save halves the fire damage and
      negates the glitterdust effect. The save DC is Consitution-based.

Description:
  - >-
    Aashaq's wyverns resemble the typical wyverns commonly found throughout the
    Inner Sea region in many regards, but they have been warped by magic. Unlike
    their more mundane cousins, these wyverns have bifurcated tails that allow
    for two stinging attacks, and are able to emit a noxious blast of gas that
    burns and blinds those in its path. Aashaq's wyverns reside in the natural
    caves that honeycomb the cliffs of Dahak's Teeth, and were common wyverns
    until the evil dragon Aashaq commandeered the islands. Seeing these beasts
    as the perfect deacons for her dark cult, Aashaq twisted the very fabric of
    the wyverns until she settled upon the form now most commonly encountered on
    Dahak's Teeth. Their very name is indicative of the wyverns' servitor
    status, and they are occasionally even ridden as mounts by Dahak cultists.
  - >-
    Aashaq gives her wyvern minions a remarkable amount of freedom, but most
    never stray too far from the three islands that make up Dahak's Teeth.
    Mariners who make their way past the dreaded isles know to watch out for the
    beasts, which assail unprepared ships from both sky and water in order to
    feed upon their crews and capture their cargo for Aashaq. The corrupting inf
    luence of Aashaq's chaotic manipulations has also provided these
    unpredictable creatures with resistance to acid, fire, and magic.
  - >-
    A typical Aashaq's wyvern is 18 feet in length (including its bifurcated
    tail) and weighs 2,500 pounds. Their scales can vary in tint, but are
    usually purple. Though only slightly more intelligent than their common kin,
    the Dahak-worshiping wyverns enjoy lording their "superior" status over the
    lesser specimens found on other islets.
