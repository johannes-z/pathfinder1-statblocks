Description:
  - >-
    Horrifically enlarged versions of the common mosquito, giant mosquitoes
    bring death on swift wings. A single specimen can drain the blood from a
    human adult with shocking speed, while swarms of fist-sized mosquitoes can
    lay waste to herds of livestock or entire villages. In the wild, giant
    mosquitoes prey upon megafauna like dinosaurs and other huge creatures.
  - >-
    Giant mosquitoes grow to 6 feet in length, and weigh up to 150 pounds.
    Variant species of giant mosquitoes exist, although not in the great
    diversity seen in many other giant vermin. The most common variant is the
    smaller goblin mosquito (a giant mosquito with the young creature template),
    but stories of Large jungle mosquitoes (giant mosquitoes with the advanced
    and giant simple templates) are not unheard of.
