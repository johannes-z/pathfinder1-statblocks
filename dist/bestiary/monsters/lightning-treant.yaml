Description:
  - >-
    Unlike most treants, this creature appears to be a moss-covered dead tree,
    with bare branches stretched toward the sky. Often living in the shade of
    larger trees, or in the wasteland of a destroyed forest, lightning treants
    are strange, angry creatures whose powers and talents are almost elemental
    in nature. Confused by some travelers with shambling mounds, these creatures
    are much larger and the moss-like vegetation they are covered with is only a
    thin layer over their hard wooden core. While many types of treants might
    make an effort to negotiate, or at least try to determine whether or not
    travelers might be hostile to whatever forest they are living in, lightning
    treants tend to simply attack first and, quite frankly, not question
    anything. Using their ability to call lightning storms, these creatures can
    be a true bane to travelers, especially those that do not recognize them at
    first. Lightning treants have an inherent hatred of all humanoids and attack
    them on sight. If there are more than one or two in a group the lightning
    treant starts combat with a chain lightning spell and then uses call
    lightning storm to have further lightning bolts ready; afterward, the
    lightning treant charges into combat, focusing first on anyone with an axe
    or other slashing weapon. If combat goes against it, it uses lightning bolt
    on its enemies, as well as using bolts called down with call lightning storm
    to heal itself or hurt its opponents. Copyright Notice Author Casey
