    A creature with the calcified template is preserved by the toxic fluids
    pumped into its body by an incutilis lord. Though the creature's identity is
    lost and its life soon fades, the incutilis lord retains use of the
    creature's feats, physical skills, extraordinary abilities, spell-like
    abilities, and supernatural abilities. This template can be applied to any
    living corporeal creature.
