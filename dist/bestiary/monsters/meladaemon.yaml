SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Consumptive Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A meladaemon radiates an aura of hunger to a radius of 20 feet. Every
      round a creature begins its turn within this aura, it must succeed at a DC
      22 Fortitude save or take 1d6 nonlethal damage and become fatigued from
      extreme hunger. Creatures that do not need to eat are immune to this
      effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Daemonic wasting: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 22; onset 1 day; frequency
      1/day; effect 1d4 Con and 1d4 Cha damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Hunger (Su)
    description: >-
      A meladaemon's claw attack deals an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal
      damage as it causes sudden pangs of horrific hunger in its foe. Creatures
      that do not need to eat are immune to this effect.
Description:
  - >-
    As personifications of death from starvation and thirst, these withered
    fiends spend their time destroying resources and spreading hunger. Deacons
    of the Horseman of Famine, these creatures visit worlds throughout the
    planes, destroying acres of crops and slaughtering livestock in order to
    harvest souls for their honored master. Meladaemons delight in the slow
    death of starvation, going so far as to experiment with various bodily
    deficiencies and mortal weaknesses. Arrogant and utterly bound to their
    patron, meladaemons rarely work with others of their kind and never serve
    any of the other three Horsemen except in the rarest of circumstances.
  - Meladaemons stand approximately 12 feet tall and weigh 350 pounds.
