SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Improved Tracking (Ex)
    description: >-
      An invisible stalker takes no penalty to Survival checks when tracking and
      moving at any speed.
  - name: Natural Invisibility (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability is constant-an invisible stalker remains invisible at all
      times, even when attacking. As this ability is inherent, it is not subject
      to the invisibility purge spell. Against foes that cannot pinpoint it, the
      invisible stalker gains a +20 bonus on Stealth checks when moving, or +40
      when standing still-these bonuses are not included in the statistics
      above.
Description:
  - >-
    Very little is known about these enigmatic and mysterious creatures, as
    their very nature makes details of their true form difficult to discern.
    Brought to this world from the Plane of Air, these creatures fulfill tasks
    for those who conjure them. Invisible stalkers act as guardians, assassins,
    and trackers, occupations in which they excel. Their natural invisibility
    and skill at stealth allow them to follow their quarry without detection and
    give them the upper hand when it comes to exterminating a mark. Many
    invisible stalkers resent this and see these petty tasks as nothing more
    than chores dictated by mortals. When given a particularly complex or
    bothersome task, an invisible stalker seeks to find a loophole in a poorly
    worded instruction. For instance, wizards calling an invisible stalker into
    service with the instructions "protect me from danger" might find themselves
    escorted to a faraway hidden location, or even brought to the Plane of Air.
    Due to their constant summoning, many invisible stalkers harbor hostility
    for those dwelling on the Material Plane. Those invisible stalkers new to
    the mortal world only know the stories of their kind and tend to keep an
    open mind about the intentions of those who call them. Over time, or in the
    service of a particularly vile master, invisible stalkers form negative
    opinions of these creatures of flesh and bone, leading to their tendency to
    pervert their instructions and cause harm to their masters. For older and
    more experienced invisible stalkers, the only thing protecting those who
    summon them is the magic that binds them. These creatures automatically try
    to use inconsistencies in the wording of their tasks and literal twists on
    the intention to find a way to inconvenience, injure, or even kill the
    priest or arcanist that brought them to the plane.
