SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Air Walk (Su)
    description: >-
      Protectors can air walk as the spell of the same name (caster level 10th).
      This ability is always active and can be dispelled, but the protector can
      restart it as a free action on its next turn.
  - name: Know Alignment (Su)
    description: >-
      A protector automatically knows the alignment of any creature within 50
      feet that it looks upon.
  - name: Resistant Touch (Sp)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, you can touch an ally to grant him your resistance
      bonus for 1 minute. When you use this ability, you lose your resistance
      bonus granted by the Protection domain for 1 minute.
  - name: Touch of Law (Sp)
    description: >-
      You can touch a willing creature as a standard action, infusing it with
      the power of divine order and allowing it to treat all attack rolls, skill
      checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 round as if the natural
      d20 roll resulted in an 11.
Description:
  - >-
    Protectors are extraplanar guardians of law that appear as very noble and
    regal creatures. They are often sent to the Material Plane when the forces
    of chaos swing from the balance. Protectors move by means of their air walk
    ability; their feet never touch the ground, and they always float 6 to 10
    inches above the ground. A protector stands 7 feet tall and weighs about 200
    pounds or more.
  - >-
    Protectors attack neutral (except non-intelligent or low-intelligence
    creatures such as animals) and chaotic creatures on sight. They never
    knowingly and willingly attack lawful creatures. A protector fights with its
    longsword and spells.
