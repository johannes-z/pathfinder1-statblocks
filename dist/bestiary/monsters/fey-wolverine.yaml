Description:
  - Creating a Fey Animal
  - >-
    "Fey animal" is an inherited or acquired template that can be added to a
    living, corporeal animal (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A fey
    animal uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except
    as noted here.
  - 'CR: Same as the base creature +1.'
  - >-
    Type: Creature type changes to fey. It gains the augmented subtype. Do not
    recalculate Hit Dice, Base Attack Bonus, skills, or saves.
  - 'Alignment: Any chaotic.'
  - 'Armor Class: A fey creature''s natural armor bonus increases by +1.'
  - >-
    Special Qualities and Defenses: A fey animal gains darkvision 60 feet and
    low-light vision if it didn't already possess it. It also gains DR 5/cold
    iron (DR 10/cold iron if it has 11 or more Hit Dice) and SR equal to its CR
    + 11.
  - 'Speed: All of the fey creature''s movement speeds increase by 10 feet.'
  - >-
    Special Attacks: A fey animal gains the special attack described below. Save
    DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the fey animal's Hit Dice + the fey animal's
    Charisma modifier.
  - >-
    Death Curse (Su): When a creature slays a fey animal, the slayer is cursed
    with ill luck unless it makes a successful Will saving throw to resist the
    curse. If it fails to resist, the victim takes a -2 penalty on all attack
    rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws until the curse is
    removed. The total penalty from multiple fey animal death curses stacks, but
    the multiple death curses count as a single curse overall for the purposes
    of removing its effects. A fey creature can see this curse on a creature as
    an angry red halo around the victim's head.
  - >-
    Spell-Like Abilities: A fey animal has a cumulative number of spell-like
    abilities set by its HD. Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable 1/day.
    The CL equals the fey animal's CR.
  - HD Spell-Like Abilities
  - 1-3 charm person, faerie fire
  - 4-6 fly (3/day), tree shape
  - 7-9 charm monster, hallucinatory terrain
  - 10-13 polymorph (3/day), summon nature's ally IV
  - 14-16 feeblemind, transport via plants
  - 17 or higher mass charm monster, summon nature's ally VIII
  - 'Abilities: Dex +4, Int +10 (to a maximum score of 12), Wis +2, Cha +4.'
  - >-
    Skills: A fey animal gains a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Stealth checks,
    and has skill points per racial Hit Die equal to 6 + its Intelligence
    modifier. Its racial class skills are Acrobatics, Bluff, Climb, Diplomacy,
    Fly, Knowledge (nature), Perception, Sense Motive, Stealth, and Swim.
  - >-
    Languages: Fey animals speak Sylvan plus one other language common to the
    region.
