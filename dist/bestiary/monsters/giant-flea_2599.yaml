SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Attach (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a giant flea hits with a touch attack, it uses its many legs to attach
      itself to the opponent's body. While attached the giant flea loses its
      Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 13. It gains a +12 racial bonus to
      CMD checks while attached. An attached flea can be struck with a weapon or
      removed by an opposed CMB attack to pluck it free. On a critical failure
      (a roll of 1) the flea's head snaps off in the victim and continues to
      drain blood for 1d8 more rounds. The head can be removed with a successful
      DC 18 Heal check.
  - name: Blood Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant flea drains blood, dealing 1d3 points of Constitution damage in
      any round it begins its turn attached to a victim. Once it has dealt 4
      points of Constitution damage, it detaches and leaps away to digest the
      meal. At Constitution 0 the host dies and the giant flea detaches. If it
      has yet to deal 4 points of Constitution damage, it seeks a new host.
  - name: Crowd (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because of their tiny size, up to four giant fleas can occupy the same
      5-foot space.
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Filth fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 11; onset 1d3 days; frequency
      1/day; effect 1d3 Dex damage and 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Giant fleas are blood-sucking parasites that prey on warm-blooded animals.
    They have strong hind legs with powerful tendons that allow them to leap
    incredible distances with ease. A giant flea is about a foot long, with an
    oval, flattened body. This shape makes it easy for a giant flea to move in
    and among the hairs of large mammals. When lacking mammals large enough for
    them to feed on, giant fleas live in swarms of up to twenty individuals.
    These swarms wander at random, seeking prey large enough to sate their
    appetites. Female giant fleas lay their eggs in warm areas (usually nestled
    in the fur of some giant animal) and leave them to hatch and fend for
    themselves. The female lays a clutch of up to 2d10 eggs, half of which never
    hatch. The larvae hatch in two weeks, and resemble hairy maggots; they are
    effectively helpless (AC 10, 1 hp). They mature into adult giant fleas in
    1d6 months, and leap away to join or form a colony. Giant fleas attack in
    groups, leaping onto the largest obvious food source; they would attack a
    horse before a human, and a human before a halfling. If attacked, a giant
    flea jumps away, only to return the next round to continue the attack.
