  This towering humanoid figure appears to be sculpted from clay. Fine cracks
  thread through the creature's body, leaking a steady stream of putrescent
  slime.

  - name: Clay Shell (Ex)
    description: >-
      A benaioh is safely encased in an animated clay shell that is sculpted to
      resemble a giant humanoid. The shell provides the inhabiting ooze total
      cover. When the clay form is destroyed, it shatters violently, exploding
      in a spray of jagged clay shards that deal 3d6 points of damage to all
      creatures in a 30-foot-diameter burst centered on the benaioh. A
      successful DC 21 Reflex save halves this damage. This explosion releases
      the benaioh from its clay shell; thereafter it uses its ooze form
      statistics (see below). The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      While a benaioh is immune to disease, it carries a contagion with which it
      both infects other creatures and propagates itself. Any creature struck by
      the benaioh's spray slime ability is exposed to this disease. Wormrot:
      Contact; save Fort DC 20; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect sickened
      plus 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. A creature that dies of wormrot transforms into a
      benaioh over the course of the next 24 hours.
  - name: Spray Slime (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds (but no more than 6 times per day), a benaioh in its
      clay shell can force a stream of itself in a 20-foot line of worm-laden
      slime from one of the clay shell's orifices. The putrescent sludge deals
      3d6 points of acid damage and exposes the target to wormrot.
  - name: Symbiotic Senses (Ex)
    description: >-
      A benaioh can still use its blindsense and tremorsense abilities while
      housed inside its animated clay shell.
Description:
  - >-
    Long before the Thassilonian empire rose to power on the western shores of
    Avistan, ancient tribes of stone giants migrated into the western reaches of
    Varisia and settled in the region now called the Mindspin Mountains. As
    their culture grew, so did their devotion to the deities who blessed them
    with the riches of the earth. They worshiped gods, the spirits of the wild
    world around them, and their ancestors. To show their respect, they erected
    dozens of small temples throughout the region. In later centuries, much of
    their culture was torn apart. Those who clung to their beliefs were
    slaughtered, and their temples were sacked, looted, and burned. Anything
    left behind fell into the care of aging priests, and over the centuries, as
    their caretakers passed on, these remnants slipped into obscurity.
  - >-
    One strange ritual from this time, typically practiced by the ancient
    priests of the giant goddess Fandarra, involved the preparation of corpses
    for the journey to the afterlife, but created benaiohs as a side effect.
    Corpses were prepared by decomposing them within a clay vessel that the
    priests believed would allow the soul to escape after the body decomposed.
    To augment this process, the priests used slender, flesh-devouring worms
    that were imbued with divine blessings. Over the course of a lengthy ritual,
    priests sealed the deceased's entire body in sacred clay. As the clay
    hardened, they sculpted it to resemble the likeness of the deceased, forming
    a sort of statue-like sarcophagus that stood upright. The only portions of
    this clay vessel that were left unsealed were holes that allowed access to
    the individual's eyes and mouth. Then Fandarra's priests placed three of the
    sacred worms into each of the vessel's openings. Lastly, the priests sealed
    the openings with wax. In this manner, the priests believed they were
    separating the deceased's physical body from its soul, leaving the soul free
    to follow Fandarra (or her servitors) on to its final rest in the Great
    Beyond.
  - >-
    As a side effect, this strange burial practice provided guardians for the
    tombs, as the divinely imbued worms eventually animate their clay vessels as
    benaiohs. Since the worms are able to breed rapidly and then maintain a
    stable population indefinitely, benaiohs are capable of standing vigil for
    millennia. A benaioh in its clay vessel stands just over 12 feet tall and
    weighs 2,000 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    A benaioh is an ooze-like colony formed by a swarm of divinely imbued worms
    that live within a morass of their own waste and digestive secretions. When
    first created, the colony consists of only nine worms; however, the
    creatures breed rapidly, particularly when they have a readily available
    source of flesh. Over the course of several months, the worms reproduce
    hundreds of times, quickly increasing in population until they fill the clay
    vessel. During times of dormancy or when meat is scarce, the worms sustain
    their population through cannibalism, eventually balancing their
    reproductive and mortality rates. If the colony senses warm flesh, though,
    the worms stop eating each
  - >-
    other. These worms never exhibit this type of swarming behavior when
    encountered naturally, which indicates that the divine ritual is necessary
    to create a colony.
  - >-
    The worms are coated with a fleshy, gelatinous slime that forms as they
    devour flesh, and eventually this slurry of worms and slime gains the
    ability to animate the clay vessel in which they are interred. The worms'
    individual tiny jerking and wriggling movements work in unison to move the
    limbs of the clay vessel. The worms innately sense nearby motion as well as
    the body heat of most living creatures. As soon as a benaioh senses fresh
    meat, the worms begin jerking about in a sympathetic reaction, activating
    the clay figure and sending it lumbering off in the direction of the nearest
    living prey.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Being by-products of a long-forgotten burial practice, benaiohs have no
    society. Few of these ancient worm-filled statues have managed to survive
    the transition into contemporary times, though they can still be found in
    lost tombs dotted throughout western Avistan.
  - >-
    A number of prominent scholars have questioned their existence altogether.
    While most of these scholars accept the procedures and preparations
    performed during burial rituals, they discredit tales of magically imbued
    worms animating the clay vessels, in part because no one has ever created
    one of these creatures in modern times-or, for that matter, provided hard
    evidence for their existence beyond a few broken shards of clay and trace
    amounts of slimy residue.
  - >-
    Many of these scholars think that this burial practice is simply a variation
    of an unusual practice from distant lands, in which ochre jellies are used
    to dissolve the deceased's flesh. They dismiss the tales of benaiohs
    springing to life as fables of a lost age invented by giants to protect
    their ancestral burial grounds.
  - >-
    While the practice of making benaiohs is most closely associated with the
    religious practices of ancient tribes of giants, tales and rumors of similar
    practices persist among primitive humanoids in the lower depths of the
    Darklands. In accounts of this practice, the flesh-devouring worm ceremony
    serves as a punishment or torture, but the end result is similar-the
    creation of guardians. These stories go on to describe guardians with
    powerful abilities.
