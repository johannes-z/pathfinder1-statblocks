      The three heads of a corpse rook grant it a +6 racial bonus on Perception
      and Search checks (included in the above stats), and the corpse rook
      cannot be flanked.
Description:
  - >-
    Corpse rooks are giant three-headed birds of prey that devour just about
    anything they can catch, preferring a diet of horses, giant lizards, dire
    rats, giant frogs, cattle, sheep, and humanoids. They build their nests at
    the top of broadleaved trees or high atop rocky outcroppings in less
    forested terrain. A corpse rook's nest is constructed from mud, grass, hair,
    leaves, and the bones of their victims. These creatures do not associate
    with other avian creatures and are often hunted by red dragons, green
    dragons, rocs, and wyverns (who savor the taste of their flesh).
  - >-
    Corpse rooks are solitary hunters with a hunting territory often covering 5
    miles in each direction away from its nest. Hunting is always done during
    the day when the corpse rook has the advantage. During mating season (spring
    and early summer months) both the male and female corpse rook hunt for food,
    sometimes together, but most often in separate directions away from the
    nest. A nest typically contains 1d4 silver and gold-flecked eggs as well as
    treasure from slain prey.
  - >-
    Corpse rooks attack their foes from the air, slashing with their claws and
    biting with their sharpened beaks. They rarely land on the ground during
    battle, preferring to swoop in and out of melee to keep their opponents off
    balance. Multiple corpse rooks work together to bring down prey; one might
    land on the ground to draw the attention of the prey, while the other corpse
    rook swoops in behind to flank. Creatures killed by a corpse rook are
    carried back to the nest and either devoured or fed to the newborns.
