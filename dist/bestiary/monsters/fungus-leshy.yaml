SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Puffball (Ex)
    description: >-
      A fungus leshy can spit a puffball as a standard action. If it hits, this
      attack deals 1 point of damage (this damage is not modified by Strength)
      and affects the target struck (but not adjacent targets) with the fungus
      leshy's spores. The puffball has a range increment of 20 feet.
  - name: Spores (Ex)
    description: >-
      A fungus leshy is riddled with molds and spores. Anytime a fungus leshy
      takes damage, a cloud of spores bursts from its body, forcing all adjacent
      creatures to make a DC 14 Fortitude save or have their vision reduced to
      10 feet for 1 minute. Spending a full-round action to wash one's eyes with
      water ends this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Keepers of cavernous mushroom forests and rotting compost pits deep within
    the swamp, fungus leshys preside over subterranean growth and the rot that
    fertilizes new life. Among the most alien and monstrous-looking of all
    leshys, these tiny rot farmers' frightening appearance has more to do with
    the asymmetrical eeriness intrinsic to molds and fungi than an outward
    expression of evil. Like all their kin, fungus leshys vary widely in form,
    often adopting the colors and shapes of the mushrooms and other large fungi
    common to the areas they tend.
  - >-
    Fungus leshys are spawned from realms of underground wonder or the rotting
    places of the natural world. They perform an important service in the lands
    they keep, encouraging the growth of fungi, transporting rotting material to
    fertilize other plants, and making the most use of growth that has died off.
    Fungus leshys are most active at night and spend the day in the forms of
    plump fungi amid their ripest compost heaps or fungal glens.
  - >-
    Fungus leshys are 2 feet tall and weigh 25 pounds, their spongy interiors
    full of hollows and fluffy spores.
  - GROWING A FUNGUS LESHY
  - >-
    A fungus leshy is usually grown amid the compost of a treant's groves, in
    dens of mold deep underground, or in eerie hillocks at the heart of dense
    swamplands.
