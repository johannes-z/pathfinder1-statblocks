Description:
  - >-
    When a humanoid creature dies on the Parched Expanse on the Plane of Molten
    Skies (see City of Brass by Necromancer Games), there is a good chance it
    returns from the afterlife as a dust ghoul-an undead flesh-eating creature
    composed of dust and earth. Dust ghouls haunt the Parched Expanse, preying
    on unwary travelers who linger too long in their hunting grounds. These
    creatures savor the taste of human flesh and devour such a kill with great
    ferocity. Dust ghouls predicate their arrival by animating dust into ghostly
    humanoids that immediately move to grapple potential prey. Dust ghouls then
    move in (often swooping in from above) and attempt to paralyze their foes
    with their shriek. Prey is then torn to pieces by the dust ghouls using its
    claws and fangs. If a dust ghoul is slain, it crumbles into a pile of dust.
