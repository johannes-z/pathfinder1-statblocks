SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animate Dust (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a dust ghoul can cause 1d4 ghostly humanoid-shaped creatures
      to materialize from an area of dust and earth within 100 feet. The dust
      ghoul can control and direct these creatures as long as it is "alive" and
      within 100 feet. The dust creatures have a speed of 10 feet and each has
      only one attack; a grapple. Each has a CMB equal to 1/2 dust ghoul's HD +
      its Strength modifier (+12 CMB for the standard dust ghoul). A dust
      creature holds but does not harm creatures it grapples. The dust humanoids
      are immune to all attacks and spells, except water-based spells and
      effects. A gallon of water instantly destroys a dust humanoid. If the dust
      ghoul moves more than 100 feet away from a dust creature, that dust
      creature collapses into a pile of harmless dust. If the dust ghoul is
      destroyed, all dust creatures it animated collapse.
  - name: Augmented Critical (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dust ghoul's claws are razor-sharp. It threatens a critical hit on an
      attack roll of 19-20. On a successful critical hit with a claw, it deals
      triple damage.
  - name: Earth Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dust ghoul gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if its foe is
      touching the ground. If an opponent is waterborne, the dust ghoul takes a
      -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls.
  - name: Limited Flight (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dust ghoul can fly for a number of minutes equal to its Charisma
      modifier (minimum 1). After that, it must rest for 10 minutes before it
      can fly again.
  - name: Paralyzing Shriek (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per minute, a dust ghoul can unleash a hellish shriek that paralyzes
      any creature within 60 feet that hears it. Affected creatures that succeed
      on a DC 19 Will save negate the paralysis. This is a mind-affecting, fear
      and sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    When a humanoid creature dies on the Parched Expanse on the Plane of Molten
    Skies (see City of Brass by Necromancer Games), there is a good chance it
    returns from the afterlife as a dust ghoul-an undead flesh-eating creature
    composed of dust and earth. Dust ghouls haunt the Parched Expanse, preying
    on unwary travelers who linger too long in their hunting grounds. These
    creatures savor the taste of human flesh and devour such a kill with great
    ferocity. Dust ghouls predicate their arrival by animating dust into ghostly
    humanoids that immediately move to grapple potential prey. Dust ghouls then
    move in (often swooping in from above) and attempt to paralyze their foes
    with their shriek. Prey is then torn to pieces by the dust ghouls using its
    claws and fangs. If a dust ghoul is slain, it crumbles into a pile of dust.
