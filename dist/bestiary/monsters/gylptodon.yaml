Description:
  - >-
    The gylptodon is often hunted for the value of its outer armor, made up of
    bony plates in turn composed of many smaller, knobby "scales." The creature
    is quite capable of defending itself with swipes from its deadly claws, as
    its ill-tempered nature often urges it to do. Gylptodon Companions Starting
