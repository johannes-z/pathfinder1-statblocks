    description: >-
      With a snap of its tail, a manticore can loose a volley of four spikes as
      a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike). This attack has a
      range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30
      feet of each other. The creature can launch only 24 spikes in any 24-hour
      period.
Description:
  - >-
    Manticores are fierce predators that patrol a wide area in search of fresh
    meat. A typical manticore is about 10 feet long and weighs about 1,000
    pounds. Some have more human-like heads, usually with beards. Males and
    females look much alike. Manticores eat any meat, even carrion, though they
    prefer human flesh and rarely pass up an opportunity for such a delicacy.
    They are smart and social enough to bargain with or bully evil humanoids
    into alliances or offering tribute, and more powerful creatures may hire or
    bribe them to guard or patrol a place or area. They like lairs in high
    places, such as hilltops and caves in cliffs. Although manticores were
    likely a magical creation, they have long since established themselves as a
    naturally occurring species. Curiously, manticores seem strangely fecund,
    and can interbreed with a number of other similarly shaped creatures,
    including lions, dire lions, lamias, sphinxes, and even chimeras. The
    progeny of a manticore and an unusual mate is summarized on the table below.
