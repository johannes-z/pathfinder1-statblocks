SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Glaive Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Baphomet is exceptionally skilled at fighting with a glaive. He is treated
      as a 20th-level fighter for the purposes of fulfilling any feat
      prerequisites, such as that for Weapon Specialization.
  - name: Infernal Brand (Su)
    description: >-
      The mark of Asmodeus is branded on Baphomet's brow, yet this is no mark of
      fealty or servitude. Rather, Baphomet has claimed the pentagram-a remnant
      of the time he spend as the archdevil's prisoner-and now draws power from
      it. The brand grants him his devil-like abilities of fire immunity and see
      in darkness. In addition, all devils and worshipers of devils take a -2
      penalty on saving throws against Baphomet's special attacks and spell-like
      abilities. He gains a +4 bonus on caster level checks to penetrate a
      devil's spell resistance, and automatically penetrates a devil's damage
      reduction with his glaive and natural attacks.
  - name: Language Mastery (Ex)
    description: Baphomet can speak, read, and understand all languages.
  - name: Scroll Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      Baphomet can cast spells from any scroll as if he possessed the spell on a
      spell list. Spells he casts from scrolls always resolve at caster level
      27th.
  - name: Summon Minotaurs (Sp)
    description: >-
      Baphomet can summon half-fiend minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs (see page
      90), and mythic minotaurs as if casting a summon monster spell. He can
      summon eight half-fiend minotaurs three times per day, and four mythic
      minotaurs or one labyrinth minotaur once per day. This ability functions
      as a swift action, but otherwise works like the summon universal monster
      rule with 100% chance of success and counts as a 9th-level spell effect.
  - name: Supernatural Cunning (Su)
    description: >-
      Baphomet is never caught flat-footed and gains a +8 bonus on initiative
      checks. In addition, he's immune to maze spells and can never become lost.
      He always knows the shortest, most direct route through any maze. After
      spending 1 minute in any maze, he understands its entire layout implicitly
      and can teleport to any location using his greater teleport spell-like
      ability.
Description:
  - >-
    Baphomet-Lord of the Minotaurs-was created by Lamashtu from the soul of the
    first minotaur. In those days, he was a powerfully muscled specimen, and the
    Queen of Demons kept him as a consort until the day Baphomet stole away from
    her palace in Yanaron, seeking to gain even greater favor by claiming a
    legendary trophy. Baphomet's ambition was as great as his folly, and he
    invaded the deepest layer of Hell, intent on stealing Asmodeus's ruby rod
    for his mistress. Needless to say, he was swiftly caught. Lamashtu claimed
    no allegiance to him, and Asmodeus imprisoned Baphomet in a devious maze the
    archdevil proclaimed to be unsolvable, even by the first minotaur. The
    archdevil also carved his own symbol into Baphomet's brow with the nail of
    his index finger in an attempt to fully subjugate the minotaur.
  - >-
    But in this attempt, it was Asmodeus who overstepped his bounds. Not only
    did Baphomet solve the seemingly unsolvable maze after a mere decade, but as
    he escaped, he also took the world-sized labyrinth with him. Baphomet had
    changed over that time, becoming almost emaciated in his build, yet growing
    much wiser. He did not return to Lamashtu's side, but instead took the
    archdevil's infernal maze and made it his own as he claimed a portion of the
    Abyss as his realm.
  - >-
    This was eons ago, and now Baphomet is a powerful demon lord in his own
    right. He has forgiven Lamashtu, and serves as her lover now and then, yet
    he's no longer her direct subservient minion. He works to increase the inf
    luence of his cult on countless worlds, building his forces so that one day
    he might again invade Hell. But this time, Baphomet plans on taking much
    more than Asmodeus's weapon-he intends to take Asmodeus's life!
  - Baphomet's Cult
  - >-
    Baphomet is worshiped by conspirators, secret societies, corrupted
    crusaders, and above all else, minotaurs. His minotaur worshipers venerate
    him openly; in their art, Baphomet is typically depicted as a more classical
    bull-headed, minotaur-like creature, and when he deigns to appear before
    these worshipers he often assumes this form. His humanoid worshipers
    venerate him
  - >-
    in secret, offering prayers and sacrifices in hidden shrines and dark
    temples beyond the sight of society and communicating in a complex series of
    hand gestures when in mixed company.
  - >-
    Baphomet has two symbols. To most, including his minotaurs, his symbol is a
    brass minotaur's head with ruby eyes. His secret societies use this symbol
    as well, but also mark his works with the inverted pentagram, sometimes
    decorating the star shape with an image of his face. Baphomet's favored
    weapon is the glaive, although he does not abide any of his followers
    wielding a weapon that looks like Aizerghaul. He grants access to the
    domains of Animal, Chaos, Evil, and Strength, and to the subdomains of
    Demon, Ferocity, Fur, and Resolve.
