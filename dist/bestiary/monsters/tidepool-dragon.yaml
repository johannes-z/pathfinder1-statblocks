Description_Visual: >-
  This small draconic creature seems better suited for the waves than wind, its
  wings sweeping along its body like massive fins. Light from the water refracts
  off its resilient-looking cerulean hide as it snaps crustacean-like claws.

  - name: Attach (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a tidepool dragon hits with a claw attack, it automatically grapples
      its foe, dealing automatic damage with that claw each round.
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      When a tidepool dragon uses its breath weapon underwater, it creates a
      10-foot cone of superheated water rather than a line of fire (as noted
      above). This effect deals the breath weapon's damage to any creatures in
      the cone's area, though victims can still save to take only half damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Aquatic dragons similar in size and fickleness to faerie dragons and
    pseudodragons, tidepool dragons rule as whimsical tyrants over miniature
    realms comprising coral forests, sand dune mountains, and low-tide
    menageries. Preferring to inhabit coastal regions throughout the world's
    warmer climes, these dragon-kin make their lairs amid balmy lagoons and
    hidden coves, favoring any seaside setting devoid of stronger predators. A
    combination of chitinous shell-similar in shade to that of a blue crab-and
    scales the color of clear tropical waters covers every tidepool dragon, the
    shade deepening through twilight hues to a shade as dark as a ocean abyss.
  - >-
    Tidepool dragons typically measure about 2 feet long and weigh approximately
    14 pounds. They are known to live for about 300 years.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Despite their size, tidepool dragons are hardy and well suited to their
    environment. Their sweeping fin-wings work equally well both above and
    beneath the water. While underwater, these dragons use their fins to make
    languid, powerful strokes, propelling them forward in graceful bursts, but
    the strong, flexible musculature beneath the fins also allows them to make
    quick, dramatic turns essential in pursing eels, small fish, and other agile
    prey. Above the water these same appendages work like wings, the membranous
    skin spreading over bones and cartilage to catch currents of air. Many
    observers who have glimpsed these creatures both above and below the waves
    claim that they do not fly so much as swim through the skies. The tiny
    dragons' dense muscle mass, particularly in their tails, allows them to
    create momentum strong enough to break the surface of the water and send
    them skyward in their characteristic glides. Although they prefer to eat
    fish, tidepool dragons often use their flight to chase seabirds off the
    surface of the waves and high into the sky, while the small, tough teeth
    that line every tidepool dragon's mouth can easily crack the hard shells of
    crabs and other shellfish.
  - >-
    The tidepool dragon is amphibious, possessing both gills and lungs, and can
    exist outside of water indefinitely. While it is in flight, muscles stretch
    its gill slits so they lie flat along the body, decreasing resistance to the
    wind. At the apex of the dragon's complex respiratory system, near the base
    of the creature's throat, a pair of small bones hang down. Tidepool dragons
    can vibrate these bones at an almost unthinkable speed, and the furious
    motion gives off intense heat. They can then draw water through their bodies
    from their gills and push it out of their mouths. As this torrent of water
    passes the vibrating bones, it heats to temperatures beyond scalding,
    capable of burning flesh and even melting glass. Even when not submerged,
    tidepool dragons can draw moisture from the air through their gills to power
    their breath weapons. But despite the potency of a tidepool dragon's breath
    when used in flight or on land, these creatures usually employ their breath
    weapons while underwater. When the dragons are submerged, their scalding
    gout of water diffuses into a small cloud of boiling water, allowing them to
    affect entire schools of fish or other groups of prey in a single boiling
    burst.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Tidepool dragons get their name from their tendency to frequent small
    coastal pools, where they bask and sleep because they are usually safe from
    other predators there and their shell-like hides blend well with the
    brilliant colors of local aquatic fauna. Those attempting to capture or
    otherwise contain a tidepool dragon find it a challenging task, as the
    creature's freedom of movement ability makes most nets, ropes, and simple
    attempts to grab it near useless. "Slippery as a tide wyrm" is a phrase
    often bandied about by sailors and other seafarers when trying to cross
    treacherously wet decks or wrestle the rigging of a loose and blowing sail.
  - >-
    Despite being almost impossible to catch, tidepool dragons can be bargained
    with rather readily, as their interests, while fickle, are quite simple.
    Those seeking tidepool dragons' favor-or, at least, hoping not to incur
    their mischief-can make offerings to the dragon, typically in the form of
    coins, gems, or particularly shiny shells so that the miniature wyrms can
    mimic their larger kin. Additionally, most tidepool dragons enjoy rare fish
    that cannot be found in their home waters, or fruits and vegetables from far
    inland that they've never sampled.
  - >-
    Capricious and self-serving, these miniature dragons possess a less savory
    reputation than their faerie dragon or pseudodragon cousins, making enemies
    as easily as they make allies. Highly territorial, most tidepool dragons
    take offense if the waters and coasts near their lairs are intruded upon,
    blasting trespassers with their breath weapons or perpetrating various
    pranks upon them. If satisfied, though-typically by being bribed with shiny
    baubles or salty food-tidepool dragons can prove quite helpful, serving
    other creatures for the promise of more rewards. Clever sailors have been
    known to leave trails of enticing foods in their ships' wakes in an effort
    to draw the attention of tidepool dragons. If successful, a vessel can gain
    a valuable helper, capable of acting as a lookout both far above and far
    below the water. Several aquatic species, such as merfolk, tritons, aquatic
    elves, and even sahuagin, also recognize the benefits of keeping tidepool
    dragons as allies, and some explorers have recorded colonies of such aquatic
    humanoids where well-fed clutches of these dragons act as sentries or
    scouts.
  - >-
    When left to their own devices, tidepool dragons live in small coastal
    caves, usually in mated pairs or related family clutches. These lairs always
    contain exit shafts into the sky beyond since tidepool dragon eggs and new
    hatchlings are a favorite prey of bunyips. Tidepool dragon eggs are about
    the size of a chicken or crocodile egg, but are marked with the same colors
    that will eventually grace the hatchlings' scales. Parents hatch their young
    and then raise them until they are capable of surviving on their own, around
    age 3. At that point, young tidepool dragons set off to find mates and
    indulge their species' rampant curiosity. Single youths also band together
    to form non-familial pods for hunting and adventure.

    Tidepool Dragons as Familiars Although difficult to approach, tidepool
    dragons sometimes choose to serve as the familiars of unruly spellcasters
    and those who go out of their way to feed them rich or exotic foods.
    Spellcasters of 7th level or higher with an alignment within one step of
    chaotic neutral can gain a tidepool dragon as a familiar by taking the
    Improved Familiar feat.
