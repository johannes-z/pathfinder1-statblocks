SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Explosion (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a gorbel is hit with a weapon, spell, or effect that deals piercing
      or slashing damage, it must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage
      taken) or instantly explode, dealing 1d4 points of damage to all creatures
      within 5 feet. This instantly kills the gorbel. Creatures in the affected
      area can attempt a DC 12 Reflex save to reduce the damage by half. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Grab and Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gorbel can bite a grappled opponent as a swift action with a +4 attack
      bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    The gorbel is a strange creature approximately 3 feet in diameter. Its
    reddish skin is a thin but tough and rubbery membrane. The spherical body of
    a gorbel is highly elastic and filled to near bursting with a lighter-than
    air flammable gas that smells of rotten eggs (sulfur). A gorbel eats,
    breathes, and excretes through an aperture best described as a mouth. This
    mouth is lined with a ring of sharp teeth that face inward to help it force
    food into its gullet. Gorbels primarily attack with their claws, only
    resorting to biting after they have latched onto their prey. A gorbel will
    attack and try to eat whatever it thinks is edible - generally including
    anything that moves that is smaller than the gorbel. Its strange metabolic
    processes instill it with an almost insatiable hunger. Credit The Gorbel
