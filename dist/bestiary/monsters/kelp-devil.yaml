    description: >-
      Twice per day, on a successful hit with a frond, a kelp devil can affect
      the opponent as by charm monster (caster level 12th). The creature can
      make a DC 18 save DC to resist the effects. The save DC is

  - name: Underwater Concealment (Ex)
    description: >-
      The main body of a kelp devil remains submerged even when attacking. This
      grants it concealment (20% miss chance) against all attacks.
Description:
  - >-
    Kelp devils are relatives of kelpies and are believed to have once been of
    that race before being subjected to vile and evil experiments that placed
    them in their current state. To the casual observer, the kelp devil
    resembles a large colony of slow moving seaweed about 20 feet in diameter. A
    closer look reveals six 10-foot long pseudopods extending from its body.
  - >-
    Kelp devils are patient creatures. They lie perfectly motionless until
    potential prey moves within 10 feet. Once their prey is within range, they
    strike quickly with their pseudopods, attempting to grab an opponent.
  - >-
    Grappled creatures are dragged underwater and drowned. Slain creatures are
    devoured by the kelp devil.
