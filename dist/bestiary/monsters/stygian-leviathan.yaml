Description_Visual: >-
  A gigantic whale, twice the size of ship surfaces. Its dark gray flesh
  contrasts hideously with the yellowish-white of its underbelly. It cuts
  through the water with a short, gray- mottled gray dorsal fin with a sharp
  curve. Its enormous mouth is lined with nearly 600 teeth of white or pale
  ivory color.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Capsize (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Stygian leviathan can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as
      a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the
      result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher.
      For each size category the ship is larger than the leviathan's size, the
      leviathan takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.
  - name: Stygian Poisoning (Su)
    description: >-
      The Stygian leviathan's stomach contains large quantities of water from
      the River Styx. Each round a swallowed opponent must succeed at a DC Swim
      or the swallowed creature slips underwater. Thereafter they must make a
      successful DC Fortitude save each round or be affected as by a feeblemind
      spell.
Description:
  - >-
    The Stygian leviathan is the largest known creature swimming the River Styx.
    Very few inhabitants bother this monster and it has no known natural
    enemies.
  - >-
    It spends its time swimming throughout the Styx, gulping massive quantities
    of Stygian plants and aquatic life (such as fiendish octopi and fiendish
    krakens). Occasionally, it slips through a portal that leads to other
    planes-most often these portals carry it to the Material Plane. On the
    Material Plane, the Stygian leviathan doesn't deviate from its course-it
    simply swims about devouring whatever happens to get in its way. Some, on
    the other hand, actively hunt aquatic animals, preferring their flesh to the
    other more mundane food these monsters usually consume.
  - >-
    These beasts are solitary creatures and no more than a single leviathan has
    ever been encountered at one time (thankfully). Mating and reproduction
    cycles and methods are unknown and have never been documented.
  - >-
    These monsters are hunted by demons and devils for their flesh, which is
    used for food. Also, the teeth of dead Stygian leviathans are sometimes
    taken and fashioned into weapons of war.
  - >-
    A Stygian leviathan attacks by simply swimming over its foes, opening its
    mouth, and swallowing them (and perhaps their ship if such a vessel is
    involved). Swallowed foes are drowned and digested.
