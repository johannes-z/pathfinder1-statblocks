SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adhesive (Ex)
    description: >-
      A neomimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding
      fast any creatures or items that touch it. An adhesive-covered neomimic
      automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack.
      Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the neomimic is alive without
      removing the adhesive first. A weapon that strikes an adhesive-coated
      neomimic is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save.
      A successful DC 17 Strength check is needed to pry off a stuck weapon.
      Strong alcohol or universal solvent dissolves the adhesive, but the
      neomimic can still grapple normally. A neomimic can dissolve its adhesive
      at will, and the substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies.
      The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Alter Physique (Ex)
    description: >-
      At will as a standard action, a neomimic can alter its physical structure
      to affect its physique. A neomimic can shift points between its Strength,
      Dexterity, or Constitution by reducing one or more of the scores while
      raising one or more by the same amount. The neomimic can shift no more
      than 12 points at one time and no score can be raised or lowered by more
      than 10 points. For example, a neomimic can reduce its Strength from 19 to
      10 while increasing its Dexterity from 14 to 18. It could not, however,
      decrease its Strength to less than 9, or increase its Dexterity to greater
      than 24. These changes remain in effect until the neomimic uses this
      ability again.
Description:
  - >-
    Unlike its lesser kin, the skin of a neomimic is soft and fleshy, and it
    cannot substantially alter its texture to appear as wood or stone. When
    taking the form of a creature of any kind, a neomimic cannot assume the form
    of a specific individual. Anyone who examines the neomimic can detect the
    ruse with a successful Perception check opposed by the neomimic's Disguise
    check.
  - >-
    The neomimic is thought by sages to be an advanced species of mimic perhaps
    from some distant future or unknown plane. Neomimics may also be somehow
    related to doppelgangers, but any such relationship has not been proven.
  - >-
    In its natural state, a neomimic is an amorphous blob of fleshy substance
    approximately 5 feet across. Its skin is the color of dead tissue, a
    sickening grey-green hue tinged here and there with what appears to be
    healthy human skin. Like normal mimics, a neomimic can assume nearly any
    shape it can conceive. A neomimic often takes humanoid form, however, and
    rarely resorts to taking the shape of inanimate objects.
  - A neomimic in its natural form is 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.
  - >-
    In its natural form or the form of an inanimate object, a neomimic pounds
    its opponent with powerful fist-shaped pseudopods in much the same way as a
    normal mimic. While in the form of a creature, however, a neomimic strives
    to fight as much as possible like the creature it is emulating.
