Description:
  - >-
    Ice drakes are found in cold mountainous caves and caverns. Most encounters
    are with a solitary drake. Only in the winter months is it common to find a
    mated pair or family. An ice drake's scales are white, and it is often
    mistaken for a young white dragon. Ice drakes range from 3 feet to 6 feet
    long.
  - >-
    An ice drake opens combat from the air using its icy breath weapon. If it
    expends its breath weapon, it relies on its claws and bite to finish off any
    remaining opponents.
