Description_Visual: >-
  This beautiful and yet disturbing flower resembles a man-sized sunflower that
  grows daggers instead of petals and has a great, round eye in its center. From
  its thin stem a small iron shield and a needle thin rapier sprout. Suddenly,
  the thing stirs.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dagger Wind (Ex)
    description: >-
      A war flower can lunch all its dagger-petals in all directions at once.
      Every creature in a 30 ft. radius must succeed a DC 18 Reflex save or be
      hit by 1d4 daggers for 1d4+2 damage each. This attack is usually performed
      when the flower is mortally wounded or hopelessly outnumbered. The save DC
      is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Thin Stem (Ex)
    description: >-
      A war flower has a thin and fragile stem. The thin stem makes it extremely
      vulnerable to slashing weapons. A war flower that suffers a critical hit
      from a slashing weapon must make a Fortitude save equal to DC 10 + the
      damage dealt or die as result of its stem being chopped in two.
Description:
  - >-
    War flowers were among of the first of the Tree That Sees creations (see The
    Hollow Mountain from Frog God Games for more information on the Tree That
    Sees), a union of the gentleness and beauty of the flower with the grace and
    deadliness of a rapier. Although only slightly smarter than normal flowers
    they nevertheless can follow one-word orders, tell the difference between
    friends and foes and fight with unpredictable style and elegance.
  - >-
    War flowers usually wait until an enemy comes close enough to rain a hail of
    daggers on him before charging with their rapiers. Since they are nearly
    mindless they fight until either they or their designated target are dead.
  - >-
    The group stumbles upon a group of warflowers lying in ambush for any
    trespassers into the Tree That Sees' realm. There is a 20% chance for a dead
    adventurer along with his treasure to lie in the area.
