  Resembling nothing so much as a large rodent that stands on its powerful hind
  legs, this brown mammal has a long tail and short arms that end in
  five-fingered paws.

Description:
  - >-
    Wallabies are squat mammals that hail from a distant land far from the Inner
    Sea. The wallaby is often mistakenly identified as a small kangaroo. Like
    all marsupials, wallabies carry their newborn young in pouches at the front
    of their bodies. The wallaby defends itself using its strong hind legs,
    which it can launch quickly from under its body to deliver a powerful kick
    that sends would-be predators reeling. A wallaby stands about 2 feet tall
    and weighs 20-40 pounds.
