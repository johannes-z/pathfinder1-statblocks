SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fated (Su)
    description: >-
      A norn adds her Charisma modifier as an insight bonus to AC and on
      initiative checks.
  - name: Shears (Su)
    description: >-
      A norn's shears function as a +5 mithral keen speed scimitar, but only for
      a norn.
  - name: Shift Fate (Su)
    description: >-
      As an immediate action, a norn can force any one target within 120 feet to
      reroll a saving throw-this ability must be used immediately after the
      saving throw is rolled, and the target must abide by the result of this
      second roll.
  - name: Snip Thread (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action up to three times per day but no more often than once
      every 1d4 rounds, a norn may produce a golden thread linked to a
      creature's fate and then attempt to snip it short with her shears. The
      target creature must be within 120 feet and in the norn's line of sight.
      The target immediately takes 20d6 points of damage (Fortitude DC 30 half).
      If the target dies from this damage, the norn has cut through the
      thread-in this case, the target may only be restored to life via miracle,
      wish, or divine intervention. This is a death effect. The Save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Ancient beyond imagining, the norns are a race of powerful women who hold in
    their hands the physical manifestation of fate and destiny in the form of
    golden thread. They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when
    called upon or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and
    abused by lesser beings. Worshiped as gods by some, the norns do little to
    discourage this veneration.
  - A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.
