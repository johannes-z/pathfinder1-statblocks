SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Climb Stone (Ex)

      A copper dragon can climb on stone surfaces as though using the spider
      climb spell.
  - name: Deadly Joke (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day, as a standard action, a great wyrm copper dragon can tell a
      joke that kills. This affects one target, and functions as power word
      kill. This is a language-dependent sonic effect.
  - name: Mass Laughter (Sp)
    description: >-
      An ancient copper dragon can tell a fantastic joke once per day as a
      standard action. All creatures within 10 feet per age category must make a
      Will save or laugh for 1 round per age category, as if affected by hideous
      laughter. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is equal to a 6th-level
      spell.
  - name: Slow Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      An old or older copper dragon is surrounded by an aura of slowness. All
      creatures within 5 feet of the dragon must make a Will save or be affected
      as per slow for 1 round. An ancient dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. For
      great wyrm copper dragons, those opponents that fail their saves are
      slowed for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to the dragon's breath
      weapon. A copper dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a
      free action.
  - name: Slow Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Instead of a line of acid, a copper dragon can breathe a cone of slowing
      gas. Those in the cone must make a Fortitude save or be slowed (as per the
      spell slow) for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.
  - name: Trap Master (Ex)
    description: >-
      A juvenile or older copper dragon receives a +1 bonus per age category on
      Craft (traps) and Perception checks made to locate a trap. Upon becoming a
      mature adult, he can also use Disable Device to disarm magic traps as if
      he had the rogue's Trapfinding class feature.
Description:
  - >-
    This whimsical dragon spends most of its time in combat trying to annoy and
    frustrate its enemies.
