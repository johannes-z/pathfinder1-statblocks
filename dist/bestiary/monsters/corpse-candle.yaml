SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hypnotic Lights (Su)
    description: >-
      The corpse candle possesses the ability to create a dancing, twisting
      pattern of ever-shifting lights that slowly change colors. The corpse
      candle can create these lights within 20 feet of itself, covering an area
      in a 10- foot radius spread (usually underwater). Creatures viewing the
      pattern within 50 feet must make a successful Will save (DC 18) or become
      fascinated. If the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected
      again by that corpse candle's hypnotic lights for one day. The lights
      remain for as long as the corpse candle concentrates plus 1 minute. The
      save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. A fascinated
      victim moves toward the lights, taking the most direct route available at
      its normal movement rate. The creature avoids certain dangers (walking off
      a cliff, walking through fire, etc.) and skirts around such obstructions
      if possible, but it will swim towards the light if necessary, paying no
      heed to the need for air. If no path to the light is available, the
      fascination is broken. Any living creature within the area of light at the
      end of its turn takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage. This is a death
      effect.
Description:
  - >-
    Corpse candles are formed when creatures are sacrificed by ritualistic
    drowning to a sea or water deity. The fear of dying coupled with the hatred
    of the ones performing the ritual infuses the victims' spirit with energy
    that often lingers in the area and empowers the corpse with unlife, raising
    it as a corpse candle. Corpse candles hate the living, and have a particular
    dislike for clerics. Corpse candles are bound to the area of their death in
    the sense that they cannot leave that particular body of water (be it a sea,
    river, lake, or ocean).
  - >-
    A corpse candle appears as a translucent image of its living self. Its body
    shows little, if any, signs of death, though as its "ages", the corpse
    candle's translucence seems to grow faint and fade (as if a light were
    burning out). Some sages have researched this phenomenon and believe that
    corpse candles can actually die of old age. Perhaps some remnant of their
    former lives binds them to the mortal world or perhaps sages are just
    reaching for answers to some unknown equation.
  - >-
    Corpse candles detest the living and seek to lure wayfarers to their doom
    using trickery and misdirection. Corpse candles use their ability of
    deception to lure unsuspecting victims to their doom. When a corpse candle
    successfully fascinates a creature, it waits until the creature draws near
    and then attacks relentlessly with its incorporeal claws.
  - >-
    Corpse candles are particularly fond of luring sailors, swimmers, and other
    seafarers to their watery graves by first fascinating them, draining sapping
    them of their strength, and finally allowing them to drown as the lights sap
    their vitality. Drowned victims are left as food for any aquatic carnivores
    in the area.
