    description: >-
      A shikigami gains Catch Off-Guard and Throw Anything as bonus feats, and
      adds its Charisma modifier instead of its Strength modifier to damage done
      with any improvised weapon, as attacks it makes with such weapons seem
      supernaturally lucky in landing damaging blows. Although a shikigami is
      Tiny, it never provokes attacks of opportunity when it attacks an adjacent
      foe with a melee weapon. If a shikigami critically hits an opponent with
      an improvised weapon, it deals x3 damage. A shikigami is proficient with
      improvised weapons.
Description:
  - >-
    Shikigami are the least of the kami, yet they make up for their lowly status
    with their loyalty and bravery. Unlike most other well-known types of kami,
    shikigami are more often associated with rural and urban regions than with
    natural settings. These kami are the protectors of the minor works of
    civilization-things like milestones, waymarkers, tiny garden statues, and
    other relatively mundane works of art crafted by humanoid hands.
  - >-
    No two shikigami look exactly alike, as befits a race of kami that
    associates with such a wide range of wards. While all shikigami have the
    ability to merge with their wards, these kami are also fond of spending time
    in their physical forms, watching over their wards either invisibly or in
    the form of a tiny statue. In combat, a shikigami fights with whatever
    objects it finds at hand. Although relatively weak, these improvised weapons
    have an uncanny knack for hitting harder than they should.
  - >-
    Shikigami are as friendly and curious as other kami, but they are quick to
    leave an area they see as being polluted by ideals that disrupt the virtues
    of nature. When they do, they generally take their wards with them. They do
    not engage humanoids who desecrate the environment, but their absence leaves
    a profound mark on the morale of perceptive villagers. Should the shikigami
    leave, town officials who know the function of the miniature kami are quick
    to change policies in their community to ref lect a more naturalistic
    approach, hoping to rekindle the relationship between shikigami and people,
    lest the community fall into the disfavor of more powerful and less passive
    kami.
  - >-
    Shikigami typically stand 2 feet tall and weigh 30 pounds, or 50 pounds when
    taking their statue forms. A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar
    feat, an alignment of lawful neutral, and an arcane caster level of 7th or
    higher to gain a shikigami familiar. Whenever a shikigami becomes a
    familiar, it treats its master as its ward.
