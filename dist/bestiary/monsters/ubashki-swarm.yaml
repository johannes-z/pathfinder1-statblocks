SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ubashki Fever: Injury; save Fort DC 13; onset 1d3 days; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d2 Str damage and 1d2 Wis damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. A
      creature afflicted by ubashki fever develops unsightly splotches and sores
      all over its body that persist until the disease is cured. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Perhaps no beasts were trusted into the afterlife so much as felines,
    however, who were almost without exception buried alongside deceased
    pharaohs or at the very least inscribed into their burial chamber walls.
    Those cats that rose from the dead- either because of the foul magical
    energies of a pharaoh's crypt or thanks to the necromantic magic of a
    restless undead pharaoh herself-were known as ubashki.
  - >-
    Ubashki were prized for being stealthy, agile, and preternaturally
    perceptive sentries that made for effective spies and watch guards for the
    tombs of Osirian god-kings. Emperors often filled their crypts with the
    bodies of strangled and mutilated cats before they themselves were entombed,
    believing that a feline's suffering in life would translate to strength in
    undeath.
  - >-
    Whether or not such theories were true is up for debate, but those felid
    creatures that did rise from death with their masters were indeed beasts to
    be reckoned with, and a sizeable pack of the mummified things could very
    well spell the end for would-be tomb raiders. Ranging from tiny housecats to
    desert-roaming mountain lions, the feline enshrined with a deceased pharaoh
    varied in type depending on the predilections of its master, but all were
    known to be signif icantly more powerful than their living iterations.
