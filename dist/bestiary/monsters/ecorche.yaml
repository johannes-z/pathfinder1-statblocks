  - name: Seize Skin (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever an ecorche damages a target with its rend ability, the target
      must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save to resist being skinned alive.
      Those who fail the save become staggered and take 1 point of Constitution
      drain per round. Both of these effects are permanent but can be removed
      with a regenerate or heal spell (or 1 round of regeneration). The ecorche
      can use its wear skin ability to don a skin stolen in this way as a
      full-round action. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The bodyguards and spies of undead masterminds, ecorches appear as gory
    giants with musculatures overdeveloped by infusions of necromantic toxins
    and grafts of reanimated sinew. Although its natural form possesses no skin,
    an ecorche can steal the flesh of another creature, flaying its victim in
    mere seconds and leaving it in unimaginable shock and pain with only moments
    to seek aid before perishing. Yet this gruesome act of violence is only the
    first stage of the chaos an ecorche spreads with its violence.
  - >-
    An ecorche possesses incredible control over its gruesome form, allowing it
    to compress its body into the skin of a much smaller creature. Wearing such
    grisly garb, these terrors walk among the living, doing the bidding of their
    terrible masters or searching for more inf luential individuals to murder,
    skin, and impersonate. If an ecorche's unholy nature is revealed, the
    monster is quick to dispose of its nowuseless disguise, bursting from the
    suit of flesh and exposing its terrible form to the unprepared, few of whom
    can withstand such unabashed gore.
  - >-
    An ecorche stands approximately 8-1/2 feet tall and weighs upward of 600
    pounds.
