Description_Visual: >-
  This tall, three-legged fiend possesses an avian body and head, save for its
  gangly arms, which end in thin, clawlike fingers. Its scrawny neck is adorned
  with three thick iron rings, and a grotesquely long, barbed tongue resembling
  an octopus's tentacle winds out of its oversized beak. Burst blood vessels
  fill the creature's wide eyes, and reddish speckled blotches cover its
  cyanotic flesh.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Concussive Gasp (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a suspiridaemon can inhale with such sudden force as to
      evacuate the air in its proximity, causing a sudden wave of air pressure
      from the implosion. Every creature within 30 feet must make a DC 18
      Fortitude save or take 5d6 points of sonic damage and become sickened for
      1d4 rounds. Any creature that makes a successful save takes only half
      damage and is not sickened. A suspiridaemon cannot perform this ability if
      it is currently grappling a creature with its tongue. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Strangle (Ex)
    description: >-
      Suspiridaemons have an unerring talent for seizing their victims by the
      neck. A creature that is grappled by a suspiridaemon cannot speak or cast
      spells with verbal components.
  - name: Suffocate (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature affected by the daemon's strangle ability cannot breathe and
      must hold its breath. Because of the daemon's thin air aura, this can
      quickly render an opponent unconscious.
  - name: Thin Air (Su)
    description: >-
      A suspiridaemon's aura makes the air around it difficult to breathe.
      Creatures that need to breathe can only hold their breath half as long as
      normal while within this aura, and suffer from altitude sickness as if in
      a low peak or high pass (see Altitude Zones, Core Rulebook 430).
Description:
  - >-
    Horrid fiends whose very presence makes the air difficult to breathe,
    suspiridaemons personify death by suffocation. Discolored and blotched like
    the stagnant blood of a suffocated corpse, a suspiridaemon enjoys nothing
    more than the last choked gasp of a victim as it wraps its tongue around the
    creature's throat. While a suspiridaemon does not normally breathe, its body
    is nonetheless convulsive and twitchy; coupled with its utterly silent
    demeanor, they excel at slow, gruesome kills while hiding in the shadows.
    The only time a suspiridaemon makes a noticeable noise is when it suddenly
    loosens the binds around its neck and inhales a booming breath, the sudden
    loss of air enough to make foes fall ill.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    A suspiridaemon arises from an evil soul that died by suffocation, drowning,
    or execution by hanging. Each individual suspiridaemon bears the mark of its
    particular manner of mortal death-usually in the form of the bruised or
    mangled flesh of its throat-and the large iron collars around its neck hide
    such shameful reminders of life, though the suspiridaemon itself is often
    unaware of this. A suspiridaemon comes into being with the rings already
    bound around its throat, so that it never witnesses the aff lictions that
    sent it to Abaddon in the first place. It is thought that should the collars
    around a suspiridaemon's throat ever be broken, the fiend's head would crook
    clumsily downward, allowing the monster to see wounds that might remind it
    of the terrible death it endured in its past existence.
  - >-
    Suspiridaemons pride themselves on the number of souls they have deprived of
    life by strangulation, and this amount often corresponds to the number of
    iron rings a suspiridaemon wears on its body. While most suspiridaemons are
    relatively weak compared to their daemonic kin, a particularly skillful
    individual who is talented at crafting as well as killing can construct iron
    collars adorned with gem slots, items that give the suspiridaemon the
    ability to contain the souls of its victims in the rings for trade in the
    soul markets of Abaddon. When a suspiridaemon is slain, its iron rings
    disintegrate into ash, and any gems held within are shattered as well,
    freeing the trapped souls.
  - >-
    A suspiridaemon generally uses stealth when confronting foes. Unleashing its
    long, winding tongue from a dark corner, one of these fiends will strangle
    an unwary foe in isolation from the rest of the creature's party. When in
    combat, a suspiridaemon greatly prefers to kill its enemies by its own hands
    or its barbed tongue, using its arcane abilities and other daemonic gifts to
    wear down or sow discord into a group of opponents. To a suspiridaemon,
    there is no act more appreciable than choking the life from a victim, and
    bringing the creature close to hear its final, distorted gasp.
  - >-
    A suspiridaemon prefers to take souls from creatures who are on the verge of
    death, but aren't quite there yet; the fiend gazes at its victim's expiring
    face, drawing the dying creature's soul out of it with a solemn suspension
    of the daemon's normal twitching and convulsing. Those who have witnessed a
    suspiridaemon draw the life from a creature claim that the fiend almost
    seems to be inhaling fresh air for the first time as the victim's physical
    shell expires, and for the briefest moment, the monster appears to breathe
    normally. The eerie spectacle ends as quickly as it begins, however, as the
    suspiridaemon sets its gaze upon its next victim, preparing its vicious
    tongue for another attack.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    While many daemons dedicate their loyalty to one of the Horsemen or some
    other power within Abaddon, either based on their origins, historical ties,
    or environmental circumstances, no such proclivities exist for
    suspiridaemons. Suspiridaemons avoid operating under masters whenever
    possible, preferring more individualistic careers of murder and destruction.
    They tend to work well with other daemons when forced into doing so, though
    the more daring individuals tend to stray from Abaddon and gravitate toward
    population centers on other planes to stalk prey as they please.
    Suspiridaemons traversing the multiverse in a pack regularly take their
    small hunting parties into the wilderness around smaller settlements,
    ravenous in their pursuit of those who stray from the protective gazes of
    allies. While their killing tactics are as ruthless as any other daemon,
    suspiridaemons' murders are particularly shrouded in a cold manner of
    sincere and solemn contemplation, their grisly crimes against souls veiled
    in a mist of contempt toward the living as well as hatred for themselves.
    Some speculate that this self-hatred might be connected to the lingering
    doubts as to their origins, the itch beneath their iron collars that reminds
    them of their own past mortality. Whatever the cause of their self-doubt,
    the feeling does not seem to bother most other daemons, who generally view
    suspiridaemons as useful companions whether inside or outside of Abaddon.
    Piscodaemons and sangudaemons in particular consider them among the most
    ideal lesser daemons to command.
  - >-
    Suspiridaemons cannot speak, and rarely use their powers of telepathy to
    communicate, simply nodding discreetly when given a task by a more powerful
    daemon. This silent subservience only adds to other daemons' general
    appreciation of their humble and disturbing demeanors, though most are sure
    to keep the strangling fiends at a distance.
