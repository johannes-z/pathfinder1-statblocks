Description:
  - >-
    Porcupines are omnivorous mammals that often climb trees in search of food.
    The spines on their back provide camouflage as well as protection from
    natural predators- typically other small mammals. Though primarily
    nocturnal, porcupines do occasionally graze during the day, eating the
    twigs, roots, and stems of bushes, coniferous trees, and other flora.
    Porcupine quills normally lie flat against the creature's body, but stand
    stiff ly on end when the porcupine feels threatened.
