Description_Visual: >-
  A horrid walking corpse appears, arrayed in brightly colored clothes, floppy
  shoes, and a bright red jester's hat complete with jingling bells sewn to the
  ends of the cap. The rigor mortis seems to have permanently pulled the
  creature's face into a broad and horrific grin.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear Cackle (Su)
    description: >-
      A red jester can unleash a fear-inducing cackle as a free action. All
      creatures within 60 feet that hear it must make a successful DC 22 Will
      save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. Panicked creatures suffer a -2
      morale penalty on saves and flee (if possible). A panicked creature has a
      50% chance to drop what it's holding. If cornered or unable to flee, a
      panicked creature cowers. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect.
      Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to
      that red jester's fear cackle for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
      Jester's
  - name: Deck (Su)
    description: >-
      The red jester uses a deck of playing cards in combat that functions as a
      deck of many things (Pathfinder RPG core rulebook, 544-555). Once per
      round, as a standard action, the red jester can draw a single card and
      throw it at an opponent to a range of 20 feet. This requires a successful
      ranged touch attack. If successful, the card takes effect that round and
      affects the target just as if he had drawn a card from a deck of many
      things. A red jester can draw the same card more than once. The playing
      cards only function in the hands of a red jester. To anyone else, they are
      merely normal playing cards.
  - name: Merriment (Su)
    description: >-
      If a red jester strikes an opponent with its mace, the creature must make
      a successful DC 20 Will save or fall to the ground laughing for 1d3
      rounds. The opponent is not helpless, but is unable to move or act for the
      duration. A mace of merriment functions only in the hands of a red jester.
      In the hands of any other creature it functions as a masterwork light
      mace.
  - name: Unassailable Mind (Ex)
    description: >-
      The mind of a red jester is a twisted and dangerous place to journey.
      Being undead, it is immune to all mind-influencing effects and should a
      creature target the mind of a red jester with such an effect (including
      psionics, telepathy, or the like), the creature attempting to invade the
      red jester's mind must make a successful DC Will save or suffer the
      effects of an insanity spell (caster level 15th). The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Red jesters are thought to be the undead form of court jesters having been
    put to death for telling bad jokes, making fun of the local ruler, or dying
    in an untimely manner (which could be attributed to one or both of the first
    two). Another legend speaks of the red jesters as being the court jesters of
    Orcus, Demon Prince of the Undead, sent to the Material Plane to "entertain"
    those the demon prince has chosen to pay special attention to. The actual
    truth to their origin remains a mystery. While they can be encountered from
    the coldest to the warmest regions of the world and on any type of terrain,
    a red jester is generally encountered near civilized areas. Though it is
    dead (or undead) now, it still delights in entertaining living creatures
    through its humor and obviously cannot do that if it resides far away in
    unsettled lands. Some red jesters, in an effort to disguise their undead
    nature don masks or wear makeup. Red jesters speak Common and at least two
    other languages and often engage in humor during combat, spilling bad puns
    and riddles at their opponents. A red jester opens combat using its fear
    cackle attempting to affect as many opponents as possible. Those that resist
    its effects are assailed with its magical playing cards and mace. During the
    entire combat, the red jester talks, laughs, and tells jokes and riddles.
