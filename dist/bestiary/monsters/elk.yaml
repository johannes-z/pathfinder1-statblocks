Description:
  - >-
    Elk range in great herds throughout the plains, hills, and forests of many
    wilderness areas. Their size, strength, and antlers allow them to contend
    with most of their environment's dangers, though herds generally favor
    flight to combat. Elk also prove exceptionally adaptable survivors, capable
    of living through severe weather changes without concern. Most breeds of elk
    stand between 3 and 5 feet tall and weigh between 350 and 550 pounds, with
    females far slighter than the males.
  - >-
    Numerous species of elk exist. Some larger species can stand up to 6 feet
    tall at the shoulder and can be used as mounts by Medium humanoids; these
    elk have 3 Hit Dice and are Large. One particularly unusual species of elk,
    the river elk, is an excellent swimmer-these elk gain a swim speed of 30
    feet. All elk of this size are CR 2 creatures.
