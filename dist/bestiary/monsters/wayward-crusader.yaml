    Yet the long road from Taldor took her through Numeria, and here she found a
    cause perhaps as great, and with far fewer ready to stand with her on the
    side of compassion and righteousness. Now she quests to bring justice to
    Sovereign's Reach and mercy to the Felldales, and is always in search of
    stout hearts to stand beside her. She preaches the glory of the Inheritor to
    those in search of meaning and answers, but recognizes the universal truths
    behind all good faiths.

    PCs adventuring in Numeria may run across or even be rescued by this wayward
    crusader, and she doesn't hesitate to enlist them in her cause. For
    low-level PCs she can serve as a powerful ally and mentor, while companions
    who surpass her in power could even claim her crusade for their own.
