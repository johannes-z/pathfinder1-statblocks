SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adrenal Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Twice per day, an encephalon gorger can create an effect on itself
      equivalent to a haste spell (caster level 10th).
  - name: Mindfeed (Su)
    description: >-
      If an encephalon gorger begins its turn grappling an opponent, it can
      attempt to suck its brain fluid with a successful grapple check. If it
      pins the foe, it drains cerebral fluid, dealing 1d4 points of Intelligence
      drain each round the pin is maintained. On each successful mindfeed
      attack, the encephalon gorger gains 5 temporary hit points. This ability
      does not work against nonliving creatures or creatures without a central
      brain mass. The encephalon gorger must be able to reach the head or neck
      of the target creature to use this ability.
  - name: Mindsense (Su)
    description: >-
      As a move action, an encephalon gorger can gauge the relative intelligence
      level of any creature within 60 feet as follows: unintelligent, animal
      (Int 1-2), low (3-8), average (8-12), high (13-16), genius (17-20), or
      supra-genius (21+).
  - name: Mind Screen (Ex)
    description: >-
      The mind of an encephalon gorger is an alien and dangerous place. Should a
      creature attempt to scan the mind or read the thoughts of an encephalon
      gorger (with detect thoughts, telepathy, or the like), it must make a
      successful (DC 20) Will save or be driven permanently insane (as by an
      insanity spell, caster level 15th); if the save succeeds, the creature is
      instead confused (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is
      Intelligence-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Encephalon gorgers (sometimes known as cranial vampires) are malevolent
    creatures from another dimension or plane of existence. They are greatly
    feared by intelligent creatures for they use such beings (their brain fluid
    to be exact) to power their great cities. Many of these creatures have
    constructed strongholds or outposts on the Material Plane, though it is
    unknown when they first appeared.
  - >-
    Encephalon gorgers dislike for direct sunlight, though they are not harmed
    by it. When traveling aboveground in daylight hours, they usually cloak
    themselves in robes of gray or black. The gorger's leathery, whitish flesh
    is nearly translucent and in older encephalon gorgers one can faintly see
    veins and other organs pushing grayish-brown blood through its body.
  - >-
    This creature is completely hairless and its eyes are small with nictitating
    membranes. Its mouth is lined with short, needlelike teeth, with the canines
    being most pronounced (perhaps the reason these monsters are sometimes
    called cranial vampires).
  - >-
    Encephalon gorgers enter battle using their claws to slash and grapple their
    foes, going first for targets with the most delicious, intelligent brains.
    Once it grabs its prey it sinks its teeth into the foe's head, draining it
    of cerebral fluid. However, an encephalon gorger will not put itself in
    danger by ignoring other threats around it, so generally it only drinks when
    all of its other foes are either dead or engaged with others of its kind.
    Encephalon gorgers often make use of slave creatures and dumb beasts to
    engage an enemy's warriors while it sidles behind its chosen victim.
  - >-
    Often times, an encephalon gorger attempts to capture rather than kill its
    prey, especially in the case of intelligent humanoids. Captured prey is
    taken to one of their alien cities, where it is handed over to the Breeders
    who tend the slave pits.
  - >-
    Encephalon gorgers advance by character level; many have levels in wizard or
    psionic-oriented classes. At least one such gorger capable of interplanar
    travel is always present in any Prime Material Plane outpost.
  - >-
    Encephalon Gorger Society Encephalon gorgers refer to themselves as Silians
    and they make their homes deep beneath the surface world or hidden far away
    from prying eyes (cloaked by natural occurrences such as fog or mist or
    hidden by magic). Underground lairs resemble great domed cities, while those
    on the surface resemble iron fortresses of exquisite craftsmanship. Each
    lair, regardless of its location, has dozens of slave pits and breeding pens
    filled with captured, intelligent humanoids (or other creatures). The slaves
    are maintained by a specialized group of silians called the Breeders. It is
    their job to tend to food supply of the city at all times and to gauge the
    relative worth of each and every humanoid used by the gorgers for feeding.
  - >-
    Encephalon gorgers sometimes trade with other races, usually trading for
    slaves, which are taken to the Breeders. Other slaves are kept by particular
    encephalon gorgers and assigned menial tasks. Once such a slave has
    exhausted its usefulness, it is "recycled" in the food pens so long as it
    isn't dead. Dead slaves are discarded, ground up into a bland paste that is
    fed to the other slaves.
  - >-
    Little is known of particulars regarding the gorger's society; such as
    reproduction, lifespan, aging patterns and so on. A few things that are
    known come from a group of adventurers that saw one of the iron fortresses
    and lived to tell about it. They spoke of large vats filled with cranial
    fluid maintained by the Breeders and of young silian being grown in these
    vats. They also spoke of the horrid squalor of the breeding pits and the
    slaves kept in them.
