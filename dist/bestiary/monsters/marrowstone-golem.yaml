  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoid creature that is slain by a marrowstone golem rises from
      death as a free-willed ghoul in 24 hours. A creature with four or more
      class levels rises as a ghast instead. In either case, the ghoul or ghast
      has a 25% chance of retaining whatever class levels it had in life.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      A marrowstone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that
      allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the golem, as noted below. • A transmute rock to mud
      spell slows a marrowstone golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with
      no saving throw. • Effects that heal undead heal half that amount of
      damage to a marrowstone golem, to a limit of its full normal hit points. •
      A marrowstone golem that fails its save against a magical attack that
      deals positive energy damage (including the channel energy ability when
      used to harm undead, but not when used to heal living creatures) does not
      take any damage from the attack, but it loses its create spawn ability,
      its necrotic field aura, and the negative energy damage from its slam
      attack for 1d4 rounds.
  - name: Necrotic Field (Su)
    description: >-
      Undead within 30 feet of a marrowstone golem gain a +2 resistance bonus on
      saving throws, increase the save DCs of their extraordinary and
      supernatural abilities by 2, and gain a +4 bonus to channel resistance.
      Positive energy effects cause only half damage to a creature within the
      marrowstone golem's aura. Their aura particularly strengthens ghouls and
      ghasts, giving them a +2 bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls.
Description:
  - >-
    Carved from rock hewn from the marrowstone mines of Sekamina, these golems
    amplify the magical radiation emitted by veins of lazurite. They can only be
    crafted within the necropolis of Nemret Noktoria, land of ghouls, for
    lazurite brought beyond its boundaries loses its potency. Binding the
    lazurite into the body of the golem stabilizes it and lets the construct
    leave the boundaries of the ghoulish city with its fell powers intact.
  - >-
    Though the ghouls guard the secrets of making a marrowstone golem, they are
    sometimes known to trade their handiwork with outsiders.

    A marrowstone golem's body is chiseled from a single block of marrowstone
    weighing at least 2,500 pounds. Marrowstone can only be found in the
    necropolis of Nemret Noktoria in the Darklands realm of Sekamina. Preparing
    the stone requires the use of exotic unguents that cost 2,500 gp.
