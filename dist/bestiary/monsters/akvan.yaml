Description_Visual: >-
  Ornate armor covers this hulking creature, rocky protrusions jutting from its
  hide and fierce horns crowning its broad head.
Group: Div
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 3
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Armor Training (Ex)
    description: >-
      An akvan is created wearing armor, and is naturally experienced in its
      use. An akvan possesses the armor training ability of a 15th-level
      fighter.
  - name: Aura of Hopelessness (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures except divs within 30 feet of an akvan must make a
      successful DC 30 Will save or take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving
      throws, skill checks, and ability checks. This is a mind-affecting effect.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Create Ghul (Su)
    description: >-
      Any genie that is slain by an akvan becomes a ghul (see page 125) in 1d4
      rounds. Such ghuls are under the command of the akvan that created them
      and remain enslaved until it dies, at which point they become free-willed
      ghuls. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
  - name: Shake Faith (Su)
    description: >-
      Anytime an akvan strikes a divine spellcaster with any of its melee
      attacks, the target must make a DC 30 Will save or be shaken for 1d4
      rounds. If the save is successful, the target is instead shaken for 1
      round. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Torturous Gullet (Su)
    description: >-
      As hunters of otherworldly beings, akvans are uniquely drawn to digest
      creatures with a variety of resistances. In addition to the damage dealt
      by crushing internal organs, creatures swallowed by an akvan take 4d6
      points of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage per round. The akvan
      chooses what type of energy damage those in its stomach will take every
      round, and may change this from round to round. Additionally, an akvan's
      stomach is thickly armored, allowing it to benefit from its entire natural
      armor bonus instead of merely half.
Description:
  - >-
    Akvans number among the most physically powerful and openly destructive
    servants of Ahriman, directly carrying out his ancient plans for oblivion.
    Their twisted minds bend toward desolation, ruin, and blasphemy, and their
    hatred of the gods of creation and beings renowned for inspiring art and
    wonder knows few equals. Whereas most divs turn their cruelty and
    vengefulness exclusively upon mortals, akvans broaden the scope of their
    hatred to encompass geniekind as well.
  - >-
    Akvans seek out wonders to destroy-monuments from lost ages that have long
    inspired awe and pride or beings and establishments said to be invincible.
    While divs typically spread their taint through more subtle ways, akvans
    target symbols for destruction, bringing down not just stone and mortar but
    hopes and dreams. Additionally, these masters of destruction promote the
    creation of new horrors, transforming their most hated victims, genies, into
    nightmares known as ghuls. Thus, an akvan's evil does not end with its
    victim's death, as slain genies arise from the battlefield-or are belched up
  - >-
    from an akvan's gullet-as blasphemous undead servants. These undead minions
    serve their terrifying master and, over the ages, gather around it as an
    army of profane slaves.
  - >-
    Hatred and hunger for genies and those allied with them constitute the
    racial compulsion to which all akvans bow. These divs always go out of their
    way to hunt, destroy, and consume any genie they encounter. While wise
    enough to not waste their lives in combat against foes obviously more
    powerful then they, akvans seek to bring low any such opponents, if not by
    brute strength, then by guile.
  - Akvans stand approximately 40 feet tall and weigh over 30,000 pounds.
  - AKVAN PRINCES
  - >-
    As akvans go through existence slaying mortals and genies, many gravitate
    toward one of the races of geniekind, targeting members of that race with
    particular passion. Over ages of service, akvans who prove especially lethal
    in slaughtering genies garner the attention of Ahriman, who blesses such
    divs with increased power, transforming them into akvan princes.
  - >-
    Each akvan prince dedicates itself to extinguishing a particular type of
    genie and gains special abilities with which to slaughter genies of that
    type. An akvan prince gains an additional 4-8 Hit Dice, a +4 bonus to three
    ability scores, and has a CR of 22-24. The akvan prince also gains one of
    the following sets of abilities, depending on what type of genies it hunts.
  - >-
    Crumbling Earth: A shaitan-hunting akvan prince shatters the strongest
    stone. It gains the stone glide ability, tremorsense 100 feet, and a burrow
    speed of 100 feet, and its natural attacks are treated as adamantine for the
    purposes of overcoming damage reduction. It also gains the following
    spell-like abilities: 3/day-quickened stone shape, transmute mud to rock,
    transmute rock to mud, wish.
  - >-
    Dying Ember: An efreet-hating akvan prince holds dominion over flame. It
    gains an efreeti's heat special attack (1d6 when struck, 6d6 when grappling
    or grappled) and the following spell-like abilities: at will-quickened
    quench, scorching ray, wall of fire; 3/day-wish.
  - >-
    Gasping Wind: A djinn-hunting akvan prince gains power over the wind. It
    gains resist electricity 30 and the whirlwind ability, its fly speed
    increases to 120 feet (perfect maneuverability), and it gains the following
    spell-like abilities: at will-invisibility; 3/day-gaseous form, wish.

    disjunction, wish.
