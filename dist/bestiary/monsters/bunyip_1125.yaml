SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Rage (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bunyip's blood rage ability activates whenever it detects blood in the
      water using its keen scent, but otherwise functions as the universal
      monster rule of the same name.
  - name: Roar (Su)
    description: >-
      A bunyip's roar is supernaturally loud and horrifying. When a bunyip roars
      (a standard action the creature can perform at will), all hearing
      creatures with 4 or fewer HD within a 100-foot spread must succeed on a DC
      13 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is
      successful, creatures in the area are immune to the roar of that bunyip
      for 24 hours. This is a sonic, mindaffecting fear effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The bunyip is a fierce and avid hunter, possessing a primal ruthlessness
    that seems almost evil in its rapacity.
  - >-
    A bunyip typically inhabits large freshwater inlets or sheltered coastal sea
    caves where food is plentiful-the bunyip is equally at home in fresh or salt
    water. It prefers feeding on animals of Small size or larger, though it
    isn't averse to eating humanoids when presented the opportunity. Bunyips are
    quite territorial, and readily attack when intruders threaten their hunting
    grounds.
  - >-
    Bunyips mate annually, during the late spring. During this period, bunyips
    become even more aggressive. After mating, couples split, with the female
    wandering off to find a place to birth a small litter of four to six pups.
  - >-
    Females watch their pups for a few days, until they become independent
    enough for the mothers to move on.
  - >-
    Reports of bunyip sightings come from every end of the map. Though the
    accuracy of all such reports remains doubtful, enough reliable accounts
    exist to confirm their widespread adaptability. The species thrives in
    numerous ecological climes, from frigid polar fjords to idyllic tropical
    lagoons. The bunyip is not a deep-sea creature, and even avoids larger
    freshwater lakes, as it prefers to lurk near shorelines where its favorite
    food is more common.
  - >-
    While bunyips vary in appearance, all possess similar basic physical
    structures. The bunyip's head exhibits strong seal-like features, save for
    its shark-like jaws. Its upper torso is thick and muscular, with long,
    fin-like limbs. Some species even have a single, shark-like dorsal fin. The
    remaining portion of the body extends into a long tail. Those with fur
    usually only grow a short coat on the upper body in shades of pale gray,
    brown, or black.
