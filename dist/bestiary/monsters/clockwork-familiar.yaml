      Clockwork familiars have an innate understanding of how things work,
      granting their masters a +2 bonus on all Craft and Use Magic Device
      checks.
  - name: Item Installation (Ex)
    description: >-
      Each clockwork familiar is made with the ability to carry a specific type
      of magic item inside its body. This item type is chosen at the time of the
      construct's creation, and cannot be changed. While the creature cannot
      activate or use the item for its original function, it gains certain
      constant abilities from the resonant magic fields, and can drain the
      item's magic as a free action in order to gain additional magical effects.
      In addition, any clockwork construct can drain a single charge or spell
      level from its installed item to heal itself 1d6 hit points as a standard
      action. Removing a spent item and installing a new one is a full-round
      action. Potion: The clockwork familiar gains a constant protection from
      good/evil/law/chaos effect (one type only, chosen each time a new potion
      is installed). In addition, a clockwork familiar can drain the magic from
      the potion in order to gain the ability to include in the effect a single
      creature whose shoulder it's perched on. While perched on a character's
      shoulder, it acts like a worn object with no body slot. While the familiar
      can move from person to person, thus transferring the benefit, latching on
      or unlatching from a shoulder is a move action. This ability to include
      others in the protection effect lasts for 1 minute per spell level of the
      potion drained. Scroll: The clockwork familiar gains a constant detect
      magic effect as a spell-like ability. Draining magic from a scroll allows
      the familiar to cast a single identify spell on behalf of its master for
      each spell level of the spell inscribed on the scroll-these castings may
      be stored and saved, though a scroll used in this manner becomes instantly
      useless, even if not all spell levels have been drained. Wand: The
      clockwork familiar gains the ability to spit a gobbet of acid up to 30
      feet as a ranged touch attack, dealing 1d4 points of damage. Draining a
      charge increases the damage to 2d4 points for a single attack. This charge
      is spent before the attack is rolled.
Description:

    When it comes to familiars, most arcanists satisfy themselves with mundane
    creatures such as rats and lizards. Those with the power to bind greater
    assistants often call forth helpers from the planes, turning minor fiends or
    celestials to their will. Yet for artificers and those who fuse magic with
    machinery, the best familiar is the one the caster creates herself,
    breathing life into a clockwork mechanism of her own design.
  - >-
    Clockwork familiars can take a variety of forms depending on the whim of the
    creator.
  - >-
    Most popular are tiny metal dragons, birds (especially owls and ravens),
    faceless humanoids, and spiders that run on clicking, needlelike legs,
    though practically any shape and material can be animated in this fashion.
  - >-
    With its ability to generate electric shocks, a clockwork familiar can be
    useful in combat, yet it more often finds more use in the workshop, where
    its methodical thought processes and innate knowledge of mechanical systems
    allow it to offer valuable advice. In addition, each clockwork familiar has
    a unique relationship with a particular type of magic item, established at
    creation. When items of the chosen sort are slotted into the
    familiars-usually via a locking compartment, though some familiars simply
    drink potions, their metal stomachs becoming new receptacles- the familiars
    gain the ability to drain the magic back out of the items and turn it toward
    a different preset purpose, such as healing themselves or creating a
    specific spell effect.
  - >-
    A typical clockwork familiar is roughly 2 feet tall or long and weighs 10
    pounds. While the stat block here represents a raven familiar, and hence has
    a fly speed, other forms may trade this ability for a different form of
    movement, such as a clockwork piranha with a swim speed of 40 feet or a
    mechanical badger with a burrow speed of 10 feet.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Clockwork familiars can be constructed from a wide variety of materials, the
    most common being adamantine, steel, and bronze. Though their bodies are
    often expertly crafted contraptions of gears, drive shafts, and even
    circuitry, a clockwork familiar is not simply a robotic wind-up toy, nor is
    its consciousness the result of elaborate programming. Instead, each
    construct is more like a vehicle for the tiny spirit that lives inside its
    heart. On their own, these flickers of consciousness-pulled from the
    fundamental animating energy of the planes-would have no real ability to
    affect their surroundings. Only through the specially attuned constructs
    created by arcanists do they gain the ability to truly live, and it's
    perhaps gratitude for this service that initially binds clockwork familiars
    to their creators.
  - >-
    Once called into being and installed in its new vessel, a clockwork
    familiar's animating spirit controls its mechanical manipulators through
    tiny bursts of magical or electrical energy. As a result, most such
    constructs have conductive metal parts, and thus an instinctive fear of
    water and corrosion. Unable to heal naturally, clockwork familiars know that
    if their systems fail, they may never again be granted the chance to
    interact with the world. As a result, most clockwork familiars tend to be
    slightly paranoid and demanding when it comes to getting their masters to
    keep them in good repair, and it's not uncommon to find a clockwork familiar
    left to its own devices busily scouring rust from its shell, performing
    maintenance on itself, or attempting to improve the resilience of its basic
    functions.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    As created creatures, clockwork familiars have little society of their own,
    and tend to take on mannerisms and speech patterns similar to their
    masters'. Most feel an instinctive affection for their masters, though as
    intelligent beings it's not unheard of for the little automatons to have
    existential crises if their masters mistreat or ignore them. Clockwork
    familiars are often fascinated by other construct creatures and may attempt
    to befriend or study them, the better to understand how their systems work.
    Though they rarely adopt religion on their own, familiars with religious
    masters may go through the motions of worship as a way of honoring their
    place in the great chain of creation-left to themselves, clockwork familiars
    tend to be more interested in the systems and logic by which the natural
    world and planes operate than in particular entities, including deities.
  - >-
    While clockwork familiars have little desire for treasure themselves, they
    understand its value in trading, and may snatch up worthwhile items either
    on behalf of their master or-if they're concerned about being provided
    for-as emergency funds with which to purchase information or repairs, or as
    fuel for their magic-draining abilities. Clockwork familiars value knowledge
    above all things, though they tend to focus on logic, mathematics,
    organizational systems, and new ways of seeing and interpreting the world
    rather than simple facts. In a clockwork familiar's eyes, an almanac is
    useless clutter, but a textbook on geometry or chemistry is worth more than
    a pile of gold.
  - >-
    As intelligent creatures, clockwork familiars have an ambiguous relationship
    with the lives of servitude they're inevitably born into. For some, the
    philosophical quandaries are small and easily managed, as their creators
    treat them well, ask their opinion, share their stores of valuable
    knowledge, and may even come to love them. For others, whose masters see
    them as slaves at best and irritatingly imperfect projects at worst, only
    fear for their continued existence keeps the constructs in line. Many fall
    somewhere in the middle, and are interested in all the world has to offer
    even down to the mundanity of fetching and polishing, and thus are content
    to experience life on their masters' terms. A spellcaster of at least 7th
    level who takes the Improved Familiar feat can select a clockwork familiar
    as a familiar.
