Description:
  - >-
    The rock-horned lizard is commonly referred to as the blood lizard because
    of its ability to shoot a stream of blood from its eyes when threatened. The
    rock-horned lizard grows to a length of eight feet. Its head is
    wedge-shaped, and small horns protrude from the sides and top of its head.
    Its scales are dark reddish-brown or gold in color. The rock-horned lizard
    fires a stream of blood from the corners of its eyes at its foes before
    rushing in to attack with its bite. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
