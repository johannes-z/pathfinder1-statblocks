SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Boulder Barrage (Ex)
    description: >-
      An ulkreth can hurl up to four rocks as a full-round action or two rocks
      as a standard action. If rocks are available (as when the ulkreth uses its
      ground pounder ability to create rubble) it can pick up a single rock as a
      swift action, two rocks as a move action, or four rocks as a full-round
      action. If an ulkreth has a rock in each hand, it cannot use its rock
      catching ability.
  - name: Ground Pounder (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an ulkreth can strike the ground with its powerful
      fists, turning the area within a 10-foot radius into dense rubble
      (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 412). Any creatures in this area at the time
      must succeed at a DC 26 Reflex save or fall prone. An ulkreth's movement
      is not slowed by the rubble it creates.
  - name: Punch Through (Ex)
    description: >-
      An ulkreth can use a full-attack action to make its gore and slam attacks
      against the same opponent. The ulkreth then totals the damage from all
      hits before applying any damage reduction or hardness.
  - name: Wrecker (Su)
    description: An ulkreth's rend special attack deals double damage to objects.
Description:
  - >-
    Ulkreths are among the mightiest servants of the demon lord Xoveron, the
    Horned Prince of gargoyles and lord of ruination. They exist solely to
    destroy, carrying out his will of devastation to cities and civilization
    throughout the planes, tearing down monuments and buildings in the name of
    their unholy patron. Ulkreths are 25 feet tall and weigh 10 tons.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Ulkreth demons form from the souls of mortals who spread wanton destruction
    and vandalism, burning and tearing down what others have labored long to
    build up. Small-scale vandals do not earn damnation for simple graffiti and
    petty breakage; ulkreths arise from those who devoted their lives to
    bringing ruin forge their own chain of condemnation with every new act of
    malicious deconstruction. Some do so by targeting grand works of art,
    stately monuments, cathedrals, libraries, and historical edifices,
    destroying not just physical structures but also the artistic and cultural
    legacy of their own people, or of other cultures living among them. These
    targets are singled out for defacement as a sign of the vandal's hate. The
    pinnacle of vandalism, however, is attained by those who not only cause
    damage to property but also murder via their sabotage-collapsing mines and
    trapping miners to die choking in the dark; breaching dams and dikes to
    unleash deadly floodwaters that wreak devastation; or bombing, burning, or
    otherwise destroying homes, businesses, and other gathering places. Whether
    done as an anarchic political statement, for revenge upon those who owned
    the buildings, or for pure psychotic joy at watching the world crumble,
    these are the blackest-hearted vandals of all.
  - >-
    The level of destruction perpetrated by mortals in life is important to
    their lord Xoveron because while his will is bent on the ruination of every
    civilization, tearing down the literal and figurative structures that hold
    society together, he is still only a minor demon lord. His power is
    insufficient to endow every servant with great abilities. Lesser vandals
    simply do not rate a major investment of his lordly power, and if made into
    demons at all, may be consigned to eternity as mere dretches, or as fiendish
    gargoyles rather than actual demons. It is only those whose acts of
    destruction are truly heinous that inspire him to transform them into
    ulkreths.
  - >-
    Ulkreth demons are unusual, however, in that they can also be formed not
    from one soul but from many, especially in the case of gangs that once
    worked together as mortals in their acts of destruction. These joint-souled
    ulkreths are, if anything, even more savage and destructive than their
    fellows, as the different soul fragments bound together struggle for
    mastery, trying to show their dominance by wreaking greater mayhem than
    their rivals.
  - >-
    Ulkreths do not need to eat or drink, but they enjoy chewing and swallowing
    powdered stone and shattered glass, twisted metal and splintered wood. They
    consume the detritus of their destruction as a ritual of satisfaction after
    their rampages. Some say they gain sustenance from these shattered remains
    and claim that if ulkreths are prevented from destroying for too long, they
    can actually waste away and die of starvation, though planar scholars know
    that outsiders don't need to eat to live. Ulkreths cannot reproduce
    biologically and are propagated only by the transformation of new souls into
    ulkreths.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Most ulkreths inhabit the endless ruins of Ghahazi, the hearth of their
    master Xoveron. There they tend groves of fiendish treants that wait amidst
    the ruins, crumbling foundation stones with their defiled roots even as they
    stand ready to batter and smash at the ulkreths' command. Flights of
    fiendish gargoyles wheel constantly overhead, making aeries of the shattered
    spires of the Horned Prince's city and flocking ahead of the ulkreths when
    they march. Xoveron often barters the service of his ulkreths with other
    demon lords or their generals, especially in siege situations where demonic
    teleportation is of no avail and defenses must be breached with naked
    strength. Ulkreths may be kept back as artillery, but they chafe under
    efforts to suppress their urges to sunder and smash and have often been
    known to abandon their orders and wade directly into a fray or smash down
    gates and walls with their bare fists.
  - >-
    On the Material Plane, the cultists of Xoveron and his gargoyle minions
    stand sentinel against the encroachment of civilization, ready to foil its
    ambitious reach towards eternity. When his minions report cities growing too
    great, too lovely, or too proud, Xoveron tempts mortals with a gluttonous
    hunger for power and a jealous pride and rage toward their fellows that
    drives them to call forth a ulkreth demon. Mortal gargoyles can sense the
    presence of one of their master's favored servants and flock to its side to
    swoop hooting and screeching overhead as the wrecker commences a reign of
    terror. Of course, ulkreths are notoriously indiscriminate about their
    destruction, and those summoning them must be very careful not to become
    casualties of the ulkreth's rampage.
