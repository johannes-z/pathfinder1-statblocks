SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Agile Grappler (Ex)
    description: A gylou does not gain the grappled condition if she grapples a foe.
  - name: Tentacle Cage (Su)
    description: >-
      If a gylou successfully grapples a creature, she transfers that creature
      into her lower body's nest of cage-like tentacles. This works like swallow
      whole. The gylou's tentacles are AC 17 and have 18 hp for the purpose of
      an entrapped creature cutting itself out. A gylou's tendrils heal quickly,
      allowing her to use this ability 1 round after a creature cuts itself
      free.
Description:
  - >-
    Known as handmaiden devils, Mothers of Pain, and Maids of Miscarriage,
    gylous attend to the whims and schemes of Hell's few female overlords. Like
    manipulative matrons amid decadent mortal courts, these deceivers hide their
    fathomless evil beneath illusions of beauty, graciousness, and tradition.
    Gylous particularly loathe children. It's said that the persistent cry of a
    babe can sometimes cause these fiends to abandon their illusions and
    viciously attack.
  - >-
    As greater devils, gylous can command many lesser devils, yet harbor an
    exclusive favoritism for erinyes. A gylou weighs 160 pounds and stands stiff
    ly at 5-1/2 feet- though many wear their head-sprouting tentacles in tall,
    elaborate coiffures.
