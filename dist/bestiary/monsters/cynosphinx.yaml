SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Devour Secret Lore (Su)
    description: >-
      When a cynosphinx reduces a living creature below zero hit points, it
      steals some of its essence. Treat the cynosphinx as if it were the target
      of an aid spell with a caster level equal to the dying target's Hit Dice.
      A cynosphinx can only affect a single creature with this effect once in a
      24 hour period.

      Carrion fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 17; onset 1 day; frequency 1 day;
      effect 2 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Powerful Bite (Ex)
    description: A cynosphinx adds 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to its bite attack.
Description:
  - >-
    Cynosphinxes are hoarders of secret knowledge and guardians of abandoned
    ruins. Those who intrude upon the realm of a cynosphinx and fail to offer a
    tribute of secret knowledge provoke the beast to savage anger.
  - >-
    Whereas androsphinxes barter information for the sake of achieving
    enlightenment, cynosphinxes strive to learn secrets to gain power over
    others. Often, a cynosphinx enters a parley hoping to secretly learn
    clandestine information with its ability to read its target's thoughts,
    steering the conversation toward such topics with leading questions. Quick
    to anger, the cynosphinx kills those it feels are inferior, knowing that it
    still has the opportunity to converse with the trespasser after its death.
    If the knowledge it seeks is relayed during clever, amusing conversation,
    the sphinx rewards the provider with invaluable clues to a desired object or
    location, or simply safe passage through its territory, though the
    cynosphinx rarely shares any of its own secrets willingly. A cynosphinx
    stands 12 feet tall at its powerful shoulders. Built of muscular flesh and
    sinew, a cynosphinx weighs roughly 1,200 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Rare even among sphinxes, a cynosphinx is a terror of the desert. Were it
    not for its fixation on secrets, it would be a scourge to all who dwell
    among the sands. Its canine head grants it a sense of smell superior to that
    of other sphinxes, giving it the ability to stalk prey in conditions of poor
    visibility. Though it possesses massive wings, a cynosphinx is an ungainly
    flier. In addition to hit-and-run attacks from above, one of its favored
    tactics is to hover over an enemy and whip up a cloud of dust and debris to
    blind its prey.
  - >-
    Like all sphinxes, a cynosphinx is long-lived, but it has a particularly
    selfish desire to cling to its lengthy existence, making it a careful
    combatant who will flee rather than perish. This obsession usually leads a
    cynosphinx to search out the secrets of longevity and immortality, not just
    for its own use, but also because it knows the value mortals place on such
    secrets.
  - >-
    A cynosphinx requires little sustenance and even prefers to feed on carrion,
    finding rotting flesh more palatable. Because of this, an area with a few
    hundred gravesites can sustain a cynosphinx for several millennia. Even when
    a cynosphinx makes a fresh kill, the creature lets it rot for several days
    before devouring the carcass. Its diet mainly consists of the decaying
    corpses found abandoned within its lair, with bone marrow being a particular
    treat. Due to its affinity with the dead, and its obsessive need to learn
    secrets, a cynosphinx always interacts with its exhumed morsels, speaking
    with the dead and learning what it can before fully consuming the body. Like
    a scholar devouring knowledge from a book, a cynosphinx pores over both the
    physical and intellectual particulars of its strange corpse diet.
  - >-
    When a cynosphinx it sees fit to mate-usually once its will to live ends-it
    needs a gynosphinx, just like other sphinxes do. However, due to the
    cynosphinx's disdain for mating, not to mention gynosphinxes' utter disgust
    toward cynosphinxes, this type of union is rare. In nearly every case, the
    resulting offspring from such a pairing is a cynosphinx. Gynosphinxes want
    nothing to do with such offspring, and offer no protest when the cynosphinx
    takes the progeny away. Before it dies, the new father brings the child to
    its lair, leaving its progeny a carcass to learn from and feed upon.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Cynosphinxes dwell among the abandoned burial sites of civilized folk. Due
    to their obsession with lost secrets and their steady diet of carrion, a
    cynosphinx's ideal lair is a graveyard, tomb, or necropolis. When a
    cynosphinx takes up residence at such a site, the otherwise contemplative
    creature defends its territory with tenacity. However, if a visitor
    approaches a cynosphinx's territory with the promise of divulging secret
    lore, the sphinx may grant an audience. In such an instance, if the promise
    of lore fails to satisfy the cynosphinx, the intruder finds herself quickly
    under attack. Fortunately, many tombs and necropolises have tight nooks and
    narrow crannies far too small for a cynosphinx to maneuver in. If a clever
    traveler offers to explore these regions for the obsessive cynosphinx, she
    may find this arrangement to be just the bartering chip she needs to leave
    the sphinx's territory alive.
  - >-
    Solitary by nature, a cynosphinx truly feels comfortable only among the
    dead, and leaves its lair only for brief, localized patrols or when a longer
    journey promises to unearth lost knowledge. Cynosphinxes are always male and
    treat other sphinxes as inferior, save for androsphinxes. Cynosphinxes
    ignore criosphinxes, subjugate hieracosphinxes, and only associate with
    gynosphinxes for the purpose of mating-an act cynosphinxes find revolting.
    If a cynosphinx finds its only recourse to extend its legacy is through
    mating, this is usually done through blackmailing a gynosphinx or resorting
    to other forms of coercion or subterfuge. In fact, a cynosphinx would rather
    discover a means of extending its own lifespan than sire an offspring-as
    they view even their own progeny as threats to their well-guarded store of
    knowledge. Toward the androsphinx, the cynosphinx harbors a seething
    jealousy. Envious of the androsphinx's superior intellect, wisdom, and
    guile, a cynosphinx will plot to murder any androsphinx it discovers.
    Cynosphinxes believe they can extract a wealth of knowledge and learn
    powerful secrets from the carcass of a slaughtered androsphinx using their
    speak with dead ability. If a cynosphinx's food supply is abundant, the one
    category of creatures with whom it will ally is the undead. It is common for
    a cynosphinx to take a place at the head of an undead menace or even to
    serve a greater power such as a graveknight or a lich.
  - >-
    Cynosphinxes as Mounts Although they have the physical ability to carry a
    rider, cynosphinxes cannot be trained as mounts. They are intelligent beings
    who choose for themselves whether to accept a rider. A worthy rider is
    usually a powerful undead creature of evil alignment with whom the
    cynosphinx has an obsession, or who has promised eldritch secrets in return
    for service. Often, a creature petitioning a cynosphinx for this arrangement
    must provide such knowledge regularly for the cynosphinx to continue to
    grant its consent as a steed. A cynosphinx is considered a special cohort,
    not a normal mount.
