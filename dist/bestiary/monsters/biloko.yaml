Description_Visual: >-
  This gnome-sized humanoid's face is adorned with fiery red eyes and a
  sharp-toothed mouth that seems too wide for its head. The creature is garbed
  in leaves and possesses no hair-patches of grass and moss grow from its skin
  instead.

    description: >-
      Biloko can gradually insinuate their desires into the minds of those in
      the power of their charm person spell-like ability. For every 10 minutes a
      humanoid is under the influence of a biloko's charm person, the victim
      takes a -1 penalty on her opposed Charisma check (to a maximum of -5) when
      the biloko is trying to convince her to do something she would not
      normally do. This penalty applies to the charm of only a single biloko and
      is reduced back to 0 as soon as the victim breaks free or the spell ends.
Description:
  - >-
    Blood-red man-eaters and cunning jungle stalkers, biloko hunt those who
    think themselves hunters, preying upon foolish travelers and incautious
    jungle natives with maniacal zeal. Lanky and quick humanoids, biloko possess
    exaggerated, fearfully expressive facial features, including mouths capable
    of stretching impossibly wide. Adept at blending in amid jungle underbrush
    despite their brilliant coloration, these ferocious jungle fey delight in
    constructing deadly traps, tricking victims into deadly ambushes, and
    leading enthralled foes into dangerous situations. The average biloko stands
    between 3 and 4 feet tall and weighs between 40 and 50 pounds, though a
    biloko who has recently fed might bear the weight of a far greater creature.
    Ecology Wild-eyed and unpredictable, biloko are feared by many natives of
    the jungle and the tropical lands around their verdant hunting grounds.
    Frequent menaces in both the fireside tales of children and the bravest
    adults' nightmares, they embody the most common fears of the jungle, proving
    that beneath the jungle canopy lurk forces that seek to do the unwary harm
    and can make even experienced warriors disappear without a trace. Biloko
    exclusively consume humanoid meat, and though they tend to prowl near
    forest-side villages, prey can be sparse at times. A biloko can live without
    sustenance for a lengthy period, but the hunger it eventually suffers proves
    nearly maddening. Sometimes fasting for weeks at a time, the intense hunger
    pains a biloko feels may drive it to cannibalism, though such occurrences
    are somewhat rare. A biloko's mouth stretches across its face in a
    grotesque, unnatural fashion, and it can consume a whole humansized creature
    in one terrible, hours-long bite, dislocating its jaw like a snake in order
    to do so. With the aid of its acidic saliva, its powerful maw is capable of
    grinding flesh and bone into a concentrated, compact form, allowing it to
    digest and survive off of a single meal for the extended period of time it
    may be forced to fast while awaiting new prey. If uninterrupted, an eager,
    starving biloko can swallow an adult human in about 3 hours. Biloko are
    related to the jungle spriggans known as Eloko, though they are far less
    organized and more at home in the jungle depths. While wilder and more
    bloodthirsty than their spriggan kin, biloko possess several similar
    physical traits, though their gaunt builds and bright red skins make the two
    unmistakably distinct. Some biloko look on their fey kin as strangely
    colored relatives, while other biloko attack them just as they would any
    other stranger. Thus, little special connection exists between the two
    races. Eloko are further detailed in Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Heart of
    the Jungle. Habitat & Society Biloko are cruel, mischievous humanoids, known
    and feared by all who dare live near a forest plagued with the vile beings.
    Non-locals are urged never to travel alone; those foolish enough to ignore
    these warnings are seldom seen again. Whether hunting for food or journeying
    through the wilderness, locals know well to move in groups. While biloko are
    intelligent beings, their reclusive habits and lust for flesh drive them
    from any sort of civilized society. They keep mostly to deep, dark areas of
    the forest, and are rarely seen on the woods' outskirts. Their numbers are
    small enough that it is rare for two unacquainted biloko to run into each
    other on a given day, but the species is sufficiently widespread to pose a
    threat to all travelers. Biloko are not social creatures by nature, but
    recognize the benefit of traveling in a group. When stealth is not of
    primary concern, several biloko might band together in order to hunt. While
    not organized by a tribal system, biloko often identify other biloko long
    residing in a region as friendly, although they remain cautious when
    encountering newcomers. They rarely see others of their kind as enemies, but
    more typically as rivals who begrudgingly allow one another to hunt on the
    same turf. Biloko rarely deal with other sentient beings-save during a meal.
    They choose lives of isolation from other races, usually dwelling within
    dark forests where their fiendish acts are less likely to be noticed by
    strangers. Large, hollow trees provide shelter for the small humanoids, who
    drape cloths of moss and ivy across the gaping portals behind which they
    slumber. A biloko often waits stealthily in his hideout, perched in one
    position for most of the day as he hungrily anticipates an unwary group of
    travelers or a lone wanderer. Once such a party or individual has passed,
    the monster creeps out of his hole, giving his prey a wide berth as he
    stalks it. At a time he deems appropriate-usually when a traveler is alone
    or has strayed from the group-the biloko whistles, creating an enchanting
    melody that draws his target near. The encounter ultimately ends in either
    the victim's hideous consumption or the biloko's flight. Far from being
    anchored to his hiding spot, a biloko often leaves his nook to wander the
    forest in search of other hiding spots on the edges of trails or
    well-trodden paths. Boring through a stump or the trunk of a tree with his
    razor-sharp claws, he can create a new abode in the span of several hours. A
    single biloko can have as many as a dozen hollow tree-holes, which provide
    valuable landmarks in the often complex jungle-maze he inhabits, as well as
    safety from pursuing predators or attackers. During his exploratory treks
    through the thick brush, a biloko might acquire dozens of fruits and berries
    for their bright colors, carrying the goods back to his nearest hiding hole
    to gaze upon later. Biloko have little interest in metals and artifacts,
    though they occasionally stumble upon a particular object they find
    especially attractive or interesting. They do, however, love gems, as the
    brightly colored crystals appear dazzling in the creatures' enhanced vision.
    This sense of sight, which makes anything not green in color stand out
    magnificently, helps biloko spot prey even in the thickest of jungles, where
    the skyscraping canopy blots out the sun for miles.
