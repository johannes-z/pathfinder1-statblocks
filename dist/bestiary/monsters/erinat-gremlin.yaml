Description:
  - >-
    Erinat gremlins are obsessed with conflict and discord. They love nothing
    more than starting fights-the more inane and pointless the struggle, the
    better. Erinat gremlins typically use alter self to take the appearance of
    unfed, unwashed humanoid children as appropriate to their surroundings,
    allowing the gremlins to move freely through settlements (and accuse anyone
    who attempts to stop their malicious conduct of trying to kidnap them).
    Erinats don't care who wins the fights they start; they simply wish to be
    entertained by the largest brawls they can arrange. The mischievous gremlins
    delight in creating chaos, and are prone to making outrageous claims in the
    hope of sparking riots, aided by forcing bystanders to attack each other
    with random, often ridiculous objects.
