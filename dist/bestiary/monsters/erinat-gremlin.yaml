SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Discordant Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      An erinat radiates an aura that imparts both gullibility and
      susceptibility to mental influence. Creatures within a 20-foot radius take
      a -2 penalty on saves against compulsion effects, and Bluff checks
      attempted against such creatures gain a +5 bonus. This bonus also applies
      on opposed Charisma checks against a charmed creature within the aura.
  - name: Lashing Chains (Ex)
    description: >-
      Erinats have 5-foot reach when attacking on their turn with their spiked
      chains, though they don't threaten adjacent squares when it is not their
      turn.
  - name: Malicious Mischief (Su)
    description: >-
      A pair of erinats working together for 1 round can present an item and
      compel a creature to take it. This functions as beguiling giftAPG (DC 13),
      but rather than using the item in the appropriate fashion, the recipient
      is compelled to use the item to attack a random non-gremlin creature
      within 30 feet, even if the recipient must use the item as an improvised
      weapon. Additionally, a group of six erinats working together over the
      course of 1 hour can create an effect identical to malicious spiteUM (DC
      16) on any living creature. This effect functions at CL 6th, and the
      target creature must be either willing or helpless.
Description:
  - >-
    Erinat gremlins are obsessed with conflict and discord. They love nothing
    more than starting fights-the more inane and pointless the struggle, the
    better. Erinat gremlins typically use alter self to take the appearance of
    unfed, unwashed humanoid children as appropriate to their surroundings,
    allowing the gremlins to move freely through settlements (and accuse anyone
    who attempts to stop their malicious conduct of trying to kidnap them).
    Erinats don't care who wins the fights they start; they simply wish to be
    entertained by the largest brawls they can arrange. The mischievous gremlins
    delight in creating chaos, and are prone to making outrageous claims in the
    hope of sparking riots, aided by forcing bystanders to attack each other
    with random, often ridiculous objects.
