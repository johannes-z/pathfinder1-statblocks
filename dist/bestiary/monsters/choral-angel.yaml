  matches her broad, platinum wings. Her silver hair slowly ripples through the
  air of its own volition, highlighting the angel's serene expression.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Countersong (Su)
    description: >-
      A choral angel can attempt a Perform (sing) check to counter magic effects
      that depend on sound. This ability functions as the bard ability of the
      same name.
  - name: Harmonize (Sp)
    description: >-
      When choral angels work together, they can use their complementary voices
      to create mystical harmonies. Two or more choral angels within 60 feet of
      one another can use calm emotions or heroism as a spell-like ability, four
      or more choral angels can use shout, and six or more choral angels can use
      greater heroism or holy word. Only the choral angel who actually uses the
      spell-like ability in question must take a standard action to achieve this
      effect-the other choral angels need only take swift actions during the
      same round.
  - name: Piercing Hymn (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a choral angel can launch a concentrated blast of
      sonic energy from its mouth. This attack has a range of 90 feet with no
      range increment. Any creature struck by a choral angel's piercing hymn
      must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 minutes. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Choral angels are vocalists of unparalleled talent, and their singing fill
    the halls of good deities with soaring hymns and solemn chants. They
    manifest from the souls of the pious dead who possessed exceptional musical
    talent and pure spirits in life. Sometimes, mortals who did not possess
    musical talent but instead held a deep and abiding appreciation for the arts
    are gifted with this form upon ascending to the good-aligned planes after
    death. While choral angels are not soldiers and prefer to avoid combat,
    which many of their angelic brethren relish, these celestials can defend
    themselves with their puissant voices when need be, creating powerful
    magical effects that resonate with the purity in their hearts to overcome
    foes.
  - >-
    Choral angels sometimes support astral devas in their duties by visiting the
    Material Plane bearing messages for mortals. These messages are inevitably
    good in nature, and it is a joyous event when a choral angel appears to a
    mortal. If the celestials expect danger or opposition during their visit,
    they travel in groups called ensembles, and use their harmonizing voices to
    spread the word of their patron as well as to bolster their allies in
    battle. If particularly vexed or pressed, an ensemble of choral angels can
    use their harmonies to devastating effect, obliterating their foes with
    powerful chants drawn from Elysium or hymns dedicated to the powers of
    Heaven.

    Most choral angels stand only 3-1/2 feet tall, and their svelte frames weigh
    a meager 40 pounds. Their hair is always of a metallic sheen resembling that
    of rare natural minerals and ores such as platinum, gold, and silver, though
    some of the oldest choral angels posses hair that glimmers perpetually like
    emeralds, sapphires, or diamonds.
