Description_Visual: >-
  This eerie creature has the upper body of a beautiful, pale green woman and
  the lower body of a pulsating mound of fungus.
Source: Inner Sea Bestiary
IsTemplate: '1'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Compel Plants (Su)
    description: >-
      A fungus queen's mind-affecting powers and spell-like abilities (and
      spells, should the fungus queen gain the ability to cast them) affect
      plant creatures (but not mindless plant creatures) as if they weren't
      immune to mind-affecting effects.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that would normally be slain by a fungus queen's energy drain
      attack is not killed- instead, it immediately loses all negative levels
      imparted by the fungus queen and transforms into a fungus-infested minion
      of the queen. Such creatures gain the fungoid simple template. Fungoid
      creatures are under the control of the fungus creature that created them,
      and remain enslaved until their mistress is destroyed or until they are
      cured of the infestation (see the facing page). A fungus queen can
      communicate telepathically with her fungoid spawn at any range as long as
      they are on the same plane, and may have a number of Hit Dice worth of
      enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice her own Hit Dice; any spawn she
      creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed fungoid creatures.
      A fungus queen may free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn,
      but once freed, a fungoid creature cannot be enslaved again (although it
      can still be influenced by the fungus queen's compel plants and plant
      empathy abilities).
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A fungus queen's energy drain functions identically to that of a succubus
      (Bestiary 68). Creatures killed by this attack do not die-they instead
      become infested with the fungus queen's spores (see Create Spawn). The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Plant Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as the druid's wild empathy, save that a fungus
      queen can use this ability only on plant creatures. A fungus queen gains a
      +4 racial bonus on this check. Mindless plant creatures are imparted a
      modicum of implanted intelligence when a fungus queen uses this ability,
      allowing her to train such creatures as guardians.
  - name: Sporepod (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a fungus queen can cause a Medium pod of fungal
      material to burst out of the ground at any point within 60 feet of her
      current location. Once created, a sporepod cannot move. If the fungus
      queen travels more than 120 feet from a sporepod, it is destroyed. A
      fungus queen can maintain a number of sporepods equal to her Charisma
      modifier (7 for the typical fungus queen). As a move action, she can
      instantaneously travel to one of her sporepods as if using transport via
      plants. She can also choose to spread out her tentacle attacks among her
      sporepods, attacking a creature within 5 feet of any sporepod with a
      tentacle-she is still limited to making only four tentacle attacks as part
      of a full-attack action, or one as a standard action. A sporepod is an
      object that has an AC of 15 and 20 hit points; damage dealt to a sporepod
      does not harm the fungus queen.
Description:
  - >-
    Hundreds of years ago, a cabal of powerful succubus assassins in the service
    of Nocticula attempted to invade the Jeharlu, the Abyssal Realm of
    Cyth-V'sug, demon lord of disease and fungus. They sought to assassinate a
    powerful witch named Soris Delyn, who had befouled one of Nocticula's
    favorite mortal temples, hidden below the Chelish city of Vyre, before
    fleeing to her patron's side. The succubi failed at their mission, and from
    their corpses grew the first fungus queens. Pleased with the outcome, Soris
    returned to the Material Plane with the fungus queens seeded them throughout
    the Inner Sea region to aid in the spread of Cyth-V'sug's cult. The fungus
    queens have taken to the Material Plane like rot to a carcass, and today
    hundreds of the subversive creatures dwell in the foul reaches of the world.
    They are particularly fond of large cave systems in the reaches of Nar-Voth
    near the surface, and of the slums of ruined cities in the Worldwound.
    Styrian Kindler's Account of Ostog the Unslain tells of a particularly
    harrowing encounter with a fungus queen in the caverns below Devil's Platter
    east of Sandpoint, and of indications that this was but one of many such
    queens dwelling in the region. A particularly dangerous and powerful sect of
    advanced fungus queens dwells within swampy reaches of Tanglebriar,
    commanding groups of vegepygmies grown from the corpses of slain elves-these
    fungus queens have seceded from the rule of Cyth-V'sug and now serve his
    rebellious minion Treerazer in the crusade to corrupt and destroy Kyonin.
  - >-
    An encounter with a normally nonintelligent plant monster acting in a
    sinister and organized way is sure evidence of the manipulation of a fungus
    queen, but these monsters are equally fond of commanding and keeping other
    creatures as pets and slaves as well, particularly attractive humanoids.
    Those charmed minions they especially favor are given the gift of the fungus
    queen's embrace, and are transformed into fungoid minions forever loyal to
    their pallid mistress.
  - >-
    Fungus queens are violently jealous and possessive. Those who attempt to
    lure away their charmed and dominated pets or cure those they have infested
    gain their eternal ire, but it is by succubi that fungus queens are the most
    enraged. Whether it be a simple territorial conf lict or some deeper hatred
    born of their unique genesis, a fungus queen faced with someone whom she
    even suspects might be a succubus is a terror indeed, for in such battles
    the sensuous plants abandon their normally subtle approaches of mental
    control and trickery, and instead bring all of their power to bear in an
    attempt to rip the offending creature limb from limb.
  - >-
    Fungus queens take great delight in transforming succubi into fungoid
    creatures under their control. While their jealousy doesn't compel them to
    do battle with other fungus queens, they are always careful to maintain
    their own territorial boundaries apart from any nearby queens, and they take
    great pains not to "poach" from their sisters' harems of charmed and
    infested pets.
  - >-
    Many fungus queens grow quite powerful over time, typically gaining class
    levels in ranger, bard, or sorcerer- they generally do not become more
    powerful by merely gaining racial Hit Dice or increasing in size. A typical
    fungus queen is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.
  - FUNGOID SIMPLE TEMPLATE (CR +1)
  - >-
    Creatures with the fungoid template appear as they did in life, save that
    their flesh is pallid and moist, and mushrooms and mold cake their bodies.
    This template can be applied to any living, non-plant creature. A fungoid
    creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same.
  - >-
    Rebuild Rules: The creature's type changes to plant, and it gains all of the
    traits of the plant type. The creature gains telepathy 100 ft. with other
    fungoid creatures. Its alignment changes to chaotic evil.
