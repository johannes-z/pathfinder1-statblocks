Description_Visual: >-
  This revolting withered corpse of a woman is dressed in revealing clothes, its
  bare skin wet with fresh blood.
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 4
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Absorb Blood (Su)
    description: >-
      A sayona adjacent to a bleeding creature automatically accelerates the
      bleeding, dealing 1 point of Con damage to that creature once per round on
      its turn and absorbing the blood through its skin.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      When a sayona kills a humanoid or fey of Medium or Small size with its
      absorb blood or blood drain ability, the victim rises 24 hours later as a
      ghoul with the advanced creature simple template and the blood drain
      ability. The spawn is the sayona's slave until its master is destroyed.
  - name: Living Form (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a sayona can transform into a young, beautiful
      person for 24 hours. It can only use this ability if it has absorbed or
      drained blood in the past hour. In this form, the sayona has the aura of a
      living creature instead of an undead (for the purpose of detect undead and
      similar effects), its fast healing increases to 10, positive energy
      attacks (such as channel energy) deal half damage to it, and it cannot use
      its fear cone or gaze attack. Exposure to holy water or positive energy
      attacks in this form reduces the duration of this transformation by 1d4
      hours.
  - name: Staggering Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Staggered for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 23 negates. This is a
      mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Occasionally called "weeping vampires" for their ability to cry tears of
    blood, sayonas are powerful and intelligent undead creatures that hunt
    mortals to steal from them what they envy most: the ability to exist within
    living flesh. While they aren't true vampires, similarity between these two
    creatures creates substantial confusion to those unfamiliar with sayonas.
    While sayonas and vampires sustain themselves off mortal blood, sayonas
    don't consume the blood, but rather absorb it through their skin (even when
    using blood drain), using it to transform their twisted forms back into some
    semblance of the beauty they had-or believe they had- in life. Above all
    else, sayonas covet youth. Stories of their origins claim that the first
    sayona was a vain woman who grew old and whose lover left her for a younger
    paramour; the woman avenged herself by bathing in the blood of her lover's
    children, then killed herself. Doomed to undeath, she wanders the world
    crying tears of blood and preying on beautiful young women-slaying them,
    stealing their beauty, and transforming them into ghastly undead fiends to
    forever share her fate.
