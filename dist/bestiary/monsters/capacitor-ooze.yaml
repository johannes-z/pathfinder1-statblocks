SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Electrified (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature that strikes a capacitor ooze with a natural weapon, unarmed
      strike, or metal weapon takes 4d6 points of electricity damage. Creatures
      grappling a capacitor ooze take this damage when initiating the grapple
      and on each round the grapple is maintained.
  - name: Neurophagic Jolt (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a capacitor ooze deals electricity damage to a target with its slam
      attack, the jolt to the target's neurological system stuns the creature
      for 1 round (Fortitude DC 25 negates). A second neurophagic jolt to a
      stunned target sets up a destructive resonance in the target's brain. This
      resonance functions like an affliction with the following statistics: save
      Will DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dexterity and 1d2
      Intelligence damage; cure 1 save. Neutralize poison does not cure this
      affliction, but heal, greater restoration, and any effect that removes
      insanity does. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Osmotic Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      A capacitor ooze drains power from nearby electrical sources. Any
      creatures within 10 feet of a capacitor ooze carrying at least one device
      that's powered by or generates electricity must succeed at a DC 25
      Fortitude save or lose 1 charge from a random electrical device. Singleuse
      items are depowered entirely; devices with renewable electrical sources
      are depowered until they can recharge (in the case of a solar-powered
      device) or have their electrical function suppressed for 1d4 minutes (in
      the case of a shock weapon). A given power source can be drained only once
      per minute. For each electrical device affected by the capacitor ooze's
      osmotic drain, the ooze deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity
      damage the next time it would deal electricity damage to a target, and its
      speed increases by 30 feet for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Created by technologists seeking to devise an organic battery, capacitor
    oozes escaped captivity and now infest the hinterlands of Numeria. They find
    water dangerous and humidity painful, so they gravitate toward arid climes
    with stable weather. Capacitor oozes instinctively seek out sources of
    electricity, consuming them like other creatures would food. Maintaining
    vigor and growth requires regular consumption of organic material as well. A
    capacitor ooze that's denied power or food begins to starve. Capacitor oozes
    grow without bound, splitting only from damage or misfortune. Capacitor
    oozes that encounter others of their kind often merge if left undisturbed, a
    process that takes 1d4 hours and may result in a giant or advanced ooze.
    Capacitor oozes that aren't inclined to merge disperse, as they find
    disharmonious electrical auras intolerable.
