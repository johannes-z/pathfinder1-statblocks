SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      An ooze golem's body secretes a deadly acid that damages only flesh. Any
      melee hit deals acid damage. Creatures attacking an ooze golem unarmed or
      with natural attacks take acid damage as though hit by the ooze golem's
      slam attack.
  - name: Amorphous (Ex)
    description: >-
      An ooze golem's body is malleable and shapeless. It can move through an
      area as small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or oneeight its
      space when squeezing.
  - name: Death Throes (Ex)
    description: >-
      When an ooze golem is reduced to 0 or less hit points its body collapses
      into a bubbling pool of acidic slime that covers a 10-foot square area.
      Creatures touching this acidic pool take 2d6 points of acid damage (no
      save) for 1d3 rounds. The acid pool remains for 10 rounds (1 minute)
      before dispersing.
  - name: Fast Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      An ooze golem heals 5 points of damage each round so long as it has at
      least 1 hit point.
Description:
  - >-
    Believed to be the creation of Masters of the Ooze (high-ranking priests and
    followers of The Faceless Lord), ooze golems appear as swirling
    conglomerations of oozes of columnar or humanoid shape. Their bubbling,
    shifting form stinks of dead animal matter and sulfur. Ooze golems are often
    employed or summoned by evil spellcasters and given the task of guarding or
    protecting an area of great importance. They are sometimes found in the
    company of normal oozes. These golems are quite prevalent in temples
    dedicated to The Faceless Lord. Ooze golems are 10-foot tall amorphous
    creatures of swirling colors: gray, black, dull red, pale green, and brown.
    They can alter their shape so as to appear roughly humanoid, but their
    natural form resembles a column or pillar. Two large pseudopods extend from
    the central trunk and function as arms. No facial features are discernable
    in either form. In humanoid form, an ooze golem's lower torso ends in two
    powerful legs and almost-human feet. This creature can flatten its body and
    squeeze through cracks and openings up to 2-inches in size. An ooze golem
    attacks by pummeling its opponents with its fists. It employs rudimentary
    tactics in battle and always fights until destroyed. An ooze golem often
    grabs a foe and hangs on; dealing acid damage each round the hold is
    maintained. Construction An ooze golem's body is constructed from pieces of
    destroyed or slain oozes. Magical bindings are used to hold the pieces
    together. These materials cost 900 gp. OOZE GOLEM CL 10th; Price 28,900 gp
