SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fate Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A theletos possesses a pair of flexible crystalline tentacles with which
      it can drain a creature's sense of fate and destiny. Whenever it strikes a
      foe with these tentacles, the creature struck must make a DC 17 Will save
      or take 1d4 points of Charisma damage. Until a creature's Charisma damage
      from this ability is healed, the victim takes a -2 penalty on all saving
      throws (regardless of the actual total amount of Charisma damage it
      takes). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Wreath of Fate (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round-action every 1d4 rounds, a theletos can release a 60-foot
      cone of energy from its chest. Any intelligent creature struck by this
      cone must make a DC 15 Will save or become nearly overwhelmed with the
      knowledge of various fates that destiny has in store for him-there is no
      way to make sense of these myriad dooms and boons, and as a result, the
      victim is staggered. As long as this condition persists, the victim may
      choose to make two rolls when attempting an attack roll, a saving throw,
      or a skill check-he must accept the worse of the two rolls, but in so
      doing the wreath of fate passes from his soul and he is no longer
      staggered by this ability. Wreath of fate is a curse effect, and as such
      can be affected by remove curse or break enchantment-the effective caster
      level of this curse is equal to the theletos's HD (CL 9th in most cases).
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The strange theletos is the guardian of the duality between freedom and
    fate. Slavery is no more of an issue to a theletos than is true freedom, but
    without one, the other cannot exist. In areas where slavery is rife, a
    theletos might aid in freeing some slaves, while in regions where slavery
    has been abolished, this strange being works to subjugate many creatures
    with its own mind-controlling spell-like abilities-often encouraging them to
    further undertake acts of slavery themselves. The theletos is also a
    guardian of fate and prophecy, and while for some creatures it might allow
    glimpses of futures, others who peer into the future almost seem to cause
    the aeon physical pain. The theletos cannot explain why one seer might be
    allowed to divine futures while another should not-it knows only that some
    prophets should be denied this pursuit.
  - A theletos is 5 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.
