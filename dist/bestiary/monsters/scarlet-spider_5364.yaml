Description:

    Scarlet spiders are small arachnids with bright red bodies and black legs.
    Scarlet spiders don't have web attacks. Though they can be found in any
    terrain, scarlet spiders are more common in environments where they can hunt
    large insects and small mammals. A spellcaster who selects a scarlet spider
    as a familiar gains a +3 bonus on Climb checks as long as the familiar
    remains within 1 mile of her; a scarlet spider familiar loses the mindless
    trait and has an Intelligence score appropriate for its master's level.
