SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hold Breath (Ex)
    description: >-
      A boggard can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to four times
      its Constitution score before it risks drowning or suffocating.
  - name: Sticky Tongue (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by a boggard's tongue attack cannot move more than 10 feet
      away from the boggard and takes a -2 penalty to AC as long as the tongue
      is attached (this penalty does not stack if multiple tongues are
      attached). The tongue can be removed by making an opposed Strength check
      as a standard action or by dealing 2 points of slashing damage to the
      tongue (AC 11, damage does not deplete the boggard's actual hit points).
      The boggard cannot move more than 10 feet away from the target, but the
      boggard can release its tongue as a free action. Unlike a giant frog, a
      boggard cannot pull targets toward it with its tongue.
  - name: Swamp Stride (Ex)
    description: >-
      A boggard can move through any sort of natural difficult terrain at its
      normal speed while within a swamp. Magically altered terrain affects a
      boggard normally.
  - name: Terrifying Croak (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per hour, a boggard can, as a standard action, emit a loud and
      horrifying croak. Any nonboggard creature within 30 feet of the boggard
      must make a DC 13 Will save or become shaken for 1d4 rounds. Creatures
      that succeed at this save cannot be affected again by the same boggard's
      croak for 24 hours. Creatures that are already shaken become frightened
      for 1d4 rounds instead. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2
      racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Boggards resemble anthropomorphic frogs or toads, complete with webbed hands
    and feet, large eyes, and overly wide mouths. These creatures make their
    homes near large rivers or deep in marshes. There they make small villages
    composed of mud mounds on the banks. Boggards start out life as tadpoles in
    breeding ponds, eventually growing to a length of 3 feet before sprouting
    arms and legs and becoming capable of terrestrial living. Acceptance into
    the clan then depends on the young boggard's successful hunt to kill a
    sentient humanoid. Those who fail are exiled from the clan. As boggards age,
    they continue to grow and lose their coloration. Exceptionally old boggards
    bear completely white skin covering massive corpulent bodies. Some of these
    boggards rank among the caste of priest-kings and enjoy a life of grotesque
    pleasures ruling their clans. Though often hunched over, boggards stand 5
    feet tall and weigh close to 200 pounds. These creatures live for 50 years,
    though the harsh swamps and infighting usually cut these years short.
