Description:
  - >-
    Haniver gremlins haunt the stories of sailors and fishing communities,
    featuring prominently in parables told to naughty children by disapproving
    parents. A thousand such tales exist, each a variation on a common theme-the
    gremlins flap up from the sea, startle nasty fishermen or disobedient
    youths, and make off with their trinkets. Yet as is rarely the case with
    such tales, nearly every word of these stories-no matter how unlikely or
    comic- proves near to the truth. Strange, capricious fey creatures that
    enjoy skimming whitecaps, flipping over solitary horseshoe crabs, and
    suicidally teasing dolphins and sharks, hanivers endlessly indulge a mad
    racial curiosity. Such is their obsession that every haniver must know what
    is under every rock, in every basket, and beneath every hat. Should they
    like what they find, they typically attempt to make off with it, clinging to
    their prize like a beloved heirloom until the next curiosity or shiny
    treasure catches their attention. Hanivers have no concept of worth, though
    they know much of desirability, and might hang onto an item they would
    otherwise discard in moments if another creature-or former owner-expresses
    desire for it. The gremlins don't steal out of any sense of maliciousness,
    but rather out of curiosity and self ishness. The most intelligent
    occasionally even believe that they're trading, and leave behind old
    "treasures"-often strange or natural items that barely fit the
    description-in place of things they've claimed. Regardless, folklore advises
    those who have something stolen by a haniver to simply abandon it rather
    than face the frustration of attempting to rescue it-hence the tendency of
    sailors to blame the hanivers whenever something goes missing. Hanivers
    possess flat, leathery bodies with only a few thin bones. Most stand little
    more than a foot tall and 1-1/2 feet across, and weigh less than 5 pounds.
