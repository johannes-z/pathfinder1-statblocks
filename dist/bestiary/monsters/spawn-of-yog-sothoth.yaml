  - name: Tenuous Natural Invisibility (Ex)
    description: >-
      This functions like natural invisibility, except it is subject to
      invisibility purge and effects that outline invisible creatures (such as
      glitterdust and faerie fire). It cannot be dispelled.
Description:
  - >-
    The spawn of Yog-Sothoth are begotten upon the world as the results of vile
    rituals in which cultists call down the essence of Yog-Sothoth, an Outer God
    from beyond the stars (see page 135) to impregnate a humanoid creature. The
    Outer God is not of this dimension or world; only by incorporating flesh and
    bone of a mortal can its spawn exist. Upon death, a spawn's flesh rapidly
    melts until nothing remains but a crusty stain. Although the spawn of
    Yog-Sothoth are naturally invisible, they exude a hideous, unforgettable
    stench that alerts others to their presence. Ancient legend holds that the
    spawn of Yog-Sothoth are inflicted upon a world to clear it of all sane life
    and to prepare the way for the return of the Great Old Ones. But it's just
    as likely that the carnage and mayhem it brings upon the world is due to its
    ravenous and constant hunger for blood as any agenda from masters beyond the
    stars. A spawn of Yog-Sothoth grows quickly to Large size, but if it
    continues to feed, it also continues to grow, albeit at a lesser rate. A
    truly ancient spawn of Yog-Sothoth can be the size of a barn or even a small
    hill. Not all spawn of Yog-Sothoth are massive or inhuman. Some (often twins
    to their more monstrous kin) remain roughly humanoid in shape and size,
    although their deformities still require them to wear disguises or layers of
    baggy clothing if they want to walk unchallenged in civilized regions. These
    sinister creatures have a wide range of strange and unusual abilities and
    appearances, and are usually spellcasters-typically oracles with the dark
    tapestry mystery (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 54) or sorcerers with the
    aberrant bloodline.
