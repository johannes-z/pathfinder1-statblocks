SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cursed Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Aghash's choice: confused for 1 round, shaken for 1 round, stunned for 1
      round, or deals 1d4 points of damage, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 16 negates.
      Any creature under the effects of protection from evil is immune to an
      aghash's gaze. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Sandstorm (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, as a full-round action, an aghash can create a temporary
      sandstorm. This storm has a radius of 100 feet centered on the aghash and
      lasts for 1 minute per Hit Die the aghash possesses (typically 5). This
      functions as a sandstorm (Core Rulebook 431).
Description:
  - >-
    Aghashes embody the evil eye, a curse granted by merely witnessing these
    embodiments of ruin and misfortune. Terrifying, haglike beings, aghashes
    wander deserts of the Material Plane spreading doom with their gazes. These
    wretched creatures hold nothing sacred, taking particular pleasure in
    bringing vain and arrogant mortals, particularly spellcasters, to ruin.
    Ragged and filthy, an aghash moves with a staggering motion. Its hoofed legs
    bend like those of a goat, giving its emaciated frame an obscene, jerking
    gait.
  - >-
    All divs exhibit some manner of compulsion, and aghashes' is to despise
    beautiful mortals. If given a choice between attacking two different
    opponents, an aghash always chooses the most physically becoming foe. Such
    is their loathing-or, perhaps, jealousy-that an aghash might stalk
    attractive foes, delighting in aff licting them with curses that sap their
    Charisma or otherwise undermines their charm. With its spectral hand ability
    an aghash can deliver curses from a distance, leading some victims to
    believe they've been aff licted by a disease or cursed by the gods
    themselves. All the while, the aghash lingers nearby, delighting in the
    suffering it has caused.
  - An aghash stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds.
