    description: >-
      The soul bound to the shell lives within a gem inside its chest. As long

      shell, at the same cost as creating a new soulbound shell, and retains its
      personality and memories. A soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and
      a break DC of 20. Spells A spellbound shell casts spells as a 12th-level
      cleric, witch, or wizard, but does not gain any other class abilities.
