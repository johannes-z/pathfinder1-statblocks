SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Captivating Artistry (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature with an Intelligence score of at least 3 that begins its turn
      within 30 feet of a living cave painting must succeed at a DC 15 Will
      saving throw or be fascinated for 1 round. Hostile actions by the living
      cave painting that don't target or affect the fascinated creature do not
      end the fascinated effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the
      target is immune to the same living cave painting's captivating artistry
      aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Manifestation (Sp)
    description: >-
      A living cave painting manifests itself in the three-dimensional world by
      shaping quasi-real illusions. Three times per day, a living cave painting
      can use shadow conjuration as a spell-like ability, but the shadow
      conjuration can mimic only summon nature's ally III spells. Additionally,
      whenever a conjured creature takes enough damage to destroy it, the living
      cave painting can instead, as a free action, sacrifice any number of hit
      points. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage
      done to the shadow conjuration. The caster level for this effect is 7th.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Ocherous Touch (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living cave painting's touch causes vicious wounds to appear on the
      victim's body, dealing 1d6 points of damage and 2d6 points of bleed
      damage. The living cave painting uses its Dexterity modifier instead of
      its Strength modifier to resolve all touch attacks. Two-Dimensional (Ex) A
      living cave painting exists in only two dimensions, and has some qualities
      in common with incorporeal creatures. A living cave painting has no
      Strength score. Additionally, it gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal
      to its Charisma modifier. It cannot move in three dimensions (such as
      jumping or flying), and can navigate only along solid surfaces such as
      floors, ceilings, and walls. It can attack creatures only by entering
      their squares and touching them directly. A living cave painting can crawl
      onto solid objects that can then themselves be moved through other means.
      It cannot fall or take falling damage, and it cannot use or be affected by
      combat maneuvers such as bull rush, grapple, or trip. It cannot take any
      physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or the
      opponent's equipment. It has no weight, and does not set off traps that
      are triggered by weight. A living cave painting takes no damage from
      nonmagical attacks and takes only half the normal amount of damage from
      magical weapons.
  - name: Vulnerable to Erase (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living cave painting can be targeted by an erase spell, which deals 3d6
      points of damage to the creature.
Description:
  - >-
    Little is known of the primitive tribes that preceded the great mortal
    civilizations of the Age of Legends. They possessed no written language and
    built few lasting structures, so little of their culture exists to this day.
    Yet some evidence of these ancient peoples can be found, hidden away in
    deep, remote caves protected from the ravages of time. The simple paintings
    and sculptures found in these caves speak to the primal roots of the human
    experience, and they're treasured in the modern world as pieces of art
    nearly as much as they are considered historical artifacts. Yet those who
    wish to explore these caverns or retrieve such relics must be cautious.
    Ancient guardians haunt the dark places in the earth, hiding among the
    paintings, waiting to strike down those foolish enough to disturb their
    millennia-long rest.
  - >-
    These guardians are the living cave paintings, ancient works of art animated
    by strange magic at the dawn of human civilization. They lack true bodies,
    and instead exist as two-dimensional beings painted across cave walls in
    ocher and charcoal. Living cave paintings most often depict herd animals
    such as aurochs, bison, horses, or rhinoceroses, or megafauna such as
    megaloceros that forms herds. Some others depict predatory creatures, human
    figures, or even animal-human hybrids.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    A living cave painting's temperament and behavior seem to depend on the type
    of creature (or creatures) it is painted to resemble. While all living cave
    paintings are aggressive to some extent, those that portray bison or horses
    tend to be less violent and less predatory in nature than those that depict
    lions or bears. Likewise, living cave paintings illustrated to represent
    herd animals often group together, while those showing solitary creatures
    generally eschew the company of their own kind. It is a mistake, however, to
    assume that a living cave painting is merely a two-dimensional version of
    some common animal. Even those that represent prey animals have sharp
    predatory instincts, and many an explorer has met a grisly end after
    disregarding a living cave painting of a peaceful herd animal.
  - >-
    Though they require no food or drink to survive, living cave paintings can
    consume small amounts of material-usually blood, ash, or stone pigments such
    as ocher. They seem to absorb these materials directly into their
    two-dimensional bodies, growing darker or more vivid as they do so. Living
    cave paintings sometimes accept such materials as offerings, allowing
    creatures who present them with such gifts to pass unharmed into the caverns
    they protect, though their tolerance is tenuous and short-lived even in the
    best of situations.
  - >-
    Scholars aren't sure whether living cave paintings age. Some living cave
    paintings seem to have existed for thousands of years without losing any
    potency or vitality, while others have grown faint and restive with age. It
    is even possible that apparently mundane cave paintings were once living
    cave paintings that either died or now simply lack the will or ability to
    move.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Living cave paintings reside deep in the earth, in places of sacred
    significance to the primitive cultures that created cave art during
    Golarion's primordial times. Living cave paintings in these caverns attack
    intruders out of some bestial territorial instinct rather than cruel spite
    or random violence. No matter how extensive the cave system it occupies
    might be, a living cave painting typically treats only the areas of its cave
    decorated with cave art as its territory. It generally ignores raw,
    unadorned areas,
  - >-
    though it may pursue intruders into these areas if it feels they are still a
    threat.
  - >-
    In addition to the cave itself, living cave paintings are extremely
    protective of the mundane paintings and sculptures that cover the walls of
    their cavernous homes. Explorers who damage or deface such ancient works of
    art, whether accidentally or intentionally, are sure to draw the ire of any
    nearby living cave paintings. Such behavior suggests that living cave
    paintings were first created to be guardians for these sacred places, and
    continue to act out this role long after the cultures that created them have
    died out.
  - >-
    While many living cave paintings are ancient, specimens can sometimes be
    found in more recent sites. Some living cave paintings can be found in
    caverns near the surface that were occupied by orcs during the Age of
    Darkness, and even more recently in caves inhabited by modern Kellid or
    Shoanti tribes not that far back in Avistan's past. It's not clear whether
    the living cave paintings found in these places migrated to younger sites
    from older caves, or newer cave art also has the potential to transform into
    living cave paintings. Some believe (albeit without evidence) that shamans
    among some remote tribes still preserve the age-old secret to creating new
    living cave paintings.
