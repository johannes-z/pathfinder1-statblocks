SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Paralytic Tentacles (Ex)
    description: >-
      A chuul can transfer a grappled victim from a claw to its tentacles as a
      move action. The tentacles grapple with the same strength as the claw but
      deal no damage, instead exuding a paralytic secretion. Anyone held in the
      tentacles must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save each round on the chuul's
      turn or be paralyzed for 6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
      While held in the tentacles, paralyzed or not, a victim automatically
      takes 1d8+7 points of damage each round from the creature's mandibles.
Description:
  - >-
    Chuuls are armored, crustacean-like predators that lurk beneath the surfaces
    of shallow ponds and mires, bursting from concealment to snatch up prey in
    their chitinous pincers and then paralyzing them with their mouth tentacles
    before eating them alive.
  - >-
    Chuuls are excellent swimmers but prefer to attack land-bound creatures or
    those wallowing in shallow water. Once they seize their victims, chuuls
    often drag grappled foes back into deep water to drown them.
  - >-
    Lizardfolk are by far the chuul's favorite prey, though those pale chuul
    breeds that live underground prefer morlocks, duergar, unwary drow, and
    other unfortunates who get too close to their subterranean waterways-with
    the exception of troglodytes, whose flavor chuuls find particularly
    offensive.
  - >-
    Chuuls are surprisingly intelligent, leading many to speculate fruitlessly
    on their origins and motivations.
  - >-
    They speak a chittering, burbling dialect of Common, but few are inclined to
    speak to those outside their race, and if chuul society exists beyond their
    frenzied mating season, humanoids have yet to record it. Instead, chuul
    intellects seem entirely devoted to seeking out the perfect ambush sites to
    attack other intelligent creatures and decorating their elaborate lairs with
    trophies from their kills. Though the chuuls themselves seem uninterested in
    using tools of any kind, they have an almost compulsive need to collect
    keepsakes from their victims.
  - A typical chuul is 8 feet tall and weighs 650 pounds.
