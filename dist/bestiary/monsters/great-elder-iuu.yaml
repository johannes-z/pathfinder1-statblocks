  - name: Summon Boulders (Su)
    description: >-
      Great Elder Iuu can summon three adamantine throwing rocks as a swift
      action. If thrown, the rocks disappear at the end of his turn. Any rocks
      leaving his grasp otherwise disappear immediately.
Description:
  - >-
    Great Elder Iuu is one of the first stone giants ever to set foot upon the
    mountains of Golarion, and one of the stone giants' first tribal elders.
    After he died at the age of 888, Minderhal brought him to Stonepeak for a
    century of paradise and crafting, then elevated him to serve as the god's
    herald. Minderhal sends Iuu to the mortal world in times of great trouble or
    change for the stone giant people, or to put an end to conf licts between
    tribes.
  - >-
    Iuu looks like an exceptionally tall, handsome, and wise elder stone giant
    with crystals sprouting from his head like a crown and a cloak of heavy
    moss. His weapon is Anfaru (meaning "Mountain from the Sky"), an
    adamantine-laden stone meteorite he carved over the course of 100 years into
    a hammer shape. Iuu has a deep, booming voice that can shatter mortar when
    he's angry. His crystal crown and unusual weapon have sometimes led ignorant
    members of lesser races to mistake him for a stone giant king.
  - >-
    Iuu uses his magical abilities to enhance, protect, and support himself and
    his mortal allies. Having been in countless battles against various
    creatures, he is a competent tactician; he quickly reacts to specific
    threats or enemy abilities and determines how to best use the available
    terrain and resources to overcome threats. When he gives orders, he expects
    other giants to obey immediately and without question. He believes in the
    inherent strength of his people, and although he is evil, he's unwilling to
    sacrifice their lives in risky gambits unless the survival of all the stone
    giants is at stake. He thinks little of smaller races and is indifferent to
    the "degenerate" giant races (which, according to some stone giant lore,
    includes all other races of giants).
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Iuu was born a mortal giant, and although he doesn't have to eat, he still
    has a strong attachment to the traditional foods and beverages of his
    people. When summoned to
  - >-
    the Material Plane by those with means, he expects a great feast to be
    prepared for him, and he honors his hosts by participating. If those who
    call him are impoverished, he treats whatever meager food they offer as if
    it were a fine meal, and limits what he eats so others don't go hungry.
  - >-
    Iuu does not need to sleep, and although he needs to breathe, that becomes
    an issue only if he is forced underwater or buried alive-in which case he
    can use magic such as dimension door or meld into stone to escape or
    compensate for the hazard.
  - >-
    As with mortal stone giants, Iuu's flesh appears to be made of rock, but he
    is a creature of flesh and blood. His flesh is much harder than normal
    stone, but when injured, he bleeds red. Having already lived a full mortal
    life once, he doesn't fear death, especially if his dying better serves
    Minderhal or the stone giant race as a whole. At worst, he would experience
    regret that he would not share another song or teach another student about
    the traditional ways of giantkind.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Great Elder Iuu spends decades at a time in a catatonic slumber deep within
    Minderhal's realm, and nearly as much time crafting weapons for the god's
    other servitors and building architecture for the realm itself. After one of
    his deep sleeps, it's customary for new petitioners and servitors of the god
    to seek him out and gain his blessing. Many in Stonepeak determine their
    seniority by how many cycles of Iuu's waking and sleeping they have been
    present for.
  - >-
    Iuu enjoys teaching others-whether mortals, petitioners, or outsiders-about
    crafting and the early history of the giant race, using ancient songs to
    convey these tales to eager ears. He is pleased when a student learns the
    songs he teaches, but becomes stern if his pupil accidentally or
    intentionally alters the words or cadence of the song. If he hears an
    altered version of a song or tale from another, he interrupts, insisting the
    raconteur tell it the right way and honor its proper, orthodox form.
  - >-
    Iuu is respectful toward shrines and priests of Estig (the stone giants'
    name for Erastil), Fandarra, and spirits of ancestors and stone. He doesn't
    allow followers of Urazra to speak in his presence-the first offense merits
    a verbal rebuke; the second, a beating; and the third, a beating followed by
    tribal exile.
  - >-
    Many mortal giants are related to Iuu through the countless generations
    extending back to the origin of their race. Stone giants of all tribes award
    him great respect as a powerful, wise, and noteworthy hero-ancestor-even
    those of tribes that don't worship Minderhal or that disagree with the
    herald's beliefs. When a stone giant exemplifies many of the god's ideal
    traits, members of the tribe often consider that giant a spiritual
    incarnation
  - >-
    of Iuu, as if the herald granted the leader a portion of his own spirit at
    birth, destining that child for greatness.
  - >-
    When he visits the mortal world, Iuu typically travels with other stone
    giants; it's very rare that he's encountered alone. Usually, his companions
    are members of the tribe he came to the Material Plane to help. However, in
    rare cases, the giants who accompany him are his "proud children"-worthy
    petitioners temporarily given mortal bodies in the form of fiendish stone
    giants. These companions give Iuu many hands to accomplish tasks that, even
    with his great strength and knowledge, would be difficult to handle alone.
