    description: >-
      A stampede occurs if three or more creatures with stampede make a trample
      attack while remaining adjacent to each other. While stampeding, the
      creatures can trample foes of their size or smaller, and the trample's
      save DC increases by +2.
Description:
  - >-
    Year-round grazers, scythe horns live in moderate to cold climates existing
    primarily on a diet of grasses, roots, and similar vegetation. Scythe horns
    are herd animals and most often encountered within a herd. When traveling,
    scythe horns form a straight line, with the strongest male (or bull) at the
    front of the herd. Similarly, the next strongest bull takes its spot at the
    rear of the herd. Young are always kept in the middle with the females in
    front of and behind the calves. If the herd is attacked, the female scythe
    horns (cows) move to encircle the young, while the bulls move to confront
    the threat. During winter months when ice and snow cover the ground, scythe
    horns generally congregate near water sources such as lakes or streams,
    where the ground may give easier access to the vegetation they need to
    survive. Also, during the winter months, scythe horns either obtain water
    from such streams or crush snow and ice between their flattened teeth. The
    average scythe horn is 10 to 13 feet long, standing 5 to 6 feet tall at the
    shoulders, and weighs 2,000 to 2,500 pounds. Its body is covered in a thick
    brownish-black or brownish-gray fur, longer in the front around the neck
    than in the rear of the animal. Its legs are short and thick and its black
    hooves are circular in shape. Its most identifying features are its
    magnificent ebony colored horns which curve upward and inward in a
    scythe-like shape. Scythe horns are often hunted by humanoids for their fur,
    hide (which can be crafted into hide armor), and meat. Scythe horns are
    highly territorial and move to engage any creature that comes within their
    area. They are generally passive creatures but become highly aggressive if
    their young or the herd is threatened. An enraged scythe horn butts or
    slashes with its scythe-like horns. If startled, a herd generally flees,
    starting a stampede in the process. Scimitar Horn A relative of the scythe
    horn, the scimitar horn is found only in cold plains and hills. They use the
    same statistics for the scythe horn, but have no butt attack, and attack by
    slashing with their scimitar-like horns. Copyright Notice Author Scott
