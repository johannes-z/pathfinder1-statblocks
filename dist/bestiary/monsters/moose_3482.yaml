Description:
  - >-
    Moose are the largest members of the elk family, ranging in size from 4 1/2
    feet to over 8 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing from 440 to over 1,000
    pounds. Males have broad, flat antlers that can reach a length of 5 feet or
    more. These antlers are shed each year after mating season. The moose's fur
    ranges from brown to black, changing to a dull gray in the winter months.
    They are excellent swimmers, often swimming into deep water to feed on
    aquatic plants.

    Generally non-aggressive if left alone, moose can become quite aggressive if
    approached. They have poor eyesight, but excellent hearing, and tend to flee
    rather than fight as soon as would-be attackers are detected. If forced into
    combat, a moose attacks with its antlers or hooves.
