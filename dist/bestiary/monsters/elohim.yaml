Description:
  - >-
    An elohim is a strange being obsessed with creating miniature worlds
    populated with creatures of its choosing. It creates new permanent
    demiplanes or alters remote environments in pre-existing planes, seeds them
    with new life, then eventually abandons them. An elohim might return to its
    creation decades or centuries later to observe how its progeny have fared,
    and might allow them to continue or eradicate them completely. Elohim
    communicate with other beings only rarely, and always in a cryptic fashion.
