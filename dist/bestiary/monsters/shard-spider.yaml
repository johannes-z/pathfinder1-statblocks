Description:
  - >-
    Shard spiders are giant, black, nocturnal hunting spiders that dwell in dark
    forests and feed upon those creatures unlucky enough to stumble into their
    lair. Shard spiders live under fallen trees or in tunnels in the ground. A
    nest typically contains a single shard spider and up to 10 noncombatant
    young. Shard spiders usually hunt denizens of the forests and drag their
    prey back to their lair to be divided among the young.
  - >-
    Shard spiders stand 8 feet tall. Their bodies are covered in short, thick
    black fur. Though intelligent, shard spiders seem unable to converse with
    any but their own kind. Communication among shard spiders takes the form of
    body language and hissing sounds. Shard spiders have an average lifespan of
    30 years.
  - >-
    A shard spider attacks from ambush, seeking to neutralize its prey as
    quickly as possible with its poisonous bite. Due to its magical ability to
    split, a shard spider welcomes melee and engages its foes as quickly as
    possible.
