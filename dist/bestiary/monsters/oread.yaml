Description:
  - >-
    Oreads are humans whose ancestry includes the touch of an elemental being of
    earth somewhere along its line, often that of a shaitan genie. Oreads are
    strong and solidly built, and prefer wearing earth tones that match the
    coloration of their flesh and hair-shades of gray, brown, black, or white.
    In rare cases, oreads' stone-like traits are so strong as to leave no
    question as to their nature, with growths like rocky outcroppings protruding
    from their skin or hair like crystalline spikes.
  - >-
    Oreads tend to be stoic and contemplative, slow to anger but terrible when
    roused. Outside of combat, they tend to be quiet, dependable, and protective
    of their friends.
