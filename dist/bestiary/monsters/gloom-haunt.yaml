SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Creeping Shadows (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a gloom haunt can emanate an inky darkness in a
      30-foot-radius burst as a standard action. This functions as a deeper
      darkness spell (CL 6th).
  - name: Incorporeal Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      By passing part of its incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard
      action, the gloom haunt inflicts 7d6 damage. This damage is not negative
      energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from
      supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this
      damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A
      Fortitude save halves the damage inflicted.
  - name: Pain Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      A gloom haunt adds its Charisma modifier on damage rolls with its
      incorporeal touch. Additionally, the touch of a gloom haunt sends a wave
      of intense pain through the opponent's body. A creature touched must
      succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round and shaken for
      1d4+2 rounds thereafter. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Shadow Mastery (Su)
    description: >-
      A gloom haunt is a creature of darkness. In areas of total darkness
      (including that created by its creeping shadows ability), a gloom haunt
      gains a +2 racial bonus on attack rolls, saves, and checks. These bonuses
      are not included in the statistics block.
  - name: Shadowy Resolve (Su)
    description: >-
      In areas of shadowy illumination or total darkness, a gloom haunts channel
      resistance increases to +4.
Description:
  - >-
    Gloom haunts are believed to somehow be related to shadows though most
    learned scholars agree that people simply relate them to shadows because of
    their resemblance to said creatures. In actuality, gloom haunts are
    different creatures, unrelated to the aforementioned undead at all. While
    both prefer areas of gloom and darkness, and both seem to be formed of
    shadowstuff, that's where the similarities end.
  - >-
    Gloom haunts are vile evil creatures, who seem to have no ties to the living
    (i.e., scholars cannot find any reasonable explanation as to why they
    exist), though a few learned sages believe gloom haunts to be the spiritual
    remains of paladins who were sacrificed by evil clerics to their vile and
    dark gods. Gloom haunts are found haunting graves, dungeons, and catacombs.
    These creatures detest light (though they are not harmed by it) and move
    about at night when their natural coloration and abilities help them the
    most.
  - >-
    A gloom haunt appears as a humanoid-shaped somewhat translucent creature
    formed of darkness. Two small pinpoints of red light function as eyes. A
    gloom haunt does not speak or utter any sounds.
  - >-
    Gloom haunts use their ability to hide in shadows to wait for living
    creatures to come close. When such a creature does, glooms haunt leap to the
    attack.
