  - name: Serrated Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A kytha's bite always deals 1-1/2 its Strength modifier on damage rolls
      and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.
Description:
  - >-
    Kytha are lesser demons found throughout the various layers of the Abyss.
    Though native to just about all of the Abyssal planes, they generally avoid
    those steeped in cold and ice (they have no particular vulnerability to
    cold; they just don't like it).
  - >-
    Kytha are often employed by the Abyssal dukes and nobles as ground troops
    and soldiers in their battles against one another and against interlopers
    from other planes. The kytha's love of blood and battle greatly enhances
    their usefulness in the eyes of many of the Abyssal nobility.
  - >-
    When not serving in the rank-and-file of some Abyssal noble's army, these
    monsters are found roaming the various Abyssal planes hunting and tracking
    down food, which to a kytha is just about anything it can catch and kill. It
    has a great fondness for the flesh of minor demons (dretch for example) and
    humans. Captured prey is usually devoured on the spot; rarely does a kytha
    kill something and save it for later.
  - >-
    A kytha stands about 7 feet tall and weighs around 300 pounds. Its skin is
    usually blue-black or solid black, and its eyes red. The fin-like spines
    running down its back are coal black.
  - >-
    Upon entering combat, a kytha often frightens its opponents as it seemingly
    changes into a mindless killing machine; roaring and growling, drooling and
    hissing, as it circles its prey. A kytha attacks with its wickedly-sharp
    claws and with its envenomed tongue. Kytha enjoy combat, especially against
    creatures weaker than themselves, and so they never flee unless facing
    overwhelming odds. Many kytha however, equate fleeing with cowardice and
    choose to fight to the death, no matter the odds.
