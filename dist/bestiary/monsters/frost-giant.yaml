Description:
  - >-
    A frost giant's hair can be light blue or dirty yellow, and its eyes usually
    match its hair color. Frost giants dress in skins and pelts, along with any
    jewelry they own.
  - >-
    Frost giant warriors also don chain shirts and metal helmets decorated with
    horns or feathers. An adult male stands about 15 feet tall and weighs
    approximately 2,800 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter, but
    otherwise identical to males. Frost giants can live to be 250 years old.

    Frost giants are among the most feared giants, as their wanton destruction,
    battle lust, and fearless demeanor push them to ever-increasing displays of
    brutality. Frost giants usually start combat at a distance, throwing rocks
    until they run out of ammunition or the opponent closes, then wading in with
    their enormous greataxes. A favorite tactic is to lay an ambush by hiding
    buried in the snow at the top of an icy or snowy slope, where opponents will
    have difficulty reaching them, and then starting an avalanche before leaping
    into battle. Frost giants can hide well in snowy environments and are
    masters of stealth in their domain.

    Frost giants survive on hunting and raiding alone, as they live in desolate,
    frigid environments. Frost giant groups are split almost evenly between
    those that live in makeshift settlements or abandoned castles and those that
    roam the frozen north as nomads in search of spoils and provisions. Frost
    giant leaders call themselves jarls and demand absolute obedience from their
    followers. At any time a jarl may be challenged by combat for leadership of
    the tribe. These challenges typically result in the death of one of the
    combatants. A single jarl can often count a dozen or more smaller frost
    giant tribes as part of his extended tribe. In such a situation, the leaders
    of the lesser tribes are known simply as chieftains or warlords.

    Frost giants love to take captives, and use them for food as well as slaves
    and commodities.
  - >-
    Every group of frost giants typically has 1-2 humanoid slaves shackled to a
    slave handler- usually the meanest and cruelest non-jarl in the group. They
    are also quite fond of monstrous pets- white dragons and winter wolves are
    popular choices, but remorhazes, yetis, and even linnorms can be found
    dwelling in a frost giant lair.
