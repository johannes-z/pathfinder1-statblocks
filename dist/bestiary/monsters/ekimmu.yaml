SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Incorporeal Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      By passing part of its incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard
      action, the ekimmu inflicts 7d6 damage. This damage is not negative
      energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from
      supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this
      damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A
      Fortitude save halves the damage inflicted.
  - name: Lifesense (Su)
    description: >-
      An ekimmu notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if
      it possessed the blindsight ability.
  - name: Malevolence (Su)
    description: >-
      The ekimmu's jealousy of the living is particularly potent. Once per
      round, the ekimmu can merge its body with a creature on the Material
      Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (CL 8th), except that
      it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ekimmu must be
      adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful
      DC 21 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same
      ekimmu's malevolence for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based and
      includes a +2 bonus from the ekimmu's Ability Focus feat.
  - name: Paralyzing Howl (Su)
    description: >-
      At will, an ekimmu can let out a fearsome howl that paralyzes all within a
      30 feet radius for 1d4+1 rounds unless they succeed on a DC 19 Will save.
      A creature that successfully saves is immune to that ekimmu's howl for one
      day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      In most cases, it's difficult to destroy an ekimmu through simple combat:
      the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d6 days. Even the most powerful
      spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently
      destroy an ekimmu is to determine the reason for its existence and set
      right whatever prevents it from entering the underworld.
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of an ekimmu, unless a
      master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check.
Description:
  - >-
    An ekimmu is the evil ghost of one who has been denied entrance to the
    underworld and is doomed to wander the earth. It is greatly feared, for it
    attaches itself quite easily to virtually any living person regardless of
    whether that person has been acquainted with the dead one. Once it has
    possessed a living host, it is very difficult to exorcise.
  - >-
    An ekimmu roams the lands near where it was killed. Though it is not bound
    to the area, it feels a sense of connection to it and rarely wanders more
    than a few miles from it. An ekimmu has no permanent lair and wanders its
    realm perpetually, always on the move.
  - >-
    An ekimmu roams the earth, seeking victims to possess and using its hosts to
    bring misfortune and death to the living. Its howling in the night is often
    the only warning of its approach. In battle, it uses its array of abilities
    to defeat and destroy its opponents, opening combat with its paralyzing howl
    and then using its malevolence to attack a target it deems weak-willed and
    open for possession.
