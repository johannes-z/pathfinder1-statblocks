SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Icewalking (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cold rider and any creature it rides can move across icy surfaces
      without penalty and do not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge
      on ice. They may climb icy surfaces as if under the effects of the spider
      climb spell.
  - name: Implements of Ice (Su)
    description: >-
      A cold rider wears full plate armor and wields a +2 icy burst glaive made
      of magical ice as hard as steel. Its armor does not restrict it in any
      way. When a cold rider dies, its armor and glaive melt into water in 1d6
      rounds.
  - name: Susceptible to Shatter (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shatter spell deals 3d6 points of damage to a cold rider (no save) and
      reduces its armor bonus by 2 for 1 minute. Shatter spells automatically
      overcome a cold rider's spell resistance.
Description:
  - >-
    Cold riders are terrifying armored majesties, clad in cloaks of frost with a
    pair of large crystal-blue antlers cresting their almost skeletal heads.
    Their icy armor and weapons are as much a part of them as their frozen
    flesh. Cold riders delight in perversion, slaughter, and the corruption of
    other fey. They prefer undead or cold-resistant steeds, but even when they
    have no access to such, their phantom steed spell-like ability ensures they
    never go long without a mount.
  - >-
    Cold riders are 7 feet tall, though their antlers easily add another 2 feet
    to their height. They weigh 300 pounds.
