  - name: Megaswarm Traits (Ex)
    description: >-
      Megaswarms are not so called because of the size of the swarm but rather
      the size of the creatures that compose the swarm. Unlike normal swarms,
      megaswarms are composed of Small creatures which are usually a megafauna
      version of a normal swarm and otherwise behave in a swarmlike manner.
      There are usually around 100 creatures in a megaswarm. The net effect is
      that they take only half damage from piercing weapons but take normal
      damage from other weapons. In addition when the swarm is reduced to 0 hit
      points or lower and breaks up, unless the damage was dealt by
      area-affecting attacks, then 2d6 surviving members of the megaswarm
      continue their attack, though now only as individual creatures. Otherwise,
      a megaswarm conforms to all of the other swarm traits as described in the
      Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary.
Description:
  - >-
    Much like a swarm of ordinary rats, a dire rat swarm is composed of a
    teeming mass of disease-ridden dire rats intent on feeding on whatever they
    can catch. A dire rat swarm usually exists in abandoned ruins or city dumps
    where there is a plentiful food supply and a lack of significant predators.
  - >-
    A dire rat swarm seeks to overrun and attack any warm-blooded prey it
    encounters. It typically ignores undead and other creatures that are not
    warm-blooded.
