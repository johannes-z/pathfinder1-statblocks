SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Wounding (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any living creature damaged by a bat swarm continues to bleed, losing 1
      hit point per round thereafter. Multiple wounds do not result in
      cumulative bleeding loss. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 10 Heal
      check or the application of a cure spell or some other healing magic.
Description:
  - >-
    Bat swarms dwell in large caves, ruins, or even city sewers-anywhere they
    can find darkness to hide in during the day and a supply of food to feast
    upon at night. They are only encountered outside in a group at dawn or dusk,
    or when they have been startled and forced to flee their lairs.
