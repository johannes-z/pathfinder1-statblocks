SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Positive Energy Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Living creatures within the manitou's aura heal 5 hit points on its turn
      each round. A manitou can exclude a number of creatures equal to its
      Charisma modifier (typically 7) from the aura's effect, and can cease or
      resume the aura as a free action.
  - name: Spirit Stampede (Su)
    description: >-
      Every 1d4 rounds, a manitou can call upon animal spirits to attack,
      affecting a 60-foot cone and dealing 10d6 points of force damage (Reflex
      DC 26 half). Using this ability temporarily weakens the manitou's
      connection with the natural world, halting its positive energy aura until
      the stampede is ready to be used again.
  - name: Token of Fortune (Su)
    description: >-
      A manitou can imbue an small object, such as a stone or necklace, with its
      blessing. The object's bearer and any allies within 10 feet gain a +2 luck
      bonus on saving throws. The manitou can use scrying on the token at will.
      The manitou can teleport to it (without error) once per day as a swift
      action. These abilities are lost if the token leaves the manitou's
      territory. A manitou may only have one token active at a time.
Description:
  - >-
    A manitou is a powerful, benevolent spirit of nature that safeguards entire
    regions from danger, heals the sick and wounded, and preserves the balance
    among all creatures. When not invisible, a manitou looks like a powerfully
    built, long-haired humanoid with skin made of tree bark and rose quartz. A
    manitou stands 20 feet tall and weighs over 5,000 pounds.
