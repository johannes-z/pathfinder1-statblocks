Description:
  - >-
    Lesser ooze demons are soldiers in the abyssal army of the Faceless Lord and
    the servants in his abyssal lair. They are relatively weak demons and are
    often pushed around and controlled by superior demons.
  - Lesser ooze demons stand about 7 feet tall.
  - >-
    Lesser ooze demons charge into combat and pound their enemies with their
    fists, or bite with their sharp teeth. They rely on their acid to fell their
    foes and depend on their damage reduction and spell resistance to protect
    them from harm. Ooze demons usually flee if the battle goes poorly, though
    if under the command of a more powerful demon (such as a greater ooze demon
    leading a squad of lesser ooze demons into battle), they do not retreat and
    always fight to the death.
