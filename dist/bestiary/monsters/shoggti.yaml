Description_Visual: >-
  This pale creature has four suckered arms that end in pincers. A gnashing maw
  gapes in its head between two staring eyes.
Group: Qlippoth
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 2
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Braincloud (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round, in place of a melee attack with a tentacle, a shoggti can
      make a melee touch attack with the pincer on the end of that tentacle. If
      it hits, the target takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. Shoggti use this
      ability to mentally debilitate their victims so they can more easily use
      their charm spell-like abilities against them.
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures that succumb to a shoggti's horrific appearance become
      fascinated by the creature's hypnotically wriggling tentacles and the
      strange, shimmering colors in its eyes. This effect persists for 1d6
      rounds (but can be ended by the normal methods of defeating the fascinated
      condition).
Description:
  - >-
    The shoggti are masters of mind manipulation, capable of seizing control of
    the thoughts of others and charming them into docile allies. They invade
    other realms in slaver bands, seeking out creatures to capture alive and
    return to the Abyss as charmed slaves-the fates of these poor souls is
    unknown, but likely has something to do with the qlippoth drive to reclaim
    the Abyss as their own.
  - >-
    Although a shoggti lacks proper hands, it is capable of performing
    incredibly dextrous manipulations with the pincers at the tips of its
    tentacles. It cannot wield weapons in these pincers, but it can utilize
    magic items like wands, rods, staves, and the like. Shoggti are fond of
    wands in particular, particularly those that create mind-affecting effects
    that are easy to inf lict on victims of their braincloud ability.
  - >-
    A shoggti's body is an egg-shaped mass about 8 feet long-its tentacles are
    about 8 feet long as well. The whole creature weighs 900 pounds.
