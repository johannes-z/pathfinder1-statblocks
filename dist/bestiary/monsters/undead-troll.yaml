Description:
  - >-
    Sometimes when a troll dies, the evilness within the creature raises it as
    an undead troll; a mockery of life and even more evil than it was before (if
    such is possible). Undead trolls despise all living creatures, especially
    other trolls. Their sole purpose now seems to be to kill and devour every
    living thing they encounter. Undeath seems to have cursed them with an
    eternal hunger, and undead trolls are forever seeking to satiate their
    appetite. Undead trolls do not eat other undead trolls however. Though they
    tend to inhabit the same cold mountains they did in life, undead trolls can
    be found anywhere.
  - >-
    Undead trolls generally resemble normal trolls in stature. Their flesh has
    taken on a sickly green appearance and is rotting in various places. Their
    teeth and nails are filthy and these creatures are almost always caked in
    dried blood.
  - >-
    Undead trolls are relentless in combat, always fighting to the death. They
    attack as do standard trolls, using wicked claws and bites. While they lack
    the true regenerative powers of a standard troll, their ability to quickly
    heal still complicates combat for a lot of would-be troll slayers.
