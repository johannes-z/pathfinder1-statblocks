  - name: Infestation (Su)
    description: >-
      An infestation of poisonous spiders, which nest within this creature's
      exoskeleton, constantly surrounds a deathweb, to a radius of 5 feet. Any
      creature within the infestation takes 1d6 points of damage at the end of
      each round it remains in the area. A creature that takes this damage must
      make a DC 17 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. In addition,
      those damaged by this infestation are poisoned as well. Any area effect
      attack that deals 10 or more points of damage to a deathweb destroys its
      infesting spiders, removing its aura for 3 rounds, after which a new batch
      of spiders swarms out of the undead's body to replenish the infestation.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A deathweb is the undead exoskeleton of a massive spider animated with the
    vilest necromancy. The spells that create this monstrosity bind to it
    thousands of normal spiders, which together form the mind of the undead
    beast like an arachnid hive. These smaller spiders live in and direct their
    exoskeleton home, working together to swarm around the deathweb and weave
    its web sheets.
  - >-
    The exoskeleton of a deathweb is cracked and full of holes to allow the
    resident spiders easy passage into and out of it. Although the exoskeleton
    can be up to 10 feet long, the largest spiders within are only 6 inches in
    length. The variety in the sizes of the internal spiders allows them to ably
    move all parts of the exoskeleton, giving the massive carapace amazing
    dexterity and swiftness, as well as cleverness, perception, and presence.
  - >-
    These capabilities make deathwebs resourceful and frightening opponents,
    especially when adversaries mistake them for normal monstrous arachnids or
    mindless undead. Because of their ability to squeeze into tight
    surroundings, deathwebs may be found lurking in all manner of niches.
  - >-
    Deathwebs lair where they can build webs to trap passersby, such as among
    thick trees or in caves or tunnels. The creatures don't actively collect
    valuables, but they kill indiscriminately to feed the multitude of spiders
    within. Webs in a deathweb's lair are thus likely to contain valuables
    despite the creature's lack of interest in wealth.
