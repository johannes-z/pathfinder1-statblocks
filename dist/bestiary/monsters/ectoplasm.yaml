Description_Visual: >-
  This creature gives off light with the approximate brightness of a candle, and
  appears to be a shimmering cloud of filaments, tendrils, and whips of eerie
  mist. The form of the thing continuously roils and billows like a cloud, and
  it is eerily silent.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 2 rounds as a standard action, an ectoplasm can release a
      20-foot cone of ectoplasmic goo at its foes. Affected opponents must
      succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be affected as if by a sleep spell
      (caster level 7th). A successful save renders a creature immune to that
      ectoplasm's breath weapon for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Glow (Su)
    description: >-
      An ectoplasm continually gives off light with the approximate brightness
      of a candle. It cannot consciously extinguish this light. When an
      ectoplasm is killed, this light fades to darkness.
  - name: Manifestation (Su)
    description: >-
      An ectoplasm dwells on the Ethereal Plane and as an ethereal creature, it
      cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material world. When an
      ectoplasm manifests, it partly enters the Material Plane and becomes
      visible but incorporeal. A manifested ectoplasm can be harmed only by
      other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, or spells, with a 50% chance
      to ignore any damage from a corporeal source. A manifested ectoplasm can
      pass through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through
      armor. A manifested ectoplasm always moves silently.
  - name: Strength Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      The touch of an ectoplasm deals 1d8 points of Strength damage to living
      opponents.
  - name: Undead Bane (Su)
    description: >-
      Against corporeal undead, an ectoplasm deals 1d8 points of Strength damage
      and 1d8 points of damage. Ectoplasms ignore the damage reduction of
      corporeal undead.
Description:
  - >-
    Many encounters with glowing, ghostly spheres can be attributed to
    ectoplasms rather than restless spirits. An ectoplasm, sometimes called a
    ghost ooze, is a faintly glowing orb of immaterial substance that lurks in
    catacombs and cemeteries. Although incorrectly assumed by most to be some
    form of incorporeal undead, ectoplasms are quite alive. Ectoplasms dwell in
    places of the dead because they consume dead flesh, slowly dissolving
    decaying bones and skin and absorbing the nutrients directly. The strange
    irony of the ectoplasm is that a cemetery â€˜haunted' by these creatures is
    almost certain to be free of any corporeal undead; the ectoplasm makes a
    meal of them as soon as it discovers them. Ectoplasms are not undead and
    cannot be turned by clerics. Although its primary diet consists of the dead,
    an ectoplasm is also a threat to the living. An ectoplasm attacks anything
    within the range of its senses that disturbs it. An ectoplasm that
    encounters a living opponent attacks for a few rounds before attempting to
    escape-it senses that it can get no sustenance from the opponent. If it
    finds an undead opponent, an ectoplasm continues to attack until it or the
    opponent has been destroyed. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.
