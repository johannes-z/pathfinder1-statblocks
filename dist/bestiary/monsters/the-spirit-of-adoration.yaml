  - name: Inspiration (Su)
    description: >-
      The Spirit of Adoration can inspire an intelligent creature by giving it a
      token of her favor. As long as the creature carries her token, it gains a
      +4 insight bonus on all Will saving throws, Craft checks, and Perform
      checks. An inspired bard adds the spirit's Charisma bonus (+6) to his
      number of bardic performance rounds per day. The spirit retains a link to
      her token and its carrier as if she had cast the spell status on the
      carrier. The spirit can end this effect at any time as a free action. The
      spirit may inspire a number of creatures at a time equal to her Charisma
      bonus.
