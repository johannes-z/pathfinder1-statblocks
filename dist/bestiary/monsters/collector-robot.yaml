SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adaptive Tracker (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a collector robot can adapt itself to any
      environment in which it travels, granting it a +2 bonus on initiative
      checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks
      while in that kind of terrain.
  - name: Integrated Stun Gun (Ex)
    description: >-
      A collector robot has an integrated stun gun slung beneath its body. This
      weapon uses a powerful sonic amplifier to produce powerful low-frequency
      blasts of energy that pummel targets. This weapon has a range increment of
      20 feet, and it deals 1d8 points of nonlethal damage. On a critical hit,
      the robot can attempt a free trip combat maneuver (CMB +12) against the
      target, which does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
  - name: Integrated Tracking (Ex)
    description: >-
      A collector robot has integrated systems that allow it to tag and track
      creatures. As a full-round action, a collector robot can implant a tracker
      chipTG into the body of a target that it is grappling or a helpless
      target. Once implanted, the tracker chip is activated and the collector
      robot's chipfinder can detect the presence of the implanted tracker chip
      within 1 mile. It uses a signal to locate the tracker chips, and this
      signal can be blocked by 1 foot of metal, 5 feet of stone, or 20 feet of
      organic matter. A tracker chip can be removed with a sharp tool. Doing so
      deals 1 point of damage. Once an implanted tracker chip is removed from
      the body (or remains in a body after it dies) it retains enough energy to
      continue to be detected by the collector robot's sensors for 1 week.
  - name: Reactive Gyros (Ex)
    description: >-
      The rotors that grant a collector robot flight also provide quick
      reactions to threats and external stimuli, granting it a +3 racial bonus
      on Reflex saves.
Description:
  - >-
    Serving as long-distance scouts, trackers, and acquisition agents, collector
    robots see frequent use in the study and collection of alien life forms on
    new worlds. They can operate independently for years, cataloging unique
    species while enduring extreme environments that would overwhelm their
    biological makers. These machines may tag a captive creature with a tracker
    chip that can be monitored and tracked with their integrated chipfinders.
    They do so to observe and document the behavioral patterns of such creatures
    from afar, studying viable specimens for days until they eventually isolate
    and retrieve the studied prey again for further examination in the
    controlled laboratories of the robots' masters.
  - >-
    Among their more impressive features, collector robots possess a hardened
    artificial intelligence, maintaining a singular focus on their mission
    directives even when wandering out of communication range with their owners.
    They tend to react swiftly to movement and perceived threats to their
    physical security, either emitting loud tones or alarms as a preemptive
    warning, or flying upward to gain altitude before assessing a given
    situation and potentially opening fire in defense of itself. Some collector
    robots grow more lax in their analysis protocols over time, giving way to a
    state similar to paranoia if left in the field for too long. This corrupted
    logic inevitably leads them to interpret even the most innocuous actions as
    proof of hostile intent. Other collectors become fixated on their directive
    to retrieve specimens without undue damage, interpreting it as a need to
    protect their targets from all possible sources of harm.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Collector robots have no defined Ecology, as they are built by others and
    gifted with a unique purpose and skill set. Most often, they emerge from
    automated factories, engineering shops, and scrap heaps under the direction
    of a controlling authority that activates them and assigns their missions.
    Thereafter, the power cores of collector robots last indefinitely. Most
    collector robots have fusion generators, but some have the ability to derive
    power from the sun,
  - >-
    making them capable of recharging several weeks' worth of operating power
    with solar energy in a single daytime "sleep" cycle. During prolonged
    missions, collector robots often support one another in the absence of their
    masters, dragging damaged units back to repair facilities and cooperating to
    achieve any mutual goals. Collector robots have a similar protectiveness
    toward other robots of various types, treating them almost like siblings.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Collector robots have little in the way of organized society, but do array
    themselves in a rigid hierarchy as designated by their controlling
    authority. Individual collectors may carry a higher rank than other robots,
    and thus are capable of commanding lesser machines they encounter or even
    overriding their programming with new directives as they commandeer aid in
    carrying out their assigned missions. This often leads to symbiotic
    relationships with servant robots capable of repairing and assisting with
    their upkeep.
  - >-
    Collector robots first appeared in Numeria, but some have since wandered
    further afield, slaves to their dedicated programming as they go about
    cataloging, tagging, and occasionally tracking various life forms- sentient
    or otherwise. Some rogue collector robots kidnap people and creatures, and
    secret them away in remote caves. Others cascaded from the starship Divinity
    during its original descent, falling to Golarion as newly deployed probes
    far outside the range of Unity's control, thus free to pursue individual
    interests. A few enterprising Technic League wizards and alchemists have
    managed to control some of these automatons, taming and reprogramming them
    to suit their purposes. New directives for these automatons typically
    involve the abduction or assassination of targets that their overseers
    program into them.
  - Variants
  - >-
    The chassis developed for collector robots has proven exceptionally
    versatile over the years, giving rise to multiple configurations and
    alternate capabilities. These are less likely to be encountered than a
    typical collector robot. Some of the models include:
  - >-
    Aquatic Collector Robots (CR +0): Adapted for use in marine environments,
    aquatic collector robots abandon flight for a swim speed of 30 ft. Their
    integrated stun guns still function underwater, though they are based on
    frequencies designed to work more eff iciently in aquatic environments.
  - >-
    Extermination Robots (CR +1): Newly encountered life forms can sometimes
    threaten the safety of landing parties or the ecological balance of
    controlled environments. Extermination robots serve a more specialized role
    than collectors, programming themselves to track and annihilate a single
    type of creature. This ability grants a favored enemy bonus (as the ranger
    class ability) against a single creature type chosen from the ranger favored
    enemies table. The robot also comes equipped with a longer-range arc
    rifleTG.
  - >-
    Trapper Robots (CR +1): Some robots cover a wider range of territory by
    deploying traps rather than hunting creatures individually. Designed to
    capture specimens for retrieval and sedation, they have gravity-based snares
    which function similar to the snare spell. They can deploy up to five of
    these devices and remain linked to them via tracker chips and an integrated
    chipfinder. When a snare is sprung, it sends an alert to the trapper robot,
    which then hurries to retrieve its quarry.
