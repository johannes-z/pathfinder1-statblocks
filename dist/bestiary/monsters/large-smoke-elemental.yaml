SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Air Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against a
      smoke elemental.
  - name: Burn (Ex)
    description: >-
      A smoke elemental's burn DC includes a -2 racial penalty, as their fires
      don't burn as hot as a true fire elemental's flames.
  - name: Engulf (Ex)
    description: >-
      A smoke elemental can engulf creatures of its size or smaller into its
      smoky form as part of a standard action. It cannot make any other attack
      in which it engulfs. The smoke elemental merely has to move over its
      opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Targeted creatures can make
      attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so, they are
      not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack. Those who do not
      attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a Reflex save to avoid being
      engulfed-on a success, they move back or aside (target's choice). The
      smoke obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet and grants
      concealment to creatures inside the cloud from attacks by opponents that
      are not adjacent to them. Engulfed opponents do not gain the pinned
      condition and may move normally. Each round a creature begins its turn
      engulfed, it suffers from burning eyes (-2 on attack rolls and Perception
      checks) and takes 3d6 points of fire damage from smoke inhalation. The
      penalties and damage continue for a number of rounds equal to the smoke
      elemental's Hit Dice even after escaping the engulf. A creature can make a
      Fortitude save (DC is listed with each elemental) to end the penalties and
      damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Gaseous (Ex)
    description: >-
      A smoke elemental can pass through small holes or narrow openings without
      reducing its speed.
  - name: Vulnerability to Wind (Ex)
    description: >-
      A smoke elemental is treated as two sizes smaller for purposes of
      determining the effects high wind has upon it.
Description:
  - >-
    Smoke elementals are creatures of elemental smoke: part fire, part air.
    Where the Elemental Plane of Air meets the Elemental Plane of Fire lies a
    para-elemental plane, that of Elemental Smoke. It is from that black clouded
    region that these creatures hail.
  - >-
    Smoke elementals spend most of their time on their home plane, only
    occasionally venturing into the Elemental Planes of Air or Fire. Rarely do
    they ever enter the Material Plane unless called by a spellcaster.
  - >-
    A smoke elemental appears as a cloud of black smoke or thick fog. No
    discernible features can be seen in its form, though it can reshape itself
    at will to form two large eyes and a mouth of empty darkness (which serve no
    purpose other than to perhaps startle onlookers).
