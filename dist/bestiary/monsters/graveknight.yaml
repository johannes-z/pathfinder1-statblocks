Description:
  - >-
    Undying tyrants and eternal champions of the undead, graveknights arise from
    the corpses of the most nefarious warlords and disgraced heroes-villains too
    merciless to submit to the shackles of death. They bear the same weapons and
    regalia they did in life, though warped or empowered by their profane
    resurrection. The legions they once held also flock to them in death, ready
    to serve their wicked ambitions once more. A graveknight's essence is
    fundamentally tied to its armor, the bloodstained trappings of its battle
    lust. This armor becomes an icon of its perverse natures, transforming into
    a monstrous second skin over the husk of desiccated flesh and scarred bone
    locked within.
  - CREATING A GRAVEKNIGHT
  - >-
    "Graveknight" is an acquired template that can be added to any living
    creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base
    creature). Most graveknights were once humanoids. A graveknight uses the
    base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here.
  - 'CR: Same as base creature +2.'
  - 'Alignment: Any evil.'
  - >-
    Type: The graveknight's type changes to undead (augmented). Do not
    recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.
  - 'Senses: A graveknight gains darkvision 60 ft.'
  - 'Aura: A graveknight emanates the following aura.'
  - >-
    Sacrilegious Aura (Su): A graveknight constantly exudes an aura of intense
    evil and negative energy in a 30-foot radius. This aura functions as the
    spell desecrate and uses the graveknight's armor as an altar of sorts to
    double the effects granted. The graveknight constantly gains the benefits of
    this effect (including the bonus hit points, as this aura is part of the
    graveknight's creation). In addition, this miasma of fell energies hinders
    the channeling of positive energy. Any creature that attempts to summon
    positive energy in this area-such as through a cleric's channel energy
    ability, a paladin's lay on hands, or any spell with the healing
    subtype-must make a concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the
    graveknight's Hit Dice + the graveknight's Charisma modifier. If the
    character fails, the effect is expended but does not function.
  - 'Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +4.'
  - >-
    Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected.
    As an undead, a graveknight uses its Charisma modifier to determine bonus
    hit points.
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: A graveknight gains channel resistance +4; DR 10/magic;
    and immunity to cold, electricity, and any additional energy type noted by
    its ruinous revivification special quality. A graveknight also gains spell
    resistance equal to its augmented CR + 11.
  - The graveknight also gains the following ability.
  - >-
    Rejuvenation (Su): One day after a graveknight is destroyed, its armor
    begins to rebuild the undead horror's body. This process takes 1d10 days-if
    the body is destroyed before that time passes, the armor merely starts the
    process anew. After this time has elapsed, the graveknight wakens fully
    healed.
  - >-
    Attacks: A graveknight gains a slam attack if the base creature didn't have
    one. Damage for the slam depends on the graveknight's size (see Bestiary
    302).
  - >-
    Special Attacks: A graveknight gains the following special attacks. Save DCs
    are equal to 10 + 1/2 the graveknight's HD + the graveknight's Charisma
    modifier unless otherwise noted.
  - >-
    Channel Destruction (Su): Any weapon a graveknight wields seethes with
    energy, and deals an additional 1d6 points of damage for every 4 Hit Dice
    the graveknight has. This additional damage is of the energy type determined
    by the ruinous revivification special quality.
  - >-
    Devastating Blast (Su): Three times per day, the graveknight may unleash a
    30-foot cone of energy as a standard action. This blast deals 2d6 points of
    damage for every 3 Hit Dice a graveknight has (Reflex for half ). This
    damage is of the energy type determined by the graveknight's ruinous
    revivification special quality.
  - >-
    Undead Mastery (Su): As a standard action, a graveknight can attempt to bend
    any undead creature within 50 feet to its will. The targeted undead must
    succeed at a Will save or fall under the graveknight's control. This control
    is permanent for unintelligent undead; an undead with an Intelligence score
    is allowed an additional save every day to break free from the graveknight's
    control. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the
    same graveknight's undead mastery for 24 hours.
  - >-
    A graveknight can control 5 Hit Dice of undead creatures for every Hit Die
    it has. If the graveknight exceeds this number, the excess from earlier uses
    of the ability becomes uncontrolled, as per animate dead.
  - 'Special Qualities: A graveknight gains the following.'
  - >-
    Phantom Mount (Su): Once per hour, a graveknight can summon a skeletal horse
    similar to a phantom steed. This mount is more real than a typical phantom
    steed, and can carry one additional rider. The mount's powers are based on
    the graveknight's total Hit Dice rather than caster level. A graveknight's
    mount looks distinctive and always appears the same each time it is
    summoned. If the mount is destroyed, it can be summoned again with full hit
    points 1 hour later.
  - >-
    Ruinous Revivification (Su): At the time of its creation, the graveknight
    chooses one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire.
    This energy type should be relevant to the graveknight's life or death,
    defaulting to fire if none are especially appropriate. This energy type inf
    luences the effects of several of a graveknight's special abilities.
  - >-
    Ability Scores: Str +6, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a
    graveknight has no Constitution score.
  - >-
    Skills: Graveknights gain a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate, Perception, and
    Ride checks.
  - >-
    Feats: Graveknights gain Improved Initiative, Mounted Combat, Ride-By
    Attack, and Toughness as bonus feats.
  - GRAVEKNIGHT ARMOR
  - >-
    In death, the graveknight's life force lingers on in its armor, not its
    corpse, in much the same way that a lich's essence is bound within a
    phylactery. Unless every part of a graveknight's armor is ruined along with
    its body, a graveknight can rejuvenate after it is destroyed. A typical suit
    of full plate graveknight armor has hardness 10 and 45 hit points, though
    armor with enhancements or made of special materials proves more difficult
    to destroy. Merely breaking a graveknight's armor does not destroy it; it
    must be ruined, such as by being disintegrated, taken to the Positive Energy
    Plane, or thrown into the heart of a volcano.
