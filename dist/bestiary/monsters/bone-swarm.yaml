Description:
  - >-
    A bone swarm is created when multiple animated skeletons are destroyed more
    or less simultaneously, either through a single powerful area attack or by
    simply being smashed to pieces in melee. The bones of the skeletons are
    scattered and smashed, but the necromantic magic that animated them lingers
    on, pulling the bones back together in a mass of clattering fragments.
  - >-
    A bone swarm is ten feet across and is comprised of hundreds of bones and
    bone shards. When it forms to attack, it appears as a roiling mass of bone
    shards.
