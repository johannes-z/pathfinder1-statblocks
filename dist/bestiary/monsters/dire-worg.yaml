Description:
  - >-
    These creatures are to worgs what dire wolves are to their more ordinary
    kin. They still tend to associate with evil creatures but rarely anything as
    mundane or insignificant as a goblinoid. Occasionally they serve as mounts
    for ogres or hill giants. Like their lesser kin, dire worgs typically hunt
    in packs, though they don't limit their fare to herbivores or the sick and
    infirm.
  - >-
    Dire worgs often challenge the most powerful member of an animal pack
    knowing that if the leader is killed, the rest are usually easy pickings.
    They have also been known to seek out isolated humanoid settlements and
    leave them as little more than smashed buildings and a few well-chewed and
    bloody bones.
  - >-
    A dire worg has black fur, sometimes with reddish highlights, giving it an
    almost demonic appearance, and grows to be 10 feet long and 7 feet high at
    the shoulder. It weighs 1,200 pounds.
  - >-
    Dire worgs typically attack in packs holding particularly powerful prey at
    bay until their giant allies or additional worgs arrive. A mated pair of
    dire worgs often has a pack of normal worgs serving them as bush beaters to
    chase prey into the dire worgs' clutches. Like their lesser cousins, they
    prefer to harry and exhaust tougher prey before moving in with flanking and
    trip attacks.
