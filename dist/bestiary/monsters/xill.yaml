SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Implant (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a xill can lay 2d6 eggs in a helpless creature. A
      xill's eggs hatch in 24 hours, at which point the young consume the host
      from within, inflicting 1 point of Con damage per hour per young until the
      host dies. The young then emerge and planewalk to the Ethereal Plane, if
      possible, to mature. A remove disease spell (or similar effect) rids a
      victim of all implanted eggs or active young, or they can be cut out one
      at a time with DC 20 Heal checks (each attempt takes 10 minutes). If a
      check fails, the healer can try again, but each attempt (successful or
      not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the patient.
  - name: Multiweapon Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A xill never takes penalties to an attack roll when fighting with multiple
      weapons, and treats claws as primary attacks even when also wielding
      weapons.
  - name: Planewalk (Su)
    description: >-
      A xill can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a move
      action. Shifting from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane takes 2
      consecutive full-round actions, during which time the xill is immobile. As
      a xill fades away, it becomes harder to hit: opponents have a 20% miss
      chance in the first round and a 50% miss chance in the second. A xill can
      take a single willing or helpless creature with it when it switches
      planes.
Description:
  - >-
    Xills are the scourge of the Ethereal Plane, conquering everything in their
    paths with only one purpose: to perpetuate their race at the expense of
    others. All xills are female and capable of fertilizing their own eggs, but
    require living hosts to incubate these eggs, which they inject into
    paralyzed victims by means of a grotesque ovipositor normally kept retracted
    behind their mandibles. Evil and alien, the plane-shifting xills possess
    impressive intelligence and a totalitarian, militaristic culture all their
    own. Though they see most other life forms as incubators, they particularly
    prize phase spiders for this purpose.
