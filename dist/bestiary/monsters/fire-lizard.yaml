Description:
  - >-
    Fire lizards are often called "false dragons." Despite their general
    resemblance to dragons, sages have as yet found no evidence of these
    creatures being in any way related to them. Fire lizards do not associate
    with or keep company with dragons. A fire lizard is averages 30 feet long
    but can grow to almost twice that size.
  - >-
    Fire lizards prefer to attack opponents with their claws and bite, though if
    outnumbered they resort to using their breath weapon.
