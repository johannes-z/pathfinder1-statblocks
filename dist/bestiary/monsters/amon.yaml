Treasure: double standard
Description_Visual: >-

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Control Wolves (Su)
    description: >-
      Amon can control up to 40 HD of wolves, worgs, winter wolves, or dire
      wolves to a range of 1 mile. This is otherwise similar to a control undead
      spell cast by a 20th-level sorcerer and does not count against his 40 HD
      summoning limit (unless Amon summoned the creatures).
  - name: Fear Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that successfully saves against Amon's fear gaze cannot be
      affected again for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based. Craver: Amon's
      unique oversized weapon is a Huge +4 axiomatic thundering heavy mace. In
      Duke Amon's hands it deals double his Strength bonus to damage in addition
      to its +4 enhancement bonus when he uses it two-handed (+30 total). He is
      able to use the oversized weapon without penalty.
Description:
  - >-
    Amon is a vassal in service to Geryon, commanding no less than 3 legions of
    bone devils. He is completely loyal to the Great Serpent and never questions
    his post. On more than one occasion an arch-devil has tried to dupe Amon
    into betraying his lord, but such attempts always fail.
  - >-
    Amon's iron citadel Harrowcourt sits high on a flat-topped mountain within
    the domain of Hell's fifth plane. It is a great, dark place filled with
    devils, wolves, and creatures far worse.
  - Amon stands 9 feet tall and weighs about 600 pounds.
  - >-
    Amon begins combat with his fear gaze. Unaffected creatures are subjected to
    a barrage of spell-like abilities and physical attacks with his mace. If
    combat is going against him, he summons his wolf companions or other devils
    to aid him or cover his escape.
