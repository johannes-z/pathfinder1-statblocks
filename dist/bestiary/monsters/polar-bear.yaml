Description:
  - >-
    Polar bears swim along frigid coasts and wander icy plains looking for prey.
    They often eat seals plucked from holes in the ice, but will attack any
    creature when desperate or provoked. Unlike most animals, polar bears show
    little fear, and can be dangerous scavengers around arctic settlements. They
    can easily avoid conf lict by plunging into the icy waters, which they often
    do instead of engaging every threat. A polar bear's blubber gives it
    buoyancy, and its long neck keeps its head above water. Oversized paws with
    webbed toes propel it along steadily, and a polar bear can swim over 100
    miles in a single day.

    Some arctic clans hunt polar bears as a significant source of food, and use
    the furs and bones for clothes and vital tools. Many of these cultures hold
    the bears sacred, and honor their deaths with rituals and ceremonies. Polar
    bears live, on average, 15-20 years, but arctic peoples have known
    individual bears that lived as long as 40 years. One of the largest animal
    predators to stalk the ice, an adult male polar bear can weigh 800 to 1,200
    pounds, with females weighing 350 to 650 pounds.
