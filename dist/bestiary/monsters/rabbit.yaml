Description:
  - >-
    Rabbits are burrowing herbivores with short tails, long ears for sensing
    predators, and powerful hind legs that allow them to leap quickly to safety
    in an emergency. They are frequently confused with rodents, but can be
    distinguished thanks to their two sets of incisor teeth, which are
    positioned one behind the other. An average rabbit is between 8 and 20
    inches long and weighs 1 to 4 pounds.
