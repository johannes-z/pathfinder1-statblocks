SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Agile (Ex)
    description: >-
      Void dragons have good aerial maneuverability regardless of their age or
      size.
  - name: Alien Presence (Su)
    description: >-
      A void dragon's alien presence causes an opponent that fails its save to
      be overcome with dizziness, becoming sickened (or nauseated if the target
      has 4 or fewer Hit Dice) for 5d6 rounds.
  - name: Obliterate (Su)
    description: >-
      A young or older void dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of
      negative energy damage. A creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by
      this attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or be immediately slain and
      reduced to ashes (as the disintegrate spell). The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Suffocating Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Instead of dealing cold damage, a very young or older void dragon can
      breathe a cone-shaped suffocation effect. An air-dependent creature that
      fails its Fortitude save suffocates (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 445) for
      a number of rounds equal to the dragon's age category. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Void Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature within 30 feet of an adult or older void dragon must succeed at
      a Will save or become confused for 1d6 rounds. This gaze attack is a
      mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Void dragons have been tainted by long exposure to the terrible alien
    entities that dwell in deep space. Though some continue to struggle against
    the inevitable tide of annihilation, many have embraced the encroaching void
    and exist only to feed and destroy.
