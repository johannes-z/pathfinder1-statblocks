  - name: Attach (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a giant mosquito hits with a touch attack, it uses its legs to latch
      onto the target, anchoring it in place. An attached giant mosquito is
      effectively grappling its prey. The giant mosquito loses its Dexterity
      bonus to AC and has an AC of 13, but holds on with great tenacity and
      inserts its proboscis into the grappled target's flesh. A giant mosquito
      has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is
      attached. An attached giant mosquito can be struck with a weapon or
      grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape
      Artist check against it, the giant mosquito is removed.
  - name: Blood Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant mosquito drains blood at the end of its turn if it is attached to
      a foe, inflicting 1d4 points of Constitution damage. Once a giant mosquito
      has dealt 4 points of Constitution damage, it detaches and flies away to
      digest its meal. If its victim dies before the giant mosquito's appetite
      has been sated, the giant mosquito detaches and seeks a new target.
  - name: Welt (Ex)
    description: >-
      The bite of a giant mosquito forms an irritating welt on the affected area
      that imposes a -2 conditional modifier to skill checks for one day if the
      opponent fails a DC 10 Fortitude save. A DC 10 Heal check or any cure
      spell negates the penalty. Both the save DC and check DC are
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Giant mosquitoes are large blood-sucking relatives of normal mosquitoes and
    are found in any area where large amounts of water have stagnated. They are
    most active at sunset and actively hunt living creatures from which to drink
    blood and gain nourishment. Mating takes place in early spring and summer
    when the female lays a large cluster of eggs in an area of murky or stagnant
    water. The female uses the nutrients and bacteria in the water to provide
    nourishment to the eggs. The male mosquito fertilizes the eggs soon after
    the female lays them and then flies away. Shortly after fertilization, the
    male dies. The eggs hatch a few days later and the larva form of the giant
    mosquito emerges. They remain in the area, absorbing nutrients from the
    surrounding waters for about a few weeks, moving from larvae to pupae and
    finally to adulthood. Giant mosquitoes are 3 feet long and slender with dark
    black bodies. Silver scales line their thorax, and like other insects, the
    giant mosquito is segmented. It has six legs of the same dark color as its
    body and its single pair of wings is translucent. The giant mosquito
    possesses a long, slender proboscis, the end of which contains its mouth.
    Females use this to pierce a living creature and drink their blood. Giant
    mosquitoes normally attack in clusters or groups when confronted. They
    prefer to attack sleeping or helpless victims and draw blood without fear of
    resistance or attack. Sleeping victims are not likely to notice a giant
    mosquito's bite when it attaches, as they inject an anesthetic with their
    bite (Wisdom check DC 12 to notice). Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.
