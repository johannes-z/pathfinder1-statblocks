  - POD-SPAWNED CREATURE (CR 0, -1, OR -2)
  - >-
    A creature with the pod-spawned template is a duplicate created by the
    bodythief. It resembles the original and has all its memories, but can't
    exhibit sincere emotion. Pod-spawned creatures can't reproduce and remain
    the same apparent age as their original at the time of replacement.

  - >-
    "Pod-spawned" is an acquired template that can be added to any living
    creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature).
