  - name: Oversized Weapon (Ex)
    description: >-

      without incurring any penalty-this longbow can be one size category larger
      than normal (Large for most kuchrimas).
Description:
  - >-
    These foul creatures are a disgusting cross between humanoids and condors.
    Also known as the Eaters of the Dead, the kuchrimas are the lowest order of
    the lamia-kin, lacking even standard lamias' capability for spell-like
    abilities. They not only serve the function of common soldiers and scouts,
    but are also left to take care of the disposal of bodies, garbage, and other
    waste-most of which they feed upon. This habit results in their foul
    appearance and disease-ridden bite. Kuchrimas often wield giant bows in
    their powerful talons, holding the weapon in one talon and pulling the
    bowstring with the other in order to fire arrows with devastating effect.
  - >-
    Kuchrimas have much in common with the condors they resemble, and are
    opportunistic hunters and scavengers. Bands of kuchrima hunters might fly
    dozens of miles from their communal aerie, using their keen sight to locate
    prey both small and large. In the extreme mountainous areas they inhabit,
    such meals often take the form of giant rams, mountain aurochs, and even the
    occasional mountaineer, though these disgusting creatures prefer their meals
    dead and rotting.
  - >-
    Kuchrimas dwell principally in the thin air among the upper peaks of
    desolate mountain ranges, where they have gathered in enclaves or
    "gluttonies." They have lived in a state of static barbarism since the
    diaspora following the fall of the Thassilonian Empire. In the thousands of
    years since that civilization's collapse, these lamia-kin have migrated to
    many mountainous regions throughout Golarion. These disease-ridden hunters
    strive to remain well out of sight of land-bound races, which they mistrust
    and fear in numbers. Should a new runelord or powerful harridan come into
    power and manage to locate these disparate gluttonies, however, the
    kuchrimas could be gathered into a formidable airborne force once again.
