      A jaculi is not required to make an Acrobatics check when jumping down
      from heights of 30 feet or less and can do so without taking any damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Jaculi average 8 feet long, but can grow to a length of 12 feet. Its natural
    coloration is a deep green fading to dark brown near the tail. Its
    underbelly is light gray. Jaculi usually lie in wait for opponents,
    preferring places high above the ground where they can leap on their prey
    and gain surprise.
