SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Malevolence (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round, a dybbuk can merge itself with a creature on the Material
      Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 18th),
      except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the
      dybbuk must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack
      with a successful DC 26 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is
      immune to that same dybbuk's malevolence for 24 hours. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Pain Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      With a successful touch attack, a dybbuk causes painful spasms throughout
      the target's body, dealing 7d6 points of damage. Creatures that are immune
      to pain take no damage from this touch.
  - name: Possess Object (Su)
    description: >-
      A dybbuk can use its malevolence ability to possess a Large or smaller
      unattended object, animating it as if using animate objects, except the
      dybbuk merges with and controls the object as if it were a living
      creature. The dybbuk cannot speak or use its other special abilities while
      possessing the object.
Description:
  - >-
    A dybbuk is a misplaced soul who has eluded judgment because of a some great
    transgression or a pitiful suicide. Like a ghost, it lingers on in the
    mortal world, either trying to fulfill an insane need to right some great
    failure that has marked its soul for eternity or merely to spread the
    torment it is condemned to face for eternity. Bodiless and left to wander,
    dybbuks grow increasingly bitter and resentful over the loss of their bodies
    and endlessly seek mortal or even inanimate forms to steal and use to sow
    suffering. Vile manipulators, they seek bodies that have the greatest
    potential to cause pain in those closest to their victims, taking pleasure
    in shifting a leader's agenda toward the destruction of her followers or
    torturing an innocent from within. Dybbuks also often animate unliving
    things to spread fear, reveling in the chaos resulting from manipulating
    corpses to confuse and terrify. Most also realize they have all of eternity
    to torment their chosen victims, and might lurk quietly near a living target
    for weeks or months, waiting for the right moment to act and begin their
    terrors anew.
