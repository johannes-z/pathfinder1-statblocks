SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Luck Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      With a claw attack or touch attack, an ovinnik can alter a creature's
      luck. If the target fails a DC 14 Will save, it either gains a +4 bonus or
      takes a -4 penalty (ovinnik's choice) on its next three d20 rolls. The
      target can choose to automatically fail the saving throw, but must choose
      before it knows whether the touch will be beneficial or harmful. The save
      DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Ovinniks make their homes in granaries and drying houses. These thin, sleek,
    black-furred humanoids stand only a foot high. Their eyes and features seem
    catlike, but they bark like dogs to scare away thieves. No one knows why an
    ovinnik chooses to take up residence in a particular farm's threshing house,
    and few would call on them willingly. A wise farmer placates resident
    ovinniks with frequent gifts of warm milk, pancakes, or dead roosters. By
    tradition, before the new year farmers and their families go to the granary
    to learn their fates for the coming year. The ovinnik touches each of them
    in turn. If the touch is warm, the person will have good luck; if cold, she
    will suffer terrible misfortune in the days ahead.
