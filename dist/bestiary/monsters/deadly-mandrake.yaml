SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Scream (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per minute, a deadly mandrake may scream as a full-round action. The
      scream lasts until the beginning of its next turn. All creatures within 40
      feet of the deadly mandrake when it begins its scream, as well as those
      that end their turn within the area, must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude
      save. (This save is only required once per scream.) Creatures under the
      effects of a fear effect take a -2 penalty on this save. Creatures that
      make their save are sickened for 1d2 rounds. Those that fail their save
      take 20 points of damage. If a screaming mandrake is damaged during a
      scream, it must make a Will save (DC 15 + damage taken) to maintain the
      scream; otherwise it ends. This is a sonic death effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Deadly mandrakes are mischievous plant creatures believed to be part plant
    and part fey. They relish in playing tricks on those passing through their
    domain. These tricks are always more playful than harmful, at least to the
    deadly mandrake. Most such tricks take the form of lights or weird sounds
    meant to distract and confuse travelers.
  - >-
    Deadly mandrakes sustain themselves on a diet of tree bark, leaves, and
    berries, and are most active during the day. At night they burrow into the
    ground to rest. Often times, a deadly mandrake burrows just far enough into
    the ground to cover its body, leaving the flower on top of its head exposed.
    Little else is known of these creatures thus far.
  - >-
    Deadly mandrakes, despite their name, are generally inoffensive unless
    disturbed. If disturbed or forced into battle, deadly mandrakes use their
    death scream immediately in an attempt to end the confrontation as quickly
    as possible. Creatures that resist are subjected to sleep, lesser confusion,
    or hypnotism. They can attack with their claws if needed, but rarely do so.
  - >-
    Any deadly mandrake killed has a 1% chance of returning in 1d4 days as a
    mandragora. If the deadly mandrake's body is doused with demon ichor (from a
    demon CR 6 or above), or a deadly mandrake is killed by a demon CR 6 or
    above, the chance rises to 10%. Using a deadly mandrake in the alchemical
    creation of a mandragora lowers the Craft (alchemy) DC from 25 to 20. (See
    the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary 2 "Mandragora", for details on the
    mandragora and the creation of a mandragora.)
