Description_Visual: >-
  An angry looking fairy, just about 20 inches tall, shrieks and waves a long,
  wool hat soaked entirely in blood. His wrinkled gray skin, silvered hair, and
  gray blue eyes give him the appearance of a miniature old man. His snarling
  mouth reveals small upward curving fangs, while its hands end in eagle-like
  talons.

  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      A redcap is never at risk of poisoning itself when handling poison. They
      usually use aconite poison on their daggers.
Description:
  - >-
    Redcaps are evil relatives of the brownie that dwell in ruins, dungeons, and
    other such desolate places. They are not averse to taking up residence near
    civilized lands, and some actually prefer it, as it simply widens the
    grounds in which they can work their vile magic.
  - >-
    Redcaps hate humans and most other good-aligned fey creatures (especially
    brownies, grigs, and pixies). Though not combat-minded, they often go out of
    their way to kill good-aligned fey if given the chance.
  - >-
    Redcaps sometimes work with evil fey such as grimstalkers (see their entry
    in this book), but such alliances are usually short-lived.
  - >-
    Hunting bands are not uncommon, especially at night, and during these hunts
    redcaps are most often encountered carrying their poisoned daggers (which
    they use to fell opponents larger or stronger than themselves).
  - >-
    They enjoy traveling into civilized areas and stealing livestock and pets,
    just to see the sorrowful looks on the faces of the farmers and children the
    next day when they find their animals missing or slaughtered.
  - >-
    Redcaps prefer to dress in greens, browns, or other drab colors, except
    their hats. They gruesomely display, their long blood-soaked soaked caps,
    turned deep crimson to have slain. Generally, the avoid combat, preferring
    to harass those they encounter until such time as the redcap can strike with
    the advantage (such as against a sleeping or helpless opponent).
  - >-
    They normally throw stones or poisoned daggers at opponents before turning
    invisible and dashing away. Sleeping or helpless opponents are attacked with
    dagger or short sword, both of which are usually poisoned.
  - >-
    If cornered or threatened, a redcap turns invisible and attempts to slip
    away.
