Description_Visual: >-
  This creature has a small spherical body of gray flesh. Two long tentacles
  protrude from the upper half of the sphere while eight smaller tentacles hang
  from the bottom of its spherical body. One tentacle ends in a squid-like
  appendage while the other ends in a needle-like barb.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Paralysis (Ex)
    description: >-
      The digestive fluid injected by a tentamort's stinging tentacle is coupled
      with a paralytic poison as well that forces the victim to make a DC 13
      Fortitude save or be paralyzed for one minute. Immunity to poison negates
      this effect.
  - name: Liquefy Organs (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tentamort can insert the needlelike projection from its stinging
      tentacle into the body of a foe grappled by either tentacle. Doing so
      requires a successful melee attack, and the tentamort cannot insert the
      projection into a creature grappled with its constricting tentacle if its
      stinging tentacle is also grappling a foe. Once inserted, the tentamort
      injects a digestive liquid and a paralytic poison (see above) through the
      hollow barb that liquefies the victim's internal organs; the tentamort
      draws this liquefied slurry back through the hollow needle into its own
      body to feed. This attack deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage each
      round the tube remains inserted in a foe. Once the needle is removed or
      the tentamort is killed, the foe continues to take 1 point of Constitution
      damage until it succeeds at a DC 13 Fortitude save. This Constitution
      damage can be halted by spells or effects that remove disease or heal
      ability score damage (including lesser restoration).
Description:
  - >-
    Tentamorts are thought to have arrived on the Material Plane through a tear
    in the planar fabric. They are rarely encountered above ground, preferring
    the darkness of underground caverns and dungeons. The tentamort somewhat
    resembles a squid. Its body is a small, 3-foot diameter sphere of gray, hard
    flesh. Two 10-foot long tentacles protrude from the upper half of its body
    while eight 2-foot long tentacles hang from its underside (it uses these for
    movement only). Of the two large tentacles, one is thicker and covered with
    squid-like suction cups, while the other is leaner, and is tipped with a
    bone-colored needle-sharp barb.
  - A tentamort uses its small tentacles to crawl along ceilings and walls.
  - >-
    When prey passes underneath, it drops on its opponent, grabbing it with its
    tentacles and injecting it with its deadly acid. If two targets are
    available within reach, it will direct a separate tentacle at each one,
    hoping to hold one target in place long enough to paralyze the other, then
    detach its stinging tentacle and focus both attacks on the remaining prey.
