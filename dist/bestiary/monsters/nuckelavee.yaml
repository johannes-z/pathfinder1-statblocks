SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A nuckelavee's breath weapon is a cone of withering foulness that causes
      painful welts, cramps, and bleeding, and only harms living creatures- this
      damage bypasses all energy resistance and damage reduction. Non-creature
      plants in the area are affected as if by a blight spell. Any creature that
      fails its Reflex save against the breath weapon must make a DC 21
      Fortitude save or contract mortasheen (see below). The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Mortasheen: Contact; save Fort DC 21; onset immediate; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d4 Con and fatigue; cure 2 consecutive saves. Animals take a -2
      penalty on their saves against this disease. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The dreaded nuckelavee is a manifestation of pollution and filth, be it the
    natural decay of a red tide or the intrusive pollution of sewage and other
    urban waste. A nuckelavee is a living irony-a carrier of disease and a
    spreader of corruption that unleashes its wrath against other sources that
    bring corruption into the world. The corruption spread by nuckelavees only
    serves to further their own sense of self-loathing and overall rage. While
    nuckelavees might, incidentally, carry out vengeance for the victims of such
    pollution, defending the denizens of their rivers, swamps, and bogs is not
    their primary drive, for they revel in inflicting the very corruption they
    hate and enjoy little more than watching their enemies sicken and die.
  - >-
    Folktales tell of talismans to carry-fetishes of seaweed garlands, horsehair
    soaked in brine, or vials of sanctified seawater-or of prayers to recite to
    ward away nuckelavees or convince them the bearer is innocent. In truth,
    however, these old solutions offer no protection from the vile
    plague-bearers.
  - A nuckelavee is the same size as a horse.
