SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Id Insinuation (Sp)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once per day, a grioth can disrupt a creature's mind.
      The target must be within 30 feet, and can resist this effect with a
      successful DC 12 Will save-otherwise, the target becomes confused for as
      long as the grioth concentrates plus 1 additional round after it ceases
      concentrating, to a maximum number of rounds equal to 3 plus the Grioth's
      total HD (5 rounds for most grioths). This is a mind-affecting effect, and
      is equivalent to a 2nd-level spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Mindshock (Su)
    description: >-
      When a grioth damages a creature with a voidglass weapon, a surge of the
      grioth's violent psychic energy pulses through the weapon, causing an
      additional 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. On a critical hit, the creature
      struck must also succeed at a DC 12 Will save or be confused for 1d2
      rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based and
      includes a +2 racial bonus.

Description:
  - >-
    Grioths inhabit rogue planets that have been cast away from the stars. They
    often travel via portals to other worlds via that are undergoing eclipses to
    pillage resources that are rare on their frozen homeworlds. Many members of
    this evil race are known for their devotion to the Outer God Nyarlathotep
    (whom they worship in his guise as the Haunter of the Dark), and it isn't
    uncommon for colonies of grioths to be led by his clerics. Grioths' voices
    are raspy and dry. They favor weaponry crafted from a strange material known
    as voidglass (see page 35).
  - >-
    The grioth race is prone to mutations, their forms twisted by the eldritch
    forces within the Dark Tapestry into lumbering giants or deformed horrors.
    Some grioths grow unusually large and ferocious, and the elders of the race
    possesses unusual and deadly psychic powers- abilities that aid them in
    ruling their dark spire cities and in their constant war against their hated
    foes, the entities of the Dominion of the Black.
