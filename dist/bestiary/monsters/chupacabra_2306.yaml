  - name: Blood Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      A chupacabra can suck blood from a living creature by making a successful
      grapple check. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and
      drains blood, dealing 1d3 points of Constitution damage each round the
      hold is maintained.
Description:
  - >-
    Chupacabras are small terrifying bloodsuckers that lurk on the fringes of
    society, emerging at night to drain the blood of warm-blooded creatures.
    Though they are not particularly selective when it comes to who or what they
    attack, chupacabras prefer to attack creatures they can easily kill (such as
    livestock or small children). Many chupacabra attacks are blamed on vampires
    (because of the blood drain) or wild dogs or wolves (because of the ferocity
    of the assault), though in the latter two cases, if the chupacabra leaves
    any tracks, an observer can readily tell the attacker was bipedal and moved
    on two legs. A chupacabra is a bipedal, almost humanoid-like creature about
    3 or 4 feet tall. It weighs 60 pounds. Its fur-covered body is dark brown or
    dark gray and its eyes are bright red, and often appear to be glowing. Its
    arms and legs end in four-clawed digits and its claws are dull black. A
    chupacabra cannot speak but utters a baleful moan when threatened. A
    chupacabra attacks with its razor-sharp claws and powerful bite, striking
    from ambush whenever possible. If a chupacabra grabs a foe, it slashes its
    throat open and sucks out its blood. If facing only one foe, a chupacabra
    maintains its grapple until it has drained all of its opponent's blood. When
    it kills an opponent, the chupacabra tears it to shreds and gorges itself on
    as much of the foe's blood as it can. Winged Chupacabras Rumors speak of
    chupacabras with fur-covered almost bat-like wings. There is a 10% chance
    that any chupacabra encountered is actually of the winged variety. Such a
    creature has a fly speed of 40 feet with average maneuverability. Copyright
