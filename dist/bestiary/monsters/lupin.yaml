Description:
  - >-
    Lupins are dog-headed humanoids standing over 6 feet tall with grayish skin
    and dark, usually filthy and matted fur. These creatures have an excellent
    sense of smell, and their tracking ability is often times unmatched. Lupins
    are colorblind and see only in shades of gray.
  - >-
    These creatures are believed to be related to both gnolls and flinds though
    sages have never found a true link tying the races together. These canine
    humanoids are carnivorous nocturnal pack hunters and relish in the hunt,
    often toying with their prey before taking it down. Though savage by some
    standards, lupins are still considered to be more organized and civilized
    than their cousins the gnolls.

    Lupin tribes form loose alliances with nearby tribes and settlements,
    sometimes offering protection to weaker tribes (such as those composed of
    goblins or kobolds) in exchange for gold, food, and anything else the tribe
    feels it needs. Lupins are generally on good terms with all the goblinoid
    races as well as minotaurs, orcs, and the occasional ogre or hill giant
    tribe. Human settlements sometimes form an alliance with a nearby lupin
    tribe as well; out of mutual need, or out of fear. The other humanoid races,
    dwarves, elves, gnomes, are generally treated with tolerance, but few
    alliances between lupins and these races are known to exist. Elves are often
    viewed as a weak race and, any such alliance between a lupin tribe and elven
    settlement is extremely shaky at best. Halflings are the single race the
    lupins detest (Sages are uncertain as to the exact reasons for this hatred).
    Halflings are killed on sight, carried back to the lupins' lair, and fed to
    the lupin pups. Other times, halflings are captured and hunted for sport by
    the lupins, and then fed to the pups afterward. Halfling settlements when
    found are ravaged and burned to the ground. Halfling temples and holy
    grounds are desecrated and defaced, the priests of these places torn to
    shreds, their bodies littered about the ruined temples and grounds.

    Lupins are savage and ferocious in battle, attacking with longswords and a
    vicious bite. Their battle tactics are well-organized and focused, usually
    concentrating on the single strongest opponent, and only moving to the next
    target, when that opponent falls. When overwhelmed and outnumbered, lupins
    resort to ambush and hit-and-run tactics. In large scale battles, lupins
    often employ gnolls and flinds (and occasionally, but rarely, goblins and
    kobolds) as shock troops.

    Lupin leaders are generally rangers or fighters. Lupin females generally
    take the role of caregiver in a lupin tribe, staying out of battles and
    tending to the pups. Some however, seem more skilled in the magical arts
    than their male counterparts, and sometimes take up the path of the
    sorcerer. Clerics are highly regarded among lupin tribes and often serve as
    counselors to the tribal leaders. Religion among lupin tribes is scattered
    and generally varies from tribe to tribe. Lupins do not seem to have just
    one god they call their own. Each tribe pays homage to its own god, usually
    one of the arch-devils. Lucifer, Belial, Geryon, Moloch, and Asmodeus seem
    to be the most prevalent.
