SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Flesh Consumption (Ex)
    description: >-
      A skin feaster that successfully deals Constitution damage to a living
      humanoid creature must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or spend its next turn
      devouring the flesh that has fallen from that opponent. It takes no other
      actions during this time but can defend itself normally. It consumes an
      amount of flesh equal to 3 points of Constitution damage (or drain) each
      round.
  - name: Necrotic Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      The touch of a skin feaster deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage if the
      target fails a DC 14 Fortitude save. If the save fails by 5 or more, 1
      point is actually Constitution drain instead. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Skin Regrowth (Su)
    description: >-
      If a skin feaster manages to consume an amount of flesh equal to 6 points
      of Constitution damage in any 24-hour period, it begins to regrow its
      skin. The process requires 1d6 hours and for the next 1d3 days thereafter,
      the skin feaster appears just as it did before its death. During this
      time, the skin feaster loses its flesh consumption weakness and appears
      human (though it is still undead). Once this period ends, the skin
      feaster's skin sloughs off, restoring it to its original appearance.
Description:
  - >-
    When a humanoid dies as a result of being skinned alive, it often returns to
    the land of the living as a skin feaster; an undead creature driven by an
    insatiable hunger for the skin and flesh of living creatures. Only by
    consuming living flesh can a skin feaster relieve itself of the burning pain
    of its raw muscles and nerves.
  - >-
    Skin feasters often make their lairs near populated areas where meals are
    plentiful. The lair itself is usually a nearby cave complex or ruined and
    abandoned buildings; places that allow the skin feaster to remain hidden,
    yet keep it close enough to feed when hungry. Skin feaster raids into towns
    and villages almost always occur at night. While they occasionally consume
    the flesh of cattle and other small game, they prefer the flesh of humanoids
    above all others; it's also the only way a skin feaster can regrow its
    flesh. During times when a skin feaster has regrown its skin, it moves
    around villages and towns, mingling among living creatures, planning its
    next meal.
  - Skin feasters stand about 6 feet tall and generally weigh 150-180 pounds.
  - >-
    A skin feaster slashes at its opponents with its razor-sharp fingernails,
    flaying off chunks of flesh with each strike. Skin feasters are so overcome
    with agony that they often stop in the middle of combat to devour any flesh
    they manage to tear away from their victims.
