SpecialAbilities:
  - name: False Flesh (Ex)
    description: >-
      The synthetic flesh and hair of a mannequin robot give it a +8 bonus on
      Disguise checks to appear human (but not to impersonate a specific human).
      Closely inspecting a mannequin or touching its cold, synthetic skin
      automatically reveals its non-human nature.
Description:
  - >-
    Designed to labor at tedious or hazardous tasks, mannequin robots were
    intended to both look and behave like humans. Their designers felt that
    humans would find the mannequins more comfortable to work next to than
    conventional robots-but they were mistaken. While the mannequins
    superficially resembled their makers, their inhuman behavior, subtly wrong
    appearance, and unnatural movement, as well as the unyielding cold of their
    synthetic flesh proved disturbing, and the humans they were meant to work
    alongside reflexively distrusted them. Though many were produced for a
    variety of tasks, the mannequin line of robot was deemed a failure. The next
    generation of human-form constructs took the form of a true artificial life
    form: the android. Mannequins look more or less human, but their jerky,
    mechanical movement, imperfectly simulated behavior, and artificial
    construction give them away with any close interaction. Mannequin robots
    vary in size and shape as much as humans, but weigh at least 200 pounds
    because of their metallic endoskeletons. Variants The mannequin robot
    described above represents a typical model, designed for menial labor or
    basic service. Other models resemble the base model, but have different
    capabilities. If no CR change is noted, the model has the same CR as a
    standard mannequin. Specialized mannequins advance by taking class levels,
    generally in non-spellcasting classes such as fighter, gunslinger, monk, and
    rogue. Athlete (CR +1): Designed to compete in robotic sporting events, an
    athlete model has +2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, Fleet in place of Alertness,
    and a +5 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks. Recreation (CR +1): Designed for
    entertainment and leisure purposes, a pleasure model has a +4 bonus to
    Charisma, has Skill Focus (Perform [any]) in place of Alertness, and can
    scan the minds of creatures within 30 feet (as detect thoughts). Rescue:
    Designed for rescue and retrieval operations in conditions too dangerous for
    unprotected humans, a rescue model's resistance to electricity and fire
    improves to 10. Security (CR +1): Designed for assisting human security
    forces in dangerous situations, a security model has +2 Dexterity, Improved
    Initiative in place of Alertness, +1 natural armor, and hardness 5. Security
    models are proficient with firearms, simple weapons, and light armor.
    Target: Designed as an active target for weapons practice, a target model
    has +2 Dexterity, a 10-foot increase to speed, hardness 5, and Dodge in
    place of Alertness. Reducing a target model below half its maximum hit
    points causes it to shut down for 10 minutes.
