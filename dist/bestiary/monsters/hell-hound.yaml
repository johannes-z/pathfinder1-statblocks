Description:
  - >-
    A typical hell hound stands 4-5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 120
    pounds. Efficient hunters, a favorite pack tactic is to surround prey
    quietly, then attack with one or two hounds, driving prey toward the rest of
    the pack with their fiery breath.
  - >-
    If the prey doesn't run, the pack closes in. Hell hounds track fleeing
    creatures relentlessly.
  - >-
    Hell hounds are particularly favored by fire giants, as the creatures are
    immune to fire and share the fire giant's sense of cruelty when it comes to
    handling intruders. Only when a fire giant goes too far toward treating a
    relatively intelligent hell hound like a pet do such alliances begin to
    falter.
