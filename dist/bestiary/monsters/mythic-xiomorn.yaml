Description:
  - >-
    The xiomorns consist of two castes: the mythic Vault Builders and the
    non-mythic Vault Keepers. The Vault Builders ruled over their less powerful
    counterparts, but both are among the most ancient forms of life-primeval
    elemental beings who travel to raw, new worlds upon the Material Plane,
    pursuing strange ecological experiments into the nature of life. The worlds
    these enigmatic beings have visited possess strange ruins in remote regions
    and immense, vault-like caverns deep underground where ecologies that
    shouldn't exist flourish. Xiomorns have little interest in protecting a
    world's indigenous life, except as necessary for their experiments' goals,
    and often war against such races when native empires encroach upon the
    xiomorns' experimental realms.
