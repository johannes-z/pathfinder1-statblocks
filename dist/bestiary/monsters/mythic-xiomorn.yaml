SQ: item mastery (see xiomorn), item shaper, secret of the Vault Seed
Environment: any
Organization: solitary, pair, or foundation (2 plus 4-20 Vault Keepers)
Treasure: triple
Description_Visual: >-
  This towering, spindly, four-armed entity appears to be made of stone and
  crystal, yet it moves with a fluid grace.
Group: Xiomorn
Source: The Emerald Spire
IsTemplate: 0
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Item Shaper (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mythic xiomorn can create magic items at a rate of 1 hour per 1,000 gp
      in the item's base price instead of 8 hours. For items made primarily of
      crystal, stone, or earth, this time and the item's cost to create are
      halved.
  - name: Secret of the Vault Seed (Su)
    description: >-
      Mythic xiomorns possess an innate understanding of Vault Seeds-the
      magic-rich artifacts that grow into the xiomorns' underground vaults. This
      process includes finding the raw crystals the seeds are formed from on the
      Plane of Earth, faceting the gem and using magic to grow it into its
      shape, and nurturing the seed with the proper spells once it's planted in
      the raw earth from which the Vault will grow. A mythic xiomorn gains
      regeneration 10 while in a Vault it created or directly helped create. No
      attack form causes this regeneration to stop functioning; a mythic xiomorn
      can be killed by hit point damage only if removed from its Vault first.
  - name: Xiomorn Spellcasting (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as simple arcane spellcasting, except that the
      xiomorn can change its spells each morning as though preparing spells,
      choosing a number of spells with a combined level equal to twice its CR.
      Each xiomorn knows a number of spells with a combined level equal to three
      times its CR-choosing from the spells listed above, as well as create
      demiplaneUM, mythic move earth, and terraformMA.
Description:
  - >-
    The xiomorns consist of two castes: the mythic Vault Builders and the
    non-mythic Vault Keepers. The Vault Builders ruled over their less powerful
    counterparts, but both are among the most ancient forms of life-primeval
    elemental beings who travel to raw, new worlds upon the Material Plane,
    pursuing strange ecological experiments into the nature of life. The worlds
    these enigmatic beings have visited possess strange ruins in remote regions
    and immense, vault-like caverns deep underground where ecologies that
    shouldn't exist flourish. Xiomorns have little interest in protecting a
    world's indigenous life, except as necessary for their experiments' goals,
    and often war against such races when native empires encroach upon the
    xiomorns' experimental realms.
