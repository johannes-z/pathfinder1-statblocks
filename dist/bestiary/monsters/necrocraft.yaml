Description:
  - >-
    A necrocraft is a medley of undead body parts and corpses grafted together
    with dark magic to create a single animated undead creature with abilities
    based on its component pieces and the surgical and necromantic talents of
    its creator. Necrocrafts are better suited for brute force than delicate
    manipulation, and most creators build larger hulks rather than smaller, more
    agile (and fragile) necrocrafts. Though necrocrafts can be of virtually any
    size and can be made up of undead bodies or parts of any size, a typical
    Medium specimen is 7 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds. The details of the
    ritual to create a necrocraft vary greatly, and depend on the particular
    undead parts used and the intended size of the resulting creature. The final
    anatomy of the creation largely depends on the master's artistry,
    creativity, and personal preferences-as well as any specific goals it has in
    mind for the creature. For example, a necrocraft's "teeth" could actually be
    dozens of clawed ghoul talons, or its eyes and mouth might be located in its
    chest rather than in a distinct head.
  - CREATING A NECROCRAFT
  - >-
    In order to create a necrocraft, a spellcaster must use at least five undead
    creatures (or their corpses), all of which must be under the creator's
    control, helpless, or slain. A larger undead or corpse can be used in place
    of two that are one size smaller. The creator must stitch, glue, or
    otherwise bind the parts together in the desired conf iguration, then cast
    animate dead and make whole to complete the construction (the material
    component cost of animate dead is 50 gp per Hit Die of the final
    necrocraft). The creator can't create a necrocraft with more Hit Dice than
    her caster level. As with animate dead, the necrocraft is under the
    creator's control when created. Note that creating a necrocraft requires
    casting a spell with the evil descriptor.
