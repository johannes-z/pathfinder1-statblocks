Description_Visual: >-
  This creature appears as a rotting humanoid dressed in tattered and ragged
  clothing. Its semi-bloated body glistens from the slimy mixture of water and
  seaweed that hangs from its form. The creature's rotting flesh is blue-green
  in color. No semblance of life burns in its eyes.

Description:
  - Brine zombies are the remnants of a ship's crew that has perished at sea.
  - >-
    They are mindless creatures, not very pleasant to look at, and relentless in
    their attacks on the living. The spark of evil that brought them back from
    the ocean depths drives them to seek the living so they may join them in
    their watery graves. Brine zombies appear much as they did in life.
  - Brine zombies attack an opponent with their cutlasses or fists in melee.
  - >-
    If a brine zombie successfully grabs an opponent, it dives overboard and
    attempts to drown the victim by pinning him underwater.
