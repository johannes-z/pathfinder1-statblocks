SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures that succumb to an augnagar's horrific appearance are driven
      momentarily insane. This results in 2 points of Charisma damage and leaves
      the victim confused for 1d3 rounds.
Description:
  - >-
    The immense augnagar is relatively slow-witted. As an outsider, it does not
    need to eat to survive, yet it remains ravenous and feeds on anything it can
    overpower. The augnagar prefers the taste of well-rotted flesh- particularly
    rotted demon flesh-and the horrific curse its bite imparts flavors its meals
    perfectly. Yet the augnagar's favorite feast is of a much more cannibalistic
    type. These creatures find the flesh of their own kind to be the greatest
    delicacy. When an augnagar feeds upon enough of its own kind, it grows
    enormously bloated such that it can no longer fly, at which point it uses
    its clawed tails to tear its body apart in a frenzy of self-destruction.
    From this storm of torn fat and shredded viscera emerges a fully grown
    thulgant qlippoth-a creature similar in shape to an augnagar, yet much more
    intelligent and even more dangerous.
  - An augnagar has a wingspan of 30 feet and weighs 6,000 pounds.
