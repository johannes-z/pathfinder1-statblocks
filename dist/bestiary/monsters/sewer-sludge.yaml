      Since a sewer sludge looks like normal sludge when at rest, a DC 20
      Perception check is required to notice it before it attacks for the first
      time. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (dungeoneering) can use
      either of those skills instead of Perception to notice the ooze.

    description: >-
      A sewer sludge hit by a cold-based attack takes no damage. However, if the
      amount of damage it would have otherwise taken exceeds its Constitution
      score, the sewer sludge is slowed (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds.

      leaving it. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A sewer sludge is a disgusting ooze that resembles nothing more than a
    filthy pile of sewage. They lurk in the sewer and waste-water systems of
    large cities, usually content to feed on rats and refuse that filters down
    from the streets overhead.
  - >-
    A sewer sludge is a globular mass about 4 feet across, and weighing 100
    pounds.
  - >-
    Sewer sludges are almost always hungry, and do not hesitate to attack prey
    larger than themselves. A sewer sludge's usual method of attack is to glom
    onto the body of a creature struck by its pseudopod, grip it tightly, and
    liquefy its flesh by releasing acidic digestive enzymes.

    The origin of sewer sludges was unknown until recently. Diligent research by
    a curious adventurer named Bilark Weterson finally tracked down where these
    creatures came from, and the news was not good at all. Weterson realized
    that sewer sludges first appeared in cities often frequented by travelers
    returning from a certain famous dungeon. Following a hunch, he investigated
    and was never heard from again. Weterson's diary was recently uncovered in a
    used book store in Bard's Gate, and in it were discovered his theories about
    sewer sludges.
  - >-
    It is known that in the upper levels of the dungeon known as Rappan Athuk
    there exists a creature called the Dung Monster. The good news is that the
    Dung Monster, nicknamed â€˜Dungie' by those few who have survived an encounter
    with that it, is content to remain in Rappan Athuk and not venture into the
    outside world. The bad news is that Dungie has begun to reproduce.
  - >-
    Once every few years, Dungie grows odd nodules on its surface. These nodules
    continue to bud until they fall away and take on a life of their own.
    Sometimes, a bud finds its way outside of Rappan Athuk, either on its own or
    hidden in the packs and clothing of weary adventurers as they exit the
    dungeon. If undetected, these buds drop out into the sewers of the great
    cities of the world and grow into sewer sludges. Fortunately, sewer sludges
    remain mindless oozes as they age. Were they to mature into adhesive,
    shape-changing, immortal monsters like their progenitor, the world might
    surely be doomed!
