  - name: Tail Lash (Ex)
    description: >-
      The diplodocus prefers to attack with its tail. The dinosaur can snap its
      incredibly long tail with surprising speed like an enormous whip-this is a
      primary attack that deals bludgeoning and slashing damage. A diplodocus
      can make two separate attacks with its tail lash as a full-attack action.
Description:
  - >-
    The diplodocus is one of the longest dinosaurs, capable of reaching lengths
    of 100 feet or more. Much of this length is taken up by the diplodocus's
    tremendously powerful whiplike tail, a devastating weapon capable of
    striking at a considerable range.
