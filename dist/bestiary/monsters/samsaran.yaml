Description:
  - >-
    Samsarans are a race of humanoids whose spirits naturally reincarnate into
    another samsaran upon death. They have dark hair, pale bluish skin, and eyes
    with no visible pupil or iris. A samsaran's blood is clear like water. Each
    samsaran is born with the knowledge that it has lived before, and shall
    continue onward after death through the cycle of reincarnation. When a
    samsaran dies, its body fades from sight, and another samsaran child appears
    somewhere and matures at the normal rate. Samsarans can reproduce with
    humans and produce true human offspring. Typical samsarans pursue simple,
    ascetic lives apart from mainstream society. They live in small isolated
    farming communities as individuals or couples, with older samsarans adopting
    newly manifested children. Some work as consultants, mediators, prophets, or
    seers.
