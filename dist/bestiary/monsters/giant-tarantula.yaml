  - name: Barbed Hairs (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tarantula can throw barbed hairs from its back at a creature as a ranged
      touch attack (range increment 20 feet). A creature struck by these hairs
      must make a DC 22 Fort save or be nauseated for 1d6 rounds. A creature
      that attacks a giant tarantula with a non-reach melee weapon must make a
      DC 22 Reflex save to avoid being struck by these hairs. The save DC is
      Con-based.

      Str; cure 2 consecutive saves. Save DC is Con-based with a +2 racial
      bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    A tarantula doesn't use a web to ensnare prey, though it may spin a trip
    wire to signal an alert when something approaches its burrow. These spiders
    grab with their appendages, inject paralyzing venom, and dispatch their
    unfortunate victims with their fangs. They also secrete digestive enzymes to
    liquefy their victims' bodies so that they can suck them up through their
    straw-like mouth openings. After a large meal, the tarantula may not need to
    eat for a month.
