Description:
  - >-
    Nithus are evil monsters that dwell deep within darkened swamps, bogs,
    mires, and marshes. These creatures sustain themselves on a diet of swamp
    creatures: alligators, fish, and adventurers and just about anything else
    that enters their domain. Slain prey is either devoured immediately or
    dragged back to the nithu's lair where it is slowly devoured over the course
    of a few days. A nithu's lair is a well-hidden and dark cave, cavern, or
    other such place. Nithus occasionally make truces with nearby humanoids
    (particularly orcs, gnolls, and goblins) in exchange for a steady supply of
    food (victims).
  - >-
    Nithus are solitary creatures and extremely territorial, even fighting their
    own kind for control of an area. No encounters of multiple nithus have been
    recorded. Sages are unsure how (and if) nithu reproduce. They appear to be
    sexless creatures and no young have ever been encountered. A typical nithu
    has a lifespan of 20 years. As a nithu ages, its color shifts from
    translucent light gray to a darker, but still semi-translucent gray. Its
    tentacles, usually the same color as the body change colors as well.
  - >-
    A nithu cares little to nothing for treasure; thus, any treasure found in or
    around its lair is typically all that remains of those who have fallen prey
    to the creature's insatiable hunger.
  - >-
    The nithu is an ambush hunter, preferring to lay in wait for potential prey
    to pass near. A nithu picks and chooses its targets carefully. The
    creature's average intelligence is enough to let it to know when it is
    outmanned and outclassed; thus it prefers to attack the lone straggler or a
    party member who may have become lost in the monster's swampy lair. Unless
    extremely hungry, an nithu doesn't attack a large group of creatures unless
    it itself is threatened and attacked first or unless it is assured of
    victory.
