  This creature resembles an executioner's hood constructed of blackish-gray
  leather. Two hollow eye holes are present in its form.
Group: Lurking Ray
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 4
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Engulfing Drop (Ex)
    description: >-
      Though it is a Tiny monster, the hood can drop onto the head of a Medium
      or smaller creature and make a slam attack as a standard action. If the
      hood's attack succeeds, it can immediately attempt a grapple check against
      the target, and if successful, the executioner's hood can constrict.
  - name: Strangle (Ex)
    description: >-
      A grappling executioner's hood entirely covers its opponent's head with an
      airtight grip. A creature that is grappled by the hood cannot speak or
      cast spells with verbal components and must hold its breath (see
      Suffocation, Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 445), unless it doesn't speak or
      breathe through its head. Any attacks against the hood deal half damage to
      the hood and the other half to the creature that it's strangling.
  - name: Susceptible to Alcohol (Ex)
    description: >-
      Strong alcohol harms the hood. Every quart poured on it deals 1 point of
      damage. Four quarts of alcohol incapacitates it and forces it to release a
      grappled target.
Description:
  - >-
    These young rays are shaped roughly like hoods (hence their name), and drag
    themselves awkwardly about with their thin tentacles. Once an executioner's
    hood finds a suitable hunting ground, usually a cavern or dungeon room, it
    hauls itself up to a high perch and hangs there, disguising itself as an
    irregular stone formation or a strange bit of masonry on a dungeon wall.
    When suitable prey walks beneath it, the young lurking ray drops, attempting
    to engulf the creature's head and suffocate it, after which the ray can
    slowly dissolve the meat at its leisure. Executioner's hoods are hatched
    from eggs laid by trappers. They stay with the mother for a month, then
    leave to hunt for themselves.
