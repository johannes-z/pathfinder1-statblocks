SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: A gelatinous emperor's acid does not harm metal or stone.
  - name: Spew Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gelatinous emperor can, as a standard action, spew forth acid in a
      30-foot line at a single target. A creature struck takes 12d6 points of
      acid damage. A DC 28 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. Once a
      gelatinous emperor has spewed acid, it cannot do so again for 1d4 rounds.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Gelatinous emperors are intelligent, foul oozes found in the court of
    Jubilex. What purpose and in what capacity they serve the Faceless Lord is
    anyone's guess. From his Abyssal plane they strike out, devouring anything
    and everything they run across. They are eternal hunters, always moving and
    always hungry. When a gelatinous emperor slips into the Material Plane it
    quickly ravages the area leaving it devoid of all life. Thankfully these
    creatures are not often found on the Material Plane.
  - >-
    A gelatinous emperor is believed to be a foul mix of gelatinous cube, gray
    ooze, black pudding, and all other manner of puddings and oozes meshed
    together by Jubilex, either for some nefarious purpose or for nothing more
    than his sheer amusement. Sages believe the latter to be the truer of the
    two theories.
  - >-
    A gelatinous emperor attacks by forming multiple pseudopods from its
    amorphous body and lashing out at its opponents. If the emperor can maneuver
    its opponents into a tight group it employs its trample attack, crushing as
    many of its foes in one move as possible.
