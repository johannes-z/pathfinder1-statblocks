Description_Visual: >-
  This large, muscular dog has sickly brownish-yellow fur, matted or torn in
  places. Small sores cover its body, each oozing a thick, yellowishgreen
  liquid. Its mouth is filled with long pointed yellow teeth, some broken off on
  the ends. Most disturbingly, it has four large yellow eyes evenly aligned
  across its canine head.

Description:
  - >-
    Retch hounds are large, yellowish, sickly-looking hounds, about the size of
    war dogs. They are highly aggressive and powerfully built carnivores that
    love the taste of human flesh and bones. Their appearance lends to the
    faÃ§ade of a sickly dog, which sometimes works to the retch hound's advantage
    when hunting its prey.
  - >-
    Retch hounds are often found in the service of powerful fighters and
    warriors, who use the dogs to guard prisoners, lead hunting expeditions, and
    perform other such services. A retch hound is only as loyal to its master as
    it has to be to insure its own survival. While the dog won't necessary seek
    escape at the earliest possible time, it often turns on its master at some
    point. Retch hounds raised in captivity are often more loyal to their
    masters than those captured in the wild. A typical retch hound stands 4 to 4
    1/2 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs about 150 pounds.
  - >-
    Retch hounds hunt their prey in packs. Using an eerie howl, they seem to
    coordinate and communicate with one another during these hunts. A favored
    tactic of a retch hound pack is to encircle a foe and then hit it from all
    sides at once. Usually the largest hound in the pack is the leader.
  - When slain, a retch hound melts into a pile of stinking and bubbling slime.
