SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hold Breath (Ex)
    description: >-
      A blue whale can hold its breath a number of rounds equal to 10 times its
      Constitution score before it risks drowning.
  - name: Powerful Tail (Ex)
    description: >-
      A blue whale's massive tail deals more damage than a normal tail slap. The
      blue whale's tail slap is a primary attack and applies 1-1/2 times its
      Strength bonus to its tail slap damage.
  - name: Stun (Ex)
    description: >-
      A blue whale's fluke can deliver a powerful stunning blow. A creature
      struck by this attack must succeed at a DC 34 Fortitude save or be dazed
      for 1 round. If the strike is a critical hit and the target fails its
      save, it is instead stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The imposing blue whale is one of the largest animals in the sea, though it
    is generally docile toward anything it doesn't perceive as a threat. A
    filter-feeder, the blue whale does not look at humans or ships as potential
    meals, instead preferring to eat millions of tiny invertebrates known as
    krill, which it sucks through its baleen in massive gulps. The most
    dangerous thing about a blue whale, other than its sheer size, is its
    powerful tail, which can capsize boats and kill humanoids. These enormous
    mammals can be found in all of Golarion's oceans and seas. An adult blue
    whale is 100 feet long and weighs 200 tons.
