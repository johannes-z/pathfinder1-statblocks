Description_Visual: >-
  The ground quakes as a colossal, elephantine beast of rocky, armored plates
  presses forward. Elaborate horns crown its head, and multiple rock-encrusted
  tusks jut from its toothy maw. With a bellowing roar, the creature shakes its
  massive head in challenge, then paws the ground and charges.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    description: >-
      A ravener behemoth looks like a rocky hillside or small mountain when at
      rest. It takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks.
  - name: Demolishing Attack (Ex)
    description: >-
      A ravener behemoth that makes a full attack against an object or structure
      deals double damage.
  - name: Mighty Roar (Su)
    description: >-
      Every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, a ravener behemoth can issue a
      mighty roar in a 60-foot cone that duplicates the effects of greater
      shout. This attack deals 10d6 points of sonic damage (or 20d6 against
      exposed brittle or crystalline objects or crystalline creatures). It also
      causes creatures to be stunned for 1 round and deafened for 4d6 rounds.
      Creatures exposed to the sonic attack can negate the stunning and halve
      both the damage and duration of the deafness with a successful Fortitude
      save (DC 30). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Rock Hurling (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because of their immense hunger, ravener behemoths often ingest ore-laced
      rocks to fill their stomachs with longer-lasting sustenance. When faced
      with dangerous opponents outside its reach, a behemoth may regurgitate
      these rocks and grind them into smaller shards with its hardened teeth. It
      then spits forth these shards one at a time as boulders weighing between
      60 to 80 pounds. A ravener usually carries enough rocks in its stomachs to
      make up to 4d6 boulders in this manner.
  - name: Shock Wave (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a ravener behemoth can hammer the ground with its
      feet and generate a localized tremor that rips the ground, knocking down
      smaller creatures and creating di#cult terrain in a 100-foot radius
      centered on the behemoth. This shock wave lasts for 1 round, during which
      time creatures in the affected area cannot move or attack. They must also
      succeed on a DC 38 Reflex save or fall prone. Any spellcaster on the
      ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any
      spell he or she tries to cast. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Swallow Whole (Ex)
    description: >-
      A ravener behemoth can swallow a snatched opponent of Huge size or smaller
      with its bite attack by making a successful grapple check. Once swallowed,
      a victim suffers 4d6+24 points of bludgeoning damage per round from one of
      the behemoth's 5 stomachs. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by
      using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 33 points of damage to a
      stomach (AC 27). Once the creature exits, that stomach regenerates 15 hit
      points per round. A ravener behemoth may gorge itself upon multiple
      creatures, shunting each victim to a different stomach each time. Each of
      a behemoth's 5 stomachs can hold 1 Huge, 4 Large, 16 Medium, 64 Small, 256
      Tiny, or over 1,000 Diminutive or smaller creatures.
Description:
  - >-
    Ravener behemoths walk the land as the ultimate consumers of all things.
    This includes every manner of beast, plant, and mineral caught in their
    path. They indiscriminately fill their five ever-hungry stomachs by cutting
    wide swaths through tangled jungles, digging through mountains for precious
    ores, and razing settlements and strongholds to get at those sheltering
    inside. Sometimes they even ply shallow coastal waters, capsizing ships to
    feast upon their crews and any other predators drawn by the smell of blood
    in the water. Monstrously massive, a ravener behemoth stands nearly 60 feet
    tall on four thick, trunk-like legs and measures up to 80 feet long.
    Multiple horns and tusks sprout from its face and head, helping it root
    through even the hardest soil and rocks in search of food. It quickly
    reduces anything stronger into rubble with its earth-shattering roar and
    stomping feet. A rocky hide grown from the many minerals it routinely
    consumes protects it from harm even as lichen, small plants, and trees take
    root along its back, out of reach of its ravenous mouth. Divine blessings
    bequeathed by the gods ensure only the most powerful spells or adamantine
    weapons can lay a behemoth low. As a result, the ravener behemoth fears
    nothing and eats everything. Ecology Behemoths have existed since the birth
    of the First World, where they served the gods as work beasts, intelligently
    shaping and transforming the land to a divine plan. However, when such work
    ended, some gods sought to put down their creations, hunting them to
    near-extinction. Others simply forgot them or left them to die as the First
    World faded away. But many behemoths stubbornly refused to abandon their
    life's purpose and crossed into the greater world, migrating in an effort to
    stay close to their creators. Unfortunately, as part of the journey, or
    because they lost the divine sponsorship of the gods, many behemoths
    devolved, losing their sentience and becoming nothing more than monstrous
    animals and creatures of legend. The ravener behemoth exists as one such
    example. Driven mad by the inattention of the gods and filled with anger
    over their abandonment, the raveners found a new purpose. Desperately
    hungry, these multi-stomached behemoths wholly devoted themselves to
    feasting upon the bounty of all the gods had created, gorging themselves in
    an effort to fill the void left by their masters and attract the gods'
    attention once again. Unfortunately, because of their lowered intelligence,
    most raveners can no longer answer when such attention finally comes,
    lacking the will or ability to communicate with their creators, and consumed
    by an all-encompassing hunger instead. The gods mostly leave such behemoths
    alone, ashamed and reluctant to fully extinguish their enduring spirits.
    More often, the gods challenge their mortal champions by directing them to
    deal with such creatures in their stead. Habitat & Society Most ravener
    behemoths live solitary lives, as their insatiable appetites cause too much
    strain on a single ecosystem to support more of their kind. Inevitably, when
    their paths do cross, two possible outcomes emerge. The beasts either do
    battle to establish dominance over one another, or every 50 years, certain
    hormones in female raveners can invoke a natural mating instinct between the
    behemoths instead. A pregnant ravener may produce up to 1d3 offspring per
    mating cycle, but it then drives off its mate to ensure enough food remains
    in the area to raise each cub to young adulthood. Raveners may live up to
    1,000 years while food sources remain, and frequently migrate when famine
    strikes. Behemoths of Legend Some ancient raveners retain a measure of their
    original sentience, occasionally renewing their relationships with the gods
    to serve as avatars or guardians. Others choose to remain aloof, pursuing
    their own goals independent of those who created them. These more potent
    behemoths sustain themselves through divine rituals learned when they served
    the gods and passed down from one generation to the next. They use their
    spell-like abilities to enhance the land and better support their enormous
    appetites. To replicate these more intelligent and independent raveners, add
    the following abilities to the standard behemoth. A ravener with these
    abilities is CR 19 and has Int 14, Wis 18, and Cha 18. It speaks Celestial,
    Sylvan, and Terran. Spell-Like Abilities (CL 15th): Always active-
    nondetection; At will-create water, detect animals or plants, purify food
    and drink, soften earth and stone; 3/day-cure critical wounds, heroes'
    feast, move earth, plant growth; 1/day- find the path, restoration
