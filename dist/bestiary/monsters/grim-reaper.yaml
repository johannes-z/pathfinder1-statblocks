Description_Visual: >-
  This tall, cloaked figure stares out from the black hood that covers its head.
  It wields an enormous scythe in its skeletal, bone-white hands, looking as
  though it is freezing the very air around it.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures hit by either a grim reaper's touch attack or by a weapon
      wielded by a grim reaper must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or gain
      2d4 negative levels. The save DC is Charisma-based. A grim reaper can
      channel this ability through any weapon it wields. A humanoid slain by a
      reaper's death touch is consumed in unholy fire and has its remains
      destroyed as the destruction spell. This is a death effect.
  - name: Summon Minor Reapers (Sp)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a reaper can summon 1d4 minor reapers as a standard
      action. Each of these minor reapers is assigned a single creature to
      attack, and the targeted creature must battle the minor reaper by itself.
      The target that the grim reaper assigns to its minor reapers need not be
      in sight, but it must be on the same plane on which the minor reaper was
      summoned. A grim reaper may only assign one minor reaper to any creature
      at a given time, even if it uses this ability multiple times.
Description:
  - >-
    Known by many names throughout nearly all cultures, grim reapers are the
    personifications of death and all the pain and fear associated with that
    state. They are universally feared by the living as harbingers of
    destruction and masters of all that has already passed from life. These
    hooded beings travel through the planes with the sole intent of bringing
    about the end of life, slaying with a deliberateness inscrutable to all but
    themselves.
  - >-
    While grim reapers are the most feared of their kind, they are not alone.
    The towering, ghostlike grim reapers are served by minor reapers, corporeal
    servitors that enact their master's dreadful will and meet out death's
    unrelenting touch. A grim reaper is 15 feet tall and, as an incorporeal
    creature, has no physical weight except for its equipment. Minor reapers
    stand 7 feet tall and weigh approximately 70 pounds.
  - >-
    Ecology Grim reapers have no creator and are not born by any definition of
    the word-they simply exist, much as the multiverse itself does. Some
    philosophers argue that grim reapers were created along with the Negative
    Energy Plane, manifesting from this plane when mortalkind first realized
    death's terminal permanency. Others claim that multiple minor reapers
    meeting on the Negative Energy Plane or another area infused with
    overwhelming negative energy might join together to form a new grim reaper.
  - >-
    While similar in shape to the psychopomps who serve Pharasma and ferry souls
    to their fates upon the planes, reapers care little for mortal souls,
    reveling in the moment of death and dissolution of the impermanent,
    regardless of the elaborate bureaucracy that oversees the doomed.
  - >-
    Habitat & Society While grim reapers stalk the planes, spreading death and
    despair for their own sakes, they are not alone in their endeavors. Among
    their many powers, grim reapers can summon lesser versions of themselves to
    seek out and kill specific individuals.
  - >-
    These minor reapers are encountered far more often than their masters,
    either in the service of their masters or summoned by evil magic-users to do
    their foul bidding. While stripped of their more powerful brethren's
    necromantic powers, these minor reapers are nonetheless brutal hunters and
    stop at nothing to achieve their objective. Minor reapers usually wait until
    their target is alone before appearing for battle, though if a pack of these
    undead assassins are sent after a group of victims, they will engage
    multiple targets if necessary.
  - >-
    If summoned by a grim reaper, minor reapers act as its additional eyes and
    ears, and if they are destroyed, their master is immediately aware of their
    obliteration. Other times, a grim reaper may summon minor reapers to aid in
    its escape from a battle it expects to lose, and flees to another plane of
    existence where it may recover and better prepare for the annihilation of
    its targets.
  - >-
    Grim reapers possess the ability to speak to any intelligent being, and the
    few who have survived encounters with a reaper or its minions claim that the
    bringer of death spoke to them in a deep, unearthly voice like nothing in
    the material realm.
  - >-
    Minor reapers can be created by casters of 20th level or higher using the
    spell create greater undead.
