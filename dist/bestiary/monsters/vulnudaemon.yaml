SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Doom (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a vulnudaemon can radiate an aura of dread and
      hopelessness. Any creature within 30 feet of the vulnudaemon must succeed
      at a DC 18 Will save or become shaken for as long as it remains in the
      aura.
Description:
  - >-
    These deceptive daemons personify death resulting from murder accented with
    betrayal. Most often formed from the souls of evil creatures killed by
    family or friends, vulnudaemons spread their insanity throughout the worlds
    by deceiving and killing all creatures they meet.
  - >-
    Vulnudaemons stalk their prey, infecting them with a sense of impending doom
    and watching their reactions, learning their responses before attacking and
    savoring their death. These daemons serve as excellent assassins, hiding in
    the shadows before debilitating their enemies, or striking from the
    protection of invisibility in order to deliver the killing blow. When facing
    stronger enemies, vulnudaemons seek to wear them down through a series of
    attacks, nicking at them and darting off, then repeating the process until
    their opponents bleed out.
  - >-
    Vulnudaemons often find themselves called to the Material Plane by cultists
    of deities associated with murder and assassination. These cultists often
    see vulnudaemons as sacred creatures favored by their deity, and rather than
    simply use the daemons as assassins, cultists often grant them a shocking
    degree of freedom to wander the region as they will, picking victims to fit
    their own agendas and murdering whomever they wish. Cultists who conjure
    vulnudaemons into the world usually take care to show the daemons a secret
    hand sign or other code that members of the cult can show them, lest the
    monsters decide to target one of the believers for an attack. Whether or not
    an accidentally targeted cultist has the time to flash her safety sign to
    the daemon should the creature attack her at a later date is, of course,
    another matter.
  - Vulnudaemons stand 3 feet tall and weigh 25 pounds.
