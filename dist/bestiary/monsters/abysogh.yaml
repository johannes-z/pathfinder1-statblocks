SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cataclysmic Roar (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, an abysogh can emit a terrible
      roar in a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in this cone take 10d6 points of
      sonic damage and are deafened and staggered for 1d6 rounds. A successful
      DC 25 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates both conditions. This
      is a sonic effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Freedom of Movement (Ex)
    description: >-
      An abysogh is under the constant effect of freedom of movement, as the
      spell. This effect cannot be dispelled.
  - name: Living Ammunition (Ex)
    description: >-
      When an abysogh succeeds at a combat maneuver check to initiate or
      maintain a grapple against a creature two or more size categories smaller
      than itself, it can hurl the creature anywhere within 60 feet as a free
      action, though if it does so after maintaining a grapple, it can't perform
      any of the actions that can normally be taken as part of maintaining a
      grapple. Regardless of the trajectory, the hurled creature takes 6d6
      points of damage from the collision and falls prone. The creature can
      attempt a DC 25 Reflex save to halve the damage and avoid falling prone.
      The save DC is Constitution-based. If the targeted square contains another
      creature, the abysogh makes a ranged attack against the target. A hurled
      Large creature deals 4d6 points of damage, a Medium creature deals 3d6
      points of damage, and a Small creature deals 2d6 points of damage. The
      abysogh adds 1-1/2 its Strength bonus to this damage. Tiny or smaller
      creatures don't deal damage to the target. Whether the attack hits or not,
      the hurled creature lands in an empty space of the abysogh's choice
      adjacent to the target.
  - name: Trembling Earth (Ex)
    description: >-
      When an abysogh moves more than 5 feet in a round, its footsteps send
      seismic waves rippling across the ground. All creatures at least two size
      categories smaller than the abysogh that are standing on the ground within
      20 feet of the giant at any point during its movement must succeed at a DC
      25 Reflex save or fall prone. The save DC is Constitution-based. The
      vibrations also suppress tremorsense within the area for 1 round (no
      save).
  - name: Whirlwind Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      An abysogh can send multiple opponents flying through the air with its
      sweeping slams. When an abysogh uses the full-attack action, instead of
      making its normal attacks, it can perform one awesome blow combat maneuver
      at its highest base attack bonus against each opponent within its reach.
      It must attempt a separate combat maneuver check against each opponent.
      When using this ability, the abysogh forfeits any bonuses and extra
      attacks granted by feats, spells, or abilities.
Description:
  - >-
    Rather than collecting rocks like ordinary giants, abysoghs enjoy collecting
    living creatures, and love nothing more than flinging a screaming human or
    horse at enemies.
  - >-
    Legends tell of a small cult of foolish storm giants who dug around the Pit
    of Gormuz in a misguided attempt to free lost Ranginori, and struck a flow
    of horrific blood from Rovagug or one of his spawn. Contaminated by the
    blood, the cultists emerged as horribly mutated creatures of hate and
    destruction. Nearly unstoppable in their mindless rage, they now live only
    to slaughter and destroy.
  - An abysogh stands at least 40 feet tall and weighs approximately 70 tons.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Though abysoghs are giants, their mutations have warped them into bigger,
    stronger, and more aggressive creatures than others of their kind. Centuries
    spent sleeping in lightless caverns have turned the giants' skin to a
    pallid, milky white. Although sunlight does not harm them, they
    instinctively hate the sun for its connection to Sarenrae.
  - >-
    The eyes of an abysogh resemble misshapen pools of liquid. Completely blind
    to light and colors, their
  - >-
    eyes instead perceive motion and shapes through low-frequency vibrations,
    which cause ripples across the surfaces of their eyes. Only in this sense
    can they "see" the world around them.
  - >-
    The blood of these giants is black from the taint of Rovagug. Their bulging
    veins stretch out in weblike patterns across their pale skin. The cursed
    blood of the abysoghs also fuels their perpetual, mindless rage, rendering
    them incapable of being destroyed. Only electricity can momentarily snap
    them out of their rage and remind them of what they lost so long ago,
    allowing them to recover enough of their mortality to die.
  - >-
    Although abysoghs are far more intelligent than animals, their intellect is
    purely instinctual. The natural state of mind for these giants is a tempest
    of constant turmoil, and as such, it is impossible to affect their minds
    with magic.
  - >-
    For all of an abysogh's strength and fury, its body can sustain an active,
    destructive state for only a few weeks or months at a time. Toward the end
    of an abysogh's rampage, the giant becomes sluggish and weary, and starts
    looking for a place to rest. Once it finds a suitable place, it may remain
    dormant for decades, or even centuries.
  - >-
    An abysogh's metabolism slows down considerably during sleep. Although
    mortal, abysoghs can theoretically live for millennia for this reason.
    However, because of their violent lives and their lack of society or
    reproduction, their numbers decrease with every passing century.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    The lair of an abysogh is usually a vast cave in a mountainside or at the
    bottom of a deep, lightless chasm. The lair is bare of all decorations
    except for countless splintered bones and jagged rocks.
  - >-
    Much like Rovagug, abysoghs hate all creatures equally. They sometimes
    enslave lesser giants, but any such forced alliances are usually short-lived
    because of the abysoghs' volatile temperaments. They cannot even stand the
    presence of others of their kind; such an encounter inevitably leads to an
    earth-shattering showdown between the two titans. This means that abysoghs
    never mate; all the abysoghs on Golarion today come from the original cult
    of corrupted storm giants. It is unknown whether the abysogh race is even
    fecund, and, if so, whether any potential offspring would possess abilities
    different from their forebears.
  - >-
    Because of their unquenchable desire to slaughter and destroy, abysoghs
    can't coexist peacefully with any creatures save for the smallest and most
    unremarkable life forms. Tiny and smaller creatures are generally beneath an
    abysogh's notice and can even live in its lair if they are careful enough to
    avoid disturbing the giant.
  - >-
    Sometimes, people unwittingly settle near a sleeping abysogh's lair and may
    be completely oblivious to the giant's presence for generations. The only
    telltale sign of a sleeping abysogh is that the region surrounding its lair
    is occasionally plagued by tremors caused by the creature's restless
    slumber.
  - >-
    Rumors of a sleeping abysogh may attract followers of Rovagug to seek out
    its lair in order to awaken the giant. Such rumors may also attract
    giantslayers and followers of Sarenrae, who wish to thwart the cultists'
    plans and slay the abysogh before it awakens.
  - >-
    When an abysogh awakens, it often attacks any creatures near its lair
    relentlessly, destroying or eating anything it can and saving only what it
    can use later to cause more destruction. An abysogh usually keeps a few of
    its victims for future use, either as ammunition or snacks. For this reason,
    the thunderous beat of an approaching abysogh's footsteps is often
    accompanied by the lamentations of the giant's battered victims as they're
    carried along in its sack.
