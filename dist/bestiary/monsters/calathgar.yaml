  The acrid scent of vinegar wafts from this shield-sized blossom. Amid shocking
  blue petals slowly twitches a cluster of sharp stamens arranged like a ring of
  teeth within a leafy muzzle.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cold Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      Calathgars are healed by cold. Anytime a calathgar is subjected to cold
      damage, it regains 1 hit point (regardless of the amount of cold damage
      dealt). When in areas of severe cold (such as arctic regions or near brown
      mold), a calathgar gains fast healing 1.
  - name: Mold Mulch (Ex)
    description: >-
      Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, a calathgar withers and swiftly
      decays, transforming into a 5-foot patch of brown mold. If a calathgar is
      killed by fire, the mold immediately grows into a 10-foot patch. If it is
      killed in a space already occupied by brown mold, that mold patch doubles
      in size just as though fire had been brought near. The area within 30 feet
      of brown mold is cold enough to activate a calathgar's cold healing and
      the persistent effect of its seed spray. Brown mold deals 3d6 points of
      nonlethal cold damage to all creatures within 5 feet of it. See page 416
      of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for additional details.
  - name: Seed Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, up to 3 times per day, a calathgar can expel a
      blast of thorny, frozen seeds in a 15-foot cone. All creatures in this
      area take 4d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 15 for half ). In frigid
      climes-areas where the temperature is 40 degrees or colder-these seeds
      cling to those they strike, dealing an additional 1d6 points of cold
      damage on the following round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Known to grow in the depths of the densest frozen forests, realms where
    icicles rarely melt from the snow-cloaked trees, calathgars, or "hail
    lilies," grow to a size and possess an alien beauty that make their cuttings
    greatly desired in civilized lands. Yet, what few beside the wariest hunters
    and most knowledgeable denizens of the forests realize is that hail lilies
    are more than mere flowers-their fully grown varieties possess not only a
    deadly way of spreading their frozen seeds but also an even more dangerous
    trait: thought. Known among their own kind as calathgars, these ice-tinged
    plants move slowly and possess little in the way of society, yet they
    perceive their surroundings, know when their frigid gardens are threatened,
    feel pain, and-most tenaciously- seek a chilling revenge when their young
    are despoiled. The blooms of a fully grown calathgar measures 3 feet in
    diameter, though some have reported flowers up to 5, 8, and even 10 feet
    wide. Able to crawl on three tendrillike roots, one of these plants might
    stand as high as 4 feet off the ground, and when heavy with seeds might
    weigh as much as 50 pounds. Ecology Calathgars are immediately identifiable,
    even from a distance, by their sky-blue petals, a color repeated by few
    other forms of plant life in such size or brilliance. Yet typically, these
    blooms only unfurl during the brightest hours of the day or when the plants
    feel threatened. At all other times, calathgars keep their flowers closed,
    defending the sensitive structures within and presenting large, blue-gray
    sepals to the outside world. Calathgar young look little different from tall
    blue flowers-hence many horticulturists identify them merely as hail lilies.
    It takes nearly a year for a juvenile calathgar to display any kind of
    concerted movement, aside from the opening and closing of their petals and a
    few markedly un-plant-like twitches. Their sense of scent and ability to
    communicate function as soon as their buds first grow-typically within 2
    weeks of sprouting from the cold earth. Two rings of sensory organs help
    calathgars remain aware of their surroundings: a cluster of lobes at the
    base of the flower and another situated around the stamen within. Both are
    capable of not just deciphering light in an approximation of visual sight,
    but also receiving information via a highly developed kind of scent. This
    sense of smell is much more developed in the plants than their ability to
    see-though at close ranges their sight can prove just as accurate as most
    humanoids. To this end, most communication between the plants is
    scent-based, utterly silent, and often imperceptible to non-plant creatures.
    At times when the plants feel threatened, however, they exude a smell like
    vinegar or, if angry, a coppery odor. For all their developments as a
    species, calathgars possess a strange connection, even symbiosis, with a far
    less complex type of growth: brown mold. Notorious for its ability to drain
    the warmth from an area and freeze the unwary, brown mold not only benefits
    calathgars-allowing them to grow comfortably in areas they might otherwise
    find inhospitably warm-but it also pervades the roots and internal
    structures of the plants. Some suggest that calathgars might be some
    advanced form of brown mold, yet the idea is typically dismissed, as such
    mutually beneficial relationships are well documented in the world of
    mundane flora. As a calathgar grows to maturity, brown mold thrives within
    its flower and internal structures, aiding in keeping the growth cool and
    providing it with frigid defensive abilities and a way to spread its
    seeds-freezing and clinging to creatures that come near before dropping off
    later. The flowers provide the mold ample places to grow, and defense from
    creatures that might threaten it. The adult plants also prove so riddled
    with nutrients upon which the fungus flourishes that should a calathgar
    violently die amid brown mold, the fungal patch instantly explodes with
    growth-typically to the detriment of whatever ended the calathgar's life.
    Habitat & Society Calathgars have little in the way of society, other than
    grouping together for mutual defense. Despite their intellects, the plants'
    psyches prove distinctive and alien in comparison to those of animals and
    sentient creatures. They have little interest in emotions, culture, or
    ambition, yet they possess nearly flawless memories and an understanding of
    experiences which they can share with other calathgars by scent as easily as
    (and far more effectively than) humanoids can pass on information by speech.
    Yet where calathgars do seem most like humanoids is in their capacity to
    care for their young and seek reprisal should any harm befall them. Should
    an immature calathgar be trampled, plucked, or otherwise ruined, adults do
    all they can to pursue and deal vengeance upon those who murdered their
    young, planting a new generation in the killer's frozen flesh. While
    calathgars can be reasoned with and most prove generally accepting of honest
    apologies from those capable of communicating with them, like most enraged
    parents, an incensed calathgar is rarely in a mood to speak.
