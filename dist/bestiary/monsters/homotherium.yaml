Description:
  - >-
    This white-furred saber-toothed cat is a relative of the smilodon but makes
    its home in the arctic regions of the world. Its canines are much shorter
    than the smilodon (averaging only about 4-5 inches long) and its front legs
    are longer than its rear legs (similar to a hyena's leg structure).
