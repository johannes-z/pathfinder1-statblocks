Source: PFRPG Bestiary 3
IsTemplate: 0
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mighty Roar (Su)
    description: >-
      Every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a thunder behemoth can issue a
      mighty roar in a 60-foot cone that duplicates the effect of an empowered
      greater shout (Fortitude DC 30 half ). This is a sonic effect. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Rock Spitting (Ex)
    description: >-
      A thunder behemoth can spit rocks from the essentially inexhaustible store
      in its gizzard. It can spit up to four rocks as a standard action, with a
      range increment of 60 feet. A creature that is critically hit by one of
      these rocks must make a DC 38 Fortitude save to resist being stunned for 1
      round. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Swallow Whole (Ex)
    description: >-
      A thunder behemoth has five stomachs and can shunt a swallowed victim into
      any one of them (usually choosing an empty stomach).
Description:
  - >-
    Thunder behemoths walk the land as little more than roving appetites, driven
    by an all-consuming hunger to devour every animal, plant, and even building
    in sight. They indiscriminately gorge their five seemingly bottomless
    stomachs on forests and jungles, collapse mine and mountain alike in search
    of ore, and raze settlements and strongholds for the cowering morsels
    within.
  - >-
    Thunder behemoths are sent by the gods to destroy wicked cities, raze great
    temples or monuments that offend divine eyes, and otherwise act as
    instruments of divine wrath on the surface of a world or just below it. The
    days before a thunder behemoth arrives are fraught with minor but unnerving
    earthquakes, mass exoduses of burrowing animals to the surface, and an
    increase in fallen trees and sinkholes.
