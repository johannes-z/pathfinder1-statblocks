Description_Visual: >-
  This barnacle-encrusted walking corpse looks like a zombie, but is dripping
  with water and gives off a nauseating stench.

  - name: Nausea (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that is damaged by a draugr must make a DC 12 Fortitude save or
      be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Draugr smell of decay and the sea, and drip water wherever they go. These
    foul beings are usually created when humanoid creatures are lost at sea in
    regions haunted by evil spirits or necromantic effects. The corpses of these
    drowned sailors cling fiercely to unlife, attacking any living creatures
    that intrude upon them. Their attacks smear rancid flesh, rotting seaweed,
    and swaths of vermin on whatever they hit.
  - >-
    In the case of draugr who manifest when an entire ship sinks, these undead
    usually stay with the wreck of their ship. Some draugr may be found under
    the control of aquatic necromancers, while others may wander the seas as
    undead pirates aboard ghost ships.
  - DRAUGR CAPTAIN (CR 3)
  - >-
    Draugr captains have malevolent, burning red eyes. They may be more richly
    dressed than other draugr, though their clothes are always in a similar
    tattered condition.
  - >-
    A draugr captain is a draugr with the advanced simple template. In addition
    to this, most draugr captains have additional class levels, usually as
    barbarians, fighters, or rogues. Draugr captains can also use obscuring mist
    as a spell-like ability (CL 5th, concentration +8) three times per day, and
    instead of causing nausea with a successful hit, they bestow 1 negative
    level on a hit. A draugr captain can even bestow a negative level via a
    weapon it wields, but if it gains multiple attacks with a weapon, it can
    only bestow 1 negative level per round in this manner.
