Description:
  - >-
    Cinder knights are elemental creatures composed completely of fire and
    encased in suits of irremovable armor. Over time, the armor adheres to the
    cinder knight's form, and the armor chars and blackens as the flames of the
    cinder knight's body scorch and burns it. Cinder knights dwell on the Plane
    of Fire among other fire elementals and creatures. The creature's true
    origins are unknown, but some believe the cinder knight to be an advanced
    form of fire elemental or perhaps a fire elemental punished for some
    transgression.
  - >-
    A cinder knight stands over 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds (without its
    armor, its true form weighs less). The creature's true form is never seen,
    for when a cinder knight dies, its fires extinguish, and it vanishes in
    wisps of smoke, leaving only its armor behind. The armor is extremely hot to
    the touch and deals 1d6 points of fire damage to any creature touching it.
    One hour after a cinder knight dies, the armor, while still warm, can be
    handled without taking damage.
  - >-
    A cinder knight rarely attacks using natural attacks, preferring the use of
    weapons in combat. Greatswords are the most common weapon, followed by
    mauls, longswords, and flails. Regardless of the weapon used, a cinder
    knight deals fire damage with its fire attack (a product of the creature
    itself and not the weapon).
