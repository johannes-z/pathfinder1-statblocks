      During any conditions other than bright light, a shadow wing can disappear
      into the shadows as a move-equivalent action, effectively becoming
      invisible. Artificial illumination or light spells of 2nd level or lower
      do not negate this ability. Superior Low-Light

Description:
  - >-
    Shadow wings are nocturnal predators formed of inky blackness that resemble
    a cross between a giant hawk and giant tailless manta ray. They are fierce
    hunters, and once prey is sighted, shadow wings are relentless in their
    pursuit. A typical shadow wing hunter claims a territory in a 5 mile radius
    around its lair. To the shadow wing, any living creature entering this area
    is fair game.
  - >-
    The common shadow wing makes its lair within a secluded and hard to reach
    cave high in mountainous regions. A typical nest contains 2 adults and 1d4
    newborns or 2d4 eggs. Shadow wing eggs are blackish-blue in color and soft
    and leathery to the touch.
  - >-
    Shadow wings prefer to scout for food under the cover of darkness when their
    shadow blend ability is the most useful. Using its superior vision it almost
    always sights its target before they ever know the shadow wing is there.
    Prey is killed and either devoured on the spot or carried back to the lair.
  - >-
    A shadow wing measures 9 feet long and has a wingspan of 20 feet. Its body
    is composed of darkness and shadowstuff and it resembles a manta ray with a
    hawk's head. Its beak is formed of the same inky blackness as the rest of
    its form. Other than two piercing red eyes no other discernible features can
    be made out in its form. Shadow wings speak with a low, raspy voice.
  - >-
    A shadow wing attacks by swooping low at an opponent and slashing it with
    its wings or stabbing with its beak. Since most attacks instigated by shadow
    wings occur under the cover of darkness, they use their shadow blend ability
    to conceal themselves from their foes.
