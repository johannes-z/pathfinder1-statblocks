    description: >-
      Clockwork scouts are constructed to resemble small animals such as
      badgers, dogs, or cats. Often, their inner wood and metal workings are
      covered by an animal's pelt, while their frame is specially constructed to
      help reinforce the illusion that they are an animal. A character must
      succeed on a DC 15 Knowledge (nature), Perception or Survival check to
      notice that the scout is not an actual animal.
Description:
  - >-
    Scouts are constructed to resemble animals commonly found in the area that
    the brain gear operates within. This camouflage helps them move about
    unnoticed and gives them the opportunity to strike from ambush.
  - >-
    Clockwork scouts are designed to serve as the mobile eyes and ears of a
    clockwork colony. While still restricted by the 2-mile radius they must
    remain within to keep contact with a brain gear, scouts serve an important
    role as reconnaissance, patrol, and pursuit troops.
  - >-
    Clockwork scouts prefer to attack from ambush. Often, they climb trees and
    leap down upon opponents. If they come across an enemy camp, the brain gear
    may direct them to sneak into the camp and steal equipment or carry off
    water, food, and other necessities. Usually, the brain gear prefers to hold
    scouts back from combat. Only if the scouts have a chance to strike from a
    devastating ambush does the brain gear order them into battle.
