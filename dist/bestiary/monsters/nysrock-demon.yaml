Description:
  - >-
    Nysrocks are believed to be somehow related to nagas, or are in fact nagas
    themselves warped through ancient and demonic dark magic into their current
    form. Whatever their origin, nysrocks are thoroughly evil and contemptible
    caring for no one other than themselves.
  - >-
    Nysrocks are often found in the courts of various demon lords serving as
    advisors and counselors. Their cunning intellects are used to full effect by
    their masters in weaving battle plans and plots and intrigues against rival
    lords and enemies.
  - >-
    Rumors abound as of late (supposedly from an eyewitness who lived to tell
    the tale) of an abyssal plane ruled by a massive nysrock at least 40 feet
    long. Its palace is a network of underground tunnels populated with all
    manner of snakes, fiendish serpents, and intelligent and cunning reptiles of
    all shapes and sizes.
  - >-
    A nysrock ranges in size from 14 to 16 feet long and weigh 350 to 450
    pounds. Its scales are blackish-blue and its eyes are golden and glint with
    a cunning spark. Its barbed tail is jet black and oozes a vile smelling
    poison when the creature is threatened.
  - >-
    A nysrock flares its hood before it enters combat as a warning to its
    opponents. Those that press combat are met with a vicious bite and venomous
    tail sting. A creature that is bitten is grabbed and wrapped in the
    monster's coils. A nysrock derives great pleasure in repeatedly stinging a
    grappled foe. Once a grappled foe expires, the nysrock releases its hold and
    consumes it whole so long as it faces no more enemies (nysrocks aren't
    stupid and do not ignore other enemies in order to feed).
