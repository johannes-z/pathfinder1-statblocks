SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animate Bones (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a bone cobbler can animate up to 5 skeletal statues within
      30 feet as a standard action. These creatures fight as skeletons (see
      Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary), though their forms and structures
      do not necessarily have to resemble humanoids (or anything remotely
      humanoid). This ability otherwise functions similar to an animate dead
      spell (caster level 7th).
  - name: Bonestripping (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bone cobbler can rapidly strip all the flesh from a Medium creature in 3
      minutes using its claws and hammers. For each size category larger than
      Medium a corpse is, add 1 minute to the time it takes the bone cobbler to
      strip the corpse. For each size category smaller than Medium a corpse is,
      reduce the time by 1 minute (to a minimum of 1 minute). Once stripped, the
      bone cobbler devours the flesh and collects the victim's bones to use in
      its "sculptures". A creature slain in this manner can only be brought back
      to life by a miracle, wish, or true resurrection spell. Two-Weapon
  - name: Fighting (Ex)
    description: >-
      In combination with its natural abilities, a bone cobbler's Two-Weapon
      Fighting feat allows it to attack with both of its weapons at no penalty
      to attack or damage.
Description:
  - >-
    The bone cobbler is a tattered and desiccated humanoid and is often mistaken
    for a zombie at ranges greater than 10 feet. The bone cobbler is a malign
    and evil creature (thought to be from another plane or dimension of
    existence) that delights in slaying its opponents and stripping the flesh
    from their bones. Bone cobblers take the skeletal remains of those they kill
    and combine them with other bones in their lair. From these bones they
    sculpt and form weird humanoid or half-humanoid skeletal statues.
  - Bone cobblers stand 6 feet tall.
  - >-
    The bone cobbler attacks living creatures with its hammers. Slain creatures
    are stripped clean, their flesh and muscle devoured by the bone cobbler for
    sustenance and their bones carted away by the bone cobbler to be used in its
    abominable creations.
