  - name: Undersized Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although a drider is Large, its upper torso is the same size as that of a
      Medium humanoid's upper torso. As a result, it wields weapons as if it
      were one size category smaller than its actual size (Medium for most
      driders).
Description:
  - >-
    Created from the body of a drow, warped and mutated through special poisons
    and elixirs to take on the characteristics of a giant spider, the drider is
    a dangerous creature.
  - >-
    Driders are sexually dimorphic. A female drider's lower spider body is sleek
    and graceful, often similar to a black widow's body, while its upper drow
    torso retains its alluring curves and beautiful face (with the exception of
    sharp, poisonous fangs). A male drider's lower body is bulky like a
    tarantula, while its upper body is wiry and bears a hideous face more spider
    than drow, complete with fanged mandibles.
