  - name: Castle (Ex)
    description: >-
      A behemoth golem has a small stronghold built onto its back. Up to eight
      Medium creatures can occupy this tower by climbing onto the behemoth golem
      with a DC 25 Climb check (DC 10 if the golem is willing). A creature
      occupying the tower can choose either to hide in the castle's interior,
      gaining total cover as long as it remains within the structure but losing
      the ability to attack anything outside of the tower, or to stand on the
      parapet around the perimeter of the tower, gaining partial cover thanks to
      the battlement surrounding the walkway. A behemoth golem's castle moves
      with the creature itself, and though creatures occupying the castle count
      as occupying the same square as the golem, they cannot be engaged in melee
      unless their opponent is also occupying the castle. A behemoth golem can
      shake off unwanted occupants by making a combat maneuver check as a
      full-round action; any creatures currently occupying the castle must
      succeed at a Reflex save (DC equal to the result of the behemoth golem's
      combat maneuver check). Creatures standing on the parapet that fail their
      save fall out of the castle, landing in the nearest empty square and
      taking 5d6 points of falling damage (6d6 if standing on the uppermost
      parapet); creatures hiding within the castle that fail their saves are
      jumbled about and take 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC for
      half damage).
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      A behemoth golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and abilities function
      differently against the creature. • A stone to flesh spell negates a
      behemoth golem's damage reduction for 1 round. • A transmute rock to mud
      spell slows a behemoth golem as the slow spell for 1d4 rounds (no save). •
      A magical attack that deals acid damage heals 1 point of damage for each 3
      points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing
      would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any
      excess as temporary hit points. A behemoth golem gets no save against acid
      effects.
  - name: Quake (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once per day, a behemoth golem can stomp its two
      front feet down, creating a ripple of destruction in a 60-foot cone. This
      effect is otherwise identical to earthquake (caster level 17th).
Description:
  - >-
    Behemoth golems are elephantine constructs once crafted by the artificers of
    the ancient Jistka Imperium. Rather than use elemental spirits to fuel the
    constructs' animation, artificers made pacts with demons, daemons, and
    devils from the evil Outer Planes, and bound their spirits to these titanic
    horrors to bring them to life. Though from a distance they resemble armored
    mammoths with a castle attached to their back, a behemoth golem's flesh is
    in fact made of tons of mined stone, and its tusks and teeth are carved from
    rare minerals similar in density to ivory.
  - >-
    The main body of a behemoth golem is 40 feet tall, with the highest part of
    the tower reaching 60 feet.

    While the methods for creating a behemoth golem are largely considered lost
    along with so much Jistkan lore, a character who finds herself in possession
    of one of Jistka's fabled behemoth golem manuals gains the knowledge
    required to construct such a mammoth being. A behemoth golem is built from
    70,000 pounds of rocks and rare minerals treated with profane oils worth
    25,000 gp.
