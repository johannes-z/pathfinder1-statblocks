Description:
  - >-
    Requiem beetles are beetles of enormous size reaching lengths of 100 feet or
    more. They make their lairs in remote mountainous regions or deep
    underground in massive caverns. A typical lair contains a solitary creature
    (no two have ever been encountered together). Mating and reproduction
    rituals and methods among requiem beetles are unknown to sages, though it is
    generally accepted that requiem beetles follow other similar beetle and
    vermin mating patterns.
  - >-
    These monsters sustain themselves on a diet of mosses, funguses, lichens,
    molds, and oozes. Their natural immunity to acid allows them to kill and
    digest most oozes without bother. Requiem beetles are mindless hunters, like
    other vermin, and simply kill and eat whatever they come across. When they
    deplete an area of its food source they simply move to another location.
  - Requiem beetles measure about 40 feet long and weigh about 18 tons.
  - >-
    A requiem beetle charges into combat attempting to trample as many of its
    opponents as it can. It uses its massive pincers in battle to cut and tear
    its opponents or grab and squeeze them. Once a requiem beetle grabs a foe it
    rarely lets go until either it or the opponent is dead. If forced to flee, a
    requiem beetle does not release its prey, but instead, carries it off with
    it.
