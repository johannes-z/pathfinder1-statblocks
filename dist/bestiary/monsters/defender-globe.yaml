    description: >-
      A defender globe adds its Charisma bonus to its AC and CMD as a deflection
      bonus.
  - name: Flight (Su)
    description: >-
      A defender globe can cease or resume flight as a free action. The ability
      is supernatural, so it becomes ineffective in an antimagic field, and the
      defender globe loses its ability to fly for as long as the antimagic
      effect persists.
Description:
  - >-
    This small outsider is bound by spellcasters using the summon monster III or
    lesser planar binding spells, serving for up to 1 day per caster level.
    Using more powerful incantations can bind the globes for longer periods
    (GM's discretion).
  - >-
    They can understand, but not speak, any language spoken by their summoner.
    The summoned globes can understand simple orders, and carries out their last
    order until destroyed or dismissed.
