Description_Visual: >-
  Four clawed arms sprout from this fiend's chest like the limbs of a buried
  insect struggling to crawl free. Overlapping iridescent plates of chitin
  cascade down the monster's back, shrouding four membranous dragonf ly wings.
Group: Demon
Source: AP 78
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breaching (Su)
    description: >-
      When a katpaskir calls or summons a demon or creature with the fiendish
      simple template into an area where the summoned creature's entry would be
      blocked by a magical effect (such as magic circle against evil,
      forbiddance, or dimensional lock), it can force the caster or creator of
      the effect to attempt a caster level check against the katpaskir's spell
      resistance. On a failed check, the blocking effect is immediately and
      permanently negated.
  - name: Distance Distortion (Su)
    description: >-
      Reality bends and warps within 30 feet of a katpaskir. The demon moves and
      attacks normally through this distorted area, but other creatures within
      this area treat all distances as if they were double the actual distance
      for all purposes, including movement, range for spells, and ranged
      attacks. In addition, a creature that begins its turn within this aura
      must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or be slowed for 1 round (as the slow
      spell). Freedom of movement prevents the slow effect but not any of the
      other effects of the distance distortion aura. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Mirror of the Tainted Rift (Su)
    description: >-
      When one or more creature with the celestial simple template is summoned
      as part of the spell or ability within 30 feet of a katpaskir, the
      katpaskir can, as an immediate action, summon an equal number of creatures
      of the same type with the fiendish simple template. If a good-aligned
      outsider is called or summoned within 30 feet of a katpaskir, it can
      duplicate the calling or summoning spell as an immediate action, calling
      or summoning one or more demons as if it had cast the same spell.
  - name: Teleportation Disruption (Su)
    description: >-
      When a creature uses a teleportation effect to enter or leave a space
      within 30 feet of a katpaskir, the caster must immediately attempt a
      caster level check (DC equal to the katpaskir's spell resistance). On a
      failed check, the teleportation effect is negated. If it chooses, the
      katpaskir can instead redirect the arrival location of the teleportation
      effect to any unoccupied space within 120 feet.
  - name: Warp Sense (Ex)
    description: >-
      A katpaskir can automatically sense disruptions in the planar fabric
      within 1 mile. The demon is immediately aware of any conjuration effect
      used within this area, and it also knows the direction and approximate
      distance. When a teleportation effect is used within 1 mile of a katpaskir
      (including arriving within this area from somewhere else), the demon can
      use clairaudience/ clairvoyance as an immediate action centered on the
      point the teleportation effect originated from or the point the
      teleportation effect is directed at as long as the point is within 1 mile;
      if both points are within 1 mile, the katpaskir can use
      clairaudience/clairvoyance centered on both.
Description:
  - >-
    Katpaskirs are a pox and pestilence upon not just the world, but reality
    itself. Just as bugs burrow into unwatched crevices, katpaskirs pry their
    way into other realms and dimensions. They gnaw and scratch and grind away
    at the edges of the universe, the planar junctures where the folds of
    creation bend in upon themselves. They have an uncanny sense for finding
    natural rifts, portals, and convergences, and they seek ever for ways to
    expand and untether these natural gates. By setting them loose to drift
    across the world, they unhinge the orderly substrate of the multiverse,
    casting all into primordial chaos as the planes unravel. Their voices are
    strange and echoing, like several voices sounding together, each distorted
    and cacophonous and rising and falling asynchronously in pitch and volume.
    When not actively engaged in a task, katpaskirs tend to stand perfectly
    still, with the exception of its insectlike limbs, which rhythmically stroke
    the air in front of them. When other creature come near-or if some
    teleporting creature triggers the demon's warp sense special ability-it
    snaps out of this self-imposed stasis, ready to attack. Katpaskirs are a
    little over 7 feet tall and weigh just less than 600 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Katpaskirs form in the Abyss from the souls of those apocalyptic preachers,
    doomsayers, and cult leaders who, not content to merely announce the end of
    days, took it upon themselves in life to bring a living hell to the realms
    where they resided. Some led suicide cults of dozens if not hundreds, while
    others organized ultraviolent gangs of nihilistic thugs, spouting cultured
    witticisms and philosophical sophistries while perpetrating the basest
    depravities. For them, the anarchic dissolution of society was only a
    harbinger of the very real disintegration of all that is.
  - >-
    These fiends are a natural fit for the armies of Deskari, and indeed,
    katpaskirs have been used by the Locust Lord for many eons as apocalyptic
    leaders and generals in his plane-spanning campaigns. Some of Deskari's most
    fervent and inf luential worshipers are known to have become katpaskirs in
    the afterlife, earning the powers of cataclysm and madness they so
    desperately sought while still mortal.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Except in unique circumstances that align with their goals, katpaskirs
    rarely interact with humanoid cultists of Deskari. In part, this is because
    their power makes them nigh uncontrollable even for the mightiest
    spellcaster, but also because these demons see little use in humanity and
    their ilk. To katpaskirs, mortals are part of the reality that must be
    destroyed, not the implements of its destruction. They may make brief use of
    humanoid minions, but at their earliest opportunity they devour and destroy
    those seeking to serve them, unleashing a horde of fiendish terrors to
    finish their mission of ultimate destruction. Crazed cultists of Deskari and
    powerful members of the Blackfire Adepts sometimes call upon katpaskirs to
    help the group create new portals to Deskari's Rasping Rifts or tear rifts
    between worlds, but such humanoids know that such a summoning ensures their
    own final reckoning as well.
  - >-
    Katpaskirs are drawn to newly opened rifts and thin places between the
    planes. Upon reaching such areas, a katpaskir may either attempt to
    accelerate the opening of the rift or wait for whatever creatures come
    through once it opens.
