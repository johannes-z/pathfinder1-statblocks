SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Constitution Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature grabbed by a sleeping willow must make a successful DC 19
      Fortitude save or take1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the hold
      is maintained as the sleeping willow drains the victim's body fluids. The
      sleeping willow heals 5 points of damage whenever it drains Constitution,
      gaining temporary hit points (if bonus hit points exceed the sleeping
      willows total). At Constitution 0, the creature dies and its body is
      absorbed by the sleeping willow's roots. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Sleep Spores (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a sleeping willow can eject a cloud of yellowish
      pollen from its body in a 30-foot spread. Affected creatures must make a
      successful DC 19 Will save or fall asleep for 10 minutes. There is no HD
      limit for this sleep effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Sleeping willows are slow-moving, carnivorous plant creatures with evil
    dispositions. Most sleeping willows make their home among groves or areas of
    normal willow trees where they can use their natural appearance to their
    advantage. Though capable of movement, the sleeping willow only moves at
    night, so as not to be detected or seen. Once a hunting area becomes
    depopulated or scarce, the sleeping willow moves on to better hunting
    grounds where it takes root and repeats the above cycle of waiting, hunting,
    and moving on to a new location. Sleeping willows do not collect treasure
    but the treasure from their past victims is often scattered about the base
    of the tree. Sleeping willows do not mind this, for they know that greedy
    treasure-seekers will be lured in by this and it makes catching a meal that
    much easier. A sleeping willow appears as a normal willow tree (and is often
    mistaken for such) standing 15 or more feet tall. Some species have been
    rumored to reach heights in excess of 30 feet. Its trunk is 2 feet or more
    in diameter and dark brown in color. From the trunk sprout branches that end
    in long drooping and graceful twigs. The sleeping willow is crowned with
    leaves of green or brownish-green. A sleeping willow prefers to attack from
    ambush when potential prey wanders too close to it. Once prey is in range,
    the sleeping willow releases its spores and then attacks with its branches,
    grabbing its prey in its viselike grip. Grappled creatures are drained of
    their body fluids and absorbed by the tree. A grove of sleeping willows act
    in concert against multiple opponents, aiding one another when necessary
    until the opponents are slain or flee. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
