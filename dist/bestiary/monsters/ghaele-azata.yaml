SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      In humanoid form, a ghaele's gaze attack slays evil creatures of 5 HD or
      less (range 60 feet, Will DC 18 negates, shaken for 2d10 rounds on a
      successful save). Nonevil creatures, and evil creatures with more than 5
      HD, must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or be shaken for 2d10 rounds. A
      creature that saves against a ghaele's gaze is immune to that particular
      ghaele's gaze for 24 hours. This is a mindaffecting fear effect. The save
      DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Light Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A ghaele can shift between its solid body and one made of light as a
      standard action. In solid form, it cannot fly or use light rays. In light
      form, it can fly and gains the incorporeal quality-it can make light ray
      attacks or use spell-like abilities in this form, but can't make physical
      attacks or cast spells. This ability otherwise functions similarly to a
      bralani's wind form ability.
  - name: Light Ray (Ex)
    description: >-
      A ghaele's light rays have a range of 300 feet. This attack bypasses all
      damage reduction. Spells Ghaeles cast divine spells as 13th-level clerics.
      They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.
Description:
  - >-
    Ghaeles are the most knightly of the azatas, hunting fiends, dragons, and
    undead with equal vigor. Most appear like idealized humans or elves and are
    quick to smile-and equally quick to strike against those they perceive as
    wicked.
