Description:
  - >-
    The great mastodons are primeval cousins of elephants. Their large tusks
    dwarf those of regular elephants, jutting outward and then curving back
    toward one another at the tips. Shaggy woolly mammoths are a mastodon
    variant adapted to cold environments, but have the same statistics.
