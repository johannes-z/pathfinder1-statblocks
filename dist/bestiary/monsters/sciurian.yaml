Description:
  - >-
    Sciurians resemble humanoid squirrels. They are a diminutive, furry folk who
    dwell deep in the forests far from the intrusions of other races. A typical
    sciurian is curious, but also somewhat skittish. They are prone to nervous
    twitching of their tails, and often pause to scan the surrounding area for
    danger. In a comfortable environment, sciurians are amiable creatures and
    enjoy music and celebration.
  - >-
    Sciurian fur ranges from gray to brown to orange-red, and fades to white on
    their bellies. They have bushy, s-shaped tails. Their eyes are large and
    dark, and their rounded ears are situated on the tops of their heads.
    Sciurians have long fingers and toes tipped with claws which enable them to
    climb with startling speed. Sciurians use the claws on their hands and feet
    to climb, so they do not wear any sort of footwear. Magical footwear worn by
    a sciurian becomes open-toed and thus does not hinder her climbing ability.
  - Sciurian Society
  - >-
    Sciurians live in small tribal communities in huts built high in the tops of
    tall trees. The huts are connected by a complex network of narrow walkways,
    rope bridges, and swing-lines. Aside from allowing the sciurians to take
    advantage of their natural abilities as agile climbers, these connections
    also act as defensive barriers for the community, allowing the sciurians to
    freely move about while hampering the movements of invaders. Sciurians are
    territorial, and attempt to drive off any interlopers that stray too close
    to their communities. Sciurian tribes are led by a shaman-chief, elected
    from among the tribe's spell casters. Most shaman-chiefs are divine
    spellcasters, but occasionally an arcane spellcaster or even a rogue with
    magical abilities can be found in the position. Sciurian tribes farm
    nut-producing trees to provide food for their members, augmented by
    ground-level foraging. They store away the excess to provide food through
    harsh winters.
  - >-
    Sciurians relate most easily to elves and gnomes, the former because of the
    elves' love of the natural world, and the latter because of the gnomes' fey
    nature. Humans and dwarves tend to think of sciurians as silly and annoying,
    often overlooking the quiet forest dwellers to their detriment. On those
    occasions when halflings and sciurians meet, there is a mutual respect
    between them due in part to their similarities in size and nature. Half-orcs
    often need to be reminded that sciurians are not food.
  - >-
    Sciurians are fun-loving creatures who enjoy the sights and sounds of the
    forest. Tall trees are near and dear to the hearts of all sciurians. They
    revere the Great Oak, an immense, neutral, treant-like goddess who is all
    things: provider, teacher, protector, creator, and destroyer.
  - >-
    Young sciurians bored with the day-to-day routines of tree farming and
    foraging often seek adventure in the lands beyond their community. Sciurian
    adventurers tend to be eager to please, hoping to overcome their reputation
    as being flighty tree-hoppers. Unfortunately, their eagerness often leads to
    reinforcing those stereotypes instead. Sciurians are not strong in combat,
    and thus avoid the more combative classes such as barbarian and fighter.
    Most sciurian adventurers are divine spellcasters, rangers, and rogues.
