Description_Visual: >-
  This immense skeletal dragon rears up to its full, towering height, bones
  glowing and shimmering with vile green energy.
Group: Ravener
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 2
IsTemplate: '1'
Description:
  - >-
    Most evil dragons spend their lifetimes coveting and amassing wealth, but
    when the end draws near, some come to realize that all the wealth in the
    world cannot forestall death. Faced with this truth, most dragons vent their
    frustration on the countryside, ravaging the world before their passing. Yet
    some seek a greater solution to the problem and decide instead to linger on,
    hoarding life as they once hoarded gold. These foul wyrms attract the
    attention of dark powers, and through the blackest of necromantic rituals
    are transformed into undead dragons known as raveners.
  - >-
    Although its body quickly rots away, a ravener does not care for the needs
    of the flesh. It seeks only to consume life, be it from wild animals,
    would-be dragonslayers, or even other dragons. A ravener is often on the
    move, changing lairs frequently as its territories become devoid of life.
  - >-
    The ravener presented here is built from a red dragon wyrm. See page 98 of
    the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary for rules on this monster's fire aura,
    manipulate flames, melt stone, and smoke vision abilities.
  - >-
    Creating a Ravener "Ravener" is an acquired template that can be added to
    any evil true dragon of an age category of ancient or older (referred to
    hereafter as the base creature). A ravener retains all the base creature's
    statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
  - 'CR: Same as the base creature +2.'
  - 'Alignment: Any evil.'
  - >-
    Type: The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate BAB, saves,
    or skill ranks. It keeps any subtypes possessed by the base creature.
  - >-
    Senses: A ravener's darkvision increases to 240 feet, and its blindsense
    increases to 120 feet.
  - >-
    Armor Class: A ravener gains a def lection bonus to its AC equal to half its
    Charisma bonus (minimum +1).
  - >-
    Hit Dice: Change all of the base creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit
    Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As an undead, a ravener
    uses its Charisma to determine bonus hit points instead of its Constitution.
  - >-
    Saving Throws: As undead, a ravener uses its Charisma modifier on Fortitude
    saves (instead of Constitution).
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: A ravener gains channel resistance +4 and all of the
    immunities derived from undead traits.
  - >-
    Its damage reduction changes from DR/magic to DR/ good. A ravener also gains
    the following ability.
  - >-
    Soul Ward (Su): An intangible field of siphoned soul energy protects a
    ravener from destruction. This ward has a maximum number of hit points equal
    to twice the ravener's Hit Dice, but starts at half this amount.
  - >-
    Whenever a ravener would be reduced below 1 hit point, all damage in excess
    of that which would reduce it to 1 hit point is instead dealt to its soul
    ward. If this damage reduces the soul ward to fewer than 0 hit points, the
    ravener is destroyed.
  - >-
    Attacks: A ravener retains all of the natural attacks of the base creature,
    but each of these attacks threatens a critical hit on a 19 or 20. Feats like
    Improved Critical can increase this range further. If the ravener scores a
    critical hit with a natural weapon, the target gains 1 negative level.
  - >-
    The DC to remove this negative level is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ravener's Hit
    Dice + the ravener's Charisma modifier.
  - >-
    Whenever a creature gains a negative level in this way, the ravener adds 5
    points to its soul ward.
  - >-
    Special Attacks: A ravener retains all of the special attacks of the base
    creature and gains the following special attacks as described below. All
    save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the ravener's HD + the ravener's Charisma
    modifier.
  - >-
    Breath Weapon (Su): A ravener keeps the breath weapon of the base creature-
    the save DC for this breath weapon is now Charisma-based. In addition, a
    ravener's breath weapon bestows 2 negative levels on all creatures in the
    area. A successful Ref lex save halves the damage and reduces the energy
    drain to 1 negative level. The save DC to remove these negative levels is
    equal to the ravener's breath weapon DC. The ravener adds 1 hit point to its
    soul ward ability for each negative level bestowed in this way.
  - >-
    Cowering Fear (Su): Any creature shaken by the ravener's frightful presence
    is cowering instead of shaken for the first round of the effect, and shaken
    for the rest of the duration. Any creature that is frightened by its
    frightful presence is instead cowering for the duration.
  - >-
    Soul Consumption (Su): When a living creature within 30 feet of a ravener
    dies, that creature's soul is torn from its body and pulled into the
    ravener's maw if the dying creature fails a Will save (DC equals the save DC
    of the ravener's breath weapon). This adds a number of hit points to the
    ravener's soul ward equal to the dead creature's Hit Dice. Creatures that
    have their souls consumed in this way can only be brought back to life
    through miracle, true resurrection, or wish.
  - >-
    Soul Magic (Sp): A ravener retains the base creature's spellcasting
    capability, adding three levels to the base creature's caster level. This
    increases the number of spells known by the ravener, but the ravener loses
    all spell slots.
  - >-
    Instead, whenever the ravener wishes to cast any one of its spells known, it
    consumes a number of hit points from its soul ward equal to the spell slot
    level necessary to cast the spell (including increased levels for metamagic
    feats and so on). If the soul ward has insufficient hit points, the ravener
    cannot cast that spell. Casting a spell that reduces its soul ward to
    exactly 0 hit points does not harm the ravener (though most are not
    comfortable without this buffer of soul-energy and try to replenish it
    quickly).
  - >-
    Abilities: Str +4, Int +4, Wis +4, Cha +6. Being undead, a ravener has no
    Constitution score.
  - >-
    Skills: A ravener has a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate, Perception, and
    Stealth checks. The ravener's class skills are otherwise the same as those
    of the base creature.
