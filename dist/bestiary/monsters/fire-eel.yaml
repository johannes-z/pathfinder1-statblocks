    description: >-
      A fire eel constantly secretes highly flammable oil from its body. Upon
      contact with the air, the oil bursts into flames. The oil normally burns
      for 1 minute before extinguishing itself. Anyone contacting the burning
      oil takes 3d6 points of fire damage. Underwater, a fire eel can release
      this oil quickly (as a swift action) in a 10-foot radius around its body.
      The oil automatically ignites at the start of the fire eel's next turn. It
      deals the same fire damage as above, but only burns for 5 rounds
      underwater. A fire eel can ignite its oil once per minute in this way.
Description:
  - >-
    Fire eels are a beautiful but dangerous species of aquatic beast that
    secrete and can ignite an oily residue on their skin to drive away predators
    and attract a mate. The flames emitted by a fire eel can be green, blue,
    red, or violet, or even a pattern of these colors, depending on the
    individual eel. Fire eels can be particularly dangerous to seagoing vessels
    during their mating season, when they come to the surface en masse to
    perform fiery courtship rituals, and are more aggressive than usual.
  - >-
    Fire eels are at home in both saltwater and freshwater, and live in groups
    of up to 10 eels. A fire eel lair consists of a number of long and winding
    tunnels burrowed into sand, rocks, or mud in shallow water. These tunnels
    eventually empty into a large central chamber. Fire eels, normally
    non-aggressive, become highly aggressive if their lair is threatened.
  - >-
    Fire eels are normally inoffensive, and avoid combat if possible. However,
    if they are attacked, grabbed, or if it is their mating season, they become
    more aggressive, and use their fire shroud to ward off attacks while they
    bite relentlessly until their opponents are driven away.
