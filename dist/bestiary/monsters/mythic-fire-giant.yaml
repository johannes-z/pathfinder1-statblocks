SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Choking Ash (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature that starts its turn in the giant's aura is nauseated for 1
      round (Fortitude DC 23 negates). The ash provides the giant with 50%
      concealment against ranged attacks. Strong wind or fire-quenching magic
      disperse it for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Fire Vortex (Su)
    description: >-
      A mythic fire giant can expend one use of mythic power to create a vortex
      of fire within 30 feet. The vortex is 5 feet wide at its base, 15 feet
      wide at the top, and 30 feet tall. Any creature starting its turn adjacent
      to the vortex takes 6d6 points of fire damage, and any creature passing
      through it takes 15d6 fire damage. A successful DC 23 Reflex saving throw
      halves this damage. The fire giant can move the vortex up to 20 feet as a
      move action. If the vortex moves through a creature, that creature must
      succeed at a saving throw against the vortex to avoid taking damage. The
      vortex lasts for 5 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Lava Weapons (Su)
    description: >-
      All melee and ranged attacks made by the fire giant deal an additional 4d6
      points of fire damage. This ability replaces the heated rock ability of
      non-mythic fire giants.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic fire giant burns like the heart of a volcano. Wielding weapons of
    flame and ash, it brands enemies with its fury and strength.
