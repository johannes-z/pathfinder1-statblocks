Description:
  - >-
    A devilbound creature has made a bargain with a devil, promising a service
    and its soul in exchange for infernal power. The specif ic service depends
    on the devil's type and motivations, but always furthers the interests of
    Hell.
  - CREATING A DEVILBOUND CREATURE
  - >-
    "Devilbound creature" is an acquired template that can be added to any
    creature with 5 or more Hit Dice and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
    scores of 3 or higher (referred to hereafter as the base creature). The
    creature retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities
    except as noted here.
  - 'CR: Same as the base creature +1.'
  - >-
    Alignment: Any evil. A devilbound creature radiates an evil aura as if it
    were an evil outsider.
  - >-
    Senses: A devilbound creature gains darkvision 60 ft. and the see in
    darkness ability.
  - 'Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +4.'
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: A devilbound creature gains a +4 bonus on saving throws
    against poison, resist fire 30, and regeneration 5 (good spells, good
    weapons).
  - 'Weaknesses: The devil-bound creature gains the following weakness.'
  - >-
    Contract Bound (Ex): The creature has signed a contract of service in return
    for this template. The devil must reveal its nature as a creature of Hell
    when it offers a contract, and it can't hide the details of the contract in
    any way. The creature must enter the agreement willingly (without magical
    compulsion). Usually the creature must perform one or more tasks for the
    devil, and in exchange the creature gains the template's abilities, whether
    immediately, after a specific amount of time, or once the tasks are
    completed. The contract always includes a clause that damns the creature's
    soul to Hell when the creature dies, with credit for the act and possession
    of the soul going to the devil signing the contract. When the creature dies,
    its soul is automatically imprisoned in a gem, which immediately appears in
    Hell as one of the devil's belongings. If the devil is dead when the
    creature dies, the creature's soul is destroyed, and can't be restored to
    life except by miracle or wish. If the creature fails to perform the tasks
    in the allotted time, its soul is still damned and the devil is not
    obligated to provide the promised abilities. Many contracts state that the
    devil, its agents, and its allies will not attempt to kill the creature.
    This doesn't protect against all devils, but does offer the creature a
    measure of protection against treachery from the signatory devil. Breaking a
    contract with a devil is difficult and dangerous. Furthermore, as long as
    the contract remains in effect, a slain victim can't be restored to life
    after death except by a miracle or wish. If the devilbound creature is
    restored to life, the devil immediately senses the name and location (as
    discern location) of the creature responsible.
  - >-
    Special Attacks: The creature gains the summon universal monster ability and
    can summon a devil once per day with a 100% chance of success. The devil
    remains for 1 hour. The creature's caster level or Hit Dice, whichever is
    higher, determines the most powerful kind of devil it can summon and the
    effective spell level of this ability, according to the following table.

    Caster Level Devil Spell Level 3rd Lemure 2nd 9th Bearded devil 5th 11th
    Erinyes 6th 13th Bone devil 7th 15th Barbed devil 8th 17th Ice devil 9th
  - >-
    Spell-Like Abilities: The creature gains the following spell-like abilities,
    depending on the kind of devil it is bound to. The creature uses its Hit
    Dice or caster level, whichever is higher, as the caster level for its
    spell-like abilities. Save DCs are based on the creature's Intelligence,
    Wisdom, or Charisma, whichever is highest.
