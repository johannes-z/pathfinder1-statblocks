SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sleep (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature struck by a sandman must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be
      affected as though by a sleep spell (caster level 8th). There is no limit
      to the number of Hit Dice a sandman can affect with this aura. The save DC
      is Charisma-based. Creatures attacking a sandman unarmed or with natural
      attacks are also subject to this special attack.
  - name: Sleep Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A sandman can radiate a 20-foot-radius sleep aura as a free action. A
      creature in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be affected as
      though by a sleep spell (caster level 8th). There is no limit to the
      number of Hit Dice a sandman can affect with this aura. A creature that
      successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same sandman's sleep
      aura for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Protection from Arrows (Su)
    description: >-
      A sandman is protected by a permanent protection from arrows effect (as
      the spell) that grants it damage reduction 10/magic against ranged
      weapons. This ability is inherent and cannot be dispelled.
Description:
  - Sandmen are silicate creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth.
  - >-
    Their purpose on the Material Plane is unknown, but spellcasters often
    summon them when they want to protect someone or something. Though sandmen
    have evil tendencies many willingly serve summoners of other alignments.
    Sandmen have an immense dislike for humans (reasons unknown) and attack them
    on sight-human spellcasters take heed when employing their services! A
    sandman attacks its opponent by pummeling it with its fists, though it
    prefers to avoid combat if possible. Given the chance, a sandman attempts to
    put an opponent to sleep rather than kill it. A sleeping creature is left to
    its own devices; a sandman does not further attack a creature it puts to
    sleep. Sleeping creatures are often carried to the sandman's master where
    they are enslaved or worse.
