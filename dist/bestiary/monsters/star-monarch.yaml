SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dreamwarden (Su)
    description: >-
      Any sleeping creature within 30 feet of a star monarch is protected by
      protection from evil and sanctuary (Will DC 15 negates). The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Glowsap (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a star monarch can spray a target within 30 feet
      with an adhesive spittle as a ranged touch attack. A creature struck is
      affected as a tanglefoot bag (Reflex DC 20 partial; see Core Rulebook
      160). In addition, this adhesive glows under starlight or moonlight,
      limning the target as faerie fire if used outdoors at night. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Navigational Awareness (Ex)
    description: >-
      Star monarchs never become lost and are immune to maze spells or any
      effect that would cause them to lose their sense of direction.
  - name: Starflight (Su)
    description: >-
      A star monarch can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through
      space at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip
      within a single solar system should take 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond
      should take 3d20 days (or more, at the GM's discretion).
  - name: Toxic Flesh (Ex)
    description: >-
      A star monarch's flesh is poisonous. A creature biting it or ingesting any
      part of its body becomes sickened for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC 20 negates)
      and is affected as if it had consumed a dose of arsenic (Core Rulebook
      558).
Description:
  - >-
    Star monarchs are magical emissaries of Desna, the guide and protector of
    those who wander and guardian of dreams. They fly in glowing clouds through
    the void of space, visiting Golarion to watch over the faithful of Desna.
    Star monarchs spin streamers of sticky silver, weaving evanescent gossamer
    cocoons to enrobe those who slumber under their protection. These cocoons
    sublimate into wisps of half-remembered dreams with the coming of dawn. Star
    monarchs rarely intervene directly in combat, more often helping good
    creatures by aiding them from the shadows, guiding their paths, or guarding
    them while they sleep. Star monarchs can be found across Golarion in a
    variety of iridescent hues, and all are sacred to followers of the Song of
    the Spheres.
