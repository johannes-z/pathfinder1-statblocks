Description:
  - >-
    Wood giants are peaceful, good-natured giants found in the forested areas of
    the world. The average wood giant stands 9 feet tall, weighs 900 pounds, and
    resembles a large wood elf. Wood giants have large heads and prominent jaws;
    their elf-like ears sit high on their long, oval heads. Most wood giants
    (particularly males) are bald. Their skin is usually brownish-green. Wood
    giants dress in greens or browns and prefer neutral colors to the bright or
    dull colors of other races. Wood giants can live to be 400 years old. Wood
    giants are on friendly terms with most benign creatures of the forest,
    particularly wood elves. Though contact outside their immediate clan is
    rare, they do occasionally have dealings with nearby tribes of wood elves.
    Wood giant villages are large and open expanses of land with few if any
    buildings or shelters. Wood giants prefer to spend their time under the
    warmth of the day and the serenity of the night. They do not associate
    with-and usually attack on sight-evil forest creatures. Wood giants usually
    attack from ambush, hiding in dense undergrowth and firing at their prey
    with their bows before closing to melee with their greatswords. Wood Giant
