Description:
  - >-
    A guardian spirit is bound to the fate of a mortal being (called its
    "ward"). This bond may be formed by any number of beings or events carrying
    the weight of destiny, such as deities, the Eldest, norns, and mythic
    creatures and magic. A spirit can bind itself willingly if it believes that
    doing so is likely to further its agenda, give it more power, or allow it
    access to the world of mortals. Mortals can generally invoke a guardian
    spirit only with summoning and calling spells.
  - Creating a Guardian Spirit
  - >-
    "Guardian spirit" is an acquired template that can be added to any fey or
    outsider that qualifies to become a familiar through the Improved Familiar
    feat (this template does not make it a familiar, however). A guardian spirit
    uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as
    noted here. A guardian spirit has a rune on its forehead similar to that on
    an eidolon (though its ward does not gain a matching rune).
  - >-
    CR: The guardian spirit's CR increases based on the level of spell used to
    summon it, as noted on the Conjured Guardian table on page 27.
  - >-
    Armor Class: The guardian spirit's natural armor bonus increases based on
    the level of spell used to summon it, as noted on the Conjured Guardian
    table.
  - >-
    Hit Dice: The guardian spirit's Hit Dice increase based on the level of
    spell used to summon it, as noted on the Conjured Guardian table. It gains
    appropriate skill points, feats, ability score increases, base attack bonus,
    and base saving throw advancements for its increased Hit Dice.
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: The guardian spirit has an amount of spell resistance
    equal to 11 + its CR unless the base creature's SR was higher.
  - >-
    Ability Scores: The guardian spirit's Charisma score becomes 18 unless the
    base creature's Charisma score was higher. Each of the guardian spirit's
    ability scores increases when it's summoned by higher-level spells, as noted
    on the Conjured Guardian table above.
  - >-
    Special Attacks: If the guardian spirit has extraordinary or supernatural
    abilities that deal hit point damage measured in dice, the number of dice
    increases by an amount equal to the level of spell used to conjure it - 3.
    If the ability requires at least a standard action to activate and has an
    instantaneous duration, the damage increases by an additional die.
  - >-
    Special: The guardian spirit gains a smite and additional special abilities
    as noted on the table.
  - >-
    Smite Threat (Su): Once per day as a swift action, the guardian spirit can
    add its Charisma bonus on attack rolls and its HD on damage rolls against a
    foe that currently threatens its ward or has attacked the ward within the
    past 24 hours; this smite persists until the target is dead or the summoning
    of the guardian spirit ends. If the spirit is summoned by a 6th-level spell,
    it can use smite threat an additional time per day, and if the spirit is
    summoned by a 9th-level spell, it can use smite threat a third time per day.
  - >-
    Spell-Like Abilities: A guardian spirit's caster level for its spell-like
    abilities is equal to its Challenge Rating + 1, or to the base creature's
    caster level, whichever is higher. It can cast guidance at will. For every
    spell level of the conjuration spell used to call or summon it (such as
    planar ally, planar binding, or summon monster if the summoner has the
    Summon Guardian Spirit feat), the guardian spirit gains access to one
    additional spell-like ability of the ward's choice from the following list:
  - >-
    Spell Level 3: Chill touch, ill omenAPG, protection from chaos/
    evil/good/law (choose one; its alignment descriptor must oppose the guardian
    spirit's alignment).
  - 'Spell Level 4: Call lightning, detect thoughts, invisibility.'
  - 'Spell Level 5: Cure serious wounds, dispel magic, shout.'
  - 'Spell Level 6: Call lightning storm, death ward, freedom of movement.'
  - 'Spell Level 7: Break enchantment, breath of life, contagious flameAPG.'
  - 'Spell Level 8: Cloak of dreamsAPG, greater heroism, sunbeam.'
  - 'Spell Level 9: Greater shout, power word blind, regenerate.'
  - Each chosen spell-like ability is available once per day.
  - >-
    Fated Guardian (Su): When conjured by a 4th-level or higher spell, a
    guardian spirit can protect the destiny of another creature within 30 feet
    as a standard action once per day. For 1 round, any time the creature makes
    an attack or attempts a saving throw, it rolls twice and takes the better
    result.
  - >-
    Co-Walker (Sp): When conjured by an 8th-level or higher spell, a guardian
    spirit can assume the shape of its ward as if with alter self, except it can
    appear to be only the ward (even if the ward is not of a creature type or
    size that can normally be assumed with alter self ) and it gains a +10 bonus
    on Disguise checks to appear to be the ward.
