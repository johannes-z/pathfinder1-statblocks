Description:
  - >-
    Cousins to dwarves, duergar are foul-tempered creatures that loathe
    intruders to their underground realms-but not nearly as much as they do
    their kinfolk closer to the surface. Duergar dwell in communities deep
    underground, and appear as darker, more twisted versions of their kinder
    kin. Their skin is a dull gray, as though rubbed with dust or ash, but this
    is a natural coloration that better allows them to blend with their
    underground surroundings. They are a race of slavers, but while non-dwarven
    prisoners are usually put to backbreaking work, dwarven prisoners are
    generally slain on the spot. In combat, duergar fire crossbows from a
    distance, then shift to the warhammer after a few rounds. If outnumbered, or
    given sufficient threat (and space), a duergar will use its enlarge person
    ability and begin lashing out at its enemies. Duergar Characters Duergar are
    defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All
    duergar have the following racial traits. +2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, -4
    Charisma: Duergar are hearty and observant, but also stubborn and
    belligerent. Slow and Steady: Duergar have a base speed of 20 feet, but
    their speed is never modified by armor or encumbrance. Darkvision: Duergar
    can see in the dark up to 120 feet. Duergar Immunities: Duergar are immune
    to paralysis, phantasms, and poison. They also gain a +2 racial bonus on
    saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities. Stability: Duergar
    receive a +4 racial bonus to their CMD against bull rush or trip attempts
    while on solid ground. Spell-Like Abilities: Duergar can cast enlarge person
    and invisibility each once per day, using their character level as their
    caster level. Both of these spell-like abilities affect the duergar only.
    Light Sensitivity: Duergar are dazzled as long as they remain in an area of
    bright light. Languages: Duergar begin play speaking Common, Dwarven, and
    Undercommon. Duergar with high Intelligence can choose bonus languages from
    the following: Aklo, Draconic, Giant, Goblin, Orc, Terran.
