SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Chameleon Blend (Ex)
    description: >-
      Skulks have the ability to match their skin coloration to the surrounding
      environment, not unlike a chameleon. This, combined with their natural
      sneakiness, grants them a +15 racial bonus on Stealth checks when hiding,
      but only while the majority of their skin is visible to the naked eye.
      Thus they cannot use this ability while wearing armor or any clothing more
      than a loincloth. Skulks favor wearing cloaks when lurking on the fringes
      of civilized society which they can quickly remove so as to make full use
      of their chameleon blend ability.
  - name: Cowardice (Ex)
    description: >-
      Skulks suffer a -4 penalty to their effective Wisdom against Intimidate
      skill checks and a -4 penalty vs. fear-based spells and effects due to
      their innate cowardice.
  - name: Untrackable (Ex)
    description: >-
      Skulks can pass through forest and subterranean settings almost without a
      trace (double the DC for any tracking attempt).
Description:
  - >-
    Skulks are a race of humanoids that dwell on the fringe of other societies.
    They are a parasitic race-the humanoid equivalent of rats that survive by
    theft, subterfuge, and at times outright murder. Skulks are consummate
    cowards, sneaking into humanoid communities under cover of darkness and
    taking what they desire. Skulks never initiate combat unless there is no
    other option. They prefer to strike from ambush, a tactic aided by their
    chameleon-like ability to change their skin tone. Skulks are cowardly
    opponents, attempting to flee as soon as they are injured or the odds are
    against them. Skulks are approximately human-sized, but are very lightly
    built. They have slender, graceful arms and legs. Skulks have no hair, and
    their eyes are usually pale blue or pink. The grayish skin of a skulk is
    leathery to the touch, but the skulk has the natural ability to vary its
    skin tone to match nearly any environment. A typical skulk stands 6 feet
    tall and weighs 140 pounds. Skulk Society Skulks dwell in small bands or
    family groups, living a nomadic existence as they travel from place to
    place. They move constantly so as not to attract undue attention from local
    militias. A skulk lair will usually be located in an area that is easily
    concealed, such as a cave or forest. Occasionally, skulks will sneak into a
    large city's sewer system and set up a more or less permanent presence
    there, moving their lair from place to place under the city. Skulks remain
    hidden during daylight hours, leaving the safety of their lair to conduct
    forays into the humanoid community under cover of darkness. A favored tactic
    of a skulk band is to sneak into a residence under cover of darkness and
    slaughter the entire family. Once that grisly task is complete, the skulks
    remain to take what they will from the home and leave the following dawn.
    Skulk Characters Skulks favor taking levels of rogue, almost to the
    exclusion of any other class. The rogue's unparalleled competence at
    stealth, ambush, and escape is a role they are perfectly suited for. +4
    Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, -4 Charisma. Skulks are nimble and
    hardy but not very personable. Low-Light Vision: A skulk can see twice as
    far as a human in dim light. Racial Hit Dice: A skulk begins with two levels
    of humanoid, which provide 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +1, and base
    saving throw bonuses of Fort +0, Ref +3, and Will +0. Racial Skills: A
    skulk's humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 2 x (2 + Int
    modifier). Its racial class skills are Perception and Stealth. Skulks gain a
    +15 racial bonus on Stealth checks when hiding due to their chameleon blend
    ability (see above). They suffer a -4 penalty to their effective Wisdom
    against Intimidate skill checks due to their innate cowardice. Saves: Skulks
    have a -4 penalty on all saves against fear spells and effects. Racial
    Feats: A skulk's humanoid levels give it one feat. AC: +1 natural armor
    bonus. Chameleon Blend: See entry. Sneak Attack: See entry. Untrackable: See
    entry. Languages: Skulks begin play speaking Common. Skulks with high
    Intelligence scores can choose from the following languages: Goblin, Orc,
    Sylvan, Undercommon. Credit The Skulk originally appeared in the First
