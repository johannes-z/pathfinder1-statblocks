SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Merope Consumption (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a standard action, a thriae seer can consume a dose
      of merope in order to further tap into her spiritual powers for 1d6+3
      rounds. Starting on the round after she consumes the merope, the thriae
      seer gains an insight bonus to her AC and on damage done with melee
      attacks equal to her Wisdom modifier (+6 for most thriae seers).
  - name: Mind Sting (Su)
    description: >-
      A target stung by a thriae seer becomes confused for 1d4 rounds unless it
      makes a successful DC 21 Will save. This is a mind-affecting effect. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Sought after for their wisdom and guidance as well as their enchanting
    beauty, thriae seers are among the most spiritually gifted members of their
    colony. Their prowess for foretelling the future and deciding upon the
    soundest courses of action in dire situations earns them respect from other
    thriae as well as outsiders from other societies, and seers wield their gift
    with a stoic humbleness. Nonetheless, most seers expect an offering before
    they will grant an audience a divination. These offerings usually consist of
    ornate jewelry and sums of gold, though some seers desire the company of
    humanoid male or female consorts, many of whom gladly oblige the captivating
    seer with their presence.
  - >-
    While their combative abilities mainly comprise their magical powers and
    they appear at first glance to be thin and frail, seers still possess the
    trademark strength and resilience of all thriae.
  - >-
    Thriae seers spend most of their time meditating in one of the many chambers
    in the colony's hive dedicated to such activities. Consuming large amounts
    of their queen's merope to enhance their powers of divination, seers ponder
    the best solutions to their colony's problems, and often act as a sort of
    spiritual political council for the queen. If a particularly wealthy group
    of outsiders has sought the counsel of several thriae seers, this council of
    prophetesses will combine their powers in order to read a difficult
    divination.
  - >-
    Thriae seers are 6 feet from head to toe and weigh 150 pounds. The thriae
    seer presented here represents the least of her kind. Many thriae seers take
    levels of monk or rogue so as to be even more adept at protecting their
    queen. Thriae oracles and sorcerers are also relatively common-such thriae
    are particularly valued by their hive for their magical abilities.
