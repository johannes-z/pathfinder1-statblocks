SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Magma Tomb (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a great wyrm magma dragon can spit lava onto a target within
      120 feet, dealing damage normally for its breath weapon. This magma cools
      instantly-it does not continue doing damage at this point but does entrap
      the victim (see universal monster rules in appendix; DC equals the
      dragon's breath weapon save DC, 3d6 minutes, hardness 8, hp 45).
  - name: Magma Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, an ancient or older magma dragon can breathe a cone
      of lava instead of fire. The damage is unchanged, but the magma clings to
      those it damages, dealing half damage each round thereafter for 1d3
      rounds. After this magma cools, it crumbles to dust. Spell-Like
  - name: Abilities (Sp)
    description: >-
      A magma dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will
      (unless indicated otherwise) on reaching the listed age category. Very
      young-burning hands; Juvenile-scorching ray; Adult- wall of fire; Old-fire
      shield (warm shield, constant); Ancient-delayed blast fireball (3/day);
      Great wyrm-wall of lava*.
  - name: Superheated (Su)
    description: >-
      At young age and older, a magma dragon's bite attack deals additional fire
      damage equal to its age category.
Description:
  - >-
    Temperamental and prone to violent outbursts, magma dragons are regarded by
    most other dragons as dangerously insane-an assumption that, more often than
    not, proves correct. One can rarely predict a magma dragon's state of mind
    until it either attacks or attempts to engage in conversation. For their
    part, magma dragons can justify all of their actions-they just rarely feel
    the need to do so.
