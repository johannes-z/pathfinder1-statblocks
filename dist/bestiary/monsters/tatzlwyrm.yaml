SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison Gasp (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tatzlwyrm's breath contains a poisonous vapor. While grappling, instead
      of making a bite or rake attack, a tatzlwyrm can breathe poison into its
      victim's face. A tatzlwyrm must begin its turn grappling to use this
      ability-it can't begin a grapple and use its poison gasp in the same turn.
      Tatzlwyrm poison: Breath-inhaled; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 2
      rounds; effect 1d2 Str damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Tatzlwyrms are thought to be primeval relatives of true dragons, having
    branched off the line millennia ago and evolved in a way that sets them
    notably apart. Undersized compared to their larger cousins, tatzlwyrms are
    nonetheless ferocious in their own right. And while tatzlwyrms are hardly
    impressive specimens when put beside their notorious relatives, most other
    reptiles can't compare to them mentally. They understand Draconic, though
    other languages are beyond most tatzlwyrms' limited comprehension.
    Nevertheless, tatzlwyrms are deeply cunning, building complex lairs and
    rudimentary traps.
  - >-
    Tatzlwyrms are quite rare, and only a few particularly curious and lucky
    adventurers can claim to have seen a living specimen. Reports do agree on
    some basic features, however. About the size of a full-grown human,
    tatzlwyrms have only two limbs and no wings, and possess a weak poisonous
    breath similar to the breath weapons of their true dragon relatives. An
    adult tatzlwyrm is 6 to 8 feet long, including its winding, organless tail,
    and it weighs between 400 and 500 pounds. A tatzlwyrm's scales give the
    creature limited camouf lage, ranging through various shades of green,
    brown, and gray.
  - >-
    Like true dragons, tatzlwyrms are strict carnivores. They spend most of
    their time hiding, waiting to attack any prey that ventures too near. They
    consume their food slowly in the dark security and seclusion of their lairs.
    Tatzlwyrms have a remarkable knack for ambush and camouf lage.
