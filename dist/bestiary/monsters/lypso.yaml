SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Command Elementals (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an elemental lord can attempt to gain control of any
      elemental creature of the same element within 100 feet. Elementals receive
      a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10
      + 1/2 the elemental lord's + its Charisma modifier. Elementals that make
      their save are immune to the command of that elemental lord for one day.
      Elementals that fail their saves fall under the elemental lord's control,
      obeying its commands to the best of their ability. An elemental lord does
      not need to concentrate to maintain control over commanded elementals.
      Once commanded, an elemental serves until either it dies, the elemental
      lord dies, the elemental lord dismisses it, or the summoning magic ends
      (if the elemental was summoned). An elemental lord can command any number
      of elementals, so long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed twice the
      elemental lord's Hit Dice. If an elemental creature is under the control
      of another creature, the elemental lord can attempt an opposed Charisma
      check to gain control of the elemental.
  - name: Drench (Ex)
    description: >-
      Lypso's touch puts out nonmagical flames of Large size or smaller. He can
      dispel magical fire he touches as dispel magic (CL 20th).
  - name: Vortex (Su)
    description: >-
      Lypso can create a whirlpool as a standard action, at will. This ability
      functions identically to the whirlwind special attack, but can only form
      underwater and cannot leave the water.
  - name: Water Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Lypso gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both he and his
      opponent are touching water. If the opponent or Lypso is touching the
      ground, Lypso takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These
      modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether Lypso is
      initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.
Description:
  - >-
    Lypso rules over water elementals and those who call the Plane of Water
    home. His lair is a massive cavern deep within the Plane of Water. His court
    consists of water elementals, water weirds, and marid. His most trusted
    advisor is a marid of ancient age and power. Lypso keeps an "aviary" of
    water mephitis for his amusement as well. Legends tell of a great enmity
    between Lypso and Inder, the Lord of Fire Elementals, and that a great
    elemental war is brewing between the two. This same legend reveals that
    Lypso and Inder are brothers. Whether this is truth or not is currently
    unknown.
  - >-
    In combat, Lypso uses his vortex attack and horrid wilting attack to begin
    battle. Creatures that survive are subjected to his ice storm ability as
    well as a pummeling by his powerful slam attacks. If outclassed, Lypso
    summons water creatures, or a small army of sahuagin to his aid.
