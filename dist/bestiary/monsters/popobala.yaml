SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)

      A popobala loses its frightful presence, popobala fever, and stench
      abilities when not in its true form.
  - name: Harvester of Sorrow (Su)
    description: >-
      A popobala heals as a result of the suffering of others. It gains fast
      healing 10 if at least one creature within 15 feet has one or more of the
      following conditions: confused, cowering, dying, exhausted, fatigued,
      frightened, nauseated, panicked, shaken, sickened, staggered, or stunned.
  - name: Horrid Haunting (Su)
    description: >-
      A popobala may use ghost sound or ventriloquism as a free action whenever
      it manipulates a creature or object with animate objects, dominate person,
      or telekinesis. The ghost sound or ventriloquism originates from the
      controlled object or creature.
  - name: Popobala Fever (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature wounded by a popobala's talons becomes sickened for 1d6 minutes
      unless it makes a DC 25 Fortitude save. A creature already sickened by the
      fever becomes nauseated for 1d6 rounds. One already nauseated by the fever
      is helpless for 1d6 rounds. This is a disease effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The popobala is a much-feared shapeshifter that haunts and hunts warm
    coastal lands, roaming night and day to terrorize and spread anarchy and
    unrest while slaking its insatiable twin urges for violence and prurience.
    Shifting freely between bat, human, and its natural form, the popobala is
    most dreaded for its mesmeric charms, but it is more than capable of
    engaging in savage bloodletting against those who anger it. Popobalas are
    attracted to chaos, anarchy, and unrest, as the intensity of emotions and
    uncertainty inf lames its already fierce urges. War, changes of government,
    and religious or ethnic strife or persecution-all of these excite a
    popobala, and if a society remains too settled and stable, the beast is
    never above fomenting unrest through its own predations.
  - >-
    A typical popobala is 5 feet tall with a 12 foot wingspan. It weighs only
    100 pounds.
