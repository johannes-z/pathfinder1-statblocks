      Those hit by Vepar's claw attack must make a successful DC 32 Fortitude
      save or be overcome with bone-numbing cold that deals 1d8 points of
      Dexterity damage. A successful save reduces the ability score damage by
      half. The save DC is Constitution-based. Demonbrand: Vepar's unique weapon
      is a Large +2 trident that can cast magic missiles seven times per day as
      a swift action (CL 15th). Additionally, the wielder can cast waves of
      fatigue once per day (CL 15th).
Description:
  - >-
    Vepar is an Abyssal duke in the service of Dagon, Prince of the Sea. He
    leads 29 battalions of shrroths in service to his master. He is a brooding
    particularly mortals (whose very existence he disdains). His loyalty to
    Dagon is questionable at best, for behind the scenes, Vepar is quietly
    amassing an army of demons to one day lead against his current lord. But for
    now, he waits and serves.
  - >-
    Vepar's citadel, Leviathan's Reach, is built into an underwater mountain
    range that sits several miles below the surface of his watery Abyssal home.
  - >-
    The citadel is guarded by scores of aquatic demons, fiendish merfolk, and
    fiendish tritons, as well as several hundred sahuagin led by a fiendish
    sahuagin 15th-level sorcerer named Anaunon. Most visitors (those that can
    actually reach it) avoid this place.
  - >-
    Vepar resembles a 12-foot tall merman. His upper torso is copperybrown while
    his lower torso and fins are silver and scaled. Vepar's hair is long and
    black, and he usually wears it tied back or braided. His eyes, usually blue
    in color, burn with a silvery fire when he is angered or excited. Under his
    hair, two small copper horns can be seen just above his eyes. Vepar's hands
    end in wicked claws with silvery nails.
  - >-
    Vepar relies on his trident, spell-like abilities, and ability to deal
    ability damage when combating foes. Before entering combat, he often raises
    a storm (using control weather or control winds) to herald his coming,
    though he is just as likely to attack from ambush or surprise as he is to
    "announce" his arrival. He enters combat with unholy aura active and follows
    it closely with ice storm.
