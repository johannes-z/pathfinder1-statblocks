SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Weapon Aptitude (Ex)
    description: >-
      Tabaxis have an instinctive love of weaponry of all kinds, and an innate
      knack for quickly learning to employ them skillfully. This grants them
      proficiency with all simple, martial, and exotic weapons.
Description:
  - >-
    The tabaxi (called cat-people or tigerfolk by some) are a reclusive race of
    feline humanoids that dwell far from settled areas, making their home deep
    in the forests and jungles. They rarely engage in trade or dealings with
    other races, preferring to keep to themselves most of the time. Tabaxis are
    very graceful and catlike in their movements. They resemble humanoids with
    feline characteristics most akin to a tiger. Both hands and feet sport
    vicious claws that can do significant damage when they leap upon their prey.
    Although tabaxis have little use for clothing or other material possessions,
    they have a great fascination for and aptitude with weapons of all kinds,
    learning to employ them with great skill after only a little practice.
    Tabaxis are skilled with using their claws and bite in combat, often
    striking from ambush or a height, pouncing upon their prey and attacking
    with all four claws at once. However, due to their love of weapons many will
    instead employ a hand-held weapon of some kind while in melee, foregoing
    their natural attacks. Tabaxis can still employ their bite as a secondary
    attack if using a weapon, as well as one claw as an offhand attack if the
    hand is free, but they cannot use their grab or rake abilities while doing
    so. A typical tabaxi stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds. Tabaxi
    Society Tabaxis live in small groups called prides deep in jungles and warm
    forests. A typical pride consists of 1-3 each of males, females, and young.
    The females tend to be slightly larger than the males, and typically are the
    dominant members of a pride. They live a nomadic lifestyle, prowling through
    their chosen range and hunting in groups of three to five. They carry little
    in the way of possessions, although they often sport a miscellaneous array
    of weapons wrested from past prey. Unless hungry most tabaxi prides leave
    other intelligent creatures alone, though they may attack if intruders in
    their range bear especially interesting-looking weaponry. Tabaxi Characters
