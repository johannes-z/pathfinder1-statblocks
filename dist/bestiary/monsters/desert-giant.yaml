SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sandwalking (Ex)
    description: >-
      A desert giant travels at full speed across sand, rocky ground, or dust,
      and leaves no trail behind unless it chooses to.
  - name: Scimitar Training (Ex)
    description: >-
      All desert giants are proficient with scimitars, and can wield them as if
      they were light weapons. A desert giant adds its full Strength bonus to
      attacks made with a scimitar wielded in its off hand, and gains a +4 bonus
      to CMD versus disarm and sunder attempts when fighting with a scimitar in
      each hand.
Description:
  - >-
    Desert giants rove the stark and majestic sands, rarely dwelling in
    permanent camps. They roam from oasis to oasis, sleeping beneath the stars
    or in easily dismantled yurts, breaking camp as whim strikes or when food
    sources grow scarce.
  - >-
    Desert giants stand 15 feet tall on average, but have slender builds and
    rarely weigh more than 2,000 pounds, a fact that greatly contributes to
    their grace and speed. The giants favor loose robes with keffiyehs for
    protection from the scouring desert winds, as well as traveling leathers
    worn beneath the robes. They require little water, and are able to survive
    for as long as 2 weeks on food alone. When such goods are available, they
    drink water, milk, and juices in prodigious amounts, but they spurn beer,
    wine, and stronger spirits. The bulk of their diet comes from figs, olives,
    and similar bounty of the oases, supplemented by meat if required. The
    eldest desert giants live as long as 300 years.
  - >-
    Despite their nomadic ways, desert giants guard their territory fiercely,
    driving away all interlopers, whether intelligent or bestial.
