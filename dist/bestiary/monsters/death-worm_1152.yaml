SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Corrosive Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      A death worm's blood can corrode metal on contact. If a creature damages a
      death worm with a piercing or slashing weapon made of metal, the
      creature's blood deals 3d6 points of acid damage to the metal weapon
      (unlike most forms of energy damage, this damage is not halved when
      applied to a metal object, although it does still have to penetrate the
      metal's hardness). The weapon's wielder can halve the damage the weapon
      takes by making a successful DC 17 Reflex save. Creatures made of metal
      that deal slashing or piercing damage to a death worm with a natural
      attack take 3d6 points of acid damage (a DC 17 Reflex save halves this
      damage). The corrosive elements of the blood fade 1 round after it leaves
      the worm's body or the worm dies. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Electrical Jolt (Su)
    description: >-
      A death worm can fire a jolt of electricity from its mouth as a standard
      action. The range increment for this ranged touch attack is 60 feet.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury, or skin-contact; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6
      rounds; effect 1d2 Con damage; cure 2 saves.
  - name: Venomous Skin (Ex)
    description: >-
      A death worm's skin secretes a noxious, waxy substance. This venomous
      sheen poisons any creature that touches a death worm, either by making a
      successful attack with an unarmed strike or natural weapon or with a touch
      attack. A creature that grapples a death worm is also exposed to the
      creature's venomous skin.
Description:
  - >-
    The reclusive death worm is much feared in the deserts, badlands, and
    steppes in which it dwells, for it brings to a battle multiple harrowing
    ways of inf licting death upon its foes-acid, lightning, poison, and its
    ravenous jaws.
  - >-
    The creatures are remarkably good at hiding amid the sands and rocks of
    their favored terrain, and devilishly eff icient at selecting foes that they
    can easily kill. This combination makes stories of these creatures hard to
    conf irm, and in most urban centers, common wisdom is that the tales of
    death worms are fabrications- attempts to impress city folk or
    hallucinations born of too much drink.
  - >-
    A death worm is 15 feet long and weighs 1,200 pounds- although rumors of
    much larger death worms persist.
