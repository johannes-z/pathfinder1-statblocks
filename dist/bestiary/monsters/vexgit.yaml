SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Speedy Sabotage (Su)
    description: >-
      Vexgits are adept at disassembling machinery, reducing even complex
      devices to trash with shocking speed. When using the Disable Device skill,
      these gremlins treat all devices as being one category simpler for the
      purposes of determining how long it takes to use the skill. Thus,
      difficult devices count as tricky, tricky devices count as simple, and
      simple devices can be dismantled as a free action.
  - name: Wrecking Crew (Su)
    description: >-
      A group of up to six vexgits can work together to dismantle a device. This
      ability functions like the aid another action, but a single vexgit can
      receive help from up to five other vexgits, granting it up to a +10 bonus
      on its Disable Device check.
Description:
  - >-
    Maniacally destructive little brutes, vexgits delight in scrapping and
    sabotaging the works of larger races. The larger and more complicated the
    target, the better. While one of these spiteful gremlins might delight in
    trapping someone behind a door with a jammed lock, loosening the wheels on a
    carriage, or sneakily removing all the nails from a small boat, it's when
    groups of vexgits get together that they're truly dangerous. In such
    instances, the portcullis of a vexgit-infested gatehouse turns into a deadly
    weapon, while a clock tower becomes an avalanche of gears waiting to topple.
    Engineers warn apprentices of masterful constructions destroyed by these
    unruly gremlins, with many blaming their greatest failures on such tiny
    saboteurs.
  - >-
    Like most gremlins, vexgits prefer to live underground, but cities and the
    devices they find there fascinate them, often drawing mobs of the dangerous
    fey to sewer tunnels and abandoned warehouses.
  - Vexgits stand 1-1/2 feet tall and weigh approximately 16 pounds.
