SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A clockwork leviathan's breath weapon is a powerful jet of scorching
      steam-it functions equally well above and under water.
  - name: Grind (Ex)
    description: >-
      A clockwork leviathan deals an additional 1d8+16 points of slashing damage
      when it makes a successful grapple check because of the myriad twisting
      gears and churning pistons that make up its jagged underbelly.
  - name: Swallow Whole (Ex)
    description: >-
      A clockwork leviathan's interior is filled with injurious grinding gears
      and superheated water-in addition to taking damage, a swallowed creature
      must hold its breath or risk drowning as long as it remains inside a
      clockwork leviathan's "stomach."
Description:
  - >-
    Clockwork leviathans are equally capable of functioning on land and in
    water. Sailors who are haunted by the memories of these treacherous machines
    need not exaggerate their yarns, for the reality of an aquatic construct
    such as this holds enough terror in its story for even the hardiest of
    seafarers.
  - >-
    A clockwork leviathan's numerous metal plates and links are made of such
    resilient material that they never rust, even after long exposure to the
    briny sea waters that leviathans often patrol.
  - Clockwork leviathans are 25 feet long and weigh just over 3 tons.
