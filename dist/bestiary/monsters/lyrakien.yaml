SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Starlight Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a lyrakien can tap into the
      divine power of Elysium, unleashing a blast of holy starlight in a 5-foot
      burst. All creatures in this area take 1d4 points of holy damage, plus 1
      point for each step their alignment deviates from chaotic good. For
      example, a chaotic neutral or neutral good creature would take 1d4+1
      points of damage, a neutral creature would take 1d4+2 points of damage,
      and a lawful evil creature would take 1d4+4 points of damage. A DC 12
      Reflex save negates this damage. Chaotic good creatures are unaffected by
      this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based. Traveler's
  - name: Friend (Su)
    description: >-
      The performances and company of a lyrakien ease the burden of travel. Once
      per day, a creature may spend a minute listening to a lyrakien's
      performance- doing so removes the effects of exhaustion and fatigue from
      the listener.
Description:
  - >-
    Lyrakien are divine musicians and messengers, mainly in the employ of
    deities of travel and natural wonders. They love to explore and visit
    beautiful places, especially locations with excellent views of rainbows,
    moonlight, and the stars. Whimsical and joyous, they love contests of song,
    dance, and knowledge, and keep journeys happy by distracting their
    companions from weary feet and stale food. Mortals who please them with
    excellent tales and new songs may be rewarded with elaborate maps, forgotten
    shortcuts, or rambling directions to hidden locations that hold lost magic.
  - >-
    Lyrakien are light-hearted creatures, but they are very protective of
    breathtaking natural locations. Often called "glistenwings" by gnomes and
    half lings, lyrakien are frequently mistaken for fey-while they are
    generally friendly with true fey, their origin is the plane of Elysium. Like
    other azatas, they grow restless if they stay in one place too long. A
    chaotic good 7th-level spellcaster can gain a lyrakien as a familiar if she
    has the Improved Familiar feat.
