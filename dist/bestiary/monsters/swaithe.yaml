  - name: Hexes (Su)
    description: >-

  - name: Witchcraft (Su)
    description: >-
      A swaithe can use spell completion and spell trigger items as if it were a
      5th-level witch.
Description:
  - >-
    Dedicated to Lamashtu, the eyeless swaithes are skulking agents of fear and
    unprovoked beast attacks, formed from sinful souls who, in life, used
    animals as tools of violence and murder. Swaithes often lure those who seek
    their aid and advice into falling victim to the darkest secrets of
    demonology and forbidden magic.
  - >-
    If left unsupervised, a swaithe charms animals and drives them toward
    villages, often under the inf luence of rage, further stoking the flames of
    fear and distrust between settlements and the wilderness.
  - >-
    Swaithes prefer stealth and subterfuge to direct confrontation, and these
    foul creatures delight in creating a sense of dread in their prey. Swaithes
    have been known to slip into a village under the cover of night, use their
    slumber hex on lone villagers, leave a grisly token (such as a bloody organ
    or strange twig doll) on its body for the victim to discover later when they
    wake clueless as to why they fell asleep in the first place. They delight in
    later repeating these attacks with strange cackling noises, invisibly
    "haunting" a victim's home at night, and driving the target to paranoia and
    outright panic.
  - >-
    Swaithes can join hag covens and contribute to the coven's cooperative
    magic. Because of its smaller size and weaker power, a swaithe is often
    treated as a little sister or daughter by the rest of the coven. Any coven
    that includes a swaithe can add giant vermin, animal growth, and insect
    plague to the spells the spells they can cast together.
  - >-
    Small and slight, most swaithes stand about 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 50
    pounds.
