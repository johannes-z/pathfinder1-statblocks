  - name: Scorpions (Ex)
    description: >-
      A daraka's body is swarming with thousands of tiny scorpions. Creatures
      attacking a daraka unarmed or with natural weapons are automatically stung
      for 1d6 points of damage and suffer the effects of the scorpion's poison
      (see Poison, above). Alternately, a daraka can sling scorpions from its
      body to a range of 20 feet. This is a standard action that provokes an
      attack of opportunity. A creature hit takes 1d6 points of damage from the
      stinging scorpions and is subjected to their poison. A grappled creature
      is likewise subjected to the stinging of a daraka's scorpions just as if
      it had attacked the daraka unarmed (see above). A daraka has an unlimited
      supply of scorpions. As fast as it uses them, its body generates more.
Description:
  - >-
    Darakas act as guards to the greater demons or as shock troops in the
    demonic armies of the Abyss. Being intelligent, they are often used as
    commanders or leaders, with each daraka having a battalion of minor demons
    at its command.
  - >-
    A daraka's skin is leathery and oily. From a distance greater than 10 feet,
    its body appears to be a mass of writhing flesh. Closer inspection reveals
    thousands of tiny scorpions swarming its flesh. They constantly skitter
    across the daraka's body-into and out of its mouth, ears, and nose. The
    daraka doesn't even seem to notice them.
  - Darakas stand 9 feet tall and weigh 700 pounds.
  - >-
    Darakas aggressively assault any creature that stands in their way. They
    usually open combat by slinging scorpions at their opponents and using chaos
    hammer against lawful-aligned opponents. Against an enemy wizard, a daraka
    uses feeblemind as soon as it can. The remainder of the combat sees the
    daraka slash with its claws and bite with its terrible fangs.
  - >-
    If it can, a daraka likes to grapple a foe and let the scorpions on its body
    bite the grabbed opponent.
  - >-
    A daraka's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as
    chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
    reduction.
