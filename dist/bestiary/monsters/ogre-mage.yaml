Description:
  - >-
    The ogre mage, like all oni, is an evil spirit come to the Material Plane
    and clad in living flesh-in this case, that of a brutish ogre. Ogre mages
    are often found serving as leaders of ogre tribes, yet not all of them seek
    to link their destinies to their less-intelligent kin. Some become lone
    marauders who hold villages hostage, demanding regular tribute in the form
    of gold, food, or maidens, lest they take more than they ask. Oni Traits The
    oni are a diverse race of evil outsiders, of which the ogre mage is the most
    common. Other types of oni exist as well-evil spirits that clothe themselves
    in the flesh of other types of humanoid. The majority of oni are giants,
    with goblinoid, tengu, and reptilian oni being relatively common as well.
    While oni are incredibly varied in their shapes and powers, they still share
    certain traits in common. • Regeneration: All oni regenerate, although the
    rate of regeneration varies. Damage from fire or acid can kill an oni. •
    Change Shape: All oni are shapechangers, but their ability to change shape
    is generally limited to creatures similar in shape to their true form. •
    Native: Oni are native outsiders. As evil spirits clad in mortal humanoid
    flesh, all oni also possess one of the humanoid subtypes-usually giant.
