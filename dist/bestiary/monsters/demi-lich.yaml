SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A demi-lich is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell
      resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently
      against the creature, as noted below. A shatter spell deals 1d6 points of
      damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6), with no saving throw. A power
      word kill spell cast by an ethereal caster deals 50 points of damage to
      the demi-lich if it fails a Fortitude save (DC 19 + caster's relevant
      ability score modifier). Note: power word kill does not normally allow a
      save.) A holy smite spell affects the demi-lich normally. A dispel evil
      spell deals 2d6 points of damage, with no saving throw.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      Unless holy water is poured over the destroyed remains of a demi-lich, the
      creature reforms in 1d10 days with a successful level check (1d20 +
      demi-lich's HD) against DC 16.
  - name: Trap the Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      A demi-lich can trap the souls of up to eight living creatures per day. To
      use this power, it selects any target it can see within 300 feet. The
      target is allowed a DC 22 Fortitude saving throw. If the target makes its
      saving throw, it gains three negative levels (this does not count as a use
      of trap the soul). If the target fails its save, the soul of the target is
      instantly drawn from its body and trapped within one of the gems
      incorporated into the demi-lich's mouth. The gem gleams for 24 hours,
      indicating the captive soul within. The soulless body collapses in a mass
      of corruption and molders in a single round, reduced to dust. If left to
      its own devices, the demi-lich slowly devours the soul over 24 hours-at
      the end of that time the sou l is completely absorbed, and the victim is
      forever gone. If the demi-lich is overcome before the soul is eaten,
      crushing the gem releases the soul, after which time it is free to seek
      the afterlife or be returned to its body by the use of resurrection, true
      resurrection, clone, or miracle. A potential victim protected by a death
      ward spell is not immune to trap the soul, but receives a +5 bonus on its
      Fortitude save and is effective against the level loss on a successful
      save. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Unholy Grace (Su)
    description: >-
      A demi-lich adds its Charisma modifier as a bonus on its saving throws and
      as a profane bonus to its Armor Class.
  - name: Vorpal Susceptibility (Su)
    description: >-
      Vorpal weapons, no matter their enhancement bonus, ignore a demi-lich's DR
      but do only half damage to a demi-lich (demi-liches cannot be beheaded).
Description:
  - >-
    A demi-lich is an advanced lich of great power. When the life force of a
    lich ceases to exist and the material body finally decays (often after
    centuries of undeath), the soul lingers in the area and slowly over time
    possesses all that remains of the lich-its skull. The eye sockets and teeth
    of a demi-lich-possessed skull transform into clear gemstones (each worth
    1,000 gp). The skull contains a single gemstone in each eye socket and six
    gems in place of its teeth. A demi-lich rarely if ever wanders from its
    place of origin (i.e., the final resting place of its body when it was a
    true lich). Content to remain hidden and oblivious to the outside world, a
    demi-lich spends its time contemplating its past life, its accomplishments,
    as yet unachieved goals, and exploring strange mysteries of the cosmos.
    These creatures are solitary by nature and rarely associate with other
    creatures, including other undead, unless it is employing such creatures to
    further some unfinished goal. Demi-lich lairs are usually well-hidden
    dungeons and caverns consisting of winding corridors, deadly pitfalls, and
    intricate traps (some that would even bring a tear to Grimmy's eye). A
    demi-lich appears as a simple humanoid skull seated amid a pile of bones and
    dust. In each eye socket is a single gemstone, and in its mouth, in place of
    its teeth, are six more gemstones. A demi-lich sits idly in its lair until
    touched or bothered at which point it rises vertically and uses its wail of
    the banshee power against the opponent it deems most threatening. On its
    next turn, the demi-lich uses its trap the soul ability against an opponent.
    It spends the remainder of combat alternating between its wail of the
    banshee, bestow curse, and trap the soul abilities. Credit The Demi-Lich
