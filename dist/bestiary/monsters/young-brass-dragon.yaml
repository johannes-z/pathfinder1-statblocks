IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Desert Wind (Su)
    description: >-
      A juvenile or older brass dragon can call up the desert wind to serve him.
      This functions as gust of wind, but any creature in its path must make a
      Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds by the sand. The save DC for
      this effect is equal to the dragon's breath weapon DC.
  - name: Fire Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      An old or older brass dragon is surrounded by an aura of intense heat. All
      creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at
      the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient brass dragon's aura extends
      to 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. A brass dragon can
      suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action.
  - name: Move Sand (Sp)
    description: >-
      A young or older brass dragon can move sand to excavate ruins or hide
      treasures. This functions as move earth, but it only affects sand. The
      dragon uses his HD in place of his caster level for this effect. This is
      equivalent to a 5th-level spell.
  - name: Sandstorm (Su)
    description: >-
      An ancient or older brass dragon can create a powerful sandstorm once per
      day as a full-round action. This storm has a radius of 1 mile and lasts
      for 1 minute per age category of the dragon. This functions as a sandstorm
      (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 431), except that it is also accompanied by
      windstorm-level winds.
  - name: Sleep Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Instead of a line of fire, a brass dragon can breathe a cone of sleep gas.
      Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or fall asleep for
      1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon. Spell-Like
  - name: Abilities (Sp)
    description: >-

      upon reaching the listed age category. Very young-speak with animals;
      Juvenile- endure elements; Adult-suggestion; Old-control winds;
      Ancient-control weather; Great wyrm-whirlwind.
  - name: Summon Djinni (Sp)
    description: >-
      This ability, usable by a great wyrm brass dragon once per day, works like
      a summon monster spell, except that it summons one noble djinni. This
      ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell. Age Category S pecial
      Abilities C aster Level Wyrmling Fire subtype, sleep breath - Very young

    fight. Brass dragons lair near humanoid settlements, where they can hear the
    most recent news and gossip.
