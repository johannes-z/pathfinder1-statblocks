Description_Visual: >-
  A horrific creature steps forth, its body that of a great gray wolf and its
  head resembling a tremendous falcon covered with light brown feathers.  It
  sits poised to pounce, gnashing its great black, razor-sharp beak.

Description:
  - >-
    When the sound of a falcon's shriek and a wolf's howl mixed together pierce
    the night air, chances are good that a solitary or pack of ronus are nearby
    and just about to strike. Turning and running only incites the pack for they
    know that no normal creature can outrun them (without the aid of magic).
  - >-
    Ronus always hunt in large packs. A solitary encounter with a ronus is
    almost unheard of. In such events, the creature encountered is most
    certainly injured, sick, or old. Such a creature will not attack, unless
    provoked and only fights to defend itself.
  - >-
    Ronus live by hunting and are carnivorous monsters. They will eat just about
    anything from mice to rabbits to goblins to ogres; anything they can catch
    and kill. Prey is attacked quickly and dispersed as quickly as possible
    before it has a chance to get its bearings and mount an attack against the
    ronus pack. Kills are eaten where they fall. The pack ravenously devours
    most of the meat, but do not pick the bones clean.
  - >-
    Area scavengers appreciate this and some actually follow a ronus pack
    waiting for its chance to eat.
  - >-
    Ronus packs build their lairs in hard to find areas and often use leaves,
    fallen trees, and broken tree limbs to camouflage the lair. Ronus are social
    creatures and a lair typically contains 1-4 packs. If young are present,
    there will be 2d4 of them; they are noncombatants.
  - Ronus are fast and use their quickness to their advantage when hunting.
  - >-
    They often sight their prey from a great distance and rely on their closing
    speed to catch it before it notices the ronus and has a chance to flee. Prey
    that tries to escape is run down; very few creatures can outrun a hungry
    ronus.
  - >-
    These creatures also use "flush" tactics to force prey into a trap. For
    example, a pack may chase their prey for a short distance before most of the
    pack seems to break off and give up. One or two continue pursuit, forcing
    the prey to turn this way or that way; in essence, forcing the prey to go
    the way the ronus want it to go. Prey that fall for this tactic often wind
    up face-to-face with the rest of the ronus pack.
