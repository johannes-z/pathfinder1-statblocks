Description_Visual: >-
  This creature looks like a vaguely humanoid figure composed of living shadow.
  White-hot pinpoints of light seem to serve as its eyes. Its arms end in wicked
  claws of shadowstuff and its lower torso trails off into wispy dark shadows.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Charisma Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature hit by a dream spectre's incorporeal touch attack takes 1d4
      points of Charisma damage. At Charisma 0, the victim falls into a
      nightmare-filled coma until at least 1 point of Charisma is restored.
  - name: Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)
    description: A dream spectre caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered.
  - name: Dreamsense (Su)
    description: >-
      A dream spectre can automatically pinpoint the presence of dreams within
      100 feet. This ability only works against sleeping creatures.
      Heart-Stopping
  - name: Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      By revealing its true form to a living creature, a dream spectre instills
      heart-stopping fear in its foe. A creature viewing the dream spectre must
      succeed on a DC 18 Will save or suffer a heart attack and be reduced to 0
      hit points. On the next round the creature drops to -1 hit point and is
      dying. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to
      the heart-stopping fear attack of that dream spectre for one day. This
      ability only functions against creatures that are awake. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Nightmare (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a dream spectre can touch a sleeping creature and
      warp and twist its dreams into violent, chaotic nightmares. An affected
      creature must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or be affected as by a
      nightmare spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Sleep (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a dream spectre can induce sleep in a single
      creature it touches with its incorporeal touch attack. An affected
      creature must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or fall asleep for 1 minute.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Dream spectres have their origins on a dreamscape plane plagued and flooded
    with nightmares. This plane is an ever-changing plane of whirling winds,
    matter, anti-matter, and anything else a dreaming creature injects into the
    realm of dreams. Dream spectres enter the Material Plane through nexus
    points created by dreaming creatures, and once on the Material Plane, they
    use their abilities to attack sleeping and dreaming creatures within their
    immediate area, feeding on a sleeping creature's dream energy. Once sated, a
    dream spectre fades into the shadows, only to return the next night. A dream
    spectre often haunts the same creature night after night until that creature
    dies or the dream spectre is discovered and flees. Dream spectres look like
    undead shadows and are often mistaken for them. They are not undead, or even
    related to undead, so a cleric's power over such creatures doesn't affect a
    dream spectre. Dream spectres sometimes use this case of mistaken identity
    to their advantage, seeming to retreat in battle all the while waiting for
    an opening to strike the unsuspecting cleric. A dream spectre prefers to
    attack sleeping creatures so it can use its Charisma damaging attack without
    interruption as well as destroy the target's dreams with its nightmare
    ability. A creature that awakens or discovers a dream spectre (such as a
    sentry or guard) is targeted by its sleep attack. Dream spectres attack with
    their incorporeal touch in combat. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
