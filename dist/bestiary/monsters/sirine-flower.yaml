SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Charming Song (Su)
    description: >-
      Sirine flowers emit a soothing and tranquil humming in a 60-foot radius
      that resembles music or birds singing. Those hearing the song must succeed
      on a DC 16 Will save or become captivated by the sound. A creature that
      successfully saves is not subject to the same sirine flower's song for one
      day. A victim under the effects of this ability moves toward the sirine
      flower using the most direct means available. If the path leads them into
      a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature
      receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril.
      Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves.
      A victim within 5 feet of the sirine flower simply stands and offers no
      resistance to the sirine flower's attacks. This effect continues for as
      long as the sirine flower sings and for 1 round thereafter. This is a
      sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based and
      includes a +2 bonus.
  - name: Essence Drain (Su)

      A grabbed creature takes normal damage plus 1d2 points of Intelligence
      damage each round until it escapes.
Description:
  - >-
    Sirine flowers are sentient, slow-moving, flesh-eating, 5-foot tall flowers
    with many thick stalks and leaves. The flower emits a pleasant odor
    noticeable to a range of 30 feet. They are most often found in dense forests
    near other plants where they sit waiting for prey to move within range.
    Typical prey for a sirine flower includes small birds, rodents, and other
    such creatures. Such creatures supply the sirine flower with sustenance for
    a time, but in order to gain the nutrients it needs to sustain it, the
    sirine flower must kill an intelligent creature and feed on its essence.

    The sirine flower typically stands about 5 feet tall from base to the tip of
    its stalks. They can grow to a height of nearly 10 feet, though flowers this
    large are uncommon at best. The base of a sirine flower is a thick,
    leathery, brown-colored sac about 2 feet in diameter, located just beneath
    the surface of the ground. Strong, thick roots grow in all directions from
    the base, reaching lengths of 5 to 6 feet. Above ground, a thick clump of
    leaves grows from the base of the plant. From these leaves a series of 6 to
    10 stalks reach upward. Each stalk is thick, slightly coarse and leathery to
    the touch with many small leaves and flowers growing from it. Flowers are
    red, amber, gold, silver, bronze, purple, or gray. Hidden among the base
    leaves and stalks are the creature's four tendrils which it uses to ensnare
    its prey. The tendrils, like the stalks, are grayish-brown in color.

    The sirine flower begins combat using its charm ability to lure its prey in
    where it can attack with its tendrils. Once an opponent is within range, it
    lashes out, attempting to grab the foe with its tendrils. A grabbed opponent
    is held and drained of its Intelligence until it escapes, is slain, or
    rendered unconscious (and helpless). Unconscious foes are slain and devoured
    by the sirine flower's roots but only if all other attackers have been
    slain, rendered unconscious, or fled. If the sirine flower still faces
    aggressors, it turns its attention to them. Only when all are defeated or
    fled, does the sirine flower digest its meal.
