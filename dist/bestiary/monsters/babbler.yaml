Description:
  - >-
    Babblers have a large, strong tail that keeps them balanced when they stand
    on their hind legs (particularly during combat). Most of their time is spent
    slithering on their stomach in search of prey. The babbler is a carnivore
    and is quite fond of human, elven, and dwarven flesh.
  - A babbler stands about 8 feet tall and weighs around 700 pounds.
  - >-
    A babbler attempts to ambush its opponents by slithering within range and
    then rearing on its hind legs and attacking. In combat, it slashes with its
    claws and snaps with its vicious bite.
