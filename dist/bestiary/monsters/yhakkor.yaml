Description:
  - >-
    Yhakkor are half-bestial, stunted creatures; the result of foul necromantic
    rites merging the essences of ghouls with human slaves. According to lore,
    these creatures are named for their creators, dark and foul necromancers
    from an ancient civilization. Yhakkor are usually found in the employ of
    powerful wizards and necromancers, while others are found prowling ruins,
    and other such places.
  - >-
    Yhakkor are slavering humanoid things, with feral eyes and elongated
    nail-claws. The rituals used in their creation have drained them of much
    intelligence, but greatly increased their strength. Yhakkor might easily be
    mistaken for ghouls, but they are not undead and have none of their
    weaknesses. They remember little of their former human lives. These
    unsavoury creatures prefer a diet of human flesh above all else.
  - >-
    Due to their low intelligence, yhakkor are usually assigned to simple guard
    duty or other menial tasks. A strong-minded individual, such as a wizard, is
    required to control their chaotic nature. Yhakkor seem to understand Common;
    it is unknown if they can actually speak it.
  - >-
    In melee, yhakkor gang up on a single opponent and attempt to tear it to
    pieces with their knife-like claws. Yhakkor tactics consist of attacking a
    foe until it is dead. Combat with yhakkor is always a savage and bloody
    affair.
