SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Sobs (Su)
    description: >-
      All of the voices that an attic whisperer steals linger around it in an
      invisible but audible aura of unnerving childlike whimpers, songs, and
      sobs. Any living creature that enters this area loses the benefit of all
      bardic performances affecting it and takes a -1 penalty on all attack
      rolls, damage rolls, and Will saving throws. The attic whisperer can
      suppress or reactivate its aura as a free action. This aura is a sonic,
      mindaffecting effect.
  - name: Steal Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature bit by an attic whisperer must make a DC 16 Will save or become
      fatigued for 1 hour. A fatigued creature that is bitten is instead
      exhausted for 1 hour, and an exhausted creature falls asleep for 1 hour if
      bitten. The sleeper can only be roused by killing the attic whisperer or
      by using dispel magic, remove curse, or similar effects. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Steal Voice (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature hit by an attic whisperer's touch must make a DC 16 Will save
      or lose its ability to speak for 1 hour. During that time, the creature
      cannot talk, cast spells with verbal components, use auditory bardic
      performances, or use any other ability that requires speech. Once an attic
      whisperer has stolen a creature's voice, it can perfectly mimic that voice
      at any time, even after its victim's voice has returned, and while using
      that voice can speak any languages the victim knew. Those familiar with an
      individual's voice can make a Sense Motive check opposed by the attic
      whisperer's Bluff check to realize a mimicked voice is inauthentic. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    An attic whisperer spawns as the result of a lonely or neglected child's
    death. Rather than animating the body of the dead youth, the creature rises
    from an amalgam of old toys, clothing, dust, and other objects associated
    with the departed-icons of the child's neglect. The widely varying materials
    that fuse together to form these creatures lead to attic whisperers with
    vastly different appearances. Attic whisperers linger in the places where
    they were formed, typically old homes, orphanages, schools, debtors'
    prisons, workhouses, and similar places where children might be discarded.
    When an attic whisperer first forms, it does so without a skull-this does
    not impact the creature's abilities in any way, but it usually seeks out a
    small animal's skull as a form of decoration soon after it manifests.

    An attic whisperers haunts shadowy, forgotten places like old buildings and
    dilapidated institutions, places that were once homes to both young children
    and subtle evils. Hiding in drafty attics and moldy basements, an attic
    whisperer might lie dormant for decades while the quick go about their
    lives-often a scant floor away. The coming of a new child, though, rekindles
    some hope in the creature, its animating spirits motivated by loneliness,
    and ever seeking comfort and companionship. Once an attic whisperer finds a
    potential playmate, it does all it can to ensure it will never be lonely
    again by attempting to lure its friend to it, singing nursery rhymes,
    leaving trails of old toys, or calling out in the stolen voices of other
    children.

    Destroying an attic whisperer reduces it to its component parts, usually
    consisting of dusty junk left to molder in the attics of old houses, though
    a few items, such as china dolls, small lockets, music boxes, precious
    marbles, fine teacups, sculpted metal soldiers, or the like, may have some
    value.
