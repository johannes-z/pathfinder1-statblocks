Description_Visual: >-
  This monster resembles a humanoid dressed in tattered rags. Rotted flesh
  reveals corded muscles and sinew stretched tightly over its skeleton. Hollow
  eye sockets flicker with a hellish glow. Broken and rotted teeth line its
  mouth, and its hands end in wicked claws.

  - name: Reanimation (Su)
    description: >-
      When reduced to 0 hit points or less, a cadaver is not destroyed; rather
      it falls inert and begins the process of reanimating by regaining 1 hit
      point per round. Hit points lost to magical weapons or spells are not
      regained. When the creature reaches its full hit point total (minus damage
      dealt by magical attacks and weapons), it stands up, ready to fight again.
      If the creature is destroyed by channeled positive energy, it cannot
      reanimate. If a cleric casts gentle repose on the cadaver when it is
      reduced to 0 hit points, it cannot reanimate. A bless spell delays the
      reanimation, causing the creature to regain hit points at half the normal
      rate (i.e. 1 hit point every other round).
Description:
  - >-
    Cadavers are the undead skeletal remains of people who have been buried
    alive or given an improper burial (an unmarked grave or mass grave for
    example). They can be found haunting graveyards and cemeteries.
  - >-
    Cadavers are infused with a hatred that rivals many other undead creatures.
    This hatred includes its own existence as well as the existence of all
    living creatures. Thus, the cadaver attacks all creatures it encounters.
  - >-
    They have a distinct hatred for light, but it does not damage them. All
    encounters with cadavers are at night or places cloaked in darkness.
  - >-
    Encounters are most often with a solitary creature. Multiple cadavers do not
    work in concert with each other; being mindless they simply charge into
    combat, killing all creatures they can. Cadavers are sometimes found in the
    employ of greater undead (such as wights or ghasts).
  - >-
    A cadaver attacks by raking with its filthy claws or biting with its sharp,
    disease-infested teeth. They often lie in shallow graves waiting for
    potential victims to wander too close, where they immediately spring to the
    attack, raking and biting until destroyed or until all foes are dead.
