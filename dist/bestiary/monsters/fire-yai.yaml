SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fiery Missile (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a fire yai can launch a bolt of fire from its third
      eye. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment.
  - name: Smoke Form (Sp)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a fire yai can turn into a cloud of smoke. This
      functions like gaseous form, except the cloud has the properties of the
      smoke cloud from a pyrotechnics spell (Fort DC 26 negates the effects of
      the smoke cloud). The fire yai can end this ability as a standard action.
Description:
  - >-
    Fire yai prefer to live in luxury-an orderly and well-built abode is
    essential. Even a lone fire yai prefers to build or inhabit a fortified
    stone dwelling in its territory, and surrounds itself with as many luxuries
    as it can acquire. Vain, greedy, and brutal, fire yai are the most impulsive
    of their kind-several tales tell of clever heroes taunting fire yai to act
    rashly. They rarely let challenges pass uncontested and react quickly to
    squelch any threat to their rule.
  - >-
    While many fire yai seek out tribes of fire giants to infiltrate and rule,
    not all follow this compulsion. Capable of assuming the form of many types
    of humanoid, some fire yai seek to subtly invade and eventually rule entire
    nations of humanoids from within.
  - A fire yai is 16 feet tall and weighs 7,000 pounds.
