  A diaphanous, almost translucent curtain blows on a nonexistent breeze towards
  you. It spreads its folds wide as it approaches as if to envelop you.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Amorphous (Ex)
    description: >-
      Lurking wraiths are immune to precision damage (like sneak attacks) and
      critical hits, and can move through an area as small as one-quarter their
      space without squeezing or one-eighth their space when squeezing.
  - name: Constitution Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures hit by a lurker wraith's buffet attack must succeed on a DC 19
      Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain. On each such
      successful attack, the lurker wraith gains 5 temporary hit points. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      A humanoid slain by either a lurker wraith's Constitution drain or smother
      attack becomes a ghoul in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are not under the command of
      the lurker wraith (which typically ignores them), but they do
      instinctively protect their creator. They do not possess any of the
      abilities they had in life. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as a
      ghast, not a ghoul.
  - name: Smother (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a lurker wraith grapples a target, it continues its Constitution
      drain each round (though the victim is still allowed a save each round).
      In addition it forms an airtight seal around its prey. A grappled target
      cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components and must hold its
      breath (see "Suffocation" in Chapter 13 of the Pathfinder Roleplaying
      Game).
  - name: Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)
    description: A lurker wraith caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered.
Description:
  - >-
    If there is an undead form of the aberrations known as lurkers, this is
    surely it. They have a gauzy appearance and resemble some thin cloth, though
    close inspection reveals they are quite durable and thick with a certain
    translucence. They often disguise themselves as tapestries or curtains in
    order to lure the unwary into their smothering embrace. Sometimes they roll
    themselves up to appear as innocuous bolts of cloth before unfurling and
    revealing the true horror. They tend to lurk in subterranean areas or within
    ruins where they avoid rays of direct sunlight.
  - >-
    A lurker wraith is about 10 feet long by 10 feet wide and approximately 1/4
    inch thick. They weigh less than 50 pounds. Lurker wraiths typically
    disguise themselves as ordinary textiles and then try to attack prey with
    surprise by buffeting them and attempting to smother.
  - >-
    There are often a few stray ghouls lairing near where lurker wraiths dwell -
    past victims that will come to defend their creator.
