SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Drone (Su)
    description: >-
      The sound of a derakni in flight is a mesmerizing, unsettling drone that
      causes confusion in all non-demons who hear the sound. A derakni must fly
      at least 10 feet to activate this ability (which it can do as a free
      action as part of its move action). Any non-demon creature that begins its
      turn within 30 feet of a derakni that moved in this manner on its previous
      turn must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds.
      A creature that makes this save is immune to the drone of that derakni for
      24 hours. Demons are immune to this sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save
      DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite or sting-injury; save Fort DC 21; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds;
      effect 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Deraknis, also known as locust demons, are among Deskari's favorite minions,
    both in the Abyss and in the Worldwound. Great flights of these creatures
    plague the skies above the Wounded Lands in particular, but they can be
    encountered anywhere in the Worldwound. These creatures' leering humanoid
    visages are armored with chitinous plates, and their front feet end in small
    claws that look strangely like human hands. A derakni can use these hands to
    manipulate objects or wield items, but generally eschews using weapons or
    shields entirely.
  - >-
    Often, deraknis are encountered in the vicinity of hives of vescavors
    (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lost Kingdoms 50). Indeed, vescavor swarms
    eagerly serve deraknis as minions, and, save for truly unusual
    circumstances, a derakni never needs to worry about taking damage from or
    being distracted by a vescavor swarm that shares its space. Deraknis
    typically aid in the devastation of large regions, often in preparation for
    the advance of larger demonic armies, and the Worldwound is one of their
    crowning glories.
  - >-
    A derakni is 14 feet long and weighs 1,200 pounds. These wretched demons
    arise from the souls of those who, in life, purposefully engineered
    disasters or aided in their development-particularly souls whose disasters
    resulted in mass famines or droughts.
