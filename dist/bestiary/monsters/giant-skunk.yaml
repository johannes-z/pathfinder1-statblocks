Description:
  - >-
    Much larger than their passive cousins, giant skunks are an aggressive lot.
    Having a greater bulk to maintain, giant skunks feed on creatures beyond
    just grubs and insects, often hunting small mammals and reptiles by night in
    addition to giant versions of insects. While giant skunks are dangerous to
    nearby settlements, farmers find a positive aspect in their presence,
    valuing the creatures' taste for giant insects and other more dangerous
    vermin.
