SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sunlight Petrification (Ex)
    description: >-
      A rock troll that is exposed to natural sunlight is staggered and must
      make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round to resist permanently turning to
      stone. A stone to flesh spell (or similar effect) restores a petrified
      rock troll, but if it remains exposed to sunlight, it must immediately
      start making new Fortitude saves to avoid petrification. Spells like
      sunray or sunburst that create powerful natural sunlight cannot petrify a
      rock troll, but the troll is staggered for 1d4 rounds after being exposed
      to such an effect.
Description:
  - >-
    Rock trolls are relatives of normal trolls and ice trolls, but make their
    lairs far beneath the earth in underground caverns. They rarely venture
    forth from their subterranean lairs, for they have a weakness unknown in
    other troll subspecies-the light of the sun turns them to solid stone. Rock
    trolls have stony skin studded with crystals, but otherwise display typical
    troll characteristics- hunched posture, long arms, a large underbite, and
    powerful regenerative abilities. Because of the crystalline nature of their
    skin, however, rock trolls prove more susceptible to sonic damage than other
    trolls, but they are able to regenerate even wounds dealt by fire. Rock
    trolls are larger and stronger than normal trolls, typically standing 15 to
    16 feet tall in height, and weighing upward of 1,200 pounds.

    Rock trolls are fond of humanoid flesh, but eat whatever food they can get
    their claws on. Most underground creatures go out of their way to avoid rock
    trolls, as the ravenous creatures will eat anything that passes through
    their territory, as long as it is at least marginally edible.
  - >-
    Rock trolls also occasionally eat rocks and minerals, though such fare seems
    to do little to soothe their voracious hungers. Instead, these minerals
    supplement the trolls' diet, strengthening their skin, teeth, and claws.
  - >-
    Deposits of certain crystals seem especially tasty to rock trolls, and a
    rock troll who finds such a collection will often gorge himself on the
    crystalline delicacies.
