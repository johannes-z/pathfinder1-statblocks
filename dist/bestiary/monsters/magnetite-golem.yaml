SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A magnetite golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. • Any spell that deals
      fire damage instead disables a magnetite golem's inescapable grip,
      magnetic disarm, and magnetic field for 1d4 rounds, with no saving throw.
      • A magical attack that deals electricity damage heals 1 point of damage
      for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the
      amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit
      points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A magnetite golem
      receives no saving throw against electricity effects.
  - name: Inescapable Grip (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a magnetite golem hits a metallic creature or a creature wearing
      metal armor with its slam attack, it attempts to grapple the creature as a
      free action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. If a magnetite
      golem successfully grapples such a creature, it partially adheres to the
      golem's body, and the golem needs only one arm to maintain the grapple. In
      these instances, a magnetite golem may still make a single slam attack on
      its turn with its remaining arm.
  - name: Magnetic Disarm (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a magnetite golem hits a creature wielding a metal weapon with
      its slam attack, it attempts to disarm the weapon as a free action that
      doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If the golem successfully disarms
      a metal weapon, the weapon sticks to the golem's magnetic body rather than
      dropping to the ground. The golem is considered to have possession of the
      weapon, and the weapon must be retrieved using a disarm combat maneuver.
  - name: Magnetic Field (Su)
    description: >-
      A magnetite golem is surrounded by a magnetic field, which pulls all
      metallic creatures and objects toward it. At the start of a magnetite
      golem's turn, as a free action that doesn't provoke attacks of
      opportunity, the golem attempts a combat maneuver check against every
      creature within 30 feet that is connected to a piece of metal. Affected
      creatures include (but are not limited to) metallic creatures, creatures
      wearing metal armor, and creatures wielding metal weapons. If the golem
      succeeds at its combat maneuver against a creature, the affected creature
      is pulled 10 feet closer to the golem, and can't move away from the golem
      during its next round. The magnetic field is stronger than gravity, and
      can pull creatures off the ground. This movement doesn't provoke attacks
      of opportunity. Unattended Large or smaller metal objects automatically
      travel toward magnetite golem at a rate of 10 feet per round. This
      magnetism is supernatural in nature and affects all metal objects.
Description:
  - >-
    Though softer than iron golems-upon whom their design is based-and
    problematic in most industrial settings, magnetite golems still prove to be
    useful, specialized constructs for both security and salvage. A magnetite
    golem's humanoid body is made of magnetite, a naturally magnetic mineral. A
    magnetite golem mindlessly obeys its creator's instructions, and, like most
    golems, shrugs off the most devastating magical assaults. To complicate
    matters, a magnetite golem emits a magnetic field, which forcefully pulls
    metallic objects closer-including creatures holding metal weapons or clad in
    metal armor. Once within range, metal-bearing opponents find it difficult to
    pull themselves away. Magnetite golems specialize in grappling and disarming
    creatures that rely on metal equipment.
  - >-
    Magnetite golems are usually about 9 feet tall, and weigh approximately
    1,500 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Magnetite golems prove tricky to build for even experienced golem crafters.
    Because of the sheer amount of magnetite required for their construction,
    these golems must be constructed in specially designed workshops with brass,
    stone, or wooden tools.
  - >-
    While magnetite golems are invaluable in specific circumstances, they are
    equally inconvenient in other instances. Due to the golems' magnetic fields,
    small metal bits constantly fly toward them and cling to their bodies,
    perpetually covering them in metal detritus-chains
  - >-
    fittings, scrap metal, and the occasional tool or weapon. A golem's owner
    must regularly pry off such debris, lest the clinging metal clog the
    construct's joints. Additionally, the golem's magnetic field prohibits using
    any kind of mundane metal objects (like basic tools, locks, or nails)
    nearby. Due to this, wealthy individuals in the market for golems usually
    purchase iron, stone, or wood golems. However, in the rare cases in which a
    magnetite golem is the perfect tool for the job, it proves a devastatingly
    effective weapon.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Magnetite golems have existed on Golarion for many millennia. Explorers
    delving into Thassilonian ruins occasionally come across these hulking
    guardians. In Edasseril, the Thassilonian nation tied to the sin of envy,
    some powerful wizards commanded magnetite golems, and delighted in the
    constructs' ability to seize their foes' prized possessions.
  - >-
    Because of the unique difficulties associated with the crafting of magnetite
    golems, the production of new specimens is a rare event. Only a few
    workshops-such as Magnimar's famous Golemworks or the forges of
    Quantium-have the resources necessary to create these golems.
  - >-
    Most magnetite golems toil as guardians. A few individuals use magnetite
    golems for private security, including particularly wealthy alchemists and
    mages who wish to protect nonmetallic caches of alchemical reagents,
    artwork, spell components, or tomes. A few jealous warlords even protect
    their legendary armor or weapons by attaching them to the backs of magnetite
    golem guardians. For eccentrics who work exclusively with glass, paper, or
    wood, magnetite golems are ideal companions. Magnetite golems are sometimes
    tasked to guard lightly trafficked areas that hold objects of cultural,
    historical, or material value, such as spacious tombs or far-flung
    libraries.
  - >-
    A few paranoid aristocrats and wealthy thieves' guilds station magnetite
    golems at their visitor's entrances, as the inexorable pull of the golems'
    auras reveal even the most thoroughly hidden weapons. Individuals with
    substantial wealth may also station magnetite golems in secret passageways
    leading to their hidden vaults. Even if a magnetite golem fails to notice an
    intruder, its magnetic aura
  - >-
    still pulls the intruder and her metallic gear closer. The thundering crash
    of metal objects striking the golem conveniently alerts other nearby
    guardians.
  - Construction
  - >-
    A magnetite golem's body is sculpted from 1,500 pounds of pure magnetite,
    smelted with rare oils worth 5,000 gp.
