  - name: Multiweapon Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A marilith never takes penalties to her attack roll when fighting with
      multiple weapons.
Description:
  - >-
    The leaders of Abyssal hordes and queens of Abyssal nations, the dreaded
    mariliths serve demon lords as governesses, advisors, and even lovers, yet
    their brilliance as tacticians makes them most sought after as generals and
    commanders of armies. The most powerful mariliths serve no one, and instead
    command ravenous fiendish legions. A marilith is 6 to 9 feet tall and
    measures 20 feet from head to tail tip. It weighs 4,000 pounds. Only the
    most arrogant and proud evil souls, typically those of cruel kings, sadistic
    generals, and exceptionally violent warlords, can trigger the manifestation
    of a marilith.
