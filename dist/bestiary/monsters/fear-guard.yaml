Description_Visual: >-
  This incorporeal entity appears as a hooded humanoid figure clad in flowing
  robes of translucent gray over a suit of ghostly armor. Its facial features
  are a swirl of maddening images, fluctuating between a serene countenance and
  a face twisted into a grimace of horror and fear.

Description:
  - >-
    Fear guards embody evil in its blackest conjuration. They are summoned from
    some unknown place by evil wizards and clerics to guard prized possessions
    or a valued location.
  - >-
    Shrouding themselves in a preternatural darkness, fear guards fight using
    spell-like abilities and their incorporeal touch. If guarding a particular
    location, a fear guard fights until either it is slain or driven away, or
    its opponents are slain or flee. If exposed to natural sunlight, fear guards
    either surround themselves with magical darkness for protection or flee if
    this unsuccessful.
