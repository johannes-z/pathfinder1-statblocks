Description_Visual: >-
  Steel wings like two tower-sized razor blades arc from this mechanized
  horror's back. Each of its four monstrous limbs ends in an implement of
  brutality. Its smoldering aura scorches the air, sizzling and crackling with
  impossible energies that defy reality.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Absorb Good Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      The twisted angelic essence held prisoner inside each devastator allows
      these terrifying war machines to harness the energies most commonly
      employed by their natural enemies. Whenever a creature targets a
      devastator with a spell with the good descriptor, the caster must make a
      successful DC 30 caster level check or the spell is absorbed by the
      devastator and has no effect. If the devastator is in the area of effect
      of such a spell and the caster level check fails, the devastator absorbs
      the entire spell and leaves all other targets unaffected. A devastator
      gains 5 temporary hit points for every spell level of the spell absorbed.
      These temporary hit points disappear after 1 hour.
  - name: Aura of Corruption (Su)
    description: >-
      A devastator emanates an aura that bolsters chaotic evil outsiders. Any
      such creature with 15 or more Hit Dice within 60 feet of a devastator
      gains a +10 enhancement bonus to Strength and Charisma. In addition, the
      creature's spell resistance increases by 5. If such a creature doesn't
      already possess spell resistance, it gains spell resistance equal to 11 +
      its CR.
  - name: Blasphemous Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      Each of a devastator's wicked weapons and its razor-sharp wings are
      treated as +5 unholy weapons that deal bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
      damage and count as chaotic and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage
      reduction.
Description:
  - >-
    Terrifying, cruel machines forged from Abyssal steel, devastators are
    central figures in any demonic host's world-razing armies. These skyscraping
    metal goliaths are capable of driving the mad throngs of demons surrounding
    them to unthinkable feats of savagery and decimating even the mightiest of
    angelic choruses. In an unholy act of supreme irony, devastators derive
    their power from the souls of those goodly outsiders who fall in their
    attacks against the Abyss, and the war machines are capable of transforming
    virtue and piety into corrupt energy that fuels their fury. Few have
    witnessed these massive engines of unfettered chaos and destruction and
    lived to speak of the experience, but those few who have gazed into the maw
    of one of these metal monstrosities are forever changed.
  - >-
    These towering abominations hold a special place in the nightmares of holy
    champions and pure-hearted priests. Faith and the divine favors crusaders
    rely upon in order to squint into the evil gaze of demonkind affords them
    nothing against a devastator, which is capable of absorbing such divine
    energies for its own perverted use. Devastators stand 40 feet tall and weigh
    upwards of 40 tons.

    Said to be one of the demon lord Haagenti's vile creations, devastators were
    built to serve as guardians and war machines for Abyssal hordes. Such a
    construction is no mere tower of metal, however, since the final step in the
    creation of a devastator calls for the battered body of an angel (or other
    powerful good outsider) whose spirit has been shattered and utterly
    corrupted. Such a fallen angel is kept on the brink of death as it is lashed
    to the devastator's dread frame, and when the engine is finally activated,
    any semblance of righteousness is forever drained from the defeated
    celestial's screaming spirit. In this way, a devastator's body acts as both
    a war machine and a brutal cage.
  - >-
    A devastator is painstakingly crafted by hundreds of miserable fiendish
    dretches, and is wrought of strange metals and materials found in only the
    deepest, darkest realms of the Abyss. The angelic soul that fuels the
    construct is the inheritor of an existence of impotent rage, anguish, and
    humiliation. Some reports claim that the innards of a devastator are more
    murderous and gnashing than its fearsome exterior, and the unholy
    ministrations carried out from within the machine defy any mortal definition
    of torture. The ultimate fate of the twisted angel caged within remains a
    mystery. Some scholars suppose the angel must surrender to some sort of
    respite in death. Others whisper fearfully of the unquiet essence that might
    rise from the broken cage of a devastator-an avenging angel that is filled
    with dire hatred for the world and that stalks the souls it once swore to
    protect.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    These sinister machines of pure destruction are all imbued with the
    corrupted life essence of at least one angel-now twisted into a demented
    thing filled with the unwholesome urge to sow ruin and agony among its
    former brethren. Devastators are most often deployed as the guardians of
    important causeways between the Abyss and invaded territory on other worlds,
    but occasionally they are assigned to act as the bodyguards or favored toys
    of particularly powerful demon lords who enjoy having these smoldering
    monstrosities around in case of a holy raid on their stronghold.
  - >-
    When a new Abyssal incursion is launched against a virgin world, a
    devastator usually leads the advance force, wreaking untold havoc and
    redefining destruction for the uninitiated civilizations it touches. Three
    devastators patrol the Worldwound, hunting parties of crusaders and any
    other strike forces that might seek to seal off this rift to the Abyss. Each
    of the three is unique in its appearance and armaments. Those few crusaders
    who have survived encounters with the devastators have invented nicknames to
    better identify them and share intelligence on how to combat or avoid them.
    The Grinning Grinder is the most active and infamous at present, but some
    (clerics especially) fear Faith-Breaker more. The third-Fury Engine-
    terrified crusaders for many years, but it is rumored that the crimson
    devastator was destroyed in a suicidal assault by a chorus of angels some 30
    years ago. Some, however, claim Fury Engine's fate is more involved,
    whispering that the angels captured the devastator and then secreted the
    construct to a remote location on some deserted, lonely plane of existence.
    There, the angels toil tirelessly in hopes of saving the tormented soul of a
    powerful planetar trapped within the devastator's hellish interior.
