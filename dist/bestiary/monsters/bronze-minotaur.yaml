SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bronze minotaur is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted: A magical attack that deals
      electricity damage slows a bronze minotaur (as the slow spell) for three
      rounds with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire damage
      breaks any slow effect on the bronze minotaur and heals one point of
      damage for every three points of damage the attack would otherwise deal.
      If the amount of healing would cause the bronze minotaur to exceed its
      full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A
      bronze minotaur gets no saving throw against fire attacks.
  - name: Breath Fire (Su)
    description: >-
      A bronze minotaur can breathe fire as a free action on the first round of
      combat and every other round thereafter. A bronze minotaur's fiery breath
      shoots from its mouth in a 30 foot cone inflicting 4d6 damage. A DC 17
      Reflex save can reduce the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution
      based.
Description:
  - >-
    Tall, dark and powerfully built, the bronze minotaur is an intimidating
    sight. Standing over 8 feet tall, and weighing nearly 4,000 pounds, it is a
    massive and impressive guardian.
  - >-
    Bronze minotaurs can understand simple commands from their creators. They
    follow these orders unswervingly.
  - Construction

    rare minerals and oils casting at least 10,000 gp.
