    description: >-
      A nue can change into the form of a 10-foot black cloud or back to its
      normal form as a standard action. A nue in cloud form is otherwise treated
      as if under the effects of gaseous form, except that it obscures vision
      like fog cloud.

Description:
  - >-
    This strange creature has the body of a tiger, the head of a fanged monkey,
    and a poisonous viper for a tail. Though some call it a chimera and treat it
    as an exotic specimen of that creature, it is a completely different breed
    of beast.

    Intelligent enough to enjoy cruelty as well as inf licting terror upon its
    prey, a nue delights in toying with its victim before dealing the killing
    blow. Often, a nue will select a target and plague it with nightmares before
    it even attempts an act of violence, wearing down the victim with dreadful
    dreams and phantasmagoric terrors. Once its prey is thoroughly exhausted,
    the nue will finally steal into the victim's sleeping chambers and engage in
    combat, paralyzing its target with its magic and infecting its prey with
    both disease and poison, letting the victim writhe in pain before succumbing
    to death.

    A nue's ghastly appearance in physical form is only made eerier by its
    ability to turn into an inky cloud of darkness. In this guise, a nue can
    hide amongst fog clouds or shadows before emerging as the destructive horror
    it is. By the time a nue crawls forth from the inscrutable black cloud, its
    prey is often too fatigued from its strange night terrors to defend itself.
    The dreams a nue impregnates creatures' minds with varies from victim to
    victim, but all share the trait of an ever-present, foreboding cloud that
    exudes a fierce and palpable sense of malice.

    Some legends suggest that nues are the spirits of children warped into
    twisted forms to spread paranoia, exhaustion, and fear among former friends
    and family. According to these stories, such a cursed child wreaks terror
    upon its friends and relatives until they are all either dead or driven mad
    by fear. Then, the creature moves on, seeking more challenging kills to sate
    its vicious hunger. The greatest joy a nue can feel is snuffing the life of
    a once-strong and proud target that has been brought low by its debilitating
    attacks.
  - A nue is 9 feet long and weighs 600 pounds.
