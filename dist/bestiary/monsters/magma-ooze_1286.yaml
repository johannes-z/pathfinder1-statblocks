SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Lava Body (Ex)
    description: >-
      The magma ooze is formed of molten rock. Whenever a creature strikes a
      magma ooze with a weapon, that weapon takes 4d6 points of fire damage
      unless the attacker makes a DC 19 Fortitude save. Damage caused to weapons
      in this manner is not halved, but hardness does help prevent some of the
      damage dealt. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Vulnerability to Water (Ex)
    description: >-
      A significant amount of water, such as that created by a create water
      spell, the contents of a large bucket, or a blow from a water elemental,
      that strikes a magma ooze forces the creature to make a DC 20 Fortitude
      save to avoid being staggered for 2d4 rounds. A magma ooze that is
      immersed in water must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round (this DC
      increases by +1 each subsequent round) or become petrified, reverting once
      the water is gone.
Description:
  - >-
    Magma oozes are living pools of molten rock. They roam the borders of the
    Plane of Earth and Plane of Fire, and on the Material Plane they sometimes
    arise spontaneously from strange magic, usually in the vicinity of
    volcanoes. Magma oozes avoid water, and if forced into enough of it, they
    become encased in a cooled stony shell, unharmed but immobilized, waiting
    indefinitely until the water retreats.
  - A typical magma ooze grows to 10 feet across and is about 6 inches thick.
  - VARIANT MAGMA OOZES
  - >-
    Differing types of molten stone and the nature of the magic that created
    them can inf luence what types of magma ooze form.
  - >-
    Brimstone: Inf luenced by fiendish energy, brimstone magma oozes stink of
    evil, and the patterns of cooled stone and hot lava on their surfaces
    resemble tortured or demonic faces. They have the fiendish creature simple
    template.
  - >-
    Crystalline: Formed from rock densely laced with rare minerals, crystalline
    magma oozes have hot gases trapped within their bodies. Striking a
    crystalline magma ooze with a non-reach melee weapon causes this gas to
    erupt, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage to the attacking creature.
  - >-
    Poisonous: Whether from toxic metals or magical contamination, these oozes
    are deadly poison in addition to mobile burning death. A poisonous ooze is
    +1 CR.
