  The materials of the building stretch and pull as if made of elastic, taking
  on the form of an earthen figure with thick stony arms, a roughly hewn torso,
  and a chiseled, vaguely humanoid head.

  - name: Integrated Body (Ex)
    description: >-
      An ahkhat has no true body. It instead derives its form from the structure
      it inhabits, emerging from the walls, floors, and ceilings as an extension
      of the structure. An ahkhat cannot manifest from broken areas of a
      structure or separate from the building's surface at any time; it can only
      move within the building materials of the structure it's attuned to. An
      ahkhat occupies the same space as whatever area of the structure it is
      presently manifesting from. If an ahkhat is, for whatever reason, moved 10
      or more feet away from its structure, it takes 1d8 points of damage; at
      the beginning of its next turn, the ahkhat immediately returns to the
      nearest space within its structure as a free action. If an ahkhat is
      killed, its manifested body disappears as it's immediately reabsorbed by
      its attuned structure. When not manifesting from a structure, an ahkhat
      can't be attacked normally, but it is instantly destroyed if 75% of its
      attuned building is destroyed. If an ahkhat's keystone (see the Ahkhat
      Keystones on page 81.) is destroyed, the ahkhat is instantly destroyed.
  - name: Repair Structure (Sp)
    description: >-
      This functions like make whole, except this ability is strictly limited to
      the structure the ahkhat inhabits and permanent fixtures attached to the
      structure. For example, walls, doors, cabinets, and portcullises could be
      repaired with this ability, but not furniture or an adventurer's
      equipment.
  - name: Structural Mobility (Su)
    description: >-
      An ahkhat can move through solid walls, floors, and ceilings of any
      material except metal. Its movement leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor
      does it create any ripples or other signs of its passage. It cannot move
      through significantly damaged or ruined sections of a structure until they
      are repaired. If an area containing an ahkhat is targeted with a passwall
      spell or similar effect, the ahkhat takes 1d8 points of damage and is
      immediately shunted to the nearest available space in its attuned
      structure.
Description:
  - >-
    An ahkhat is an elemental entity that dwells within a single building or
    structure, such as a monument, temple, or manor. The floors and walls of
    this structure are the ahkhat's veins and arteries, and the doors and
    windows of the building are the creature's fingers and toes. An ahkhat
    exists solely to maintain and protect its attuned structure. Far from a mere
    house servant or magical butler, an ahkhat is its structure's consciousness
    incarnate.
  - >-
    Ahkhats are bound to their structures via a special keystone that's
    intrinsically attuned to the ahkhat, and they cannot leave the premises of
    their own volition. Furthermore, ahkhats cannot move through or manipulate
    structurally damaged parts of their attuned buildings, so they have a vested
    interest in maintaining the integrity of their demesnes.
  - >-
    When an ahkhat manifests, most often it emerges from a wall as a
    humanoid-like head, arms, and a torso that jut out. While ahkhats can
    manifest full bodies as well, since they cannot move away from their attuned
    structures, they rarely have cause to.
  - >-
    Since an ahkhat's body is one with the structure it embodies, it has no
    weight or size in and of itself. However, most ahkhats can extend up to 3
    feet away from their resident structures; when emerging from the structure,
    its physical form weighs about 100 pounds, though this weight has no adverse
    effect on the structure itself.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Ahkhats are a product of Ancient Osirian magic long lost to time. Since the
    means of creating an ahkhat seem to have been closely guarded secrets and
    the cost was likely extravagant, these creatures were rare even during the
    height of Ancient Osirion. Archeologists have discovered ahkhats in desert
    temples and lavish crypts, but most agree that common homes and other
    mundane structures likely did not house such beings. It's known that ahkhats
    are the result of severe and powerful magical alterations to earth
    elementals, though by what means and under what circumstances these
    modifications occurred remains unknown. The magic that caused such a
    metamorphosis must have been mighty indeed to transform an elemental into a
    native outsider, and is likely on par with the legendary deeds of the
    god-kings themselves. Like elementals, ahkhats need not breathe, eat, or
    sleep.
  - >-
    While not designed for combat, when pressed, ahkhats attack with their
    powerful limbs, and can reach up through the floor and out of the walls to
    trip and grab opponents. They're also adept at snatching nearby objects and
    hurling them at range.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Ahkhats are solitary creatures without exception. Whatever modifications
    were made to those earth elementals that would become ahkhats stripped them
    of both their ability and desire to interact with other creatures, even with
    other members of their own kind. Ahkhats pay earth elementals as much heed
    as any other creature. Earth elementals, for their part, recoil at the sight
    of ahkhats; on some occasions, elementals have been known to rage
    uncontrollably upon witnessing what they no doubt perceive as an abomination
    and mockery of their kind.
  - >-
    Only one ahkhat keystone can be attuned to a particular structure or
    building at a time. Attempting to install a second ahkhat keystone into an
    already-occupied structure results in a series of violent tremors that pulse
    throughout the building and rock the structure to its very foundation.
    During this time, the keystones crack and fall apart, and both crumble into
    useless piles of rubble unless one is removed within 3 rounds.
  - >-
    Ahkhat Keystones Every ahkhat is tied to its own keystone, which is usually
    a stone block that weighs hundreds of pounds. The keystone must be included
    as part of a structure's foundation or cornerstone, or must be exchanged for
    a mundane keystone as part of a permanent alteration effected by a skilled
    artisan. Ahkhat keystones are usually difficult to locate, and are sometimes
    protected by a locked or secret door, devious traps, or magical protections.
    The outward appearance is typically a carved icon of a humanoid figure,
    beneath which is written the ahkhat's name in Ancient Osiriani.
  - >-
    Anyone who speaks the ahkhat's name while touching its keystone can attempt
    to charm the elemental (as charm monster, CL 15th, Will DC 17 negates), and
    may even do so while the ahkhat is elsewhere in the structure. If an ahkhat
    is under the control of two or more creatures at the same time, it tries to
    obey both to the best of its ability. If it receives conf licting orders
    simultaneously, the competing controllers must make opposed Charisma checks
    to determine which one the ahkhat obeys. An ahkhat cannot approach within 10
    feet of its keystone unless granted permission by someone who has
    successfully used the keystone. Once tamed by use of the keystone, the
    ahkhat typically assumes a passive or subservient attitude toward the
    creature that activated it, even after the duration of the charm effect has
    expired. The ahkhat perceives this creature as the master of the house.
  - >-
    By use of its keystone, an ahkhat can be ordered to enter its keystone and
    remain there. The stone can then be removed and built into a different
    building as part of a major construction undertaking or even used in
    constructing a new building. This is the only way to transplant an ahkhat
    without destroying it. Details on how to create an ahkhat keystone have
    faded with time; the knowledge is lost along with the magic that created the
    first ahkhats.
