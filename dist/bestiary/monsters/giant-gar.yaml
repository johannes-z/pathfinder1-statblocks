Description:
  - >-
    Although typical gars are frightening enough, tales of enormous giant gars
    that lurk in the deepest rivers and lakes persist in many regions. These
    creatures are true monsters, often growing to lengths of 30 feet or more and
    capable of swallowing a horse and rider in a single gulp. Fortunately, giant
    gars are much rarer than their smaller kin.
  - >-
    Giant gars are often kept as pets and guard animals by aquatic creatures
    such as merrows, scrags (aquatic trolls), and the rare sea hags who dwell in
    freshwater dens.
