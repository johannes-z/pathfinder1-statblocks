Description:
  - >-
    A tsathar scourge is a slightly bulkier tsathar, of equivalent height but
    weighing about 350 pounds. Tsathar Scourge Society Tsathar scourges hold a
    special place of honor in their society, as they serve as breeders of the
    killer monstrous frogs (q.v.) which commonly accompany them as pets and
    guardians, and by extension oversee the breeding of the tsathar themselves.
    They wear a badge of station that indicates their control over the various
    beasts. All frogs bred by the tsathar obey scourges. Tsathar scourges never
    become priests and thus do not have the summoning ability common tsathars
    can attain. It is also rumored that tsathar scourges are created when a
    common tsathar consumes an implanted egg of a tsathar destined for the
    priest class in the hours before it hatches. Tsathar Scourge Characters
    Tsathar scourges also favor barbarian, ranger, rogue, and fighter classes.

    +2 Charisma. Darkvision: Tsathar can see in the dark up to 90 feet. Scent.

    tsathar scourge's monstrous humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 4
    x (4 + Int modifier) for scourges. Scourges have Handle Animal as a class

    a +14 racial bonus on Acrobatic checks when making long jumps, and a +24
    racial bonus on Acrobatic checks when making high jumps. In addition,
    tsathar scourges have a +8 racial bonus on Handle Animal checks when dealing
    with amphibians such as frogs and toads. Racial Feats: A tsathar scourge's
    monstrous humanoid levels give it two feats. In addition, all tsathar gain
