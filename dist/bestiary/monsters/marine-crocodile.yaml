SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Dive (Ex)
    description: >-
      When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a marine crocodile can
      perform a deadly dive upon making a successful grapple check. As it clings
      to its foe, it uses the force of its powerful tail to propel it downward
      in the water, allowing it to use both the move and damage actions as part
      of its grapple attempt. If successful, the marine crocodile maintains its
      grapple.
  - name: Hold Breath (Ex)
    description: >-
      A marine crocodile can hold its breath a number of rounds equal to 8 times
      its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
Description:
  - >-
    The marine crocodile resembles its land-based cousins in general body shape
    and size, though its legs are a hybrid of webbed feet and nascent fins. Its
    long tail is thinner and flatter than those of traditional crocodilians,
    allowing the marine crocodile to swim with alarming speed as it whips its
    tail back and forth.
  - >-
    Marine crocodiles generally remain in warm, shallow oceans and seas. They
    spend most of their time at sea hunting fish, sea mammals, aquatic
    humanoids, and monstrous humanoids like merfolk, sahuagin, and locathahs.
    Only when breeding and laying eggs do marine crocodiles venture onto land
    (where they are slow and clumsy), before returning to the sea.
