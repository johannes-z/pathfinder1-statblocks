  A small goblin-like humanoid emerges from the shadows. It is dressed in drab

  black hair frames its bat-like face, slightly pointed ears and bulbous red
  pupils and its long and slender arms end in four-fingered hands.

Description:
  - >-
    These small subterranean dwellers enjoy ambushing and waylaying their
    opponents. They slay their victims, steal their possessions, and leave their
    bodies to what ever happens to wander along looking for a meal. Cruel,
    mean-spirited creatures, silids care nothing for themselves or anything
    else. They seem to take great pleasure in bringing misery to others,
    particularly adventurers. Silids rarely interact with other races. They are
    an untrustworthy lot, and most other races avoid contact with them. Silids
    live in groups (called stripes) of up to 40 individuals. Each stripe is a
    loose organization of silids, with a single leader that controls and governs
    the remainder of the stripe. The leader is almost always the meanest,
    cruelest, and sneakiest silid of the bunch. Under his command, the silids
    conduct raids and hunt their subterranean realm for surfacedwellers that
    have wandered into their territory. When hunting or harassing travelers,
    silids often don armor (either leather or padded) and carry weapons. Silids
    skulk about their underground world in search of surfacedwellers.
    Surface-dwellers seem to love exploring the Underdark, so there rarely is a
    shortage of opponents for the mean-spirited silid. Often, a band of silids
    trails an adventuring party before attacking; waiting until the terrain is
    just right (silids prefer small, cramped areas because they gain the
    advantage on larger opponents). When the attack commences, a silid blurs
    itself and usually employs one of the following tactics. The silids attack
    from ambush, attempting to maim or kill as many of their opponents as they
    can. Or, the silids rush from all angles and swarm their opponents. The
    latter tactic is usually only used when a large group of silids are present
    (such as when a party of adventurers stumbles into a silid lair). Silids
    Characters Silids are defined by their class levels-they do not possess
    racial Hit Dice. All silids have the following racial traits. +4 Dexterity,
    +2 Constitution, -4 Charisma. Silids are lithe, acrobatic and furtive
    stalkers. Small: Silids are Small creatures and gain a +1 size bonus to
    their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty to their CMB and
    CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks. Fast: Silids are fast for their
    size, and have a base speed of 30 feet. Darkvision: Silids can see in the
    dark up to 60 feet. Weaknesses: A silid's eyes are sensitive eyes to
    daylight and have the Light Blindness weakness. Spell-like abilities: A
    silid can cast blur once per day with a caster level equal to its hit dice.
    This ability is Wisdom-based. Skilled: +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks.
    Languages: Silids begin play speaking Goblin and can also speak Undercommon
    if they have an Intelligence of at least 10. Silids with high Intelligence
    can choose from the following languages: Orc, Sylvan. Copyright Notice
