Description:
  - >-
    For the vast majority of ships, the shackled sorcerer provides the main
    artillery in skirmishes, sending sheets of flame at enemy vessels or
    targeting burly, hostile sailors with blasts of arcane might from the rear
    of a boarding party. Most buccaneers give their sorcerers a wide berth,
    knowing their destructive power, and thus sorcerers sometimes find
    themselves ostracized from the rest of their crewmates, misunderstood by
    their less gifted and more superstitious compatriots. In battle, however,
    pirates do all they can to protect their magic-wielding allies from harm,
    knowing that their powers can mean the difference between victory and
    swinging from a gibbet.
  - >-
    The majority of shackled sorcerers are considered officers, but they rarely
    assume traditional positions of authority such as a captain's first mate.
    Instead, they are considered advisers as well as weapons, and powers such as
    the ability to locate treasure or change the direction of the winds are
    highly prized among sea-faring magic-wielders. While the bloodlines of
    shackled sorcerers are often connected in some way with life at
    sea-including the Aquatic or Stormborn bloodlines-any gifted arcane casters
    who can hurl destruction are welcomed aboard most ships.
