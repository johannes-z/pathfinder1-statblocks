Description:
  - >-
    Cavern crawlers are subterranean creatures that make their lairs in narrow
    pits and shafts, feeding on cave rats, monstrous centipedes and spiders, and
    other such underground denizens. They are feared by subterranean dwellers
    for their toxic bite which causes its victims to become delusional or lost
    in deep dark cavern recesses.
  - >-
    Cavern crawlers lair in areas where food is plentiful; when their source of
    food runs out, they move the entire lair to a new area, digging new tunnels
    and chambers as needed by the nest. A cavern crawler can go roughly a week
    without food before it begins to exhibit signs of starvation. Many resort to
    cannibalism before that happens however. A cavern crawler nest consists of a
    single female and several male workers and soldiers. The workers hunt for
    and supply needed food for the nest while the soldiers guard the female and
    young. The female lays 10-20 eggs at one time which are buried beneath the
    ground in a special chamber dug off the main chamber of the lair. Eggs hatch
    60-90 days after incubation and young reach maturity in about 12 months.

    A cavern crawler has a reptilian head similar to that of an iguana and
    eighteen short clawed legs on each side of its body which allows it to climb
    on any rocky surface with ease. Its body is slate gray and lighter on the
    underside. Its legs are covered in short bristles of dark gray or black. A
    typical cavern crawler can reach lengths of 6 feet or more. Some species up
    to 12 feet long are rumored to have been encountered by unsuspecting
    adventurers, but these reports have yet to be confirmed.

    A cavern crawler attacks from ambush, clinging to stalactites or overhangs
    and dropping on its unsuspecting prey. The target is subjected to repeated
    bites and dragged to a safe place before being devoured by the cavern
    crawler.
