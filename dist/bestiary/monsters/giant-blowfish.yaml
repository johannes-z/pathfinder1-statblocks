SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Slam aand quills-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds;
      effect 1d6 Dex, prevents breath holding; cure 1 save. Giant blowfish venom
      causes violent seizing of the muscles. Any non-aquatic creature affected
      must immediately begin making Constitution checks to continue holding its
      breath (see page 445 of the Core Rulebook). The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Quills (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature attacking a giant blowfish with light or one-handed melee
      weapons, natural weapons, or an unarmed strike takes 1d8 points of
      piercing damage. A creature that grapples a giant blowfish takes 2d6
      points of piercing damage each round it does so. Creatures damaged by a
      giant blowfish's quills must also save or be poisoned. These gigantic
      cousins of common blowfish, covered in poisonous spearlike quills, can
      reach up to 10 feet in size, and nearly double that when fully inf lated.
