SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Whistle (Su)
    description: >-
      A marble snake can whistle, gaining the attention of any creature within
      50 feet that hears it. All creatures (other than marble snakes) with the
      area must succeed on a DC 11 Will save or become entranced. This is a
      sonic mind-affecting charm effect. A creature that successfully saves
      cannot be affected again by the same marble snake's whistle for one day.
      The save DC is Charisma-based. An entranced victim walks toward the marble
      snake, taking the most direct route available. If the path leads into a
      dangerous area, that creature gets a second saving throw. The effect
      continues for as long as the marble snake whistles and for 1 round
      thereafter. An entranced victim is effectively dazed (cannot attack, but
      can defend). If an entranced opponent is attacked, the effect is
      immediately broken. A bard's countersong ability allows the entranced
      creature to attempt a new Will save.
Description:
  - >-
    The marble snake, unlike normal snakes, adapts very well to its environment,
    hence it can be found just about anywhere, though underground encounters are
    rare. The marble snake prefers sunlight and warmth to the cold and darkness
    of dungeons and caverns and most often makes its lair in high, sunny
    altitudes. Typically an encounter is with a single marble snake. In
    instances where more than one is encountered, they will a mated pair and
    young. A female marble snake is usually only encountered during mating
    season (when she lays 1d10 eggs). Marble snake eggs are milky-white with
    gray-brown flecks. An egg can fetch up to 5 gp on the open market.
  - A typical marble snake is 10 feet long and can grow to a length of 20 feet.

    Marble snakes are generally non-aggressive creatures, though if cornered,
    threatened, or hungry, they attack on sight. A marble snake opens combat
    with its whistling and attacks relentlessly those that fall under its sway.
