SQ: devil mark, false divinity
Environment: any (Hell)
Organization: solitary or pantheon (2-5)
Treasure: double
Description_Visual: >-
  The rending, thunderous clangor of rushing claws heralds the charge of this
  fire-eyed ruin, a terror of flame-seared hide and saber-like spines shaped in
  a monstrously muscled centauric form. The true terrible ferocity of the thing
  lies hidden, restrained beneath armor and wings of crumbling stone carved with
  icons as ancient as they are undeniable and profane.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Devil Mark (Su)
    description: >-
      An advodaza can grant worthy servants a measure of its power. As a
      full-round action, an advodaza can touch a willing adjacent creature,
      marking it with a unique symbol similar to an arcane mark. This symbol can
      be either visible or invisible, as the devil chooses. For as long as the
      target possesses the mark, it gains a spell-like ability it can use once
      per day. This spell-like ability comes from the advodaza's chosen domain
      (see the false divinity ability). The target also gains the ability to
      telepathically communicate with the advodaza over any distance as long as
      the two creatures are on the same plane. An advodaza can mark multiple
      creatures, up to an amount equaling its Hit Dice (typically 18). An
      advodaza can dispel its mark as a standard action, no matter where the
      bearer is. It can also, as a standard action, deal pain to a mark bearer
      that causes 6d6 points of damage with no saving throw. An advodaza's mark
      cannot be removed physically, but a dispel magic or erase spell that
      succeeds on a dispel check or caster level check of DC 30 removes the
      effect.
  - name: False Divinity (Su)
    description: >-
      Advodazas possess areas of concern as deities do, but on a far smaller
      scale. Each advodaza chooses one cleric domain and gains the domain spells
      (up to 5th level) of that domain as spell-like abilities, each of which it
      can use 3 times per day. The advodaza does not gain any of the domain's
      granted powers. Most advodazas possess powers from the Evil, Fire, Law,
      War, or Weather domains, though any domain is possible. Evil Domain: align
      weapon (evil only), dispel good, magic circle against good, protection
      from good, unholy blight Fire Domain: burning hands, fire shield,
      fireball, produce flame, wall of fire Law Domain: align weapon (law only),
      dispel chaos, magic circle against chaos, order's wrath, protection from
      chaos War Domain: divine power, flame strike, magic vestment, magic
      weapon, spiritual weapon Weather Domain: call lightning, fog cloud, ice
      storm, obscuring mist,
  - name: sleet storm Idol Armor (Su)
    description: >-
      Advodazas armor themselves in their fallen idols and ornaments of
      devotion. This armor grants an advodaza a +6 armor bonus to AC and
      immunity to cold, electricity, and sonic damage, as well as immunity to
      the spell dismissal. The spells chaos hammer, holy smite, holy word, and
      word of chaos destroy this armor, removing the devil's armor bonus to AC
      and immunities (its cold immunity decreases to its normal resistance 10).
      If uninterrupted for 1 hour, an advodaza can summon new armor to replace
      its destroyed protection.
  - name: Infernal Wound (Su)
    description: >-
      The damage an advodaza deals with its claws causes persistent wounds that
      deal 2d6 points of bleed damage. Bleeding caused in this way is di#cult to
      stanch-a DC 30 Heal check stops the damage, and any attempt to heal a
      creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed on a DC 30 caster
      level check or the spell does not function. Success indicates the healing
      works normally and stops all bleed effects. The Heal check and caster
      level DC are Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    False gods, fallen demagogues, nemesis devils-the fiends known collectively
    as advodazas survive from dark ages past, when mortals offered worship to
    base things and unwholesome spirits masqueraded as baleful gods. Although
    time and faith have turned against these beings, the most tenacious of their
    kind have refused to fade into oblivion, and to these obstinate corruptors
    and one-time deities the gates of Hell swing wide and welcoming. These lords
    of cults and masters of forgotten mysteries find renewed vigor in the depths
    of the Pit, and those seeking to renew their power and lordship over
    mortalkind undergo terrible indoctrinations and binding rites that transform
    them over the ages into true devils. What emerge are eidolons of
    half-remembered demigods, fallen princes seeking to claim their subjects
    anew, devils of faith, and fiends of blasphemy- the idol-clad advodazas.
  - >-
    No two advodazas look exactly alike, each embodying the powers and concerns
    that saw it worshiped in ages past and subsequently anthropomorphized as a
    monstrous being. Typically, this results in quadrupedal, half-bestial shapes
    bristling with terrible wings, hooves, claws, and fangs. Universally,
    though, they bear the broken remnants of their fallen faith, usually in the
    form of cracked idols worn like armor, profane talismans crafted into
    jewelry, or fearful totems wielded like massive weapons. Despite their range
    of appearances, all advodazas possess the same core abilities, though some
    particularly ancient or powerful fiends possess unique abilities. Most
    advodazas stand 18 feet tall and weigh nearly 9 tons.
  - >-
    Ecology Fantastically old beings, advodazas rose from spirits worshiped by
    mortals in distant ages. While humanoids still huddled in crude shelters,
    begging any power that would listen for protection from storms, beasts,
    enemies, hunger, and countless other fears, the spirits of the land, sky,
    and animals were the first to give heed. Not deities, but elusive
    influences, these forces heard these early prayers and worked what appeared
    to be miracles in return for sacrifices and adoration. Slowly, these
    formless vestiges took shape as idols, fetishes, palladiums, and all manner
    of cult images. Yet, as knowledge of true deities and the powers they
    offered worshipers spread, the old spirits were forgotten or demonized and
    rooted out. While most simply faded into the ethers of time, the bitterest
    demi-deities of countless worlds found their way to Hell and Asmodeus, who
    welcomed them and offered them a chance for renewed power and worship, as
    well as a chance to avenge themselves against the deities and mortals who
    had snubbed them. Honing their hatreds through ages of flame, these beings
    emerged from the Pit as advodazas. One of the few breeds of devilkind not
    forged wholly by Hell itself, advodazas prove exceedingly rare compared to
    other fiends.
  - >-
    Habitat & Society All advodazas seek to return to the Material Plane, where
    they might tempt new followers to serve, sacrifice, and raise idols to their
    names. While merciless, advodazas appeal to many mortal servants due to the
    directness of their interaction and their willingness to grant power or
    violently smite enemies for a seemingly paltry price. In death, however,
    their servants find no divine realm nor glory seated beside some grand
    deity. For when they die, there is only Hell.
