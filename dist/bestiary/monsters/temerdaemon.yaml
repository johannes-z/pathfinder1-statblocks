Description_Visual: >-
  This creature lurches forward on multiple arms and legs, its spine contorted
  into a painful curve with its hips higher than it head. Seemingly distracted
  and muttering to itself, the thing rarely looks up with its glowing red eyes,
  its hair composed of hundreds of thin, white tendrils that hang over its head
  like a veil. Strapped onto the creature's body at various points are sacks and
  belt pouches stuffed with bizarre collections of objects, and its rear arms
  wield a wide, black bladed scythe, still coated with the blood of the fiend's
  last victim.

    description: >-
      Creatures struck in combat by a temerdaemon's claws or scythe must succeed
      at a DC 25 Will save or be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting
      effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Reaper's
  - name: Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      Those in proximity to a temerdaemon are afflicted by a profound increase
      in self-inflicted and ally-inflicted wounds, failures in magic, and
      similar accidental damage. Arcane spell failure chances for armor are
      doubled. A creature that rolls a natural 1 on its attack roll
      automatically rerolls the attack against itself (01-50%) or an ally
      (51-100%). If there is no ally in range, the attack always targets the
      creature. A creature that rolls a natural 1 on its roll to cast
      defensively suffers a mishap (see Scroll Mishaps, Core Rulebook 491).
      Skill checks that have serious consequences if failed by 5 or more (such
      as Climb, Disable Device, and Swim) have these consequences on all failed
      checks.
Description:
  - >-
    Temerdaemons personify the concept of accidental death. A knight falls upon
    her sword, a peasant trips and breaks his neck, a structure fails in ways
    its builders never foresaw and buries dozens of innocents, and meanwhile, a
    distant temerdaemon cackles knowingly. While true accidents please the
    fiend, it also delights in engineering the mishaps itself, crafting
    incomprehensibly complex plots that lead to the slaughter of as many mortals
    as possible. A temerdaemon often wades into the aftermath of such engineered
    catastrophes, carving apart the crippled survivors and sowing mass confusion
    and hysteria by its very proximity.
  - >-
    A gangly mass consisting of a rotund torso, four arms, and four legs, the
    average temerdaemon is 10 feet long and weighs 1,200 pounds, not counting
    its bizarre collection of mechanical fetishes and tinkering equipment.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Lesser fiends who follow in an existing temerdaemon's wake and learn from
    the daemon's actions are those most typically chosen by one of the Four
    Horsemen or a member of the daemonic elite for elevation into this terrible
    caste of crippled giants. Occasionally, however, an evil mortal soul proves
    worthy of such a station, having died in a singularly horrific accident,
    especially one engineered by its own hands. In such cases, transition from
    soul to temerdaemon is swift-on a cosmic scale-and made even swifter by a
    proclivity to prey upon other mortals.
  - >-
    Though Zyphus-the god of accidental deaths and tragedies-is thought by some
    to be the conceptual father of temerdaemons, the Grim Harvestman has never
    outright claimed responsibility for them. Nonetheless, he frequently
    delights in temerdaemons and the infrequent unconsumed souls they send his
    way. Neither Zyphus nor the temerdaemons seek to disrupt the other's claim
    over particular souls; they find the destinations of such tragically doomed
    mortals frequently cross paths, and are as likely to end up in the hands of
    daemons as the god's minions.
  - >-
    Cultists of Zyphus often revel in the doings of temerdaemons, though the
    daemons themselves despise such worship by the very mortals they seek to
    destroy. Even slaying these foolish accident-worshipers is hardly enough for
    the angry temerdaemons, as the daemons' masterfully constructed accidents
    are wasted on those who actually hope for the horrid events. According to
    temerdaemons, freak accidents are best engineered for those who go about
    life with little concern for danger, especially those who least expect such
    misfortune to befall them. People who watch their backs-including paranoids
    and betrayers-don't satisfy the morbid desires of temerdaemons as much as
    the daydreaming child or absent-minded village idiot.
  - >-
    No two temerdaemons look exactly the same, as these treacherous beings take
    on as many forms as there are ways to freakishly die. Particularly powerful
    individuals may rise to enormous sizes, possessing dozens of legs and arms,
    as well as multiple heads, all of which strive to wreak as much disaster as
    possible upon the souls around them.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Temerdaemons wander the multiverse in search of opportunities for sabotage
    and treachery. Those cultists of Zyphus foolish enough to summon the daemons
    in hopes of bargaining with them for their services often find themselves
    victims of their own elaborate rituals. In their most fortunate cases, a
    temerdaemon arises on the Material Plane only to greet its summoners with
    its wicked smile and deadly aura, causing chandeliers to fall upon unwary
    victims' heads, robed priests to trip onto sharp candelabras, and sconces to
    break off of walls and ignite dusty curtains to set an entire building on
    fire. Now on the Material Plane, its summoners dead, a temerdaemon strives
    to create as much havoc and mischief as possible before being banished to
    its home in Abaddon. If it weren't for the extravagant and terrif ically
    tragic manner of his worshipers' deaths, Zyphus might be rather displeased
    with the actions of these cunning daemons, but as it stands, there is rarely
    conf lict between the two forces, which inadvertently share similar goals.
  - >-
    Temerdaemons rarely cooperate among themselves when crafting masterful
    hazards, preferring to enact their deadly accidents on their own and later
    boast to their kindred of their massacres. No two accidents are alike, and
    though temerdaemons sometimes gather in groups of two or three for
    particularly elaborate schemes, they have no reason to share their
    techniques or formulate plans for long, as premeditating a particular
    slaughter is entirely counterproductive in the eyes of a temerdaemon. To
    these improvisational fiends, an accidental murder is even more satisfying
    than a mere accidental death.
  - >-
    Despite their preference to act alone, temerdaemons at times happily utilize
    some of their lesser kindred as unwitting cogs in their disastrous plans.
    Particular among these pawns are the miniscule cacodaemons, which frequently
    cluster in numbers of up to a dozen around a given temerdaemon, ready to
    absorb and regurgitate the souls of their greater kindred's kills. When a
    temerdaemon cannot attract cacodaemon followers, it simply captures them,
    and any given temerdaemon of considerable power can often be found with
    dozens of these least daemons impaled on barbed hooks, stuffed into tightly
    drawn satchels, or crammed into small cages, each container dangling from
    its myriad straps, belts, and holsters.
