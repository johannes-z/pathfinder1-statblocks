  This squat humanoid seems to be nearly all head-an unfortunate circumstance,
  considering how ugly its puffy blue face is.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hatred (Ex)
    description: >-
      Mites receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures of the
      dwarf or gnome subtype due to special training against these hated foes.
  - name: Vermin Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy, save that a mite can
      only use this ability on vermin. A mite gains a +4 racial bonus on this
      check. Vermin are normally mindless, but this empathic communication
      imparts on them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing mites to
      train Medium vermin and use them as mounts. Vermin empathy treats swarms
      as if they were one creature possessing a single mind-a mite can thus use
      this ability to influence and direct the actions of swarms with relative
      ease.
Description:
  - >-
    Descended from even smaller fey, the mites are among the most pitiful and
    craven dwellers of the dark.
  - >-
    Hideously ugly, even goblins have been known to mock mites for their homely
    appearances, mockery most mites take to heart and nurture for weeks, months,
    or even years in their tiny homes, until their distress and anger finally
    overcome their natural cowardice and impel them forth on short-lived bouts
    of bloody vengeance from the doubtful safety of a spider's back.
  - >-
    Mites, once closer to the strange realm of the fey, have grown larger and
    stockier after countless generations spent on the Material Plane. Yet still,
    their stature places them at the bottom of the pile in the dangerous caverns
    in which they live. Their traditional enemies are dwarves and gnomes,
    particularly the svirfneblin of the deep underground caves. The one thing
    that gives them a significant edge over an enemy in a fight is their natural
    ability to empathize with normally mindless vermin- mites are particularly
    fond of spiders, centipedes, and cave fishers, and a mite colony usually has
    a few of these far more dangerous monsters on hand to defend the group.
  - >-
    Although they have lost the supernatural ability to tinker with magic items,
    luck, or mechanical objects possessed by their more sinister and dangerous
    gremlin kin, mites retain the ability to perform minor magical tricks with
    prestidigitation, and often use these tricks to annoy their enemies. When
    faced with dangerous foes, a mite uses its doom ability to hex a foe-a
    mite's eyes bulge hideously open when it uses this spell-like ability.
  - A mite is 3 feet tall and weighs 40 pounds.
