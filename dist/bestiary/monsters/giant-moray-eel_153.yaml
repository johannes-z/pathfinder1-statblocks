    description: >-
      If a giant moray begins a round with a grabbed foe, it inflicts automatic
      bite damage (2d6+9 points of damage). A giant moray eel possesses a second
      set of jaws in its throat that aid in swallowing-it can make a second bite
      attack (+11 attack, 1d6+3) against a foe it has already grabbed.
Description:
  - >-
    The moray eel is a ferocious predator, capable of holding prey in its
    primary jaws while a smaller set of jaws inside its throat chews away
    bite-sized portions. Moray Eel Animal Companion Starting Statistics: Size
