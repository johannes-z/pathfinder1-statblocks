  This cloud of swirling energy flickers like lightning, with raw magical power
  playing across its form.
Source: Inner Sea Gods
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Corporeal Form (Ex)
    description: >-
      As an immediate action, the herald can take physical form, losing its
      incorporeal special quality and subtype and its deflection bonus to AC,
      but gaining a Strength score of 20 and a natural armor bonus equal to its
      incorporeal deflection bonus.
  - name: Eldritch Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      The herald chooses an additional effect for its eldritch blasts each round
      (DC 26 negates). A creature that fails its saves against both blasts in
      the same round suffers an increased effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
      Dement (Will): The creature is confused for 1 minute. Increased effect:
      The creature goes insane (as insanity). Displace (Fortitude): The creature
      teleports (as dimension door) 5 feet in a random horizontal direction at
      the end of its turn each round for the next 10 rounds. Increased effect:
      The creature is affected by maze. Ignite (Reflex): The creature takes 2d6
      points of fire damage. Increased effect: The creature catches on fire.
  - name: Energy Channel Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      On its turn, the herald can channel energy (Will DC 26 half) to deal 2d6
      points of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage to each creature in its
      aura. A creature struck by its incorporeal touch attack also takes this
      damage (no saving throw). The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    In its natural, incorporeal form, Nethys's herald is a storm of magic,
    immediately recognizable as a creature of the arcane and divine. It rises
    just over 7 feet tall, and has a habit of floating a few inches above the
    ground instead of walking.
