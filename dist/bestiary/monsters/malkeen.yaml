SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mind Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a malkeen can deliver a massive blast of mental
      energy at a single target within 50 feet. The target must succeed on a DC
      15 Will save or take 6d6 points of damage. A malkeen can use this ability
      once every 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Malkeens are intelligent, ferocious swamp cats that closely resemble dark
    furred leopards. These creatures are extremely territorial with the average
    malkeen's territory covering 10 square miles or more. Creatures entering its
    territory are stalked and watched from afar before the malkeen moves in to
    attack. Malkeens are generally passive creatures and only attack if
    threatened or hungry. They are carnivores and dine on creatures such as
    alligators, marsh reptiles, marsh birds, and wild game.
  - >-
    Malkeens reach lengths of 12 feet or more and weigh up to 5,500 pounds.
    Malkeens can live for up to 50 years.
  - >-
    Malkeens are ambush hunters and sneak up on their prey before lunging to
    attack. These creatures almost always open combat with their mind blast
    attack, attempting to kill or disable their opponent as quickly as possible.
    After that, opponents left standing are assaulted by claws and bites.
