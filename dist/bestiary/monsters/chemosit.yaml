Description_Visual: >-
  This massive, shaggy beast uses long and muscular forearms to raise itself
  onto its hind legs and beats its chest like a gorilla. Despite its ape-like
  stance, its frame is far heavier and its features more primitive, its powerful
  muzzle and gnashing canines bespeaking terrible, bestial savagery.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Brain Eater (Su)
    description: >-
      Should a chemosit kill an opponent with a coup de grace attack, it breaks
      open the creature's skull and devours what's inside. If the creature
      killed is of one of the following classes or creature types, the chemosit
      gains the associated benefit. If the creature killed falls into multiple
      categories, the chemosit chooses a single benefit to gain. With the
      exception of healing, the effects provided by this ability affect a
      chemosit for a number of minutes equal to 5 times its Hit Dice. Animal:
      The chemosit regains a number of hit points equal to the victim's Hit
      Dice, and the DC of its terrifying roar increases by +2. Arcane
      Spell-Caster: The chemosit regains a number of hit points equal to 1d4
      times the victim's Hit Dice and gains SR 15. Divine Spell-Caster: The
      chemosit regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 times the victim's
      Hit Dice. Humanoid: The chemosit regains a number of hit points equal to
      1d4 times the victim's Hit Dice. Outsider: The chemosit regains a number
      of hit points equal to 1d4 times the victim's Hit Dice but is confused for
      1d4 rounds. Monstrous Humanoid: The chemosit regains a number of hit
      points equal to 1d4 times the victim's Hit Dice and is affected as per the
      spell rage. Undead: The chemosit takes 1d4 points of damage and is
      sickened for 1d4 rounds. In addition, the chemosit detects as undead for
      the purposes of spells like detect undead, though it is in no other way
      treated as an undead creature.
  - name: Terrifying Roar (Su)
    description: >-
      The terrifying roar of the chemosit unnerves even the bravest souls. Any
      creatures within a 300-foot spread must make a DC 15 Will save or become
      shaken for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear affect. Whether
      or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same
      chemosit's roar for the next 24 hours. The save DC is Wisdom-based.
Description:
  - >-
    From the time their children are young, Mwangi tribesfolk tell them chilling
    tales of the savage, childeating chemosit. While most believe these stories
    hold little truth and serve only to keep children from wandering too far
    from their villages, others know better. Few who have witnessed the gruesome
    work of the chemosit survive. Bearing terrible scars, both physical and
    mental, they recall the creature's utter savagery and inhuman strength.
    Tribes living in close proximity to chemosits believe them to be the living
    embodiment of wrathful gods or nature spirits, and pay them grisly
    sacrifices. In such places, those who suffer the beast's attacks are often
    blamed for the violence and exiled. In other regions, evil shamans capable
    of summoning or commanding these beasts gain great power and infamy. It is a
    common practice for warring tribes to pay such shamans to summon a chemosit
    to plague the villages of their enemies. Chemosits stand over 9 feet tall on
    average and weigh upward of 750 pounds. Ecology Chemosits (or Mwangi
    ape-bears, as northerners sometimes refer to the creatures) are readily
    identified by their thick and bristly dark-blue fur and broad, stumpy tails.
    Beneath their fur, coils of muscle stretch across their broad frames, and
    they move with ferocious confidence. Chemosits can walk upright or run on
    all fours, and are able climbers. A chemosit's face is a mix of simian and
    ursine features, with a long lower jaw and the sharp, powerful teeth of a
    dedicated carnivore. Perhaps its most identifiable characteristic, however,
    is its terrifying roar. On still nights, its grim echoes roll through the
    forests, leaving all who hear it sleepless with fright. Strict carnivores,
    chemosits go through monthly feeding cycles. During the first cycle, they
    barely eat, often passing the entire month without feeding. During the
    second cycle, they emerge as voracious predators.Chemosits hunt nocturnally,
    preferably on dark moonless nights. Able climbers, they often hide in trees,
    dropping down upon prey from great heights. They favor easy prey, such as
    cattle, but they consider humans a delicacy and do not hesitate to attack
    and devour lone travelers or small groups, their favorite morsel being the
    brain. Feasting upon brains invigorates chemosits, though in varying ways
    depending on the type of creatures they consume. Some even say that
    chemosits take on the knowledge and powers of creatures whose brains they
    ingest, a legend supported by the strange powers or behaviors exhibited by
    individuals that have recently gorged. Chemosits often stalk villages,
    entering each night by stealth and stealing away with sleeping victims,
    preferably children, the infirm, or others too weak to defend themselves. A
    small number of bold or reckless exotic animal trainers value chemosits for
    their hunting and tracking abilities. They pay top coin for newborns or
    cubs, and attempt to raise them in captivity, training them to track down
    and ferret out prey. A competent handler can typically train them to follow
    simple commands, particularly instinctive concepts like "hunt" and "kill."
    Most captive-bred chemosits are accomplished trackers. Once they taste fresh
    blood, however, they eventually turn feral; thus trainers typically attempt
    to get to targets before their pets. Habitat & Society Chemosits live in
    Mwangi's most remote and fiercest jungles, where they can find massive boab
    trees capable of supporting their tremendous weight. They choose regions
    with large trees near fresh water supplies and, if possible, caves. For the
    untrained, chemosits' territory is difficult to detect. They leave behind
    few traces of their passing, fastidiously scratching out their tracks and
    burying their dung. Principally arboreal, chemosits spend the majority of
    their waking time climbing through the shadowy understory. Caves serve
    chemosits not as shelters, but as repositories for the remains of their
    kills. It is unknown why chemosits create such middens, though some suggest
    they use the scent of carrion to attract prey. Chief ly nocturnal, chemosits
    retire to the safety and shadows of high trees by day. Once darkness falls,
    the creature hunts with reckless voraciousness. Chemosits live in small
    patriarchal clans dominated by an alpha male. Male chemosits are solitary
    hunters, and establish their clan status through their kills. As they seek
    out larger game, particularly creatures not found in the deep forest, their
    hunting grounds often grow to extend beyond the borders of their clan
    territory. Clan members that display the largest and most impressive kills
    rise in status and gain access to preferred hunting grounds and mates.
