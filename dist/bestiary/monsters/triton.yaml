Description:
  - >-
    These aquatic outsiders resemble merfolk, except where a merman has a single
    fish tail, a triton has two scaly, finned legs. They are the watchers of the
    sea, often using dolphins or other aquatic creatures as mounts, and
    maintaining a vigil against the evil races below the waves. Originally
    hailing from the Plane of Water, long ago the triton race migrated to the
    oceans of the Material Plane, and they are now fully adapted to life there.
    Their split legs allow them to hobble about slowly on land, but they rarely
    do so, preferring their natural environment and the greater mobility their
    forms afford there.
  - >-
    Tritons make their homes on the sea floor, growing coral reefs and sculpting
    stones into gentle arcs to create living spaces that are beautiful and
    naturallooking.
  - >-
    Many of these sites lie near great thermal vents, providing not only heat
    but also rich minerals and nutrients for the fish and other creatures
    tritons eat. Tritons can breathe air or water, but prefer water.
  - >-
    While their cities are designed for water-breathers, they usually feature
    one or two airtight buildings set aside to hold air for landwalking
    visitors. Triton settlements can be found anywhere from arctic to tropical
    waters, but most are in temperate locations. They generally avoid the
    deepest reaches of the ocean, for it is here that creatures like aboleths
    and krakens rule-creatures that the tritons have long waged war against.
  - >-
    Tritons maintain relationships with other good undersea creatures, but
    mostly keep to themselves. They aid others in fights against their enemies
    (primarily krakens and aboleths, but also lesser evils like sahuagin or
    skum). They typically form strong squadrons of aquatic cavalry trained in
    coordinated attacks when they go to war. Tritons tend to distrust outsiders,
    and usually avoid land-dwellers.
  - >-
    They sometimes provide aid to airbreathers, even though they often see them
    as trespassers under the sea; when they do help landwalkers, their price for
    this is high. Nevertheless, when they witness a landwalker do battle against
    and vanquish a great evil such as an aboleth, they are quick to cast aside
    their prejudices and accept the great hero into their societies with open
    and welcoming arms.
  - >-
    Tritons have silvery skin, hued in tones of aqua blue and kelp green. Older
    tritons often have barnacles, corals, and seashells crusting the back,
    chest, and shoulders, worn almost like jewelry as a mark of status among
    their kind. They have white, blue, or green hair. Tritons' eyes shine blue
    like sunlight upon a clear sea. A typical triton stands 6 feet in height and
    weighs 180 pounds. While most exceptional tritons advance by taking class
    levels (typically as druids, oracles, or rangers), a rare few tritons
    advance by increasing in size.
  - >-
    These Large tritons are great heroes among their kind and have 8 racial Hit
    Dice or more.
