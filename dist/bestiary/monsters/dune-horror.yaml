Description:
  - >-
    The dune horror is a massive and vicious creature that makes its lair in the
    warmer regions of the world, usually deserts, but occasionally underground.
    A typical underground lair is a large rocky cave while those living
    aboveground dwell beneath the sand and earth. Dune horrors sustain
    themselves on a diet of plants such as mosses or cacti and meat, such as
    preferring larger animals and humanoids, including giants to other sources
    of meat.

    A typical dune horror is 20 feet long with a light brown carapace. Its legs
    and claws are dark brown, growing darker near the ends. Its tail is dark
    brown as well, and the stinger black. The dune horror's serpentine neck is
    covered in light brown scales and its eyes are ruby-colored. Males and
    females are indistinguishable from one another, save the females are
    sometimes smaller. A typical female dune horror lays 2-16 eggs once every
    few years, with the eggs usually hatching 90-100 days later. Juvenile dune
    horrors are dark brown in color and are blind for the first month of their
    life. They mature rapidly, reaching adulthood within 6 months. Dune horrors
    generally live for 20 years.
  - >-
    Dune horrors prefer to attack from ambush, often hiding just beneath the
    surface waiting for prey to come close. When prey is detected, the dune
    horror springs to the attack, rending its prey with its claws, stinging it
    with its deadly stinger, and biting it with its serpentine fanged maw.
    Grabbed prey is stung to death and devoured. Dune horrors do not collect
    treasure; any treasure found within its lair is the remnants of a previous
    meal.
