Description_Visual: >-
  With the splintering sound of dry, cracking wood, a human-sized graven image
  lurches to life. Its features shift and reform with every step, cycling
  through a variety of faces both strange and oddly familiar. Bits of feather,
  leaves, and decorative stone embellish its surface, and the strong smell of
  lacquer and resin assaults the senses as it draws near with a menacing,
  ponderous gait.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ceremonial Activation (Su)
    description: >-
      A tribal totem stands inert unless empowered each day by spiritual energy.
      This activation requires that at least 10 participants perform an
      hour-long ceremony of chanting and adoration. For each hour this ritual
      lasts, the totem remains alert and functional for 1 day. The worshipers
      need not include the creator or possess any special divine powers.
  - name: Effigy (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action once per day, a tribal totem can mimic the shape of
      any Small or Medium humanoid within its line of sight, reforming itself
      into a wooden depiction of that creature. Upon doing so, the target can be
      affected by the effigy ability. While in this shape, the tribal totem
      knows the location of its target as if persistently using the spell locate
      creature. A warp wood or wood shape spell immediately forces the tribal
      totem to revert to its normal form. Although the tribal totem may only use
      this ability once per day, it can retain a shape indefinitely.
  - name: Mouthpiece (Sp)
    description: >-
      Although a tribal totem cannot speak on its own, every day it can store a
      single message for its creator and repeat that message upon a prescribed
      condition. This ability functions as the magic mouth spell, and its
      creator may change or reset the conditions of the message each day.
  - name: Spirit Link (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a tribal totem may attempt to join its animating
      energies with a creature within its line of sight that also shares its
      likeness (as per the effigy ability). The target can resist this effect
      with a DC 16 Will save. If this save fails, the target is affected as if
      it had cast the spell shield other, taking half the damage inflicted upon
      the tribal totem. In addition, any spell with a range of "creature
      touched" cast upon the tribal totem affects the linked creature rather
      than the construct. If the spell allows a saving throw, the linked
      creature can make a saving throw as normal to resist the effect. Spirit
      link lasts for 4 hours and ends immediately if the tribal totem no longer
      possesses the target's shape. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Tribal totems represent a significant cultural achievement for their adopted
    tribe. Imbued with a spark of life from the continued worship of those they
    protect, they stand as lifelong guardians of their villages, defending them
    against enemies and predators alike. To aid them in this function, they also
    possess the unusual ability to reshape themselves into the likeness of other
    creatures, targeting them with eerie pains and ailments. This ability
    enables their tribe to more actively hunt down such enemies while their
    quarry is hindered and tracked by the totem.
  - >-
    As mindless automatons, tribal totems remain ever dependent on their
    creators to direct them. Some serve only a defensive role, strategically
    placed within villages to aid against attacks. Others carry stored messages
    on their tribe's behalf or vocalize their creator's words. Rarer still are
    the tribal totems purposed for war, which emerge from the jungle as a potent
    force capable of spearheading invasions and targeting enemy champions.
  - >-
    While most tribal totems are made of wood and combine exaggerated features
    of folkloric monsters with simple decorations and images of strength (like
    streaks of blood, the claws of defeated beasts, or enemy skulls), few look
    exactly alike, as each embodies the deities, fears, or legends of its
    creator's people. Tribal totems tend to stand 7 feet tall and weigh over 300
    pounds.
  - >-
    Ecology As constructs, tribal totems have no significant ecological niche.
    They exist at the whim of their creators and protect their assigned tribes
    from harm. The divine spark that powers them emanates from the continued
    adulation and combined spiritual energy of the tribe, but relies upon
    constant rekindling. Each morning, the totem requires lengthy ritual
    adoration to renew its power. Otherwise, the totem remains still, appearing
    to be nothing more than a decorative statue.
  - >-
    During elaborate festivals and revels, tribal natives usually spend several
    hours honoring the totem to ensure it remains vigilant for many days. They
    also take care to mend and repair any damage it might have suffered on their
    behalf. Once charged in this manner, the totem may operate remotely for many
    days at a time, undertaking longer trips on the tribe's behalf to hunt down
    enemies whose likeness it acquires.
  - >-
    Habitat & Society Tribal shamans, oracles, or witchdoctors most commonly
    undertake the rituals necessary to construct a tribal totem, guiding the
    rest of the tribe in worshiping and maintaining it. The totem only obeys the
    commands of its creator or someone appointed by her. In the event of conf
    licting orders, it always obeys its creator above anyone else loaned such
    authority. Typically, a tribal totem spends its entire existence within the
    confines of its creator's village, and is completely dependent on the
    continuing worship of the tribe to give it a semblance of life. Only in rare
    cases might a multitude of tribes gather their totems together for some
    shared offensive. Tales also tell of crazed hermits and shamanic outcasts
    who have created multiple tribal totems and then set them against specific
    individuals or whole tribes who garner their ire.
  - >-
    Greater Tribal Totems Legends also tell of more advanced versions of tribal
    totems, some reaching Large or even Huge size. Serving as guardians of
    important religious or cultural sites, these totems possess multiple faces,
    one on each side of their heads, enabling them to take on the conjoined
    likeness of up to four victims at a time. They also gain the following
    additional abilities: • +3 natural armor • +4 Strength, +2 Wisdom, +2
    Charisma • All-Around Vision (Ex) A greater tribal totem gains a +6 bonus on
    Perception checks and cannot be flanked.
  - >-
    • Extended Effigy (Su) A greater tribal totem is no longer dependent on line
    of sight to affect victims with its shared condition ability. Instead, it
    can extend this power to any creature that has ever been in its line of
    sight and is currently within 5 miles, often enabling its creators to inf
    lict terrible punishments upon their enemies through the totem's connection.
  - >-
    Construction A tribal totem is always carved from a single type of wood
    chosen for its density and beauty-typically, ebony, mahogany, or some other
    valuable resource whose value is at least 1,000 gp. Some tribes use ivory
    instead, lashing together the pieces and then relying on the magic of the
    totem's construction to knit everything into a single whole. Decorations of
    leafy fronds, stones, animalistic trophies, and paint help complete the
    appearance.
  - >-
    Initially, a creator shapes a totem's features into a ferocious, monstrous
    image. Then, the application of the proper spells enables the construct to
    alter its appearance to mimic other creatures.
