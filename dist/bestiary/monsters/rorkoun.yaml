Description_Visual: >-
  A large amber eye tops a swollen head, surrounded evenly by four mouths loaded
  with needle-sharp teeth. This enormously long, yet slender creature stretches
  the length of five men and appears to be composed of twisted strands of pallid
  flesh and veiny musculature. The tentacle-like thing moves with the awkward,
  alien speed of a hunting insect, unnaturally still one moment and darting
  forth with incredible speed the next.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aquatic Dependency (Ex)
    description: >-
      A rorkoun violently dehydrates as soon as its body is wholly removed from
      water. Every round that part of a rorkoun's space does not occupy the same
      square as a significant body of water (50 gallons or more), the creature
      takes damage equal to the number of rounds it has been outside water. The
      rorkoun stops taking damage as soon as it reenters the water.
  - name: Gob (Ex)
    description: >-
      A rorkoun can spit a wad of viscous slaver at its prey. As a standard
      action, the rorkoun can make a ranged touch attack at a single creature up
      to 30 feet away. Creatures of Large size or smaller that are struck by the
      attack must succeed on a DC 18 Reflex save or become entangled. Flying
      creatures that fail their Reflex save fall to the ground. An entangled
      creature can escape by making a DC 18 Escape Artist or Strength check.
      Should an entangled target take any amount of acid damage, the sticky
      saliva is instantly dissolved. The save, skill, and ability check DCs are
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Squeeze (Ex)
    description: >-
      Able to manipulate the shape of its highly malleable body, a rorkoun can
      easily slip through spaces not normally accessible to a creature of its
      size. For the purposes of determining how small a space a rorkoun can
      squeeze through, treat it as one size category smaller. A rorkoun can move
      into even smaller spaces by contracting, allowing it to treat its size as
      two size categories smaller.
Description:
  - >-
    Little-known denizens of the Darklands, rorkouns prey upon the unwary from
    lairs amid the deepest pools and waterways. Known as "wretch worms" and
    "eyes of Orv," these disgusting abominations writhe through flooded pits and
    crevices, feeding upon nearly all they encounter and occasionally breaking
    forth from the depths into the world of light to glut themselves upon the
    plump, tender creatures found there. Rorkouns measure over 25 feet in
    length, and beneath the strange secretions that provide them with a false,
    apparent bulk, the creatures possess a ribbon-thin body only a foot wide. A
    typical rorkoun weighs a mere 200 pounds. Ecology Little is known of the
    anatomy and life processes of rorkouns because of both their rarity and
    their fundamental dependency on water. As soon as a rorkoun leaves the
    water-which none ever do willingly, even to pursue the most tempting prey-it
    begins dehydrating at a deadly rate. Most that are ripped from their native
    pools wither to long strips of jerky-like flesh in a few short minutes.
    Thus, much of what is known of the beasts comes from direct observation, a
    methodology that proves dangerous for most researchers. Rorkouns possess
    lengthy bodies similar to tapeworms, with simple, decentralized bodily
    systems. Their flat, oblong heads branch into four split mouthparts set on
    throat-like stalks. At the top of the head, a single, bulging eye scans the
    creature's surroundings with uncanny sensitivity. Their heads are the
    thickest parts of their bodies, which taper gradually to a powerful tail.
    The strangest quality of these creatures is that their body exudes a
    rubbery, gluelike substance that swiftly hardens into a flexible, puttylike
    mass. Rorkouns use these secretions to better protect their bodies, seal off
    their chosen lairs (to prevent water from seeping out), and capture their
    prey. Several explorers who have encountered rorkouns have spread unnerving
    stories regarding the beasts, suggesting that rorkouns are not individual
    creatures but rather the impossibly long appendages of some unknown aberrant
    body. Their hesitance to leave the water is thus claimed to be because they
    are incapable of separating themselves from their greater body; the frantic
    thrashing of rorkoun that are forcibly removed from the water as they
    struggle to return is compared to the final desperate twitches of an
    amputated limb. What terrible body might support limbs as vile as rorkouns
    few dare to conjecture, but whatever hidden beings (or more terrible still,
    single being) manipulate these horrors from the darkness must be unlike
    anything known to the denizens of Golarion's surface-and must hunger
    endlessly. Habitat & Society Solitary creatures, rorkoun rarely share
    hunting grounds. Most, upon encountering another of their kind, attempt to
    leave the vicinity, avoiding any sort of confrontation and often ridding the
    area of both creatures. This aversion proves baffling, especially
    considering the extreme rarity of the beasts, though some suggest that the
    abominations might prove more receptive toward others of their kind when far
    below the surface. Those scholars who study rorkouns claim the strange
    beasts understand both the Common language and that of goblins, though most
    believe the creatures also have a silent language used among their own
    kind-despite the creatures' tendency to avoid contact with one another. They
    frequently live near goblin and mite communities. While these species share
    an ecological niche as scavengers and occasional hunters, the connection is
    a bit more complex. Rorkouns never hunt goblins or mites as they find the
    taste of their flesh repulsive. The creatures do, however, find the savory
    flavor of greater humanoids succulent; they appreciate the zeal with which
    those races seek to exterminate goblinkind, as it brings prey close to their
    lairs for them to feast on. Cowardly and secretive, rorkouns lurk in murky
    pools or bogs near such creatures' camps, hoping to provoke a fight. Once
    the battle begins, rorkouns strike, picking off the weakest creatures in the
    fray before slinking off to digest the meal in the privacy of their dens or
    some other location where their prey's allies might find it difficult to
    follow. A rorkoun's benefactors rarely understand the reason for this
    strange kind of cooperation. While mites tend to fear and flee the
    aberrations-just as they do most creatures- goblins often concoct more
    elaborate reasons for why these alien horrors might aid them. Typically, a
    particularly imaginative goblin convinces his tribe that the rorkoun is in
    fact a god and that they are its chosen people. All too often this inspires
    the community to new heights of crazed zealotry and the invention of bizarre
    forms of sacrifice and adoration. Occasionally rorkouns find their way into
    the dilapidated or abandoned sewer systems of ruined or declining cities
    where the shattered remains of such networks have collapsed and formed
    connections to the Darklands. There rorkouns crawl and swim their way
    through the slick tunnels and drainpipes, feeding on refuse, vermin, and the
    occasional sewer dweller or rat catcher. Such unusual beasts rarely prove
    significant threats, emerging to menace the surface only through what
    abandoned tunnels and drainage ditches they might happen upon.
