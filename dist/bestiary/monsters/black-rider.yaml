Description:
  - >-
    The Black Rider has the most forbidding appearance of the Three Riders. He
    always appears in a frightening form when called to service. His judgments
    are the least recorded in history, as they are all performed under the cover
    of night, and many Irriseni citizens blame other vicious creatures and
    strange occurrences for the disappearance of their fellow citizens.
