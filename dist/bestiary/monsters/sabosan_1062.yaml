Description_Visual: >-
  A high-pitched sound like the opening of a rusty hinge cuts through the air as
  a grotesquely thin humanoid creature glides to the ground on broad, leathery
  wings. A bat-like head crowned in brown and black fur darts from side to side.
  Despite the creature's feral appearance, its eyes peer forward with keen and
  penetrating intelligence.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      A sabosan drains blood at the end of its turn if it grapples a foe,
      inflicting 1 Constitution damage. The sabosan prefer to drain helpless
      foes.
  - name: Dread Flight (Ex)
    description: >-
      A sabosan can use its Hover feat to create a dust cloud as if it were a
      Large creature, except the dust cloud only has a 30-foot radius.
  - name: Fell Shriek (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a sabosan can emit a deafening cry in a 30-foot
      cone. Creatures in this area must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be
      deafened for 1 minute. The sabosan are immune to this ability. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Powerful Charge (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a sabosan makes a charge, its attack deals extra damage (listed
      above) in addition to the normal benefits and hazards of a charge.
Description:
  - >-
    Sabosan (singular and plural) are an intelligent and evil race of bat-like
    humanoids that dwell in warm and isolated locations. A sabosan's emaciated
    frame belies a strength and agility not apparent from its gaunt appearance.
    Its giant, leathery wings can reach a span of almost 20 feet. Both males and
    females have red or dark brown fur on their heads, necks, chests, and backs.
    Male and female sabosan stand just under 6 feet and weigh only 150 pounds.
    Ecology Sabosan are vicious predators, combining human intelligence with a
    bat's natural adaptations for hunting. They favor warm climates, preferring
    to make their lairs in places that are inaccessible to most intruders, such
    as mountaintop crags, abandoned ruins, subterranean caverns near hidden hot
    springs, and the dense canopy of jungle trees. With wingspans almost three
    times their height, sabosan are agile and graceful fliers, capable of
    traveling miles on a single current of air in their dauntless search for
    prey. Although they can see as well as any human in daylight, sabosan hunt
    at twilight or after dark when their echolocation-based blindsense ability
    gives them a great advantage. Sabosan can also use their voices offensively,
    funneling their screeches into blasts of highpitched sound capable of
    deafening other creatures. When hunting en masse or attacking foes, a
    sabosan employs its fell shriek on adversaries while other sabosan use their
    massive wings to churn up great clouds of dust and debris, rendering foes
    deaf and blind. Despite such effective hunting and combat techniques, all
    sabosan appear gaunt and emaciated, as if constantly on the brink of
    starvation. Cursed with a fast metabolism, they must eat approximately three
    times as much as a human and supplement their diet with frequent
    blooddrinking in order to survive. Although they can feed on almost any
    creatures, sabosan take perverse glee in devouring other intelligent
    humanoids, seeing the blood of still-living humans or elves as a divine
    offering to their dead demon lord. Habitat & Society Sages debate the
    sabosan's origins. Some theorize that they are descendents of humans aff
    licted with vampirism whose bodies did not succumb to undeath, but still
    craved blood. Others contend that they were a tribe of humans who yearned
    for flight and were transformed in a corrupt mockery of their desire by a
    malevolent trickster god. Whatever their origins, the sabosan were once a
    great and populous race, living in the massive white-stone city of Jaytirian
    in the heart of the Mwangi Jungle. Here, the "dark-wings," as they were then
    called, worshiped the foul demon lord Vyriavaxus and the now forgotten sun
    god Easivra. When the Gorilla King and his angazhani followers marched on
    Jaytirian, the sabosan defended their city and drove the high girallons
    back, but the siege nearly destroyed them. Those that survived were forced
    to quit their home and spread to the far reaches of the Mwangi Expanse. In
    the centuries after the abandonment of Jaytirian, the other humanoid races
    of the Mwangi jungles came to know and fear the sabosan's shriek and thirst.
    Zenj tribesmen, jungle elves, and even the mysterious Umasi formed hunting
    parties to stalk and kill the blooddrinkers at the first sign of sabosan in
    their lands. Today, the sabosan live in small and isolated clans, having
    been hunted to the very precipice of extinction. Normally such groups
    consist of up to a dozen members, usually made up of some mated pairs and
    offspring of varied ages, invariably led by the best male hunter. Most
    sabosan still revere the demon lord Vyriavaxus, and thus chieftains also act
    as religious leaders, coordinating their tribe's attacks on other humanoids
    to appease the sabosan's bloodthirsty deity-usually these "priests" have no
    spellcasting ability, but a few have tapped into a source of arcane power or
    are granted spells by Zura, demon lord of blood and vampires. If outnumbered
    or overwhelmed, some clans will band together to defeat mutual enemies, but
    such alliances are always short-lived, as few regions are capable of
    supporting the dread hunger of more than one sabosan clan. Females usually
    have one breeding season per year, and after an 8-month gestation produce a
    single, flightless pup. Sabosan young achieve full use of their wings
    relatively quickly but spend the first months of their life clinging to the
    chest of either parent, where they can experience flight and taste the fresh
    blood of their parents' victims. Children achieve reproductive maturity in
    just under 10 years, at which time females and males alike take an unrelated
    clan member as a mate if the clan's territory can support them. Otherwise,
    the new adults leave the roost and search for smaller clans or-in the case
    of some males-for territories that can support the creation of a new clan.
    Upon reaching maturity, some brave-or foolish-sabosan challenge their clan's
    chieftain for leadership. If the challenge is accepted, the two sabosan
    engage in a bloody melee, eschewing all weapons to fight with their claws
    and savage fangs. The Bout of Challenge, as it is known, lasts until death
    or surrender. Most sabosan choose death above surrender, as losing the Bout
    of Challenge is to lose Vyriavaxus' favor and to no longer be considered a
    sabosan-and therefore not subject to the taboo against cannibalism. Vampire
    Sabosan A small number of sabosan leaders have the vampire spawn template,
    and are easily recognized by their graying hair and red eyes. These undead
    still thirst for blood like their living kin, but do not need to eat solid
    food, and thus the rest of a spawn's clan have a slightly better chance at
    survival. Because of their powers, these spawn usually lead their clans. Due
    to a quirk of how the vampire corruption interacts with sabosan bodies, most
    sabosan cannot be made into full vampires, and any attempt just results in a
    vampire spawn sabosan. Among the sabosan spawn, there is a legend of the
    "Night King," a true vampire of their kind who is destined to bring together
    the clans and break the back of the Gorilla King, seizing his lands for the
    sabosan and using his minions as food and slaves.
