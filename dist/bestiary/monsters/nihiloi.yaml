Description_Visual: >-
  A mass of black, bramble-like tentacles writhes from the back of this vague,
  shifting humanoid. Inky skin covers the creature, and ebon claws curve long
  and thin from the tips of its fingers.  Numerous tendrils of wispy shadow hold
  the creature aloft while others rise above its shoulders in strange, wriggling
  wings.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Broadcast (Su)
    description: >-
      Nihilois possess a selective type of long-distance telepathy. All nihilois
      can communicate telepathically with all other nihilois within 3 miles. An
      intermediary nihiloi can even pass messages between others of their race
      separated over long distances. They can also communicate telepathically
      with members of other races within 50 feet.
  - name: Malleable (Su)
    description: >-
      Nihilois exists as shadow, congealed into tangible but ever-twisting
      forms. Anytime a nihiloi is aware of imminent attack, it receives the
      benefit of 20% concealment, as it can warp and shift its body to avoid the
      blow.
  - name: See in Darkness (Su)
    description: >-
      Nihilois can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by a
      deeper darkness spell.
  - name: Shadow Crafting (Sp)
    description: >-
      Five times per day, when in an area of dim light or darkness, a nihiloi
      can manipulate shadow to reproduce an effect identical to shadow
      evocation. Typically, these effects are DC 19 to resist, but if both the
      nihiloi and its target are within areas of dim light or darkness, the DC
      increases by +2. This is a shadow effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Tendrils (Su)
    description: >-
      Once aware of enemies nearby, as a standard action, a nihiloi can unleash
      its tendrils in a haze of umbral whips that surrounds the area within 10
      feet of it. Any creature that enters this area takes 4d6+3 points of
      damage from dozens of deadly lashes (Reflex save DC 23 for half damage). A
      nihiloi must take an additional standard action to end this effect. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Violent xenophobes, the creatures typically called nihilois, devashades, or
    shadow lords pose a rising threat to interlopers into their umbral realm. In
    ages immemorial, these creatures enjoyed vast empires upon the mysterious
    Plane of Shadow, but through the millennia incursion by immigrants and
    interlopers have eroded their way of life and scattered their numbers. In
    the face of spellcasters from the Material Plane striding across their
    homeland-using it as little more than a umbral thoroughfare-and whole
    terrible races like kytons migrating to their native reaches, the nihilois
    have long retreated into the deepest darknesses of their realm. Yet as alien
    encroachment continues, slowly the nihilois have revealed themselves, and
    found to their surprise that they are powerful and feared.
  - >-
    Nihilois-as the first travelers from Golarion termed them, believing them to
    be members of an ancient mythical race-resemble gaunt, vaguely humanoid
    creatures shrouded in ever-writhing shadow stuff with fountains of dark
    tendrils jutting from their backs. They often hold these thin limbs in tight
    bunches that appear like strange, dense wings, but unfurl them easily and
    with shocking speed to lash out against their enemies.
  - >-
    Unable to vocalize words, nihilois are widely distrusted by creatures
    foreign to the Plane of Shadow. Even a pair of the shadowy natives is
    unsettling to those encountering them for the first time as they silently
    gesture and nod, holding secret councils few others can understand.
  - >-
    Creatures frequently interacting with them know the nihilois have a shared
    name for their race, though since these creatures speak only telepathically,
    the term sounds more like the passage of massive wings than a word
    pronounceable in most sentient tongues.
  - >-
    Ecology Artisans of the Plane of Shadow, with a near-peerless understanding
    of that realm, nihilois can, like sculptors, twist and manipulate the very
    fabric of their home plane. Birthed from the dark plane, these natives are
    as true inhabitants of their realms as the denizens of the Material Plane
    are of theirs. The ever-changing gloom of the plane permeates these
    creatures, and they likewise prove dark and changeable. Yet as the nature of
    shadow is to flee from the light, so too do nihilois find it natural to
    retreat from interlopers into their realm.
  - >-
    Having done so since times unrecorded, only in recent centuries has a new
    sentiment grown among these shadow lords, a feeling that they are losing an
    important battle and that both their survival and their realm are
    threatened. Thus, slowly over the span of centuries, resistance to foreign
    invaders has gradually become a hallmark of this mysterious race.
  - >-
    Nihilois, both male and female, stand nearly 7 feet tall, but often raise
    themselves up off the ground on coils of their dark tendrils. Those thick
    bunches of thin limbs that extend from their backs they typically hold
    together in dense clusters, causing them to appear like wings, but can
    unravel them and bring them to bear with incredible swiftness. Having a
    highly malleable form, nihilois are light, weighing an average of 65 pounds.
  - >-
    When angered, they can temporarily inflate themselves to appear larger,
    whipping their tendrils around in a fierce display. In addition to serving
    as weapons and locomotion, nihiloi tentacles are used to feed as well. When
    tightly wrapped around or within a meal, the tendrils secrete a digestive
    acid and absorb nutrients through tiny openings.
  - >-
    Habitat & Society Nihilois prove exceedingly rare, most having retreated to
    the farthest-flung depths of the Plane of Shadow where their numbers have
    dwindled. With rising frequency, though, many have shrugged off their race's
    fear of interlopers and come to lurk in the shadow reflections of cities on
    the Material Plane. In such eerie metropolises, groups of nihilois form
    tightly knit cells, with small groups potentially claiming districts as
    their own or splitting entire shadow cities between themselves. Quick to
    influence and master lesser shadow creatures-such as shadows, shadow garms,
    and fetchlings- nihilois can draw surprisingly large populations of shadow
    creatures to a single location. While large clusters of such beings don't
    overtly threaten the Material Plane, such is true only so long as the
    natives of that plane stay within their realm. Those spellcasters who step
    from their city homes onto the Plane of Shadow might find the land far less
    deserted than is typical for the plane, a realm of living shadow and
    hostile, glowing eyes. Outside such cities or group settings, lone nihilois
    hunt down interlopers into their realm, shadowing trespassers until the time
    is right to strike. While slaying such intruders satisfies their need for
    vengeance, all nihilois also seek out portals leading onto the Plane of
    Shadow and destroy such passages however they can, striving toward a day
    when all know to avoid the nighted realm.
