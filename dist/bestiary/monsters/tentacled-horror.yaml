SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Insanity (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures with less than 6 HD that view a tentacled horror must make a DC
      23 Will save or be affected as if by an insanity spell (caster level
      12th). Creatures of 2 HD or less are not only driven mad but are also
      compelled to worship the tentacled horror as a god (as if affected by a
      charm person spell, caster level 12th). Only a restoration, greater
      restoration, miracle, or wish spell can restore the mind of one driven
      insane by a tentacled horror. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes
      +2 for its Ability Focus feat.
  - name: Horn (Su)
    description: >-
      The source of a tentacled horror's power is its horn. If a tentacled
      horror's horn is removed, it loses its regeneration ability and suffers a
      -6 penalty to Strength and Constitution until the horn is reattached. The
      horn is AC 20, hardness 10, and has 20 hit points. A tentacled horror's
      horn cannot be removed unless it is helpless. It takes a successful DC 40
      Strength or 10 points of damage to the horn to remove a tentacled horror's
      horn.
Description:
  - >-
    Ancient and evil, a tentacled horror is a monstrosity from the unknown
    depths of the earth. This monster is most often found inhabiting dungeons or
    ruins far from the reaches of civilization.
  - >-
    Tentacled horrors are egotistical and lazy creatures, and put themselves
    above all others they encounter. Often, a tentacled horror that finds its
    way into a subterranean society will attempt to set itself up as a god.
  - >-
    Lesser creatures such as goblins often accept this false god and bring it
    sacrifices of living victims. Once ensconced as ruler-deity, a tentacled
    horror is content to remain in one place to be cared for by its subjects. A
    tentacled horror that has been in power for some time will be surrounded by
    a pool of its own slime and the scattered bones of its victims.
  - >-
    Exuding a foul oily slime wherever it goes, a tentacled horror has a
    powerful humanoid torso that ends in a thick slug-like foot. Sprouting from
    the torso are four whip-like tentacles tipped in cruel barbs. Most
    horrifying of all, however, is the face. A tentacled horror has a shapeless
    head with a single, huge, unblinking eye. The mouth of a tentacled horror is
    a yawning chasm of sharp teeth eager to sink into living flesh. Above the
    eye is a glistening black 2-foot long horn-the very source of the tentacled
    horror's power.
  - >-
    A tentacled horror attacks first with its tentacles, ripping and tearing at
    its opponent with the sharp barbs at the tip. Any grappled opponent is
    immediately bitten.
