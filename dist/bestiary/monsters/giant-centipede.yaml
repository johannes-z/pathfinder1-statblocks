    Giant centipedes attack nearly any living creatures with their poisonous
    jaws. These creatures adapt to many environments and feed voraciously on the
    local fauna, including humanoids. The coloration of giant centipedes mirrors
    that of normal centipedes and spans the spectrum, ranging from dull hues to
    bright reds and fiery oranges. Other species of giant centipedes exist as
    well, some smaller but most quite a bit larger. You can adjust the stats
    given here by changing Hit Dice and size (changing Strength, Dexterity, and
    Constitution as appropriate) to represent a wide range of giant centipede
    species. The following table lists the most common variants. Species CR Size
