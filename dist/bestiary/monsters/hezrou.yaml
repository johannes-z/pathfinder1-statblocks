SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Nausea (Ex)
    description: >-
      The noxious vapors and foul fluids that constantly weep and seethe from a
      hezrou's body are particularly heinous to those the creature grapples.
      Each round a creature is grappled by a hezrou, the grappled foe must make
      a DC 24 Fortitude save to avoid becoming nauseated. A creature nauseated
      in this manner remains nauseated until he succeeds on a DC 24 Fortitude
      save, or until a minute has passed during which he is not grappled by the
      hezrou, whichever condition comes first. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The hezrou dwells in the vast Abyssal swamps, mires, and waterways, equally
    at home on land and in the water. The presence of a hezrou has an obvious
    effect on the nearby flora and water, causing plant life to twist and knurl
    and infusing water with a foul odor and brackish taste- signs much easier to
    spot on the Material Plane than the Abyss. Long exposure to this corruption
    can cause vile transformations and hideous deformities. Often, entire
    backwater communities of deformed mutants owe their twisted countenances not
    as much to incest and poor breeding as they do to a hezrou's proximity.
    Although quite intelligent, a hezrou can fairly be said to waste its
    intellect. They prefer the simple pleasures-slumber, the thrill of torture,
    the bliss of feasting on a living meal, or the joy of feeling something
    beautiful breaking and crumbling in a clenched fist. They do not often seek
    to build empires or lead cults-although few hezrous would turn away
    prospective minions who came to serve the demon on their own. These
    monstrous and bestial creatures form from the souls of evil mortals who
    poisoned themselves, their kin, or their surroundings, such as drug addicts,
    assassins, and alchemists who cared not how their experiments polluted the
    environment.
