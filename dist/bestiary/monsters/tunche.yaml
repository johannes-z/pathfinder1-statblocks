Description:
  - >-
    A tunche is a bizarre forest creature with twisted feline legs, a dense body
    resembling jungle undergrowth, clawed arms like those of a praying mantis,
    and a head resembling a cross between a monstrous spider's head and a jungle
    orchid. Although it has plant and animal features, a tunche is neither plant
    nor animal and is immune to effects that specifically target such creatures.
    Considering itself the ultimate protector of the jungle, a tunche prowls its
    domain in search of any who might despoil this vibrant and lush environment.
    If a tunche encounters travelers who treat the jungle with proper respect,
    it might simply observe them or demand an offering in exchange for allowing
    them to pass through its territory. A tunche especially enjoys toying with
    its victims, using its magic to confuse and mislead its opponents. A tunche
    rarely kills a foe without toying with it first, unless the target is
    actively harming plants or animals. A tunche stands 20 feet tall and weighs
    4,000 pounds.
