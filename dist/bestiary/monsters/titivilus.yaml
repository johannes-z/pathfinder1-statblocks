SpecialAbilities:

      fear touch for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Titivilus the Confuser serves Lord Dispater as messenger and chamberlain. He
    is a very evil and malign duke. His ability to manipulate others is
    legendary throughout the Hells, and it is because of this gift that Dispater
    allows him to attend infernal meetings where dukes are normally prohibited.
  - >-
    Titivilus spends most of his days in his tower, Martyr's Curse, a large
    structure composed of blackened iron. When encountered away from his tower
    he usually has a small retinue of bearded devils or erinyes with him.
  - Titivilus stands 6 feet tall and weighs 220 pounds.
  - >-
    Titivilus prefers to avoid combat, if possible. If pressed, he attacks with
    his spell-like abilities, seeking to sew confusion and disorder among his
    adversaries. In close combat, he uses his longsword, but usually summons
    other devils before such combat occurs. If facing imminent defeat, Titivilus
    summons other devils to cover his escape.
