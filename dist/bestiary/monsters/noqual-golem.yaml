SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Construct Bane (Ex)
    description: >-
      A noqual golem deals an additional 2d6 points of damage against constructs
      (except other noqual golems) and undead created by feats or spells.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      A noqual golem is immune to and absorbs any spell or spell-like ability
      that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects
      function differently against the creature, as noted below. • A magical
      attack that deals electricity damage slows a noqual golem (as the slow
      spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. If the golem is under a haste
      effect, the attack breaks the haste effect instead. • A mage's disjunction
      spell staggers a noqual golem and negates its impeded magic ability for
      1d4 rounds.
  - name: Impeded Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      To successfully cast a spell within 60 feet of a noqual golem, a caster
      must make a concentration check (DC 25 + the level of the spell being
      cast). If the check fails, the noqual golem absorbs the spell.
  - name: Powerful Blows (Ex)
    description: >-
      A noqual golem inflicts 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus and threatens a
      critical hit on a 19-20 with its slam attacks.
  - name: Spell Absorption (Su)
    description: >-
      A noqual golem absorbs any spells blocked or dispelled by its impeded
      magic, immunity to magic, and spell sunder abilities. It heals 5 points of
      damage for every spell level absorbed. If the amount of healing would
      cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess
      as temporary hit points. Absorbing a spell gives the golem the benefits of
      haste (as the spell) for 1 round per spell level.
  - name: Spell Sunder (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature struck by a noqual golem's slam attack is targeted by dispel
      magic (CL 18th). It absorbs any spells so dispelled.
Description:
  - >-
    The construction of a noqual golem requires both a considerable supply of
    the skymetal noqual and the skill to overcome noqual's antipathy to
    dweomers. The resulting golem resembles an iron golem, but is larger and
    more nimble. Noqual golems impede magic by their mere presence, and their
    touch disrupts spells and magical constructs.
  - >-
    Nearly all noqual on Golarion lies under Numerian control. The artificers of
    Numeria prefer tinkering with technological constructs rather than magical
    ones, but nonetheless Furkas Xoud was believed to have created a noqual
    golem. Another is thought to serve the sorcerers of Starfall as a fail-safe
    should their technology prove inadequate. A cabal of cyphermages has taken
    advantage of the recent discovery of noqual near Riddleport to commence work
    on their own magic-stealing golem.
