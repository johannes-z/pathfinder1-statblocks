SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Resistance (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Ravager spawn possesses an innate resistance to effects that would kill
      or permanently incapacitate it, including petrification and imprisonment.
      Against such effects it is considered to automatically make any required
      saving throws.
  - name: Energy Resistance (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Ravager spawn possesses energy resistance against all forms of energy
      attack (fire, cold, electricity, acid, and sonic). Form-Shifting (Ex) A
      Ravager spawn can physically alter its physiology to take on one of the
      three listed forms: the crawler, the brawler, or the flier. Doing so takes
      one minute, and during this period it cannot take any other actions,
      though it is not considered helpless.
  - name: Magic Disruption (Su)
    description: >-
      Every time a Ravager spawn comes into contact with a spell or spell-like
      or supernatural effect, there is a chance as indicated above that the
      magic does not affect it. In the case of ongoing effects, a new check is
      made each round.
  - name: Regeneration (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Ravager spawn treats all damage as subdual, except damage from
      epic-level weapons and artifacts.
  - name: Vampiric Healing (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a Ravager spawn hits with a melee attack, it is healed hit points
      equal to half the damage it inflicts on its opponent. This ability cannot
      heal it above its natural maximum hit points. This ability extends to its
      trample special attack, where applicable.
Description:
  - >-
    The Ravager was created eons ago by a primeval race of beings who believed
    in the unity of three forces: body, mind, and spirit. In their ongoing war
    with another race of savages, they created several weapons of terrible
    power. The greatest of these is the living beast known only as the Ravager.
  - >-
    This beast was given incredible vitality, and the power to manipulate its
    own body to assume a form most advantageous to it: a crawling weasel-like
    form that can burrow, a hulking apelike humanoid form with greater reach and
    strength, and a winged form to allow it greater mobility and agility.
  - >-
    After being used once or twice on the battlefield, those who created it
    realized its awesome danger and contained it in the strongest prison they
    could devise, suspended in time until it would once again be needed.
  - >-
    However, due to the subsequent influence of Orcus near the vault where the
    Ravager was contained, the wards were damaged, and a taint of evil infected
    its quarantine. This has resulted in it reproducing asexually, and has
    granted the ravager an astonishing capacity for growth. For every week that
    it lives, it permanently gains 1 hit die. There is no known limit to how far
    this advancement can go before it either devastates the planet it lives on
    or collapses under its own weight.
