Description_Visual: >-
  This humanoid mountain of stone and earth strides forward on legs like
  pillars, a vast grove covering its back.
Group: Elemental
Source: Mythic Adventures
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Earth Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it
      and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or
      waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls.
      These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the
      elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.
  - name: Petrify (Su)
    description: >-
      If it hits a target with a slam attack, a mythic earth elemental can
      expend two uses of mythic power to permanently turn that target to stone.
      If the target succeeds at a DC 23 Fortitude save, it is slowed (as the
      spell) for 1d6 rounds instead of petrified. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Stun (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a mythic earth elemental strikes an opponent with two slams in 1 round,
      that creature must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d6
      rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Trap Weapon (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mythic earth elemental's body traps manufactured weapons that damage it.
      A manufactured weapon that deals hit point damage to the elemental (after
      subtracting its DR) is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds at a DC 30
      Reflex save. A creature can spend a standard action to attempt a DC 30
      Strength check to remove a stuck weapon. Weapons that deal only
      bludgeoning damage are immune to this ability. The elemental can release
      any number of stuck weapons as a free action. The save DC is
      Strength-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Infused with the power and wisdom of the deepest, oldest stone, a mythic
    elder earth elemental is a rocky bulwark against progress and change. They
    use innate magic and their very bodies to block enemy advances and preserve
    treasures of the earth.
