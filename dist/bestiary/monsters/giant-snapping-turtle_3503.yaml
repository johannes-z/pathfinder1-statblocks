Description:
  - >-
    Giant snapping turtles are very large and very aggressive versions of their
    smaller cousins. They are found in large lakes, rivers, and inland seas. The
    average giant snapping turtle is 40 feet in diameter, but they can grow to a
    diameter of 75 feet.
  - >-
    A giant snapping turtle lurks near the shore or on the bottom of a body of
    water, where it remains motionless and hidden in its shell. When prey passes
    near, it shoots its neck out and bites.
