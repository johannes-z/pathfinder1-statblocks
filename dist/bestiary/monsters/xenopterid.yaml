  - name: Entangling Slime (Ex)
    description: >-
      A xenopterid can produce a sticky, slimy secretion it uses to protect its
      territory and eggs. The xenopterid can slime up to a 10-foot-square area
      per day at a rate of 1 square foot per minute. For 1 week thereafter, any
      creature coming in direct contact with the slime must succeed at a DC 19
      Strength check or be entangled and glued to it as if it had failed its
      save against a tanglefoot bag. The save DC is Constitution-based.

      Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Xenopterids are human-sized predatory insects with the insidious ability to
    mimic the form of their favorite prey-humanoids. Xenopterids can be
    encountered nearly anywhere they can find food, quickly adapting their
    mimicry to resemble whatever humanoids are most common in a particular
    region. They can bend their wings to form cowls and cloaks, and they can
    fold their limbs to imitate humanoids' weapons and armor. A xenopterid's
    eeriest feature is its mouth-a crude chitinous beak that, when closed,
    resembles a human face. Up close, the xenopterid's unsettling nature is
    obvious, but from a distance or in dim light, the creature easily passes for
    its prey. Because their mimicking abilities require concealment, xenopterids
    commonly hunt their prey at night. Once a xenopterid captures and kills a
    victim, it liquefies the creature's remains in order to bring the putrid
    slurry back to the hive where it stuffs this substance into small spherical
    capsules the creatures use as food. Some evil races prize these capsules,
    and make gruesome liquors by fermenting the contents. Xenopterids live in
    colonies in abandoned ruins, old castles, decrepit farmsteads, and similarly
    abandoned human structures. A colony typically consists of 19 to 28 sterile
    drones and a fertile hive king and hive queen (xenopterids with the advanced
    creature simple template). Each colony has only one fertile male, so
    xenopterids reproduce slowly. Still, the only way to destroy a xenopterid
    colony is to kill both the king and the queen, and neither one of them ever
    leaves the safety of the hive. Xenopterid drones become fiercely aggressive
    when defending the hive against invaders.
