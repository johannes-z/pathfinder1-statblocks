Description:
  - >-
    The true nightmare of the sea is the megalodon, a shark that represents the
    pinnacle of this species' evolution. Horrifying in its immense size and
    ruinous appetite, the megalodon is certainly the beast behind many legends
    of enormous fish who swallow ships whole. A megalodon is 60 feet long and
    weighs 100,000 pounds.
