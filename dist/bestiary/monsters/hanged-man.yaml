SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Drag (Ex)
    description: >-
      If the hanged man entangles a foe with his rope attack, it drags its
      opponent 10 feet closer as a standard action on each subsequent round that
      it succeeds on a CMB check (including a +5 racial bonus) without provoking
      attacks of opportunity. When an opponent is dragged within 5 feet, the
      hanged man can attack with both of its claws in the same round. It gains a
      +4 attack bonus against opponents entangled in its rope.
  - name: Entangle (Su)
    description: >-
      The hanged man's noose is a 20-ft. length of rope that entangles opponents
      of any size as an animate rope spell (CL 15th, DC 21). A hanged man can
      lash its rope outward 20 feet with no range penalty. The rope functions
      only for the hanged man it belongs to and no other. It has AC 22, hardness
      10, hp 10, and DR 5/slashing. If the rope is severed, both it and the
      hanged man are destroyed. The save DC is Strength-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A hanged man is the restless corpse of an evil humanoid that was hanged or
    the spirit of one wrongfully accused of a crime and hanged. It is a
    malevolent and vengeful creature that attacks living creatures on sight.
  - >-
    Hanged men are usually encountered near the area where they were killed or
    in cemeteries, mausoleums, or graveyards where their body was laid to rest.
    They prey on the living and are found near civilized areas where their food
    supply is plentiful. Its lair is either its final resting place or a
    secluded and overgrown area near the place of its death. Its lair is always
    scattered with the remains of its victims, including any treasure a former
    meal happened to be carrying.
  - >-
    A hanged man attacks primarily with its rope, which has become imbued with
    negative energy and now acts as an extension of the hanged man itself. It
    uses its rope to capture victims and draw them in where it rips and tears
    them to shreds with its filthy claws.
