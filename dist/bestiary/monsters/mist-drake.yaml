SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fogburst (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a mist drake can expel a ball of solid mist that
      explodes into a cloud of fog upon impact. This attack has a range of 60
      feet and deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a
      20-foot radius (Reflex DC 16 half). A flying creatures that fails its
      Reflex save is pushed 1d4 x 5 feet from the center of the fogburst's area
      of effect (taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet if it strikes a solid
      object), while creatures on the ground are knocked prone on a failed save.
      The area of effect of the fogburst is filled with mist (as obscuring mist)
      for 1d4 rounds after impact. Once a mist drake has used its fogburst
      attack, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Fogvision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mist drake can see normally through any form of natural or magical mist,
      fog, or precipitation.
  - name: Misty Camouflage (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mist drake can use Stealth to hide whenever it is in or adjacent to an
      area of mist, even while being observed.
  - name: Speed Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a swift action, a mist drake can draw on its
      draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that enables it to
      take an additional move action in that round.
Description:
  - >-
    Mist drakes are less openly aggressive than most drakes, as they are not as
    physically strong and imposing as most of their kin. Their bodies are narrow
    and serpentine, more suited for quick strikes and hit-and-run tactics than
    for close combat. However, they excel at stealth for creatures of their
    size, and can expel a burst of thick fog whenever they need to create a
    diversion or screen themselves from archers trying to target them. In the
    mist, they move swiftly and silently to disperse groups of foes with their
    explosive breath and then single out one of their enemies for a quick and
    deadly attack before their victim's allies can regroup and come to its
    rescue. Mist drakes mate only once few decades, but are more caring parents
    than others of their ilk. After the clutch of two to six eggs hatch, the
    hatchlings stay with their mother for up to 20 years before seeking out
    their own hunting territory. Mist drakes live up to 200 years. A typical
    mist drake is 13 feet long from head to tail tip, but these lithe dragons
    rarely weigh more than 1,000 pounds.
