Description:
  - >-
    The rhinoceros feeds on leafy plants, branches, and even thorny shrubs. Its
    thick hide is a mottled gray color, and it can run surprisingly fast for a
    beast of its size. The rhinoceros is notoriously short-tempered and prone to
    attacking anything it perceives as approaching too closely (generally within
    a distance of 80 feet-the distance of a single charge-for most rhinos).
