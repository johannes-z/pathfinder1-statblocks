    Snapping turtles are water-dwelling reptiles known for their propensity to
    bite anyone they deem threatening. Adult snapping turtles are usually about
    1-1/2 feet in diameter. A spellcaster who can acquire a familiar can choose
    a snapping turtle as a familiar. A snapping turtle familiar grants its
    master a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saves. Giant Snapping Turtle Companions
