  - name: Create Soldiers (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Latten Mechanism can create up to four clockwork soldiers

      ranks in Craft (clockwork). All Craft skills are class skills for Latten
      Mechanism.
Description:
  - >-
    Latten Mechanism is a defender of constructs and crafters, a living siege
    engine who prefers the solitude of research and invention to the
    distractions of battle. Given a massive insectile form to allow it to
    perform all of its necessary functions, Latten Mechanism's only humanlike
    feature is the androgynous face built into the top of its insectile head.
    Able to tear open castle gates, create iron walls, scoop up enemies and
    crush them in its body, reshape the very earth it stands on, and form
    complex objects out of raw materials or thin air, Latten Mechanism is a
    versatile engine of creation and destruction guided by a mechanical
    conscience that values constructs as much as it does intelligent living
    creatures.
  - >-
    The herald sees itself as a protective parent of all constructs, especially
    intelligent ones, and never uses its powers to destroy artificial beings
    unless it has no other choice; it prefers to neutralize or sideline these
    opponents until it has the opportunity to reprogram or repurpose them. Much
    as a true champion of freedom loathes charm spells for temporarily enslaving
    a person's free will, Latten Mechanism believes spells such as control
    construct are a violation of a sentient construct's free will, and only uses
    them as a last resort to peacefully end a threat. When confronted by a
    dangerous construct in an enemy's service, Latten Mechanism has been known
    to render the construct helpless and flee with it, returning to deal with
    the construct's master at a later time. The herald is a legend among
    intelligent constructs, and many come to Brigh's faith after witnessing or
    experiencing its generosity and leniency.
  - >-
    The herald doesn't speak in battle, as it prefers to fool its opponents into
    mistaking it for a mindless clockwork foe. Outside of combat, it's curious
    about its allies' inventions
  - >-
    and crafting projects, and it can provide many insights into how the ally
    might overcome various obstacles to achieve greater successes (although it
    sometimes needs a few minutes to update its mind with knowledge suitable for
    the conversation). It can speak equally well out of its termite or humanoid
    mouth, and sometimes uses both in the same conversation, adding deep
    emphasis to certain words with its inhuman vocal apparatus. Both voices have
    a metallic, echoing twang.
  - >-
    The herald's proper name is Latten Mechanism, although it answers to either
    part of its name individually, or even if its name is used as a title ("the
    Latten Mechanism"). Its programming allows it to recognize flattery,
    insults, and threats, although it doesn't really understand the motivations
    for such things. The easiest way to anger it is to treat it like an
    unfeeling, unthinking machine or suggest that it could be parceled into
    useful parts (in the same way that a dragon would object to a casual
    discussion of how its hide could be made into armor).
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Latten Mechanism is a created being that has no need to eat or drink. Though
    it has a need for occasional maintenance to prevent its delicate mechanical
    parts from seizing up or breaking down, it's effectively immortal. It has no
    need to reproduce, but it treats all constructs it builds (even the
    temporary ones) as beloved pets, and is saddened if they are damaged,
    destroyed, or otherwise compromised. It feels kinship toward mortals who
    create constructs, so long as those creators are respectful toward their
    inventions.
  - >-
    The herald has no particular attachment to any mortal race or country,
    although it has spent more time among humans and the people of Alkenstar
    than any other kind or place. It holds neither aversion nor affinity to
    undead creatures-it considers reusing dead body parts to create
  - >-
    new entities essentially similar to reusing metal or wood from a destroyed
    construct to repair or build another.
  - >-
    Because it became self-aware only when Brigh built it out of inanimate
    parts, it has no fear of death-for it, death is the same as the state of
    non-consciousness it existed in before its activation. If it was destroyed,
    but Brigh needed its abilities once more, the goddess would recreate and
    reawaken it; from the herald's perspective, this wouldn't even be an
    interruption of its consciousness.
  - >-
    Latten Mechanism has a fondness for small clockwork objects and wind-up
    toys, such as rolling carts, hopping animals, and music boxes. It collects
    these treasures much the way noble's child might collect elaborate dolls. A
    priest who offers such a thing as part of a payment when the herald is
    called is likely to gain the herald's support, especially if the device
    features a clever mechanism, such as a dragon toy that utilizes a smokestick
    to create a miniature breath weapon, or a mechanical spider that utilizes a
    tanglefoot bag to catch bugs with tiny bursts of sticky webbing.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    The herald spends most of its time on Axis mixing with Brigh's other
    servitors and pursuing its own research projects. It enjoys the company of
    axiomites and inevitables, respecting their non-biological anatomies and
    ever curious about their devotion to law. It sometimes directly intervenes
    in the mortal world by soothing a rampaging construct that might
    accidentally kill a genius inventor, but otherwise limits its interactions
    to those commanded by Brigh.
  - >-
    Among the servitors of Brigh, Latten Mechanism is admired for its crafting
    skills and devotion to all artificial creatures. Some servitors who become
    melancholy and long to become true flesh beings seek counsel from the
    herald, hoping to gain a better appreciation of their mechanical bodies and
    the uniqueness of their souls.
