SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Capsize (Ex)
    description: >-
      An old or older brine dragon can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by
      ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check
      is 25 or the result of the boat captain's Profession (sailor) check,
      whichever is higher. For each size category larger the ship is than the
      brine dragon's size, the dragon takes a cumulative -10 penalty on the
      check.
  - name: Desiccating Bite (Su)
    description: >-
      An ancient brine dragon's bite causes weakness, dealing 1d2 points of
      Strength drain in addition to its normal damage. A great wyrm's bite deals
      1d4 points of Strength drain. A Fortitude save (DC equals the dragon's
      breath weapon save DC) negates the Strength drain.
  - name: Painful Strikes (Su)
    description: >-
      A great wyrm brine dragon's natural attacks are so laden with salt and
      acidic crystals that every time it strikes a creature with one of these
      attacks, the target must make a Fortitude save (DC equals the dragon's
      breath weapon save DC) or be stunned for a round from the pain. Spell-like
  - name: Abilities (Sp)
    description: >-
      A brine dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will
      (unless indicated otherwise) at the listed age. Very young-speak with
      animals (fish only); Young- obscuring mist; Juvenile-water breathing;
      Adult-control water; Ancient-horrid wilting (3/day); Great wyrm-tsunami*
      (3/day).
Description:
  - >-
    Although not inherently evil, brine dragons have little patience for
    kindness and philanthropy. As they age, they grow more and more opinionated
    and obsessed with power-by adult age, a brine dragon counts itself a failure
    if it doesn't rule over a collection of "lesser beings" such as humans,
    merfolk, locathah, or even sahuagin.
