  This shifting mass of green seaweed transforms from the shape of a humanoid
  back to a patch of algae, continually changing.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Grab (Ex)
    description: >-
      A sargassum fiend can grab Huge or smaller foes, and has a +8 racial bonus
      on grapple checks rather than the normal +4 bonus most creatures with grab
      possess.
  - name: Mirage (Su)
    description: >-
      A sargassum fiend emits a powerful scent that causes specific, miragelike
      hallucinations. All creatures within 300 feet of a sargassum fiend must
      make a DC 18 Will save or become enraptured by the scent. An enraptured
      creature sees the monster as whatever would most compel it to approach.
      This might be a lost loved one, a child in need of help, an enchanting
      mermaid, the promise of dry land, and so on. The extent of this illusion
      functions as mirage arcana (CL equals the sargassum's CR), but is a
      mind-affecting phantasm, not a glamer. This effect ends immediately if the
      plant makes an attack against any target. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A sargassum fiend is a free-f loating mass of intelligent seaweed capable of
    luring its victims to their deaths via a powerful hallucinogenic pheromone.
    Once the sargassum fiend lures prey within striking distance, it grabs the
    entranced creature and attempts to crush it to death. Experienced sailors
    tell tales of entire crews jumping overboard to swim out to a murderous
    field of the sea plants.
  - >-
    The strange pheromone produced by a sargassum fiend can be harvested from
    the numerous bulbs that grow within the fiend's body, but these bulbs rot
    quickly once harvested. A fresh bulb lasts for 1 hour before becoming
    useless; until that point it can be crushed as a standard action to produce
    a mirage effect as detailed above. A single sargassum fiend generally has
    1d6 bulbs of musk when slain-harvesting one requires a DC 29 Survival check.
    To date, no alchemical or magical process has successfully preserved this
    musk.
  - >-
    Sargassum fiends usually reach sizes up to 10 feet in diameter before
    splitting, their means of asexual reproduction. Mutations have been known to
    exist, however, and sea-faring scholars have recorded individual sargassum
    fiends reaching masses of truly enormous size, up to Colossal. Such enormous
    sargassum fiends can be created by advancing their Hit Dice by a minimum of
    5 HD per size increase step.
