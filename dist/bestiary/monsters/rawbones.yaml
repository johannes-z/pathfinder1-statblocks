Description_Visual: >-
  Skulking towards you is what appears to be a freshly skinned and cleaned
  corpse. It is a bloody, skeletal creature with bits of flesh and muscle still
  clinging to its wet bones. Its entrails and organs hang loosely in its torso,
  sometimes even dropping out entirely. Its eyes roll about in its eye sockets
  as it seeks its prey.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Nauseating Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A rawbones emanates a sickening aura that reeks of death in a 20-foot
      radius. Any creature that comes within that area must succeed on DC 19
      Fortitude save or become nauseated for as long as they remain within the
      area a 1 minute after leaving the area. A creature that makes a successful
      save is immune to the nauseating aura of that rawbones for one day. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Strangulation (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a rawbones hits an opponent of up to one size larger with its
      entrails lash, it can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
      without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it succeeds on its grapple
      check, it establishes a hold and deals 1d4 points of strangulation damage
      per round in addition to normal damage to the grappled opponent each round
      that the hold is maintained.
  - name: Vomit Gore (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a rawbones can spit a blast of blood and gore in a
      20-foot cone that deals 7d6 points of damage (DC 19 Reflex save for half).
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A rawbones is an undead creature that comes into being when a tortured
    person rises from the grave. Rawbones are commonly found in ancient dungeons
    that hold old torture chambers and prison cells. Some are also found
    haunting the local cemeteries where a tortured person was laid to rest.
    While disgusting in appearance, there is something in the magic (or evil) of
    a rawbones that keeps it looking â€˜fresher' that most of its other undead
    kin.
  - >-
    Like many undead, rawbones despise the living and seek to harm such
    creatures whenever they can. A rawbones is generally a solitary creature
    though it is possible more than one could be encountered together (e.g., an
    ancient dungeon where a mass torture/execution took place or a mass grave
    where tortured and broken bodies where laid to rest).
  - A rawbones stands 6 to 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs roughly 140 pounds.
  - >-
    Its bones are stained red with fresh blood which seems to continually weep
    from the creature's body. Bits of flesh and muscle fall away from it as it
    moves about and its entrails often drag the ground behind it or are wrapped
    around the creature's forearms.
  - A rawbones speaks Common and at least one other language.
  - >-
    A rawbones attacks primarily with its powerful fists, but it has other
    weapons at its disposal. It can vomit forth a horrifying spray of blood and
    gore or use its entrails as a ranged weapon which it loops around an
    opponent's neck in an attempt to strangle it. While battling its foes, it
    attempts to keep them within range of its nauseating aura.
  - >-
    A rawbones' natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of
    overcoming damage reduction.
