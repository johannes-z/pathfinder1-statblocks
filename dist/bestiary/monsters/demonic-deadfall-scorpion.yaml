Description_Visual: >-
  This oversized vermin bears demonic features and the unmistakable glint of
  intelligence in its eyes.
Group: Demonic Vermin
Source: The Worldwound
IsTemplate: 1
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sting-injury; save Fort DC 21; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4
      Str damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Sudden Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      During a surprise round, a demonic deadfall scorpion may act as if it had
      a full round to act, rather than just one standard action.
Description:
  - >-
    Deskari's influence upon the Worldwound's verminous life cannot be ignored
    for long by visitors to this tainted land. While some giant vermin have
    resisted Deskari's influence, most have succumbed to it. Such creatures are
    almost always encountered along the Worldwound's periphery. As one travels
    deeper into the blighted land, the immense insects, spiders, and other
    vermin encountered in the canyons and rivers take on an increasingly
    unsettling intelligence and demonic features. In many ways, these demonic
    vermin are no longer true denizens of the Material Plane-they are, after a
    fact, what happens when the chaos and evil of the Abyss infuse a mindless
    creature. They are the unholy spawn of vermin-and mortal sins.
  - >-
    Countless variations of demonic vermin exist in the forbidding wasteland
    that is the Worldwound. When a nest of similar monsters is encountered, they
    all typically share the same demonic powers and traits, but another nest of
    the same species could exhibit entirely different abilities, depending on
    the nature of the Abyssal energies that have corrupted and transformed them.
    Uncorrupted giant vermin that wander into or are otherwise brought into the
    Worldwound do not immediately fall victim to this vile transformation, but
    several months of exposure can, at the GM's whim, cause such creatures to
    spontaneously transform into one of these hideous monstrosities.
  - Creating a Demonic Vermin
  - >-
    "Demonic vermin" is an inherited or acquired template that can be added to
    any vermin (hereafter referred to as the base creature). A demonic vermin
    retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as
    noted here.
  - 'CR: Same as the base creature +1.'
  - 'Alignment: Chaotic evil.'
  - >-
    Type: The creature's type changes to magical beast. Do not recalculate HD,
    BAB, or saves. While a demonic vermin is not an outsider, it is treated as
    if it had the demon subtype for the purposes of resolving all effects
    relating to that subtype.
  - 'Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +2.'
  - >-
    Special Qualities and Defenses: A demonic vermin gains immunity to
    electricity and poison and resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10. It
    also gains DR 5/cold iron (if 11 HD or less) or DR 10/cold iron (if 12 HD or
    more). As demonic vermin are intelligent, they lose the mindless trait.
  - >-
    Melee: A demonic vermin's natural weapons are unchanged, but they are
    treated as chaotic and evil for the purpose of resolving damage reduction.
  - >-
    Special Attacks: A demonic vermin retains all the special attacks of the
    base creature. In addition, it gains one of the following special abilities
    of your choosing- you can, of course, invent different abilities of your own
    as well. The save DC for any of these attacks is equal to 10 + 1/2 the
    demonic vermin's HD + the demonic vermin's Constitution modifier.
  - >-
    Abyssal Energy (Su): Choose one of the following energy types-acid, fire, or
    cold. The demonic vermin gains immunity to that energy type, and also gains
    a breath weapon that inflicts that type of energy damage. This breath weapon
    is a 60-foot-line, and deals 1d6 points of damage per CR point possessed by
    the demonic vermin (Reflex save halves). It can be used once every 1d4
    rounds.
  - >-
    Additional Senses (Ex): The vermin has a large number of extra eyes and
    other sensory organs. It gains all-around vision, scent, and a +8 racial
    bonus on Perception checks.
  - >-
    Death Throes (Su): When the vermin is slain, it can make a single melee
    attack (using any one of its natural attacks) as an immediate action. It
    then explodes into acid, fire, electricity, or cold (your choice), dealing
    1d6 points of damage per CR point possessed by the demonic vermin (Reflex
    save halves).
  - >-
    Diseased (Su): The demonic vermin is immune to disease, and its natural
    attacks inflict demonplague (see page 29) on a hit (Fortitude save negates).
  - >-
    Drone (Su): By rubbing its wings or limbs together as a standard action, the
    demonic vermin produces a loud, discordant drone that causes those within 30
    feet of it to become sickened (if the vermin is CR 8 or less) or confused
    (if the vermin is CR 9 or higher) for 1d6 rounds (Will save negates). This
    is a sonic mind-affecting effect.
  - >-
    Skitter (Ex): The creature has uncanny speed and erratic movements. The
    vermin's speeds all increase by 10 feet, it gains Mobility and Spring Attack
    as bonus feats, and it gains a +4 racial bonus on Initiative checks.
  - >-
    Spell-Like Abilities: In addition to gaining one of the special attacks
    listed here, all demonic vermin gain access to a limited number of
    spell-like abilities, depending on its Hit Dice. Each ability is usable once
    per day. Caster level equals the creature's CR.
  - CR Abilities
  - 1-4 darkness
  - 5-8 vomit swarmAPG
  - 9-12 insect plague
  - 13-16 greater teleport (self plus 50 lbs. of objects only)
  - 17-20 earthquake
  - >-
    Abilities: Str +4, Con +2. A demonic vermin's Intelligence becomes 10 and
    its Charisma becomes 15 (unless the base creature has higher values, in
    which case they remain unchanged).
  - >-
    Feats: A demonic vermin gains feats as appropriate for its Hit Dice, and
    gains Toughness as a bonus feat.
  - >-
    Skills: A demonic vermin has skill points per racial Hit Die equal to 4 +
    its Intelligence modifier. The following are class skills for demonic
    vermin: Acrobatics, Bluff, Climb, Fly, Knowledge (planes), Perception, Sense
    Motive, and Stealth.
  - >-
    Languages: A demonic vermin speaks Abyssal, Celestial, and Draconic. It also
    gains telepathy to a distance of 100 feet.
