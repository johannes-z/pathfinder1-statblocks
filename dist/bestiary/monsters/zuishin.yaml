SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Healing Arrow (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a zuishin can infuse an arrow it fires to carry any of
      the following effects: breath of life, cure light wounds, heal, neutralize
      poison, remove curse, remove disease, or restoration. Using one of these
      effects consumes a use of the same spell-like ability. The zuishin must
      make a touch attack to deliver the effect to the target-the target takes
      no damage from the arrow.
  - name: Holy Weapons (Su)
    description: >-
      Any weapon wielded by a zuishin is treated as if it had the holy special
      ability. A zuishin creates arrows out of nothing as part of its attacks
      with any bow it wields.
Description:
  - >-
    While all kami are enemies of oni, none are so fervent as the zuishin. Known
    also as shrine kami, zuishin take as their wards gates, doorways, religious
    places, and the spiritual archways known as torii, ensuring that the gates
    are respected. Zuishin can use many weapons, but tend to favor the bow. A
    zuishin treats its equipment with utmost care, viewing weapons as extensions
    of itself. It never discards its bow voluntarily; if the weapon is ever lost
    or destroyed, a zuishin can craft a new one in a month.
  - >-
    Zuishin treat other kami with respect, and are always willing to lend a
    helping hand. Creatures other than kami must earn a zuishin's trust before
    receiving its aid, and do so by honoring the gate it guards or providing an
    offering to the kami, such as a tree branch or other small piece of nature.
  - >-
    Zuishin manifest as suits of armor with a partly manifest warrior within,
    and wield glowing weapons. They stand 5 feet tall and weigh 120 pounds.
