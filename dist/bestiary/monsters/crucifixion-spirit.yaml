SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Crucify Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      Five times per day as an attack action a crucifixion spirit can point at a
      single living target within 60 feet and crucify its soul. This requires
      the crucifixion spirit to succeed at a ranged touch attack. If successful,
      the target's soul is ripped from its body, which collapses in a heap on
      the ground. The target's soul appears as a translucent copy of the victim
      and is suspended above the spot its body collapsed, crucified in midair to
      a translucent, "X" shaped structure, the soul held in place by translucent
      spikes or nails. The victim is not dead and is visible to all those
      viewing it. A crucified soul cannot be attacked or affected by anything,
      cannot take any actions (other than trying to escape, see below), and
      experiences excruciating pain that deals 2 negative levels to it in the
      round it is crucified, and one negative level each round thereafter. The
      Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 22. The save DCs are
      Charisma-based. A crucifixion spirit does not need to concentrate on this
      ability for it to continue to affect a target. It can direct attacks
      against a different opponent. A crucified creature can attempt to escape
      each round by making a DC 22 Will save. If successful, the creature's soul
      is freed from its torment and returns to its body in the same round. The
      target is stunned for one round, but afterwards can act normally. A
      creature slain with this ability cannot be returned to life except through
      the casting of a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell. Even then,
      there is a 50% chance that such magic fails. If the check fails, the
      creature cannot be restored to life by mortal magic.
  - name: Immune Channel Energy (Ex)
    description: >-
      A crucifixion spirit takes no damage from the channel energy ability, and
      is not affected by effects that mimic channel energy or are based on the
      channel energy ability (such as turn undead and command undead).
Description:
  - >-
    Crucifixion spirits are the ghostly remains of living beings executed
    through crucifixion. Their soul having not entirely departed the Material
    Plane, has risen to seek vengeance on the living, particularly clerics or
    other divine spellcasters whom they blame for forsaking them and allowing
    them to die in such a ghastly manner.
  - >-
    Crucifixion spirits are most often encountered within 1,000 feet of the
    place of their execution, though some are found haunting burial grounds
    (presumably the place where their fleshly body was laid to rest). Their only
    purpose seems to be to torment and kill any that cross their path.
  - >-
    They hold no memories of their former life, save the pain and suffering they
    endured at their time of execution, and they want all those they encounter
    to share in this pain.
  - >-
    A crucifixion spirit engages any living creature that enters its territory.
    It has no qualms about attacking creatures much larger or stronger than it.
    In combat, the crucifixion spirit's hatred for clerics and divine
    spellcasters becomes apparent as they are usually the first ones to feel the
    effects of its crucify soul ability. A crucified soul is left to die and the
    crucifixion spirit turns its attention to another opponent. A crucifixion
    spirit attacks until it is destroyed or its foes are slain or driven off.
