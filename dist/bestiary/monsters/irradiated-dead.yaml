Description_Visual: >-
  This humanoid creature's pale orange, withered skin peels from its flesh in
  patches. Its yellow eyes stare, unblinking but seething with rage.
Source: AP 87
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoid creature that is slain by an irradiated dead's radiation
      becomes an irradiated dead itself in 1d4 rounds. Spawn so created are less
      powerful than typical irradiated dead, taking a -2 penalty on all d20
      rolls and having 2 fewer hit points per Hit Die. Spawn are under the
      command of the irradiated dead that created them and remain enslaved until
      its destruction, at which point they lose their spawn penalties to d20
      rolls and become full-fledged and free-willed irradiated dead. They don't
      possess any of the abilities they had in life.
  - name: Radioactive (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature that comes in contact with an irradiated dead risks infection
      from the radiation that consumes the creatures. Any creature hit by an
      irradiated dead's slam attack or radioactive spew risks infection, as does
      any creature who touches an irradiated dead. On a failed saving throw, the
      target is affected by medium radiation and radiates low radiation in a
      10-foot radius for as long as it remains afflicted. For more information
      on radiation, see page 55 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology
      Guide. This is a poison effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.
      Radiation: Slam-contact; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds;
      effect 1d4 Con drain; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Radioactive Spew (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a standard action, an irradiated dead can spew a
      15-foot cone of irradiated viscera from its mouth. Creatures in the area
      take 2d6 points of acid damage and are subjected to the creature's
      radiation. A successful DC 18 Reflex save halves the damage. Creatures
      that takes damage from this effect are subject to the irradiated dead's
      radioactive special ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Little more than orange-tinted, blistered flesh drawn across skeletons, the
    irradiated dead were once humanoids- mainly Kellid warriors-who have been
    tainted by the radiation that's strewn across Numeria. Created as a result
    of experiments by members of the Technic League, a handful of irradiated
    dead escaped their restraints and set off across Numeria, creating more of
    their kind with each kill. With the strange chemicals and radiation coursing
    through their bodies and augmenting survival and hunting instincts, they
    scour the Numerian wastes in search of prey. Irradiated dead generally
    appear the same size as the humanoids they once were, but they weigh less
    due to their bodies have been ravaged by radiation.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    The secretive cabal known as the Technic League has always looked for ways
    to bolster its military power beyond the use of the gearsmen. Over the past
    couple centuries, the League's members have made numerous foul discoveries
    by studying the strange relics, technologies, and chemicals collected from
    the ruins of Divinity.
  - >-
    Originally conceived by a Technic League lieutenant as more reliable and
    easily replaceable minions than the gearsmen, the irradiated dead were the
    result of a series of experiments conducted in the shadow of the Silver
    Mount. The lieutenant was skilled in the use of necromancy magic, a study
    not normally mastered by Technic League members. She gathered a group of the
    strongest young warriors in Starfall-all of whom sought to make names for
    themselves in the service of the Black Sovereign-and subjected them to round
    after round of brutal endurance tests, injections of chemicals and drugs,
    savage bloodletting, and forced starvation until their bodies couldn't take
    any more.
  - >-
    The lieutenant administered to the warriors a number of chemical compounds
    recovered from a medical bay within Silver Mount that were originally
    intended to aid the crew of the Divinity in surviving in strange and hostile
    environments. Lacking full understanding of what they were working with, the
    lieutenant and her apprentices mixed and distilled these strange chemicals
    into a viscous, orange fluid that augmented physical strength and
    coordination while also thickening the outer layers of skin to a rocklike
    hardness. She believed that replacing the subjects' blood with the orange
    liquid, along with
  - >-
    controlled exposure to a smashed piece of wreckage leaking radiation, would
    yield the obedient soldiers she desired. When the first two test subjects
    completed the regimen, they awoke with a savage hunger for the flesh of
    their kind and rose up to fight her. The lieutenant escaped that first trial
    with only the loss of her right eye and her right hand just above the wrist.
    Her two apprentices were not so lucky. Subsequent refinements and tests
    yielded no better results. Though these latest test subjects retained their
    free will, their hunger for raw flesh was just as potent as the earlier
    attempts. And as they're generally more powerful than their Technic League
    creators, the irradiated dead saw no reason to serve their creators in any
    way.
  - >-
    Not long after these experiments, several irradiated dead were turned loose
    or escaped. Rumors persist within the Technic League of study specimens that
    were kept in secret, and some foolish young sub-commanders are looking to
    restart the project.
  - >-
    Burning inside with necrotic radiation, the irradiated dead display enhanced
    strength and coordination. Their skin and pupils are tinted pale orange like
    the fluids that replaced their blood. Their fingers transform into savage
    claws as sharp as ragged metal. Unexpectedly, the creatures show a
    remarkable resistance to the effects of positive energy that are deadly to
    most other forms of undead. They are also carriers of the radiation
    treatment that fueled their transition to undeath, able to pass the aff
    liction to other living creatures.
  - >-
    Irradiated dead are carnivorous, greatly preferring fresh meat, but they
    aren't above eating carrion. Cunning, patient and careful hunters,
    irradiated dead can prey on a nomad tribe over months, ambushing small bands
    of warriors and feeding upon them one by one.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Most irradiated dead are natives of the broken Numerian wastes, and they
    continue haunting these regions in their new forms just as they inhabited
    the wastes in life. They generally search for new hunting grounds in
    solitude, but those that manage to create their own spawn travel in packs
    with those they have transformed. Whether roaming across the plains, hills,
    and valleys, or even wading through muck and waterways, they spend much of
    their time lurking in shadowy places on the outskirts of villages or tribal
    encampments. They do not generally keep personal possessions or treasure
    from their meals, but may use such things to lure and entrap subsequent
    search parties.
  - >-
    Though they're intelligent, the irradiated dead rarely show any inclination
    toward forming social groups or hierarchies, preferring to kill and eat
    creatures that enter their territories, though they will deal with other
    intelligent creatures if they must. If they encounter more powerful beings
    in their hunting grounds, irradiated
  - >-
    dead will work to trick or trap them. The irradiated dead simply move on to
    new territories if they are unable to eliminate the threat. An unconfirmed
    report by a Technic League spy in Sunder Horn, however, claimed that at
    least three fast-moving, orange-skinned creatures had been hunting on the
    outskirts of town for nearly a year. The creatures have seemingly
    disappeared without any further sightings in the last 18 months.
  - >-
    Even the Technic League is aware of the dangers these creatures could pose
    to the populace. The methods used to create the irradiated dead are
    well-guarded secrets of the Technic League. These techniques are also
    impossible to implement outside of Numeria, because the necrotic radiation
    and alien chemicals instrumental to their creation can be found nowhere else
    on Golarion.
