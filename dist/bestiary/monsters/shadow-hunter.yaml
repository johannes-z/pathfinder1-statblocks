Description_Visual: >-
  The shadow hunter is a great, dark serpent that dwells in deep caverns beneath
  the earth, where it hunts dark elves and other Medium to Large sized
  creatures. An adult specimen is over 40 ft. long and nearly 5 ft. thick in its
  midsection. In bright light it can be seen to be covered with non-reflective
  black scales, and its underbelly is the dark red of clotted blood. Shadow
  hunters have the supernatural ability to blend in with shadows, both to
  protect themselves and to stalk and ambush prey. Unlike normal snakes, shadow
  hunters often work in groups of two or three to corner prey in passages.

      Shadow hunters are expert at tracking prey through the dim warrens where
      they dwell. They can track using their Perception skill in place of
      Survival.
Description:
  - >-
    Shadow hunters generally prefer to hunt in networks of twisting passages
    that allow them to move around their intended prey, or even approach it from
    multiple directions. They are particularly fond of elf flesh, but eats any
    Small to Large creature as long as it is living, organic, and animal-based
    (i.e., not a plant or fungus). When they attack, they prefer to strike and
    envenom their prey, holding on and chewing the poison into their opponent
    until it stops struggling. If there is more than one foe present, they do
    not try to grab their prey, preferring to strike at those that threaten it,
    retreating if need be to return later to consume their hopefully dead prey.
