Description_Visual: >-
  This hideous humanoid creature has the lower torso of an octopus and the upper
  torso of a human. Two long tentacles protrude from each side of the creature's
  body, just beneath its arms. Its head, while vaguely human, is hairless and
  features an elongated skull.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mind Thrust (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a uggoth can unleash a blast of mental energy at a
      single target within 40 feet. The blast deals 8d6 points of damage to a
      single target if it fails a DC 24 Will save. This is a mind-affecting
      effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Spell Reflection (Su)
    description: >-
      Any spell that fails to overcome a uggoth's spell resistance is reflected
      back on the caster who becomes the target of the spell. Area spells still
      affect the area around the uggoth, but the portion that would affect it is
      reflected back on the caster.
  - name: Tentacles (Ex)
    description: A uggoth's tentacles are always primary attacks for the creature.
Description:
  - >-
    Uggoths are subterranean creatures once bent on destruction and expanding
    their own realm from the underworld to the surface world. Legends say the
    uggoth race was formed when a band of ancient humans offended their gods and
    were forever cursed. Scholars cannot verify or disprove this origin myth.
  - >-
    Uggoths dwell in great underground cities, most of which are built and
    maintained by slave labor. Once an ambitious race with desires to rule both
    underground and aboveground, uggoths now spend most of their time lounging
    in their homes or in public places within the uggoth cities partaking of
    various dream-inducing narcotics. They are still very active in trade,
    usually trading with other evil-aligned subterranean races. In exchange for
    various foods, manufactured weapons, and spices, the uggoth receive slaves,
    exotic herbs, and the like.
  - >-
    Uggoths stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and weigh 160 to 180 pounds. Their
    humanoid flesh is dark amber and leathery to the touch. Their lower torsos
    are even darker amber fading to black near the tips of the tentacles.
    Uggoths live for 150 years typically.
  - >-
    A uggoth attack with its mind thrust attack in an effort to dispatch its
    enemies as quickly and efficiently as possible. Creatures that survive are
    attacked with various spell-like abilities and slashed or grabbed by the
    creature's tentacles. Opponents that are killed are usually devoured on the
    spot or carried back to the uggoth's dwelling and eaten later or fed to the
    young. Opponents that show promise as slaves are captured instead of killed.
    Potential slaves are carted back to the uggoth's city and placed in a public
    slave pen where they are eventually sold to the highest bidder. Occasionally
    the city's overseer allows the uggoth to keep captured slaves.
