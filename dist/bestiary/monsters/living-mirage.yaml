SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Consuming Mirage (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living mirage can engulf foes, as the universal monster ability. A
      creature engulfed by a living mirage doesn't gain the pinned condition and
      may move normally-such a creature is not in danger of suffocating-but as
      long as it begins its turn engulfed, the victim is subject to the living
      mirage's desiccation attack in addition to the damage this ability causes.
      The save DC to avoid a living mirage's consuming mirage ability is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Desiccation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living mirage siphons streamers of blood and other vital fluids away
      from living creatures it touches or engulfs. A living creature that takes
      damage from the living mirage must succeed at a Constitution check to
      avoid the effects of thirst (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444), using the
      amount of damage dealt by the living mirage as the check's DC. A creature
      that is already suffering the effects of thirst must attempt another
      Constitution check (DC equal to the damage dealt by the living mirage or
      the DC against thirst as if 1 hour had passed since the target creature's
      last check, whichever is higher) or take nonlethal damage from their
      thirst as described in the Core Rulebook. The target takes a cumulative -1
      penalty on this check for each consecutive round beyond the first it takes
      damage from the living mirage. A creature that takes nonlethal damage from
      thirst as a result of this ability is fatigued.
  - name: Gaseous (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living mirage has a body composed of shimmering air. It can pass through
      small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, but cannot enter water
      or other liquid. It has no Strength score, and cannot manipulate objects
      as a result.
  - name: Natural Invisibility (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living mirage remains invisible at all times, even when attacking. This
      ability isn't subject to the invisibility purge spell. Against foes that
      cannot pinpoint it, a living mirage gains a +20 bonus on Stealth checks
      when moving or a +40 bonus when standing still. These bonuses are not
      included in the statistics above. Because of its size and pervasiveness
      within the area it occupies, a living mirage gains only a 20% miss chance
      due to its invisibility.
  - name: Project Mirage (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a living mirage can create an illusory vision in
      areas of extreme heat or reflection-such as a desert, open ocean, or snow
      plain-to lure victims toward it. This is a nonmagical mind-affecting
      glamer effect identical to hallucinatory terrain. The living mirage can
      dismiss this effect as a swift action. The save DC to disbelieve the
      illusion is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus.
  - name: Vulnerable to Wind (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living mirage is treated as a Small creature for the purposes of
      determining the effects high wind has upon it (Core Rulebook 439).
Description:
  - >-
    A living mirage is a cloud of shimmering air that dwells in warm and cold
    deserts and calm stretches of open ocean. Although reviled as cruel
    deceivers, living mirages are in fact mindless, without any motive beyond
    feeding on the water and minerals found in living bodies.
