Description:
  - >-
    These large magical lizards, readily identified by large bulging
    sapphirecolored eyes, are found only in the darkest underground places and
    never venture to the surface world.

    A cavern lizard is typically very aggressive and often travels far away from
    its lair in order to hunt. While not territorial, a cavern lizard is rarely
    encountered with others of its kind. Each cavern lizard often has a hunting
    ground covering up to 2 miles in the Under Realms.
  - >-
    A cavern lizard's lair is a large expanse of interconnected caves littered
    with the bones and scattered remains of its victims (including treasure).
    Hunting cavern lizards usually drag their kill back to their lair before
    devouring it. If young are present in the lair, the kill is divided between
    them. Young cavern lizards resemble their adult counterparts in all
    respects, save their eyes are a dull blue. During mating season (late
    summer, early fall) 1d6 eggs may be found in the lair. Eggs are round in
    shape, leathery to the touch, and gray in color.
  - >-
    Cavern lizards are aggressive ambush hunters. They prefer to scale the walls
    and wait for prey to pass underneath them where they drop down on their
    unsuspecting meal. In most battles, once a cavern lizard bites, it hangs on
    until its opponent is dead. If facing more than one foe, it won't employ
    this tactic so as not to leave itself defenseless against other aggressors.
    If cornered or extremely hungry, a cavern lizard fights to the death;
    otherwise it retreats if it is facing a particularly powerful opponent.
