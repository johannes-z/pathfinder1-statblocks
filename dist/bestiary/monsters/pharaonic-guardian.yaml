SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Guardian Sword and Shield (Su)
    description: >-
      A pharaonic guardian can imbue any Large sword and shield with a +3
      enhancement bonus and the ghost touch ability. This effect lasts as long
      as the guardian wields them and for 1 minute thereafter. The guardian uses
      these as if its Strength score equaled its Charisma score.
  - name: Insightful Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      A pharaonic guardian gains a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls against foes
      whose thoughts it has read via its judging gaze ability.
  - name: Judging Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      A pharaonic guardian's gaze attack reads the minds of those it sees, as
      the detect thoughts spell with 3 rounds of concentration. This gaze has a
      range of 30 feet, and can be negated with a successful DC 22 Will save.
      This is a mindaffecting divination effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
      Soul-Rending
  - name: Wings (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action every 1d4 rounds, a pharaonic guardian can flare its
      wings to fire rays of soulcutting light in two 30-foot lines extending
      away from it. Living creatures in the lines gain 1 negative level (Reflex
      DC 22 negates). A creature whose mind the pharaonic guardian has read from
      its judging gaze ability takes a -2 penalty on this save. Negative levels
      from this ability are made permanent at the next sunrise unless the
      creature succeeds at a DC 22 Fortitude save. The save DCs are
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Pharaonic guardians were created when an egotistical Osirian pharaoh used
    nowlost techniques to ritually draw upon the fear of the countless slaves
    and servants who built her monuments. When enough of these minions were
    driven into self-destruction trying to provide for the pharaoh's decadent
    demands, she knitted their souls together to create the first pharaonic
    guardians. Such creatures now guard the entrances to tombs and other sites
    important to the pharaohs of the late First Age and the Second Age of
    Ancient Osirion.
