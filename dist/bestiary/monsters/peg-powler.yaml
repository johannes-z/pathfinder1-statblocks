Description:
  - >-
    A peg powler appears as an old crone, believed to be distantly related to
    the various hags (particularly sea hags). The creature makes its home on the
    bottom of rivers and lakes, but spends most of its time near the shore where
    it attempts to lure fishermen, children, and sometimes even animals to their
    watery graves. Though it can sustain itself on a diet of seaweed, kelp, and
    various underwater plants, the peg powler prefers the taste of flesh and
    blood. Stories told, perhaps only to scare children, speak of swarms of peg
    powlers journeying far inland when their shoreline food supplies run scarce.
    These stories tell of entire villages being destroyed and every single
    inhabitant devoured by the ravenous peg powler swarm.
  - >-
    Peg powlers tolerate the presence of sea hags, but there is no love lost
    between the two races. Stories speak of some peg powlers enjoying the taste
    of a sea hag's flesh over that of any other creature. This doesn't sit well
    with sea hags who have heard this tale.

    A peg powler appears as an emaciated woman with sickly green skin wearing
    tattered rags. Her hair, wild and unkempt, is usually brown or black. Her
    eyes are gray and appear almost pupiless. A typical peg powler stands
    roughly 6 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds.

    A peg powler attacks with its claws, attempting to grab its foe, and drag it
    into its watery lair. A favored tactic of the peg powler is to hide near the
    riverbanks, grab an unsuspecting foe as it passes by, and then drag it into
    the water where it is drowned.
