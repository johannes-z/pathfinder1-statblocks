SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Environmental Awareness (Ex)
    description: >-
      The very earth speaks to a forgotten one. A forgotten one has the benefits
      of tremorsense and blindsight within a 100-foot radius. It cannot be
      flanked or caught flat-footed.
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      Forgotten Ones are skilled in the use of poison and never risk
      accidentally poisoning themselves. Forgotten ones use a mixture of bee and
      spider venom on their spears that causes severe itching and soreness.
      Forgotten One Poison-injury; save Fort DC 11; frequency 1/hour for 24
      hours; effect -1 (non-cumulative) penalty on attack rolls, skill checks,
      and saving throws, if the target fails at least 8 saves it also takes 1
      point of Con damage; cure 1 save. Humanoids and monstrous humanoids have a
      5% chance of being severely allergic to forgotten one poison. The effects
      of a failed save are as above, but the penalty is -2 rather than -1, and
      1d3 Con damage.
  - name: Forgetful Presence (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a forgotten one can cause any creature within 20 feet
      of it to forget an encounter with it as per a modify memory spell with the
      restriction that it can only remove memories specifically dealing with the
      forgotten one. Opponents that succeed on a DC 16 Will save avoid the
      effects. Opponents that make the save are immune to the forgetful presence
      of that forgotten one for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Forgotten ones are a sprite race related to pixies. These wee folk are
    natural spies and trackers, and are routinely employed by powerful
    forest-guarding fey creatures such as unicorns, dryads, and nymphs. It is
    not uncommon for travelers in a fey forest to be followed by scores of
    forgotten ones, all moving unnoticed through the treetops as quickly and
    quietly as squirrels. While some forgotten ones keep track of the
    interlopers, others send messages back and forth to alert more powerful fey
    guardians to the presence of outsiders.
  - >-
    A forgotten one is about a foot tall with pointed ears, slanted eyes, and
    long, nimble limbs. Most forgotten ones weave twigs and leaves into their
    hair for decoration and to help conceal themselves in the treetops.
  - >-
    Rangers are druids are especially fond of the forgotten ones, and often use
    them as intermediaries between themselves and the greater Fey guardians of
    the forest.
  - >-
    Forgotten ones try to avoid combat with anything larger than themselves-they
    are well aware of their own limitations. If hard pressed or ordered into
    combat by a greater fey creature to defend their forest, forgotten ones will
    fight with courage not often attributed to creatures of such small size.
