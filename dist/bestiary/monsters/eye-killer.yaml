Description_Visual: >-
  This man-sized creature looks like a cross between a bat and a snake. Its
  upper torso resembles that of a large black bat while its lower torso appears
  to be that of a green and yellow scaled snake. Dark green fur covers its upper
  body. Its eyes are large, lidless white circles and are without pupils.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      By using natural or magical light that illuminates it (meaning the eye
      killer must be within the radius covered by a natural or magical light
      source), an eye killer can amplify the light and refocus it in a line that
      functions as a death ray to a range of 50 feet. The eye killer must make a
      ranged touch attack against its target as a standard action. If
      successful, the creature struck must make succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude
      save or perish. Even if the save succeeds, the victim takes 3d6 points of
      damage. An eye killer can use this gaze once per day. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Eye killers are immune to their own gaze attack and to
      the gaze attack of other eye killers. If the eye killer's gaze attack is
      reflected back upon it, it amplifies the intensity and projects it at a
      new target as an immediate action. The save DC to resist this gaze is
      increased by +2.
  - name: Sunlight Vulnerability (Ex)
    description: >-
      If natural sunlight (including a daylight spell) is brought within 5 feet
      of an eye killer, it immediately releases a grappled foe and attempts to
      move as far away from the source of light as possible. On subsequent
      rounds, an eye killer is dazzled as long as it remains within 5 feet of
      the light source.
Description:
  - >-
    Eye killers are subterranean dwellers that hate daylight. They dwell
    underground in dark places, where very little light can touch their
    sensitive eyes. They are evil, malicious creatures that delight in killing
    others, particularly those that wander to close to their lair. Eye killers
    seem to communicate with each other through a series of low rumbles and
    growls. They do not speak any known language. Eye killers are limbless
    spherical things at birth, but take form as they develop, reaching maturity
    within a year. The average adult eye killer reaches a length of 7 feet. Its
    bat-like wings are useless, as the eye killer cannot fly. The eye killer is
    very territorial and attacks any living creature that enters an area
    currently under its watchful eye. If the intruders a wield light source
    (magical flame, a lantern, or the like), the eye killer attacks using its
    eye ray ability by absorbing the light (from the source) into its eyes and
    releasing it in a bright flash of yellow light at its chosen target;
    otherwise, it dispatches the trespassers by grappling with its tail and
    squeezing. Eye killers flee if confronted with bright light, but otherwise
    are relentless in combat and always fight to the death. Umbral Eye Killer
    The umbral or shadow eye killer is a variant of the standard eye killer. It
    uses the statistics above for the standard eye killer with the following
    additions detailed below. An umbral eye killer is CR 5. Spell-like Abilities
    3/day-deeper darkness (20-ft. radius). Caster level 6th. See in Darkness
    (Su) Umbral eye killers can see perfectly in total darkness, even that
    created by deeper darkness. Credit The Eye Killer originally appeared in the
