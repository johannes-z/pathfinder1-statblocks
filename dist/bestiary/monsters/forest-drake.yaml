SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acidic Cloud (Su)
    description: >-
      A forest drake can, as a standard action, spit a ball of acid that bursts
      into a cloud on impact. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 4d6
      points of acid damage (Reflex DC 14 half) to all creatures within the
      resulting 10-foot-radius spread. The cloud remains for 1d4 rounds once
      created, acting as a 10-foot-radius obscuring mist (it no longer causes
      damage), but a strong wind disperses it in a single round. Once a forest
      drake has used its acidic cloud breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6
      rounds. The Reflex save is Constitution-based.
  - name: Aquatic Adaptation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A forest drake can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its
      breath weapon and other abilities while underwater. The acidic cloud
      created by that attack dissipates after 1 round if used underwater.
  - name: Speed Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a swift action, a forest drake may draw on its
      draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional
      move action in that round.
Description:
  - >-
    Forest drakes are the degenerate cousins of green dragons, possessed of
    cruel cunning but little actual wit. Like most drakes, forest drakes are
    bullies, prowling deep forests in search of their favorite prey-elves and
    fey. Forest drakes eagerly attack communities of such forest creatures
    unless driven off with arrows or other shows of force.
  - >-
    Like many other drake types, forest drakes organize themselves in packs
    called "rampages," and keep communal lairs in secluded forest locations.
    Such packs are usually made up of siblings who break from the pack only
    during mating season. A forest drake pack has a distinct pecking order, with
    younger and newer members receiving the least desirable portions of pack
    kills and the fewest mating options.
  - >-
    Forest drakes mate once a year, but do little to raise their offspring. A
    female lays a clutch of four to eight eggs, but abandons her young as soon
    as they hatch. Forest drake hatchlings immediately band together in a pack.
  - >-
    While few survive so long, forest drakes can live up to 200 years. Forest
    drakes are typically about 10 feet long with equally long tails, and weigh
    around 1,000 pounds.
