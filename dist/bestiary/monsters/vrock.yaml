SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dance of Ruin (Su)
    description: >-
      A vrock can dance and chant as a full-round action-at the end of 3 rounds,
      a crackling wave of energy explodes from the vrock, dealing 5d6 points of
      electricity damage to all creatures within 100 feet. A DC 17 Reflex save
      halves this damage. For each additional vrock that joins in the dance, the
      damage increases by 5d6 and the DC to avoid the effect increases by +1, to
      a maximum of 20d6 when four or more vrocks are dancing (the DC continues
      to increase with additional vrocks, but the damage does not). The dance
      immediately ends and must be started anew if any of the participating
      vrocks is slain, stunned, or otherwise prevented from dancing. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
  - name: Spores (Ex)
    description: >-
      A vrock can release a cloud of spores from its body once every 3 rounds as
      a free action. Adjacent creatures take 1d8 points of damage from the
      spores, plus 1d4 points of damage per round for 10 rounds as the spores
      grow into thick green vines. Although ugly, the vines are harmless and
      wither away in 1d4 days if not shaved off before then. The spores can be
      destroyed by casting bless on the affected creatures or by sprinkling them
      with holy water. This attack can also be halted by effects that remove or
      provide immunity to disease.
  - name: Stunning Screech (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per hour, a vrock can emit a shrill screech. All creatures except
      demons within a 30-foot-radius spread must succeed on a DC 21 Fortitude
      save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Profane champions of the Abyss, vrocks embody all the rage, hatred, and
    violence of that despicable realm. As ravenous and grotesquely opportunistic
    as the scavengers they resemble, vrocks delight in bloodshed, relishing the
    sounds and sensations of ripping the still-pulsing entrails from a living
    husk. A typical vrock stands 8 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds. Vrocks
    generally form from the evil souls of hateful and wrathful mortals,
    particularly those who were career criminals, mercenaries, or assassins.
