SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Telekinesis (Su)
    description: >-
      A domovoi defends itself and its home through telekinesis. This ability
      functions as the spell telekinesis, usable at will, with a caster level
      equal to the domovoi's Hit Dice (CL 5 for most domovoi). A typical domovoi
      has a ranged attack roll of +5 when using telekinesis to hurl objects or
      creatures, and can use the ability on objects weighing up to 50 pounds. If
      a domovoi attempts to hurl a creature with this ability, that creature can
      resist the effect with a successful DC 14 Will save. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The work never ends for those who live on farms or in small villages, and
    the wise often seek the aid of the fey-folk while pursuing their daily
    chores. A family might leave a piece of bread under the stove or an old boot
    in the closet to attract a domovoi to their home. Domovoi help with small
    tasks like churning butter and mending clothes, but mostly protect the home
    from intruders and misfortune.
  - >-
    A domovoi appears as small, old man no more than 2 feet high, covered in
    hair and with a long, shaggy beard. These helpful fey can also tell the fate
    of the family they protect, but grow annoyed when asked to do so too often.
