Description_Visual: >-
  This creature has no set form. Before your eyes it seems to shift from a
  vaguely humanoid form with yellow eyes and no other discernible facial
  features to a swirling mass of grayish-black crackling matter. In its latter
  form, blue-gray energy arcs and dances through its form, making it resemble a
  thundercloud shot through with lightning. It seems to constantly alter its
  form, as if it has no control over it.

Description:
  - >-
    A bedlam has no control over its form, but its ever-shifting form does not
    hamper its abilities in combat. It is a semi-amorphous, nearly vaporous
    creature composed of pure chaos that makes its lair in areas tainted with
    strong concentration of chaotic energies, such as temples to chaotic gods or
    areas that were once lawfully-aligned but have been poisoned by the effects
    of chaos. Bedlams are sometimes employed by chaotic wizards or clerics to
    guard a particular area. Being intelligent, the bedlam is strikes a deal
    with said employer so that it benefits from the bargain as well. Such deals
    never last long as the bedlam is an unstable and erratic creature, given to
    flights of fancy. A bedlam enjoys chaos and seeks to spread it wherever it
    goes.
  - >-
    Bedlams seek to induce chaos and destroy or weaken law with every move.
    Since it continuously detects law, it uses this ability to discern whether
    or not those it encounters are of a lawful nature or not. Nonlawful
    creatures are generally just subjected to one or two chaotic bursts before
    the creature moves on. If lawful creatures are present, the bedlam unleashes
    a chaotic burst and moves to melee, forming two limbs from its chaotic mass
    which it uses to pound its opponents.
