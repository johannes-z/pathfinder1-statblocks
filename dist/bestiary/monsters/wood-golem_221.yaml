SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A wood golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance, with the exception of spells and spell-like abilities
      that have the Fire descriptor, which affect it normally. In addition,
      certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as
      noted below. • Warp wood or wood shape slows a wood golem (as the slow
      spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save). • Repel wood drives the golem back 60
      feet and deals 2d12 points of damage to it (no save). • A magical attack
      that deals cold damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1
      point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise
      deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full
      normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A wood
      golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal cold damage.
  - name: Splintering (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds, a wood golem can launch a
      barrage of razor-sharp wooden splinters from its body in a 20-foot-radius
      burst. All creatures caught within this area take 6d6 points of slashing
      damage (Reflex DC 14 halves). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A wood golem is carved from rare woods, assembled into a roughly humanoid
    body with articulated limbs. Their creators usually leave their bodies
    almost unfinished, with individual pieces of lumber and unworked wood
    apparent and obvious as part of their construction. A wood golem stands
    6-1/2 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.
  - >-
    Construction The pieces of a wood golem are assembled from blocks of fine
    wood and sprinkled with rare powders and crushed herbs worth at least 300
