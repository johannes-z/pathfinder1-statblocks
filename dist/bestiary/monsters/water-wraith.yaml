      Once per round as a free action, a water wraith can change its color to
      any of its own choosing. A water wraith using this ability to camouflage
      itself gains a +8 bonus on Stealth checks.
Description:
  - >-
    Water wraiths are eight-legged amphibious lizards indigenous to the Mwangi
    Expanse with the ability to change their color at will. This chameleon-like
    ability, combined with their superior intelligence, makes them coveted as
    exotic pets or guard animals. They are imported throughout Garund for those
    virtues. Patient and cunning hunters, water wraiths prefer to lie still in
    ponds and rivers until their prey comes within range. When an unfortunate
    creature does, these fearless hunters strike, their webbed claws propelling
    them quickly forward either on land or in water. Once their toothy, eel-like
    mouths attach to victims, water wraiths quickly begin to bleed them dry.

    Water wraiths depicted here represent the upper end of size limitations for
    captive specimens. In captivity, these creatures are deliberately kept
    underfed and rarely grow beyond 2 feet in length. Water wraiths encountered
    wild in the Mwangi wetlands, or kept on an unrestricted diet, grow to even
    more massive sizes.
  - >-
    Strange superstitions are born out of water wraiths' color-changing powers.
    This changeability is not just an automatic defensive response, but can be a
    matter of self-expression, or even strategy and tactics on the part of the
    creature. Water wraiths often express likes and dislikes with an outward
    display of color: bright red is frequently associated with hunger, and dull
    green represents dislike or lack of interest. Some small communities in
    Katapesh and Osirion actually utilize water wraiths in a primitive system of
    jurisprudence. The authorities release the accused into a pen with the
    creatures, then interpret the reactions of the lizards as signs of guilt or
    innocence. All too frequently, the wraiths declare the accused innocent by
    virtue of being delicious. Water wraiths find full-blooded elves to be
    unpalatable, but show no aversion to their half-elven cousins. Water wraiths
    are not limited to changing color in response to base drives, however.
    Sneaky and cunning, they do not hesitate to blend into their surroundings
    despite their emotional state if it affords them an advantage in hunting.
