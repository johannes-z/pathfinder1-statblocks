    description: >-
      An almiraj takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against harmful witch
      hexes. The duration of any beneficial hexes longer than 1 round that
      affect an almiraj is increased by 50%.
  - name: Magic Horn (Su)
    description: >-
      While on the creature's head, an almiraj's horn is treated as a +1 weapon.
      Any living creature slain by an almiraj's gore attack immediately turns to
      stone (as if by the flesh to stone spell, with no saving throw, and the
      creature is still dead). A severed almiraj horn retains a wisp of its
      former magic, and counts as a masterwork weapon if used to create a
      magical dagger or similar small piercing weapon.
Description:
  - >-
    The almiraj is a surprisingly dangerous predator. Almirajes' strong affinity
    with witches, magical gore attacks, and susceptibility to hexes suggest they
    have arcane origins, perhaps the result of experiments by witches seeking to
    deliberately create a new kind of familiar. Reminiscent of a unicorn horn,
    an almiraj's most prominent feature serves as both a deterrent and deadly
    weapon. The almiraj uses its horn to hunt, stalking and spearing prey on the
    brutal appendage. The horn's unique magical properties have the gruesome
    side effect of forcing the almiraj to consume its prey while it still lives,
    before it turns to stone - when hunting smaller creatures, the almiraj
    strikes to slow its prey through blood loss and to disable it by maiming its
    limbs. Occasionally, an enterprising individual will hunt an almiraj for its
    horn, but success is limited since almirajes are exceptionally vicious,
    stealthy, and athletic targets - their acrobatic leaps bring their horns
    within reach of the vital organs of much larger creatures. Almirajes are
    fiercely territorial, although they flee if unable to fight on their terms,
    only to return later to defend their territory. They demonstrate their
    territorial claims to others of their kind with acrobatic displays and mock
    horn battles rather than fighting in earnest. Other intruders are met with
    aggressive posturing and warning calls, though almirajes prefer not to
    fight. If an interloper refuses to withdraw, however, the almiraj will fight
    to the death to defend its claim. It's unclear how almirajes reproduce,
    since females are rare and the creatures are always encountered alone.
    Records indicate that they live for 40 to 60 years and some communities are
    able to build respectful, if wary, relationships with them. Almirajes are
    particularly popular with witches as familiars. Spellcasters of any
    alignment with the Improved Familiar feat can gain an almiraj as a familiar
    at 5th level.
