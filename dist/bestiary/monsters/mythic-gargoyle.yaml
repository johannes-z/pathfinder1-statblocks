Description:
  - >-
    A mythic gargoyle is a king or queen among its kind, usually gaining its
    power from an earth deity, a mythic gem embedded in its chest, or centuries
    of exposure to powerful magic. It has a distinct appearance, and other
    members of its wing slowly shift to match its look.

  - >-
    An aquatic mythic gargoyle is nearly identical to a mythic gargoyle, but
    usually has an electricity breath weapon instead of acid. Some have the
    ability to possess coral or wood statues instead of stone.
