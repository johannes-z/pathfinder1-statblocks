      Each of a dracohydra's heads has a single breath weapon. To determine each
      head's color and the associated breath weapon, choose from or roll on the
      table below. 1d10 Head Color Breath Weapon 1-2 Black Acid 3-4 Blue

  - name: White Cold  Fast Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dracohydra's fast healing applies only to damage inflicted on the
      dracohydra's body.
  - name: Hydra Traits (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dracohydra can be killed by severing its heads or slaying its body. Any
      attack that is not an attempt to sever a head affects the body, including
      area attacks or attacks that cause piercing or bludgeoning damage. To
      sever a head, an opponent must make a sunder attempt with a slashing
      weapon targeting a head. A head is considered a separate weapon with
      hardness 0 and 10 hit points. To sever a head, an opponent must inflict
      enough damage to reduce the head's hit points to 0 or less. Severing a
      head deals 10 points of damage to the dracohydra's body. A dracohydra
      can't attack with a severed head, but takes no other penalties.
  - name: Regenerate Head (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a dracohydra's head is destroyed, two heads regrow in 1d4 rounds. The
      heads are of the same color as the one that was severed. A dracohydra
      cannot have more than 10 heads at any one time. To prevent new heads from
      growing, at least 5 points of acid or fire damage (after overcoming the
      dracohydra's resistances) must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to
      hit) before they appear. Acid or fire damage from area attacks can affect
      stumps and the body simultaneously. A dracohydra doesn't die from losing
      its heads until all are cut off and the stumps seared by acid or fire.
  - name: Savage Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dracohydra applies 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to damage dealt with
      its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.
Description:
  - >-
    Believed to be either the mating of a hydra and a dragon or the offspring of
    a draconic deity, the dracohydra is truly a fearsome monster. Most
    intelligent creatures do their best to avoid trespassing on a dracohydra's
    domain for these creatures are extremely territorial, even more so than some
    dragons. Dracohydras prefer lairing in remote locations such as mountaintops
    and ruins, far away from civilization and far away from adventurous treasure
    seekers.
  - >-
    Dracohydras, while solitary, often make pacts with local humanoids; most
    often orcs, gnolls, and hobgoblins. Generally these pacts are lopsided deals
    that favor the dracohydra: give it food and it won't eat your village. Such
    food usually consists of herd animals or cattle, and sometimes humanoids if
    necessary to sate the dracohydra's voracious appetite. Humanoid sacrifices
    usually take the form of slaves or prisoners, but if either of those is in
    low numbers, tribes have been known to sacrifice their own to appease a
    dracohydra.
  - >-
    Betraying their draconic origin, dracohydras amass treasure in great
    quantities. Most treasures are left strewn about the lair, but some, such as
    rare gemstones and small trinkets are devoured by dracohydras.
  - >-
    Dracohydras do not associate with other dracohydras, hydras, or dragons.
    Hydras are particularly reviled for unknown reasons, and are attacked on
    sight and slaughtered, their bodies being almost completely devoured by a
    dracohydra.
  - >-
    A dracohydra's body is usually dark gray or dark grayish-blue. Its
    dragon-like heads are scaled and vary in color blending into the body at the
    neckline. A dracohydra's eyes are always sapphire blue, regardless of the
    color of the dragon's head.
