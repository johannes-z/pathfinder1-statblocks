      An ossumental can see through fire and smoke as if they were transparent,
      ignoring any cover or concealment bonuses from fire and smoke, up to its
      normal range of vision.
Description:
  - >-
    Ossumentals are found exclusively in the enigmatic location called the Slave
    Trenches of Hakotep. It is here where the strong elemental forces and the
    massive loss of mortal life used to excavate the earthworks combined to
    create these terrifying creatures.
  - >-
    Hakotep I drove thousands of slaves to dig the elaborate system of
    earthworks and deep trenches, and though no one's certain of the site's
    purpose, some speculate that it is an arcane device constructed to defend
    against any perceived Shory invasion using their flying cities.
  - >-
    Obelisks bound with elemental spirits were erected throughout the system,
    and as time crept along, some of these spirits escaped their prisons and
    fused with the remains of the slaves who once toiled in the trenches. Now,
    ossumentals act as unintended guardians and caretakers of the site. Those
    exploring this region have reported that some of the ossumentals maintain
    the Slave Trenches of Hakotep by keeping the deep trenches clear of the
    ever-encroaching desert sands, though they are only successful for a matter
    of time before the winds drive the sand again.
  - >-
    The creatures aren't always active; at rest, their bones lie scattered under
    the oppressive Osirian sun, waiting for living creatures to wander by before
    clattering together to attack. An ossumental is a tricky combatant,
    attacking with its four arms in melee combat and then using its breath
    weapon to attack multiple targets that are out of reach. It makes use of its
    discorporate ability to quickly shift position on the battlefield and get
    behind its attackers.
  - >-
    Fully formed, an ossumental stands approximately 16 feet tall and weighs
    around 300 pounds.
