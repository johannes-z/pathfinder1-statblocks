Description:
  - >-
    Immolation devils are tyrant warlords and terrifying field generals among
    Hell's legions. While many other greater devils manipulate and corrupt
    subtly and from afar, puragaus surround themselves with lesser diabolical
    minions, lead interplanar incursions, hold infernal redoubts upon mortal
    worlds, or strike against any who would defy the will of Hell.
  - >-
    Immolation devils stand just over 10 feet tall, with wingspans nearing 20
    feet, and weigh 900 pounds.
