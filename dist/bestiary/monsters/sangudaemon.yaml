Description_Visual: >-
  This vaguely arachnid creature is the size of a human and is composed entirely
  of blood, globs of the viscous stuff dripping down its spindly legs and from
  its serpentine maw. A jagged set of obsidian fangs protrudes from its drooling
  mouth, and huge dragonf ly wings of crimson blood splay from the thing's back
  producing a terrifying buzz.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Augmented Critical (Ex)
    description: >-
      A sangudaemon's bite threatens a critical hit on a roll of 18-20 and deals
      x3 damage on a successful critical hit.
  - name: Bleeding Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Within the daemon's aura, blood gushes from wounds at an increased rate.
      All bleed effects deal an additional +2 points of damage (included in the
      daemon's bleed damage). Heal checks made to stop bleeding or stabilize a
      dying creature, Constitution checks made to become stable, and saving
      throws against effects that deal bleed damage take a -4 penalty.
  - name: Contagious Gore (Su)
    description: >-
      A sangudaemon alters the very flow of blood when it attacks. Any creature
      that stops a bleed effect created by a sangudaemon must make a DC
      Fortitude save or gain the bleed effect the creature just stopped (this
      has no effect if the creature was stopping a bleed effect on itself ). A
      creature that succeeds at this save is immune to this ability for 24
      hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Drain Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      A sangudaemon can revitalize itself by draining the soul of a dead
      creature. The target must be a creature the daemon dealt bleed damage to
      or used its blood drain ability on, and must have been dead for no longer
      than 1 minute. As a full-round action, it can drink the creature's soul
      dry, condemning the soul to Abaddon (though the soul can be returned to
      life as normal). The daemon gains fast healing 2 for a number of rounds
      equal to its Hit Dice.
Description:
  - >-
    A horrid combination of mosquito, spider, and vampire, sangudaemons
    personify death by blood loss. These horrors of Abaddon takes great pleasure
    in the act of draining their victims of blood, considering the fluid to be
    the essence of all mortality and the fundamental residence of the soul while
    within a mortal body. A sangudaemon bathes in the ruby humor, the fiend's
    own body resembling a brutal and gory massacre in full swing, with blood
    constantly coating and glistening its armored, chitinous carapace. Once the
    last vital drop has left a victim's body- thus depriving the soul of its
    last defenses, according to the mythology of the sangudaemons-the voracious
    insectile horror begins to devour its victim's spirit in earnest.
  - >-
    An individual sangudaemon stands about 5 feet tall, weighs 200 pounds, and
    has a wingspan of 6 feet.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    A sangudaemon typically spawns from the soul of an evil mortal who died due
    to blood loss, such as a casualty of giant leeches or mosquitoes, or
    possibly the drained victim of a ravenous vampire. Whatever the cause, a
    sangudaemon seeks to inf lict its cruel fate upon others, traversing the
    planes in search of mortal victims to bleed and consume. Wherever a
    sangudaemon goes, blood follows, as its mere presence seems to indicate a
    thinning of bodily fluids and the ensuing chaos of merciless and
    nondiscriminatory bloodletting.
  - >-
    Perhaps more so than any other caste of daemon, sangudaemons "hunt" for
    souls in the most traditional sense of the word. Lurking primarily at night
    while on the Material Plane, a sangudaemon prowls the darkest corners of
    urban areas and sparsely populated lands alike, preying on unwary victims
    and dragging them back to its secluded
  - >-
    den. Such lairs are gory, dark places, the walls entirely awash in blood.
    From the ceiling of a sangudaemon's lair, the fiend hangs the cocooned
    bodies of countless victims, some still barely conscious beneath their
    grotesque wrappings-bindings made of hardened blood and the eff luvium of
    devoured and regurgitated souls. A sangudaemon entombs its victims in these
    fibrous casings like a giant spider does its prey, slowly sucking the bodies
    dry of both blood and spirit. Sangudaemons keep their lairs underground or
    at high elevations in order to best preserve the bodies within, though when
    the cocoons have been completely leeched, the remnants begin to crumble into
    dust, and such charnel houses eventually fill with the dry, brittle ashes of
    victims.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    While out hunting in either the wastes of Abaddon or throughout other
    planes, sangudaemons often work in packs of up to 10 individuals, and though
    they hunt together, they much prefer to keep their own independent lairs to
    drag victims back to for slower feedings. Other daemons find sangudaemons'
    potent abilities useful, especially on battlefields where blood is spilt.
    Piscodaemons and purrodaemons in particular find use for their services,
    shedding much blood in their destructive rampages and benefiting from
    sangudaemons' unique and devastating control over spilt blood.
  - >-
    While sangudaemons sometimes spawn from the souls of blood-drained victims
    of vampires, the daemons and the undead share no love for one another, and
    many sangudaemons openly despise vampires. Some speculate that sangudaemons
    that hate vampires do so because they themselves were victims to the undead
    as mortals, and a faint and bitter impression permeates their otherwise
    vacuous recollection. The contempt some sangudaemons have for vampires often
    runs so deep that the daemons seek out these undead souls in particular,
    hoping to utterly consume them, as sangudaemons often find vampires' tainted
    blood even more delicious than any other creature's. A sangudaemon will at
    times trade numerous souls and soul gems via Abaddon's markets for just a
    single vampire's soul, so much do they delight in the obliteration and
    consumption of the thing. As such outspoken hunters of vampires,
    sangudaemons often find themselves at odds with the goals of Urgathoa,
    Abaddon's resident goddess of undeath. Though most daemons would never dream
    of siphoning some of her destined souls to sate their own hungers, the mere
    existence of the two polar forces within the blasted lands nevertheless
    creates an uncomfortable tension between the fiends and the goddess. What
    the two sides agree on is excessive gluttony, though Urgathoa's followers
    often partake merely of food, whereas sangudaemons indulge themselves purely
    on blood.
  - >-
    As a caste, sangudaemons have a distinct preference for service to both
    Apollyon and Szuriel. Those in service to the Horseman of Pestilence live in
    his festering swamps and frequently incubate various hemorrhagic fevers and
    blood-thinning diseases within their various pockets of consumed mortal
    blood, keeping the diseases alive and active until they can be dispersed
    through new populations for maximum carnage. Szuriel, meanwhile, spreads the
    plague of war wherever she passes, and thus bloodshed is an inevitability;
    whether this large-scale bloodletting is brought on by the tip of a sword or
    the hungering jaws of a sangudaemon matters not to the Horseman of War, and
    she gladly accepts the services of the eager and hungry sangudaemons, who
    are driven to ecstatic revels by battlef ield gore.
