  - >-
    The statistics here describe the common sheep and ram. Sheep generally flee
    from danger and avoid combat if possible. If cornered, they attack by
    biting.
  - Rams are male sheep and are usually encountered leading a flock.
  - >-
    Rams attack using their horns. They become aggressive if the flock is
    threatened.
