Group: Demon
Source: Tome of Horrors Complete
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      The infernal eyes of a mallor weaken the resolve of opponents peering into
      them. Creatures meeting its gaze must make a successful DC 22 Will save or
      flee in fear for 1d6 rounds. On a successful save, that opponent is immune
      to the fear gaze of that mallor for one day. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Foul Liquid (Su)
    description: >-
      All liquids within 100 feet of a mallor automatically foul and become
      unsuitable for consumption or inhabitation (no save). Magical liquids in
      the area receive a DC 27 Fortitude save to avoid the effects. Creatures
      drinking fouled water must make a successful DC 27 Fortitude save or
      become nauseated for 1 minute. Aquatic creatures (or those that can
      breathe water) swimming in fouled water must make a Constitution check (DC
      10, +1 per previous check) each round they remain in the area or begin
      suffocating. A mallor can foul up to 20 gallons of liquid a day using this
      ability. Sentient- or liquid-based creatures (such as water elementals)
      must make a successful DC 27 Fortitude save or take 1d8 points of
      Constitution damage each hour they remain in the area. At Constitution 0,
      the creature's liquid structure fouls and it dies. The save DCs are
      Constitution-based. A mallor can suppress or resume this ability at will
      as a free action.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Claw-injury; save Fort DC 27; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6
      Strength; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Mallors are the creation of some long-forgotten (and presumably slain) demon
    lord who supposedly used dark and powerful magic to combine the best (and
    worst) traits of a demon with the best and worst traits of snakes.
  - >-
    Purportedly they were spawned from the same demonic force that created the
    dreaded marilith. Though originally only encountered on the lowest planes of
    the Abyss, the mallor's are quickly growing and they can now be found on
    just about any layer of that dreaded plane. Mallors are frequently
    encountered on the Material Plane in the service of powerful spellcasters
    seeking to gain some service from them. They disdain mortals, particularly
    mortal spellcasters, and seek to twist and manipulate them when given the
    chance. Binding a mallor is a dangerous thing, for if it manages to break
    free or twist the bargain to its favor, it most assuredly kills or captures
    the summoner and carries it back to the Abyss never to be seen again.
  - >-
    A mallor is a 10 to 12 feet long, powerful, humanoid with the lower torso of
    a giant coral snake. Its humanoid frame is crimson-colored while its snake
    body is black with bands of yellow and red. Its arms end in sharpened claws,
    slightly curved under, just enough to tear through flesh, sinew and muscle.
    Mallors have black, gold, or amber hair. Their eyes are white with red or
    green pupils.
  - >-
    A mallor is a straightforward combatant in battle and charges directly at
    its opponents. Normally, it opens battle with burning hands and/or its fear
    gaze in hopes of affecting as many targets as possible. The mallor then
    attempts to move to melee range and touch the nearest spellcaster while
    using its touch of idiocy. Multiple mallors work in concert with one
    another; one often drawing the fire away from the others so they can charge
    in with their massive spears.
