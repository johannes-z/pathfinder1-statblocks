SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Riddle (Su)
    description: >-
      A mythic sphinx can expend one use of mythic power to ask a riddle of up
      to 12 creatures within 100 feet. Each creature is compelled (Will DC 21
      negates) to give an answer within 1 minute (creatures in combat when the
      sphinx uses this ability gain a +4 bonus on the saving throw). The sphinx
      gets a +4 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against
      any creature that refuses to answer (via a successful saving throw), can't
      answer (including if it's in an area of silence), answers incorrectly, or
      flees the sphinx instead of answering. The bonuses from failing to solve
      the riddle last for 24 hours. The need to answer is a compulsion,
      mind-affecting, language-dependent enchantment effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. Sphinx's
  - name: Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      A mythic sphinx can expend one use of mythic power when it damages an
      opponent with a claw attack to curse its opponent with bleeding wounds
      (Will DC 21 negates). Whenever a cursed target takes piercing or slashing
      damage, it takes 1d6 points of bleed damage every round for the next 1d6
      rounds. This bleed damage stacks with itself and with all other bleed
      effects. A creature that strikes the killing blow against a mythic sphinx
      must succeed at a saving throw or become cursed (this requires no uses of
      mythic power from the sphinx). The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic sphinx is often given a task by a deity, such as watching over a
    city, testing a great mortal hero, or guarding an artifact. She is gifted
    with magic to compel obedience and curse those who would defy her commands
    or interfere with her task.
