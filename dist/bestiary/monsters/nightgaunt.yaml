      A nightgaunt has a +4 racial bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks. If a
      nightgaunt uses its fly speed to move itself and a grappled target, it can
      fly at full speed.
  - name: Faceless (Ex)
    description: >-
      A nightgaunt has no face, but can still see in all directions as if its
      entire body were an eye. It is immune to gaze attacks, but not to
      illusions that rely upon vision to function. It has no need to breathe,
      and is immune to all inhaled and scent-based effects.
  - name: Tickle (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a nightgaunt can use its tail to tickle a grappled or
      helpless foe with horrible efficiency. The target must succeed at a DC 14
      Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is
      Dexterity-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Nightgaunts haunt the deepest and darkest chasms of dreams. They lurk in the
    shadows that loom at the edges of sane slumber, but are ready at any moment
    to snatch a blithe dreamer away, carrying it off into realms of endless
    nightmare and tickling it terribly all the way. They appear as stooped,
    emaciated humanoids, yet possess a remarkable strength in their sinewy
    limbs. With inky black skin, batlike wings, a long spiny tail, and demonic
    horns protruding from its skull, a nightgaunt is a fearsome foe-yet the lack
    of any facial features is what makes it truly nightmarish. A typical
    nightgaunt would stand 7 feet tall if fully upright, and weighs 175 pounds.
    Nightgaunts feed on emotions, preferring despair, horror, and nervous
    laughter. They enjoy carrying their prey high over the mountains, tickling
    their prey to create a mix of emotions, and finally dropping their victims
    in remote areas where other monsters can stalk and kill them. Some creatures
    pay nightgaunts to serve as guardians or carry them from place to place,
    though the nightgaunts are prone to turn on their employers at the smallest
    slight. Most nightgaunts have little interest in anything other than sating
    their hunger on sleepers, and gather in colonies to entertain each other by
    sharing emotion-memories through strange caresses. They sometimes war with
    the other creatures found in their desolate realms.
