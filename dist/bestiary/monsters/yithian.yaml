SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Amnesia (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a yithian can attempt to inflict
      amnesia on a target it is able to communicate telepathically with. A
      target can resist this attack with a DC 21 Will save. If the target fails
      its save, it takes a permanent -4 penalty on Will saving throws and all
      skill checks, and loses all memories save for those the yithian chooses to
      leave intact. This effect can be cured by heal or greater restoration.
      This is a mind-affecting insanity effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Deadly Pincers (Ex)
    description: >-
      A yithian always applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage dealt
      by its pincer attacks, and deals triple damage on a critical hit. Pincers
      are primary attacks for yithians.
  - name: Mind Swap (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a yithian can trade minds with another living
      creature it is able to communicate telepathically with. This functions as
      magic jar, except the two minds trade bodies. An unwilling target can
      resist the mind swap with a DC 21 Will save, after which that particular
      yithian cannot attempt to swap minds with that creature again for 24
      hours. The yithian can end the effect of this mind swap at any time and
      over any distance as a full-round action, instantly returning both minds
      to the proper bodies-if the yithian wishes, it may attempt to use its
      amnesia power on the other mind as a free action when it ends the mind
      swap in this way. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.

    description: Yithians treat all knowledge skills as class skills.
Description:
  - >-
    Untold eons ago, the yithians inhabited a dying world. To escape their
    doomed planet, they cast their minds through time and space, eventually
    coming to rest in the strange, alien bodies they possess today. While these
    strange beings now reside in a distant galaxy, the yithians make use of
    their ability to astrally project to explore other planets, eager to find
    new worlds to explore.
  - >-
    When a yithian arrives upon a new world, it often swaps minds with the
    creatures it encounters there so as to experience that world as if it were a
    native. Those who spend time in a yithian's body rarely tell of the strange
    times they have experienced, for yithians guard themselves well, and leave
    those they use in this manner amnesiacs who remember the truth only as
    fragmentary nightmares.
