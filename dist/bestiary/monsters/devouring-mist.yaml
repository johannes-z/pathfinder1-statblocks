SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      Creatures in the devouring mist's space at the end of its movement each
      round take 1d4 points of Constitution damage as it siphons blood out of
      the victim's body. For every point so drained, the devouring mist heals 5
      hit points of damage. Creatures without blood take no damage from the
      devouring mist.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature slain by a devouring mist rises as a vampire spawn in 1d4
      days, unless the remains are blessed. If the victim had more than 5 hit
      dice, there is a 1% chance per hit die that it arises as a full-fledged
      vampire instead, or a 5% chance per hit die if the victim was of the
      humanoid type.
Description:
  - >-
    Spawned of the dreams of the Bloodwraith, devouring mists are undead
    composed of equal parts blood and malice, wedded together by negative
    energy. They drift the halls of the Bloodways, looking for living prey to
    feed on and torment. When they strike, they surround their enemies and draw
    their blood from their bodies.
  - >-
    Devouring mists are possessed of a malicious cunning. They are quite capable
    of blending into the mists of the Bloodways so as to take their prey
    unaware. They may also follow creatures for a time and attack when they are
    distracted or preoccupied. A devouring mist may even stalk its prey over
    hours or even days, striking again and again, in effect milking them of
    blood.
  - Devouring mists do not speak, nor can they be communicated with.
