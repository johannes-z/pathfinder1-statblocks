Description:
  - >-
    The result of an unfortunate union between an ogre and a humanoid, the
    ogrekin (or half-ogre) is cursed with horrific malformations due to its
    tragic ancestry. Shunned by both parents, ogrekin tend to form unstable
    clans of their own, often resorting to inbreeding to sustain the collective.
    While good-natured ogrekin are not entirely unheard of, they are far and few
    between. Creating an Ogrekin "Ogrekin" is an inherited template that can be
    added to any Medium humanoid (referred to hereafter as the base creature).
    An ogrekin retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities
    except as noted here. CR: Same as base creature +1 (minimum 2). Alignment:
    Usually evil. Type: The creature's subtype changes to giant. Armor Class:
    Natural armor improves by +3. Ability Scores: Str +6, Con +4, Int -2, Cha
    -2. Special Qualities and Defenses: An ogrekin gains lowlight vision. In
    addition, ogrekin receive two random deformities-one beneficial and one
    disadvantageous. Beneficial Deformities: The ogrekin gains one of these,
    chosen randomly. 1: Oversized Limb: The ogrekin can wield weapons one size
    category larger than normal without any penalty and gains a +2 bonus to its
    Strength. 2: Oversized Maw: The ogrekin gains a bite attack (1d4). 5: Quick
    Metabolism: The ogrekin gains a +2 racial bonus on Fortitude saves. 4: Thick
    Skin: Improve natural armor bonus by +2. 5: Vestigial Limb: Vestigial third
    arm (can't be used to use items) grants a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks.
    6: Vestigial Twin: A malformed twin's head juts out from the ogrekin,
    providing the ogrekin with all-around vision. Disadvantageous Deformities:
    The ogrekin gains one of these, chosen randomly. 1: Deformed Hand: One hand
    can't wield weapons; -2 penalty on attack rolls with two-handed weapons. 2:
    Fragile: The ogrekin is particularly frail and gaunt. It loses its +4 racial
    bonus to Con. 3: Light Sensitive: The ogrekin gains light sensitivity. 4:
    Obese: The ogrekin takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity (minimum score of 1). 5:
    Stunted Legs: The ogrekin's base speed is reduced by 10 feet (minimum base
    speed of 5 feet). 6: Weak Mind: The ogrekin's head is huge and misshapen. It
    gains a -2 penalty on Will saving throws.
