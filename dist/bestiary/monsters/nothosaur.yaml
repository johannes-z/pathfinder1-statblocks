Description:
  - >-
    The nothosaur resembles a smaller version of the land-based brachiosaurus,
    sharing the distinctive long neck and tail and short legs of its herbivorous
    brethren. Nothosaurs are also similar in many ways to seals-they spend much
    of their time in the water, including when they hunt, but emerge to sleep
    and breed on land. They lay their eggs in massive sandy mounds in the
    summer, then abandon their nests and slip back into the sea. A nothosaur is
    most vulnerable out of the water, but when caught unawares, it can return to
    the water with alarming speed, notwithstanding its awkwardly short legs and
    disproportionately large neck and tail. Nothosaurs can exist in water of any
    temperature, but prefer the warmer equatorial waters. Herds of nothosaurs
    make seasonal migrations, following schools of fish over the course of many
    months. From head to the tip of its tail, an adult nothosaur is 12 feet long
    and weighs 3,000 pounds.
