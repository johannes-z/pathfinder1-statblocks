  This flying head has incredibly large ears that constantly flap to keep the
  creature aloft. It babbles to itself as it flies, as if to remind itself of
  secrets only it knows.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid Spit (Ex)
    description: >-
      A chon chon can spit a disgusting blob of acid at a single foe, making a
      ranged attack with a range of 30 feet and no range increment. A successful
      attack deals 1d4 points of acid damage and forces the target to make a DC
      11 Fortitude saving throw to avoid becoming nauseated for 1 round. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Jabber (Su)
    description: >-
      A chon chon endlessly mutters half-remembered spells and meaningless
      arcane formulae to itself. This jabbering creates a kind of magical static
      that interferes with spells being cast nearby. Any creature attempting to
      cast a spell within 15 feet of a chon chon must make a successful DC 11
      concentration check or lose the spell. This is a sonic, mind-affecting
      effect. The concentration DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Chon chons appear to be human heads with ears so grotesquely enlarged that
    they can serve as fleshy wings. Their jealous hatred of all beings with full
    bodies easily counters their comical appearance, however. Accursed creatures
    drawn to places of dark magic and arcane disasters, chon chons possess the
    desires of the most obsessed magic users, but their dementia and twisted
    forms prevent them from ever obtaining the power they seek. Although these
    crazed beings loathe all things, they do find a vicious kind of solace among
    their own kind, not out of any sort of commiseration, but rather by
    wallowing in the pain of their own kind. Such hateful swarms gather to bear
    witness to each others' misery, inadvertently increasing the deadly efficacy
    of the entire group.
  - >-
    A single chon chon is no larger than a human head and weighs 10 pounds at
    most. The creature's ears give
  - >-
    it a total wingspan of 3 feet, making it appear much larger and more
    menacing.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    A chon chon's winglike ears endlessly flap, serving as monstrous wings that
    give it surprising grace in flight. These creatures always seem distracted,
    carrying on perpetual one-sided conversations and listening to voices only
    they can hear, then replying aloud with magical recitations or snippets of
    botched arcane formulae in a gibberish amalgam of Common, Draconic, and
    meaningless noises. This blathering has no meaning, mundane or arcane, but
    sounds so similar to the common phrases and syllables of magic that it
    insidiously intrudes upon the minds of spellcasters working their craft,
    invading their thoughts like an arcane earworm. An individual chon chon can
    suppress this babbling to speak semi-intelligibly-as much as such an
    insanely erratic creature can be called intelligible-but rarely does so for
    more than a minute before lapsing back into nonsense. Groups of chon chons
    seem to have no ability to quiet themselves, being little more than a
    collection of raving lunatics inspiring one another to ever-greater heights
    of insanity.
  - >-
    Although chon chons appear to be disembodied human heads, they are a unique
    race of creatures and not merely the victims of a magical curse-though some
    particularly demented spellcasters have discovered methods by which they
    might take the forms of these creatures to horrific effect (see below).
  - >-
    How chon chons increase their numbers few scholars know-and far fewer care
    to find out. Hateful of all things, including others of their kinds, to say
    nothing of their lack of generative organs, they seem doomed to extinction.
    Many assume these terrors spread their terrible condition in a way similar
    to that of vargouilles, which many mistake them for at first glance. Chon
    chons, however, lack those outsiders' terrifying kiss. Beyond general
    appearance, few similarities exist between these two races.
  - Secret of the Kalkus
  - >-
    Certain nefarious sorcerers-known in some lands as kalkus-seek to mimic the
    horrifying shape and strange abilities of chon chons, or aff lict their foes
    with such a curse. To this end, they've created a terrifying draught with
    the power to transform the drinker into a being resembling a chon chon,
    though few can guess for how long.
