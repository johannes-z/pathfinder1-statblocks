    description: >-
      One of a goliath's arms ends in a cannon. The goliath may use this as one
      of its four slam attacks, or it can use it to fire cannonballs. A cannon
      has a range increment of 100 feet, and deals 6d6 points of bludgeoning and
      piercing damage on a hit with a x4 critical modifier. A clockwork
      goliath's cannon can hold up to 12 cannonballs-reloading a single
      cannonball is a standard action. Self-Destruction (Su) When a goliath's
      hit points are reduced to 10% its total (21 hp for most clockwork
      goliaths) or less but still above 0, it self-destructs on its next turn,
      bursting in an explosion of metal scraps and steam that deals 12d6 points
      of slashing damage plus 12d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within
      a 20-foot-radius burst. A successful DC 24 Reflex save halves the damage.
      The save is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The thunderous clockwork goliath is easily recognized as the epitome of
    technology created to destroy. The exact nature of a clockwork goliath's
    "hands" varies-they all resolve as slam attacks in melee combat, though.
  - >-
    The clockwork goliath towers over most creatures and buildings; standing at
    a height of 45 feet, it weighs over 100 tons.

    The clockwork goliath is one of the most difficult of its kind to create.
