      An old or older copper dragon is surrounded by an aura of slowness. All
      creatures within 5 feet of the dragon must make a Will save or be affected
      as per slow for 1 round. An ancient dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. For
      great wyrm copper dragons, those opponents that fail their saves are
      slowed for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to the dragon's breath
      weapon. A copper dragon can suppress or activate this aura at will as a
      free action.
  - name: Slow Breath (Su)

      Instead of a line of acid, a copper dragon can breathe a cone of slowing
