SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Goodness (Su)
    description: >-
      An empyreal radiates an aura in a 30-foot radius spread around its form.
      Any non-evil creature in this area must succeed on a DC 23 Will save or be
      overcome with awe and unable to attack the empyreal that round. Evil
      creatures within the area must make a successful DC 23 Will save or be
      unable to even look at that empyreal for one day. An affected evil
      creature functions as if blinded (as the blindness spell) when attacking
      that empyreal. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the aura of
      goodness of that empyreal for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based and
      includes a +2 bonus.
  - name: Radiant Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, an empyreal can increase the radiance of its form and
      release it in a cone-shaped blast to a range of 60 feet that deals 15d6
      points of damage and blinds any creature in the area (as the blindness
      spell) for 3d6 minutes. Affected creatures can make a successful DC 21
      Reflex save to halve the damage and avoid being blinded. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Empyreals are knights and warriors in the service of good deities. While
    closely associated with other angels, empyreals are often found leading holy
    armies against the forces of evil. They are fiery, quick-tempered, and
    forceful, but always fair.
  - >-
    In the upper planes those that serve as commanders spend their time
    organizing their troops and planning strategies. While the more powerful
    empyreals serve as commanders, the lesser can be found performing any number
    of duties, whether it is acting as guard, servant, or messenger.
  - >-
    Empyreals that enter combat prefer to attack their opponents with a mixture
    of magic and direct physical attacks with their longswords. Against powerful
    foes, an empyreal uses its radiant blast to catch as many foes as it can in
    the area of effect. During battle, an empyreal often stays aloft where it
    can blast its foes with spells while staying out of melee range.
