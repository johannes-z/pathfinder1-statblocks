Description:
  - >-
    Although ferocious in shape, with radiant scales, cobralike hoods, and
    powerful serpentine bodies, guardian nagas serve as dutiful protectors of
    places of fundamental power and sanctity. Their scales often bear elaborate
    patterns similar to those of exotic jungle snakes. A typical guardian naga
    stretches 14 feet long and weighs approximately 350 pounds. While many
    guardian nagas adhere to the exotic practices of ancient or forgotten
    faiths, others are merely drawn to sites of innate wonder-towering
    waterfalls, natural spires, mountaintop temples-minding them out of their
    own senses of duty and reverence. Often these nagas join a living faith,
    serving as protectors of sanctuaries or ancient treasures. A pair of nagas
    might take up residence near a site they deem worthy of protection, hatching
    a brood and raising their offspring there. When the young grow to adulthood,
    they have the choice of departing to seek their own homes or staying to
    protect their elder's charge. Sometimes, a guardian naga protecting a ruin
    or temple is but the current protector in a line of sentinels stretching
    back centuries. Such sentinels often take the same name as their forebears
    to appear as a single, exceptionally long-lived figure.
