SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Wisdom Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that takes rend damage from a moon-beast must succeed at a DC
      22 Will save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain. A moon-beast heals 5
      points of damage for each point of Wisdom it drains in this manner. If it
      drains a victim to 0 Wisdom, the moon-beast gains the effects of a heal
      spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Moon-beasts have no voice or eyes, yet they "see" more than most and can
    project their thoughts into the very minds of those they wish to communicate
    with. These monstrosities hail not from any physical moon, but rather from
    the shared satellite of all slumbering minds in the Dimension of Dream
    beyond the wall of sleep. Here, the moon-beasts raise stone cities on the
    oily shores of night-black seas found upon the dark side of the dreaming
    moon, from which they launch long, dark galleys crewed by not-quite-human
    slaves that sail through the void of space down to the seas of the Dimension
    of Dream to seek new slaves and stranger, more sinister wares.
  - >-
    Moon-beasts are slavers, first and foremost. They use their spell-like
    abilities to curb rebellion or to quickly gain minions, but much prefer
    using physical and mental regimens of torment and reconditioning to break
    the spirit of their captives. They often work with the denizens of Leng, a
    metaphysically nearby dimension of nightmare and madness, although as often
    as not these planar neighbors serve the moon-beasts merely as slaves.
  - >-
    Worshipers of ageless entities from beyond the stars, moon-beasts are often
    compelled to travel to the Material Plane for strange and frightening
    causes, not the least of which is gathering suitable sacrifices for their
    mysterious and demanding lords.
  - A moon-beast is 9 feet long and weighs 800 pounds.
