Description_Visual: >-
  Covered with mossy growths and creeping vines, this towering creature glides
  effortlessly across the ground. A hood of damp moss and crusty bark conceals
  the monster's face.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Envelop (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Malfesh Monster can wrap a Medium or smaller creature in its vines as
      a standard action. The Melfesh Monster attempts a grapple that does not
      provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it
      establishes a hold and deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage if the target
      fails a DC 17 Fortitude save. Attacks that hit the Melfesh Monster while
      it has a target enveloped deal half their damage to the monster and half
      to the trapped victim.
  - name: Poison Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Melfesh Monster can exude a cloud of poisonous gas in a 20-foot radius
      up to 3 times per day. Creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 17
      Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds and sickened for 1d4 hours
      afterward. This is a poison effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The sleepy town of Melfesh has endured threats ranging from a gang of
    displaced troglodytes causing havoc to the strained political ramifications
    of having a drawbridge controlling trade through southeastern Varisia, but
    none trouble the place like the Melfesh Monster. Miners working the
    foothills of the Fenwall Mountains and farmers in the countryside
    surrounding Melfesh speak in hushed tones of a strange and malevolent
    monster that haunts the area. Those who claim to have encountered the thing
    return from their encounters pale and ill, speaking of a bizarre plantlike
    creature with burning red eyes, and twisted limbs that shoot jets of flame.
    A stench like acrid, burning dung follows the monster. Some who encounter
    the creature stumble out of the woods addlepated, raving of a hovering
    creature and its fire and poisonous mist. Adults away from the safety of
    town aren't the only ones terrorized by the creature, as parents use
    embellished stories of the Melfesh Monster to frighten children into
    behaving properly.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Very little information is recorded about the Melfesh Monster, since so few
    have seen the creature. A handful of researchers enamored with studying
    monsters have written about the creature on their travels through Varisia,
    though no two accounts agree on its true nature. Some think it to be from
    another world or dimension, while others believe it is a plant creature of
    magical sentience, akin to a corrupted treant or some dark, fey-stricken
    creature. Even the camp claiming otherworldly origin is split on the
    details. Some say the Malfesh Monster hails from the horrid wastes of
    Abaddon, and others insist the First World birthed this frightening
    creature. Both its form and behavior could easily suit either of these
    theories. The Melfesh Monster never consumes its kills; it simply leaves
    charred corpses, twisted by fear, in its wake. Victims of the Melfesh
    Monster are found curled into a fetal position and burned so thoroughly they
    are barely recognizable to even their closest friends and relatives. Some
    speculate the creature feeds on strong feelings of agony, despair, and
    terror. Most who encounter the Melfesh Monster are solitary travelers,
    miners, hunters, or farmers. This suggests the creature prefers to prey upon
    single targets, but a few stories tell of it attacking a wagon full of
    farmers returning from a day at the market or a trio of teenage boys playing
    around in the woods at night. Either way, as of late, most citizens of
    Melfesh and the surrounding countryside don't go out alone after dark for
    long.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Officially, the Melfesh Monster exists only in the minds of drunkards and
    those prone to fanciful daydreams. The sparse evidence of the creature has
    yet to compel the local militia (or any of the nearby Hellknights) to
    mobilize any significant hunting party to eradicate the creature, and
    authorities who are shown places scorched by the monster's fiery jets write
    them off as merely small-scale wildfires caused by lightning or
    out-of-control campfires left by local hunters or miners. When would-be
    monster hunters show up in Melfesh, the locals have no shortage of stories
    to tell about the monster-usually heard from a distant cousin or a friend of
    a friend who claimed to have seen it. Several unscrupulous merchants in the
    area made a small industry of selling bits of slag supposedly resulting from
    the monster's fire, or maps to various caves and lairs the monster might
    inhabit. With little credible information to go on, and the creature's
    ability to fly making it impossible to track, most of the hunters give up
    the chase after having their purses lightened at nearby inns and taverns. To
    date, no lair thought to belong to the creature has been found, nor have any
    tracks of the Melfesh Monster been accurately identif ied ( just the scorch
    marks from its jets of flame). In Melfesh, sketches of the creature hang on
    the walls in taverns and inns, some drawn by those who encountered the
    creature and lived, and others sketched by those interested in the monster
    and the stories about it. All of these depictions are roughly the same,
    though some contain certain embellishments or exaggerations, such as extra
    appendages, varying color schemes, or inf lated body size. Some inn owners
    sell these drawings to monster hunters for prices that fluctuate wildly,
    seemingly set only by how severely the inn owners think they can gouge any
    particular buyer. Just last fall, a group hailing from Korvosa bought a
    skillfully drawn illustration of the Melfesh Monster from a tavern for 10
    gold pieces, though it was little help to the group in finding the monster.
    Though the monster has became a major nuisance only in the last 30 years,
    stories with details matching recent accounts of the Melfesh Monster
    circulated among the Varisian wanderers as long as 600 years ago. These
    tales, told around campfires as a warning to the traveling people, hint that
    a creature like the monster-or even the monster itself-has been a threat in
    the region for a long time. No one knows what made the creature lie dormant
    for so long, and frankly, the frightened populace is merely waiting until
    this particular bit of local folklore fades into the past.
