SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alternate Form (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a flesh colossus can break apart into four
      composite creatures. These composite creatures are identical to flesh
      golems (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 160) but lack the golem's DR and the
      berserk and immunity to magic abilities. They gain DR 5/epic, electricity
      absorption, and selective antimagic aura (10 feet). Divide the colossus's
      current total hit points by 4 to determine how many hit points each
      composite creature has. Reverting into a single form requires all of the
      remaining composite creatures to be adjacent to each other and a
      full-round action. When this occurs, add up the remaining hit points to
      determine the colossus's total hit points.
