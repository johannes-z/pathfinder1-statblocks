    description: >-
      All boring beetles within 1 mile of each other are in constant
      communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If
      one in the group is not flatfooted, then none of them are. No boring
      beetle in a group is considered flanked unless all of them are.
Description:
  - >-
    Boring beetles feed primarily on wood, mold, fungus, and other organic
    matter. They make their lairs inside ancient tunnels and caverns, where they
    harvest and grow molds and fungi. Shriekers are prized for both food and
    their use as alarms to warn the boring beetles of intrusion. Boring beetles
    are about 9 feet long.
  - >-
    Boring beetles bite with their powerful mandibles. Slain victims are dragged
    to their lair and used to grow new molds and fungi.
