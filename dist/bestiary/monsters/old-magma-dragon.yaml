Description:
  - >-
    Temperamental and prone to violent outbursts, magma dragons are regarded by
    most other dragons as dangerously insane-an assumption that, more often than
    not, proves correct. One can rarely predict a magma dragon's state of mind
    until it either attacks or attempts to engage in conversation. For their
    part, magma dragons can justify all of their actions-they just rarely feel
    the need to do so.
