Group: Dragon

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Boiling Bite (Su)
    description: >-
      At old age, a mist dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of fire
      damage. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to
      6d6.
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A mist dragon's breath weapon is a cone of cloudy scalding vapor. In still
      air, the vapor lingers for 1d4 rounds and forms a cloud that covers a
      radius equal to the cone's length; on the second round, the vapor
      condenses into a heated smothering fog that deals 1d6 points of fire
      damage to creatures each round they remain in the area (Fortitude save
      halves this damage). The fog also blinds creatures (as the blindness
      spell) that fail the save as long as they remain within in the cloud and
      for 2 rounds after they leave the area.
  - name: Mist Form (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a juvenile or older mist dragon can assume gaseous
      form, but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20
      feet with perfect maneuverability. A great wyrm mist dragon's abilities
      while in mist form improve drastically. As a standard action a great wyrm
      mist dragon in mist form can make a single melee attack of its choice at
      its highest attack bonus. This attack deals normal damage. As a full-round
      action, a great wyrm mist dragon in mist form can attack with its breath
      weapon.
  - name: Mist Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A very young mist dragon can see perfectly in foggy conditions (such as
      those created by fog cloud or obscuring mist). Spell-like Abilities A mist
      dragon gains the following spelllike abilities, usable at will upon
      reaching the listed age category. Young-create water; Juvenile-fog cloud;
      Adult-wind wall; Old-solid fog; Ancient-control winds; Great Wyrm-control
  - name: water Water Breathing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A very young or older mist dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and
      can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while
      submerged.
Description:
  - >-
    Mist dragons are relatively passive (for dragons) and reclusive, preferring
    to spend their time away from most other races (including other mist
    dragons). Mist dragons make their lairs near large sources of water such as
    waterfalls, lakes, and seashores. A mist dragon resembles a gold dragon in
    shape and size. Its scales are shiny-blue white as a hatchling and gradually
    darken to a blue-gray color with metallic silver splotches. Mist dragons
    usually spend their days moving from place to place in mist form. If
    threatened or angered, a mist dragon assumes solid form and attacks using
    its breath weapon, claws, and bite. Credit The Mist Dragon originally
