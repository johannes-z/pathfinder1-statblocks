SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Smoke (Su)
    description: >-
      In battle, a nightmare exhales smoke that chokes and blinds foes, filling
      a 15-foot cone each round as a free action. Anyone in the cone must
      succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or become sickened until 1d6 minutes
      after leaving the area. This smoke acts as obscuring mist for the purposes
      of concealment. The smoke persists for 1 round. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Nightmares are flaming harbingers of death. They allow only the most evil of
    creatures to ride them, and are never mere mounts, but rather willing
    partners in destruction.
