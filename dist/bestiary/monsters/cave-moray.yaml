SpecialAbilities:

    description: >-
      If a cave moray surprises its opponent, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus
      to its attack roll for that round.
  - name: Recoil Attack (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cave moray lunges out of its cyst up to 5 feet to strike at passing
      opponents or prey. This attack is swift enough to attack running or flying
      creatures. A cave moray's recoil attack is always considered a charge
      attack since it recoils into its cyst after an attack to lunge at its
      opponent again.
Description:
  - >-
    Cave morays make their lairs underground in abandoned mines, dungeons, or
    natural occurring caves, usually near corridors, hallways or other areas of
    high traffic. Its lair is a burrow, just large enough for its body dug into
    the walls. Only one cave moray inhabits each burrow.
  - >-
    A typical cave moray cluster contains an equal number of males and females,
    while a colony is often contains more females than males.
  - >-
    Even so, the male cave moray dominates the colony. Mating occurs in the
    warmer months of the year with a gestation period of about 6 months. Young
    are born live and depend completely on their mother for nourishment and food
    until they are about 8 months old.
  - >-
    A cave moray is a carnivore and its diet consists of whatever it can kill.
    Prey is devoured immediately and never stored or saved for later. A typical
    adult cave moray can go a month or more without eating.
  - >-
    A cave moray's favored tactic is to lie in wait in its cyst-like burrow in
    the wall and attack whenever prey passes nearby. Two or more cave morays
    usually strike in unison, one from each side of a passage. After an attack,
    a cave moray recoils into its cyst to strike again.
