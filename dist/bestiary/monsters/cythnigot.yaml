SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures that succumb to a cythnigot's horrific appearance become
      sickened for 1 round-a cythnigot's horrific appearance only functions to a
      range of 10 feet. Once a creature makes a saving throw against a
      particular cythnigot's horrific appearance, that creature is immune to the
      horrific appearance of all cythnigots for 24 hours. A spellcaster that has
      a cythnigot as a familiar is immune to the horrific appearance of all
      cythnigots, and also gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against any
      qlippoth's horrific appearance.
  - name: Spores (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature bitten by a cythnigot must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or
      become infested by the creature's otherworldly spores. These spores cause
      twitching spikes and hideous pallid growths of hair-like fibers to erupt
      from the bite wound and to writhe and wrap around the target's limbs. A
      creature suffering from these spores is entangled, and can attempt a new
      DC 11 Fortitude save in later rounds as a standard action to rip the
      tendrils free and escape the entangled condition. The effects of multiple
      cythnigot bites on a creature do not stack. Plant creatures take a -4
      penalty on saves against this effect. This is a disease effect. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The cythnigot is a foul fungal parasite that grows and thrives within the
    corpses of small animals. The fungus transforms the host corpse in hideous
    ways, adding legs or rearranging features-a rat might gain an extra pair of
    legs and an insectoid visage, while a cat could lose all its legs and fur
    and gain a snake-like body. The only thing that all cythnigots have in
    common is a long stalk of fungal material that extends up from the
    creature's body, ending in a surprisingly strong set of fanged jaws. A
    cythnigot without a host body appears as little more than a foul-smelling
    puff ball the size of a human's fist.
  - >-
    Chaotic evil spellcasters of caster level 7th who have the Improved Familiar
    feat can gain a cythnigot as a familiar-to do so, the spellcaster must
    already have a Tiny animal as a familiar.
  - >-
    Infusing this familiar with the spores results in a cythnigot that is a
    loyal, if rather disgusting, minion of the spellcaster.
  - A cythnigot is about 20 inches long and weighs 10 pounds.
