SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by a thrown object (see telekinesis below) must succeed on
      a DC 15 Will save or flee in terror for 2d6 rounds. A creature that
      successfully saves is immune to the fear effect of the same poltergeist
      for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Natural Invisibility (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability is constant, allowing a poltergeist to remain invisible even
      when attacking. This ability is inherent, cannot be dispelled or negated,
      and is not subject to the invisibility purge spell.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      Like ghosts, it's difficult to destroy a poltergeist through simple
      combat: the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Unlike ghosts,
      powerful spells such as dispel evil usually are effective. Short of that,
      however, the only way to permanently destroy a poltergeist is to determine
      the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from
      resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require
      a good deal of research, and should be created specifically for each
      different poltergeist or group of poltergeists by the GM.
  - name: Telekinesis (Su)
    description: >-
      A poltergeist can create a telekinetic effect to hurl one object or
      creature within 10 feet to a distance of 60 feet (no range increment).
      This ability functions as the violent thrust version of the telekinesis
      spell (caster level 10th) with the following exceptions: the poltergeist
      can hurl only one object or creature per round; the poltergeist uses its
      Charisma modifier (usually +2) to modify its base attack bonus. A creature
      targeted by this ability can make a DC 13 Will save to avoid being hurled
      by the poltergeist. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Both wild and domesticated animals can sense the unnatural presence of a
      poltergeist at a distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach
      nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as
      long as they are within that range.
Description:
  - >-
    Poltergeists are undead spirits that haunt the area where they died. A
    poltergeist has no material form and cannot manifest on the Material Plane.
    Most poltergeists are evil, as they are "trapped" in the area where they
    were killed and can never leave this area unless they are destroyed.
  - This "prison" drives them mad and they come to hate all living creatures.
  - >-
    Poltergeists cannot manifest on the Material Plane and attack by picking up
    objects and hurling them at opponents.
