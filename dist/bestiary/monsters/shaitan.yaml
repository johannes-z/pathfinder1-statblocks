    Shaitans are boastful and proud genies from the Plane of Earth with flesh of
    metal, gems, or stone. A shaitan stands about 11 feet tall and weighs
    roughly 5,000 pounds. Some shaitans are noble. Often called pashas, they
    have 18 Hit Dice and gain the spell-like ability earthquake, usable once per
    day, as well as the ability to grant up to three wishes per day (nongenies
    only). A noble shaitan's caster level for its spell-like abilities is 18th.
    Noble shaitans are CR 13.
