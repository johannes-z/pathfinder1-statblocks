  A long crimson cloak drapes over the form of this large faceless being, which

  with blue currents of electricity.

IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adaptable Life Force (Su)
    description: >-
      Any effect that heals living creatures and harms undead or heals undead
      and harms living creatures (such as cure spells, inflict spells, and
      channeled energy) always heals the herald, even if the source of the power
      intended to harm it.
  - name: Contact Other Plane (Sp)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as the spell contact other plane, but the herald
      can only ask questions on the behalf of another creature, the questioner
      (not the herald) must make the Intelligence check (if any) to avoid losing
      Intelligence or Charisma, and the loss is permanent rather than temporary.
  - name: Destructive Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, the herald can emit a 30-foot aura of destruction for
      15 rounds per day. All attacks made against targets in this aura
      (including the herald) gain a +7 morale bonus on damage rolls, and all
      critical threats are automatically confirmed. These rounds do not need to
      be consecutive.
  - name: Maddening Strike (Su)
    description: >-
      If the herald successfully hits a creature with its flail, as a swift
      action it may force the opponent to make a DC 25 Will save. If the
      creature fails its save, it is confused for 1 round. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Madness (Ex)
    description: >-
      The herald uses its Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of its Wisdom
      modifier, and is immune to insanity and confusion effects. Only a miracle
      or wish can remove its madness. If this occurs, the herald gains 6 points
      of Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma; it automatically reverts to its
      insane state 1d10 minutes later.
  - name: Telepathic Bond (Sp)
    description: >-
      This ability functions like telepathic bond, except any creature linked to
      the herald's disturbing thoughts takes 1 point of Wisdom damage every 10
      minutes.
Description:
  - >-
    Groetus's herald is End's Voice, an enigmatic creature that is both more and
    less mysterious than its master. It looks like a giant shrouded figure
    floating above the ground, legless and faceless, wielding a heavy flail with
    ends made of glowing energy. Its visage is often confused with a reaping
    undead, though it is a living outsider and acts mildly insulted when others
    assume it to be otherwise. Its voice is hollow and distorted, as if echoing
    from the far end of a long metal tube, and colored with accents from ruined
    empires and dead languages. It rarely comes to Golarion, and for most of
    these visits it is merely a silent witness to a great slaughter upon the
    battlefield or the last gasp of a dying city, though it may strike out with
    its weapon or magic at a seemingly random wounded or dying target, as if
    making sure the creature dies as expected.
  - >-
    The herald may be insane from associating with Groetus, but it has a clarity
    unknown to mortal worshipers of the God of the End Times; perhaps its vast
    knowledge somehow protected it from a truly insane fate, or its status as a
    herald may give it a kind of lucidity that pierces the fog of madness. It
    does not cackle at itself like a madman, respond to unheard voices, kill for
    pleasure, or exhibit any of a dozen other obvious signs of insanity
    typically exhibited by the mad followers of Groetus.
  - >-
    Ecology End's Voice does not eat, drink, or breathe; it lacks a face or
    mouth, and cannot be bribed with food or pleasure. It acts like an unfeeling
    thing, more patient than a mountain, slowly scouring away at existence like
    the ocean's tide or a desert wind. It has no role in the creation of life,
    and does not seem to take any part in the cultivation or upbringing of
    creatures or civilizations.
  - >-
    Though it is known to kill without being provoked, it only does so if the
    target has already suffered serious harm or is on the brink of death, and
    even these it may ignore; it has drifted over a bloody battle, passing
    hundreds of dying heroes and off icers, only to strike at a single common
    soldier before vanishing. Once, it killed a human woman moments after a diff
    icult but successful birth, and chose to spare the child. It acts in this
    callous way toward mortals, undead, outsiders, and even dragons, but never
    against mindless creatures or those with animal-level intellect. Perhaps
    these killings are the directive of Groetus, steering a soul's course in the
    afterlife or preventing some future event; perhaps they represent an obscure
    code, with the time of death and name of the deceased unlocking a cipher
    over the course of a millennium; or perhaps they are just random acts of
    violence, the only evidence of the creature's tightly suppressed lunacy. If
    attacked, End's Voice retaliates, though sometimes it ends combat simply by
    driving some or all of its opponents insane and then retreating. It may
    return to dispatch these defeated foes days, months, or years later, even on
    the victim's deathbed, or it may ignore them utterly and show no recognition
    if the healed opponents confront it again.
  - >-
    When called by mortals, the herald demands specif ic deeds of death, injury,
    or property damage, for End's Voice always seeks to further the end of
    times. For example, it may ask that every third adult male in a village be
    branded on the face with a mysterious symbol, or that a prince with black
    hair be nearly drowned, or a castle's eastern wall be cracked but left
    standing. Usually, these acts have no apparent link to the needs of the
    herald's conjurer, and most create a series of events that takes years or
    decades to play out. It favors the burning of incense and exotic woods,
    lingering over the fragrant smoke and making strange contortions. HABITAT &
    SOCIETY When not serving Groetus or called by the faithful to perform a
    specif ic task, the herald flies over the surface of Groetus's moon, pausing
    to alter parts of the writing on the surface or draw runes on a blank area
    untouched by the god's madness. Sometimes it can be seen curled up there on
    the moon or reclining somewhere on the Astral Plane as if sleeping, though
    the eerie being is clearly not at rest. It makes no gestures of friendship
    or comradeship toward other divine servants of Groetus, though it accepts
    their presence (and their insanity) as if used to them. On one occasion, it
    absorbed a servitor into itself, inhaling the creature like smoke, then
    expelling it a year later with no explanation or apparent harm to the
    creature.
