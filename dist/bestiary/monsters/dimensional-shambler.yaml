SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dimension Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dimensional shambler can take actions normally after using dimension
      door effects. A dimensional shambler under the effects of a dimensional
      anchor or dimensional lock spell can ignore the effects of the spell for 1
      round by making a DC 25 Knowledge (planes) check as a move action.
  - name: Resist Conjuration (Ex)
    description: >-
      Dimensional shamblers detest being conjured by other creatures. They are
      immune to all spell effects of the summoning school, and are treated as if
      they had double their actual Hit Dice (18 HD for most dimensional
      shamblers) for the purposes of determining if they can be conjured by
      spells like planar ally or planar binding.
  - name: Shift Planes (Su)
    description: >-
      A dimensional shambler can shift between planes once per hour, using an
      effect that is similar to that created by the plane shift spell, save that
      a dimensional shambler is a master of such travel and can manifest at an
      exact location on its destination plane if it makes a DC 20 Knowledge
      (planes) check. If it exceeds this DC by 10 or more, it can place itself
      in such a position upon arrival that if combat immediately results from
      its appearance, it gains a +10 bonus on its resulting initiative check.
      Using shift planes is a full-round action that provokes attacks of
      opportunity, during which the dimensional shambler shimmers and grows
      increasingly transparent. A dimensional shambler can use this ability
      while grappling a creature-doing so does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity from the creature it is grappling. If the creature is of the
      dimensional shambler's size or smaller (Medium for most dimensional
      shamblers), that creature shifts planes with the dimensional shambler
      unless it makes a DC 15 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The dimensional shambler is a vagabond of the realms between realms. With
    its ability to shift planes, it is no stranger to the weirdest the Great
    Beyond has to offer, and despite its brutish and unrefined intellect, its
    knowledge of the planes and the relationships between dimensions is
    significant indeed.
  - >-
    A dimensional shambler is humanoid in outline, yet it moves with a weird and
    alien gait that gives it the appearance of a creature not in full possession
    of its faculties, almost as if it were drunk or horribly wounded. Yet those
    who mistake this shambling posture as a sign of weakness swiftly learn of
    their error, for the dimensional shambler is in fact quite agile-the weird
    lumbering cadence of its movements is simply another outward manifestation
    of its inhuman countenance.
  - >-
    A dimensional shambler typically stands just over 7 feet in height, and
    weighs 350 pounds.
  - >-
    Ecology As outsiders, dimensional shamblers have no need to feed-a trait
    that comes in handy for a creature that often finds itself adrift or lost in
    strange realms where food and water does not-or perhaps cannot-exist. They
    are certainly most at home in regions that function similarly to most
    Material Plane worlds, for their bodies are built to traverse the ground.
    They have no inborn ability to fly, cannot breathe water, and possess no
    unusual resistance to energies, and as such there are many realms throughout
    the Great Beyond that are dangerous or even deadly to dimensional shamblers.
    Yet they are masters of traveling the planes, and instinctively avoid
    appearing in regions that would cause them harm. More powerful dimensional
    shamblers often seek out magical devices to aid them in traveling the
    stranger and less hospitable corners of reality.
  - >-
    The need a dimensional shambler has for exploring the Great Beyond is not
    fully understood by mortal scholars. Certainly, curiosity seems to be a
    large part of their drive-a dimensional shambler can spend weeks or even
    years simply observing a particularly unusual planar feature, such as the
    expulsion of raw protolife from the Positive Energy Plane into the
    surrounding realities, the strange semianimate heavings of an Abyssal swamp
    giving birth to a legion of demons, or the mind-numbing violence of a
    reality storm deep in the Maelstrom. As chaotic evil outsiders, they are
    most comfortable on planes that either have no strong alignment traits or
    are close to chaotic evil, yet this does not prevent them from exploring
    realms beyond.
  - >-
    The mind of a dimensional shambler, as with its body and mobility, is not
    quite "in tune" with mortal expectations, and it may be that what scholars
    have assumed is curiosity could be some other driving force. Perhaps the
    race instinctively travels the Great Beyond in search of a forgotten or
    hidden goal, or maybe the constant change of reality is something that
    brings them pleasure or some strange nutrition.
  - >-
    Dimensional shamblers generally lack the wits to carry on long philosophical
    discussions, and are prone to attacking other creatures when they encounter
    them, so attempts to learn more about this mysterious race through
    conversation have not resulted in particularly informative results.
  - >-
    Habitat & Society Dimensional shamblers seem to have very little interest in
    others of their kind. While they do not display any instinctual need for
    violence against others of their ilk when chance brings them together,
    neither do they seek out their own kind for companionship.
  - >-
    Dimensional shamblers are solitary beings, and the majority of their
    interactions with other forms of life are violent- they are fond of
    snatching creatures who are capable of comprehending their own peril and
    whisking them away to remote corners of the multiverse.
  - >-
    Those few who have endured these abductions and survived to tell the tale
    did so either by escaping their captors and hiding, or by slaying the
    shamblers. In all cases, their return home has involved harrowing journeys
    through the Great Beyond, for the dimensional shambler is frustratingly
    skilled at selecting particularly remote and dangerous realms as
    destinations for its abductions. The fate of the majority of these victims
    is unknown, although circumstantial evidence indicates that the shambler
    itself plays a key and grisly role in the victims' doom.
  - >-
    Spellcasters have long sought to harness the dimensional shambler's ability
    to accurately travel between planes.
  - >-
    Mortal magic has traditionally found this feat a difficult one to
    master-plane shift is notorious for its inaccuracy, often leaving powerful
    effects like gate, miracle, or wish as the favored methods of safe
    interplanar travel. Yet the dimensional shambler seems able to navigate the
    unnavigable with ease, traveling between incredibly diverse and distant
    locations with no more difficulty than a human might have stepping out of a
    house into his own front yard. Unfortunately, the same mastery over
    dimensional travel that affords shamblers such accurate navigation allows
    them to resist the call of conjurers with surprising skill.
  - >-
    In fact, by the time most spellcasters master the magic required to lure or
    conjure a dimensional shambler, it is often a simpler matter to use a gate
    spell instead.
  - >-
    Some conjurers claim to have developed methods of attracting dimensional
    shamblers more easily.
  - >-
    Through the use of blood sacrifice via a blade of purest metal and the
    application of exacting mathematical symbols or other complex combinations
    of runes, these spellcasters can call upon dimensional shamblers with
    relative ease. Unfortunately, the exact combination of runes, metals, and
    bloodshed seems different for every dimensional shambler, so once a
    spellcaster discovers the correct combination to lure one of these monsters,
    the secret that caster has uncovered is as closely guarded as her greatest
    treasures. The nature and availability of these secret rituals are left to
    the GM to determine, but such a ritual's recipe could well be worth 8,000 gp
    or more to an interested party.
