SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bitter Cold (Ex)
    description: >-
      A glacial haunt radiates intense cold in a 10- foot radius. Creatures in
      or entering the area take 1d2 points of cold damage each round.
  - name: Heat Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A glacial haunt's slam attack drains away body heat from living creatures.
      This attack deals 1d4 points of Strength damage to a living creature. This
      is a negative energy effect. A creature freezes to death if this Strength
      damage equals or exceeds its actual Strength score.
  - name: Lifesense (Ex)
    description: >-
      A glacial haunt can detect living creatures within 100 feet by the heat
      their bodies radiate. This includes invisible creatures.
  - name: Snow Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A burrowing glacial haunt can pass through ice and snow as easily as a
      fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole,
      nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence.
Description:
  - >-
    The icy wastes sometimes grant unlife to those who freeze to death at her
    unforgiving hands. The result is a glacial haunt, the utter bane of the
    unwary traveler, for the glacial haunt is drawn to the heat of all sources,
    be it from magic, fires, or the warmth given off by living creatures.
    Glacial haunts spend most of their time wandering their frigid domains
    seeking to kill and devour anything they encounter. When winter spreads her
    icy embrace to other lands, the glacial haunt's hunting grounds increase.

    A glacial haunt is 6 feet tall and weighs about 165 pounds. It is usually
    dressed in the attire it wore at the time of its death, though much of it
    has rotted or fallen away. Glacial haunts seem to understand, and possibly
    be able to speak, the Common tongue, but no encounters with these creatures
    has born any hard evidence of this. Multiple glacial haunts in a single
    encounter is rare and believed to come about when a group of adventurers
    succumb to the cold and perish together. Others have speculated that glacial
    haunts actually reproduce by melting and then splitting into two identical
    creatures.
  - >-
    Glacial haunts detest living creatures and attack them on sight. A favored
    tactic of glacial haunts is to burrow into the snow when it detects living
    creatures in its domain, and then spring from ambush to assault them when
    they move near. Glacial haunts batter their foes with their fists, seeking
    to destroy them by literally smashing the life from them.
