SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Madness (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature within a 60-foot radius of the vespergaunt must succeed at a
      DC 21 save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. Once a creature successfully
      saves, it cannot be affected by the same vespergaunt's aura again for 24
      hours. As a free action, the vespergaunt can suppress its aura. This is a
      mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Damage Reduction (Su)
    description: >-
      A vespergaunt's damage reduction is bypassed by any weapons that are
      chaos-, evil-, good-, or law-aligned.
  - name: Siphon Spirit (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature touched by a vespergaunt must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or
      gain 1 negative level as the vespergaunt rips away a portion of its soul.
      A divine spellcaster gains an additional negative level with each failed
      save. The victim must save anew each time it is touched, and a character
      killed by this attack disintegrates completely except for its eyes and
      strands of brain matter, which become part of the vespergaunt. Only
      powerful magic such as miracle or wish can resurrect a creature slain in
      this manner.
Description:
  - >-
    Often called "heresy oozes," vespergaunts are emissaries and tools of the
    horrible god-things of the Dark Tapestry. Found primarily on Aucturn,
    vespergaunts act as spiritual conduits for those attempting to contact the
    Great Old Ones, collecting and relaying those prayers deemed worthy while
    also preparing inhabited worlds for the coming of the Dominion of the Black.
    A typical vespergaunt is 8 feet tall and 6 feet wide, and weighs just 50
    pounds.
