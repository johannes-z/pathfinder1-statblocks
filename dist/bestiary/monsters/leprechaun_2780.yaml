Description:
  - >-
    Leprechauns are short fey creatures, about 2 feet tall. They favor brightly
    colored clothes, particularly greens and reds. Leprechauns are a jovial
    people, enjoying fine food and drink; some leprechauns also enjoy a good
    smoke from a long-stemmed pipe. They are a tricky folk and enjoy jokes and
    pranks, although they usually do not appreciate being the victims of such
    acts. Most leprechauns are skilled pickpockets, and it is a favored prank of
    these wee folk to filch items from unsuspecting travelers in their domain
    and then taunt the intruders into pursuit. The leprechaun so involved in the
    prank often alternates between being visible and invisible as he teases and
    pesters his pursuers in a merry chase. Leprechauns tire of pranks quickly,
    however, and will give up the stolen item and sneak away. Some say
    leprechauns are descendants of halflings and pixies.
  - >-
    Leprechauns summarily dismiss this rumor, however, scoffing at those who
    repeat it.
  - Leprechauns are fun-loving creatures and prefer to avoid combat.
  - When facing opponents, a leprechaun usually turns invisible and flees.
  - >-
    If forced into melee, a leprechaun uses its abilities to their fullest
    extent, seeking to drive an opponent off rather than kill it.
