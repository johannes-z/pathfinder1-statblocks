Description:

    Giant funnel-web spiders are deadly, nocturnal predators that dine on living
    creatures. Most of their time is spent inside their tube-like lair where
    they simply wait for prey to pass by. Once prey is detected, they rush to
    the attack, quickly poisoning their target, and dragging it back into their
    lair.
  - >-
    Giant funnel-web lairs are large spiraling tubes with open funnel-like
    mouths, typically built under large rocks, fallen trees, or straight into
    the ground. The entirely of the tube is covered with thick spider webs. Trip
    lines radiate outward from the mouth of the lair, up to 100 feet away. These
    trip lines signal to the spider that prey is near.
  - >-
    Female funnel-web spiders are generally larger than males, with shorter legs
    and thicker abdomens. Females lay several egg sacs a few times each year
    which quickly hatch. The young rapidly develop and reach maturity within 2
    years generally, and leave the lair to go out on their own. Giant funnel-web
    spiders can live up to 20 years.
  - >-
    A giant funnel-web spider is highly aggressive. If threatened or provoked,
    unlike other spiders, it rears on its back legs and displays its fangs. This
    warning position signifies the spider is about to strike. When a funnel-web
    attacks, its grabs its prey and repeatedly injects it with its deadly
    poison.
