    description: >-
      A creature struck by a violet fungus's tentacle must succeed on a DC 15
      Fortitude save or the flesh around the point of contact swiftly begins to
      rot away, exposing raw bone with shocking swiftness. This hideous
      affliction causes 1d4 points of Strength damage and 1d4 points of
      Constitution damage. This is a poison effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The violet fungus is one of the most notorious and feared dangers of the
    world's caves. A traveler can often see signs of the violet fungus in those
    who dwell or hunt in places where these carnivorous fungi lurk. In these
    folk, deep and hideous scars mar bodies where entire furrows of flesh seem
    scooped away-the marks of a close encounter with a violet fungus. A violet
    fungus feeds on the rot and decay of organic matter, but unlike most fungi,
    they are not passive consumers of corruption. A violet fungi's tendrils can
    strike with unexpected swiftness, and are coated with a virulent venom that
    causes flesh to rot and decay with nauseating speed. This potent poison, if
    left untreated, can cause the flesh of an entire arm or leg to drop away in
    no time at all, leaving behind only warm bones that soon rot into corruption
    as well. Although violet fungi are mobile, they only move to attack or to
    hunt for prey. A violet fungus that has a steady supply of rot to sup upon
    is generally content to remain in one place. Many underground-dwelling
    cultures take advantage of this penchant, particularly troglodytes and
    vegepygmies, and keep multiple violet fungi in key junctions and entrances
    to their caverns as guardians, making sure to keep them well fed with
    carrion to prevent them wandering farther into the den in search of food.
    Some species of shriekers (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 416) are relatively
    similar in appearance to violet fungi, although they lack the tentacular
    branches. It's not uncommon to find shriekers and violet fungi growing in
    the same grove-especially in areas where other creatures cultivate the fungi
    as guardians. A violet fungus is 4 feet tall and weighs 50 pounds. Violet
    Venom Although a violet fungus's tentacles swiftly grow inert after the
    mushroom is slain, they can be wielded as Medium-sized whips for 2d6 minutes
    after being harvested from the creature. These whips inf lict rot on
    anything they touch-including the wielder of the deadly weapon-and both save
    DCs to resist and effects are identical to the stats presented above. A DC
    25 Craft (alchemy) check and 250 gp worth of reagents can preserve the venom
    somewhat, although the procedure dilutes it signif icantly. Violet Venom:
    Poison- contact; save Fort DC 13, frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes, effect
    1d2 Strength and 1d2 Con damage; cure 1 save; cost 800 gp.
