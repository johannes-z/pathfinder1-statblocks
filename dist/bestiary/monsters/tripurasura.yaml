  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      The tripurasura has only one alternative form-when it uses change shape,
      it always appears as the same Small humanoid. Most take the form of gnomes
      or human children.
  - name: Elusive (Su)
    description: >-
      The tripurasura and items it carries are considered to be under the
      effects of a nondetection spell. A caster must succeed at a DC 14 caster
      level check to overcome this effect.

Description:
  - >-
    Tripurasuras, or sly ones, are among the weakest asuras, manifestations not
    of divine mistakes but instead creations of the most powerful of asuras
    exhibiting their loathing of the gods by creating blasphemous mockeries of
    their creations. A newly created tripurasura most commonly exists for one of
    two reasons: to give an asurendra sage the raw materials it needs to create
    more powerful asuras, or to seek out mortals-especially mortal
    spellcasters-to recruit into the asura cause.
  - >-
    Using its power to assume a pleasing or innocuous form, a tripurasura
    wanders the world, seeking pious mortals to corrupt. When it encounters a
    promising spellcaster (typically one who has some sort of link to a church
    or religion, but not necessarily a divine spellcaster), the tripurasura
    presents itself as an apprentice, pilgrim, or other type of curious student
    eager to learn from the spellcaster. The tripurasura keeps its true nature
    and its powers hidden, and seeks opportunities to steer its "master" away
    from decisions it might have made in good conscience to acts that promote
    the collapse of religious belief, faith, and society. When, as it inevitably
    does, the wayward spellcaster runs afoul of justice or is confronted by
    those seeking revenge, the tripurasura fades away to watch the final stage
    of the spellcaster's fall from grace, then seeks a new victim in another
    city or region.
  - >-
    Some spellcasters, on the other hand, actually seek out these tiny fiends to
    employ as familiars. A tripurasura greatly values these opportunities, since
    it need not abandon its master once its work is done and can continue to
    spread its agenda for as long as its master survives. A spellcaster must be
    lawful evil, at least 7th level, and have the Improved Familiar feat to gain
    a tripurasura as a familiar.
