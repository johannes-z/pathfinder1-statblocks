SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Neural Pulse (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures hit by a brain ooze's tentacle must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude
      save or take 1d6 points of Intelligence damage and be staggered for 1d4
      rounds. Each time a brain ooze causes Intelligence damage, it gains 5
      temporary hit points. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Prescience (Su)
    description: >-
      Limited precognitive abilities grant a brain ooze a +2 insight bonus on
      initiative checks, on Reflex saves, and to its Armor Class. Brain oozes
      are never surprised or flat-footed.
  - name: Psychic Noise (Su)
    description: >-
      The discordant psychic noise emitted by a brain ooze dazes nearby
      creatures for 1d4 rounds. When a creature begins its turn within the aura,
      it must succeed at a DC 19 Will save to negate this effect. Whether or not
      the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same
      brain ooze's psychic noise for 24 hours. An affected creature may attempt
      a new save to shake off the effect at the end of each of its turns. This
      is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A brain ooze (sometimes known as a "killer brain") resembles almost
    precisely the raw brain of a human, save for the eldritch energy surrounding
    it and the twin tentacles extending from its sides. The creature's thought
    patterns are unusually powerful, and cause painful mental feedback in the
    minds of other conscious beings.
  - >-
    Other intelligent beings are nothing more than cattle and playthings to
    brain oozes-victims to be tormented, thought patterns to be consumed. Brain
    oozes prefer to manipulate their prey from the shadows. Rather than
    assaulting openly, they provoke fights and conf lict within groups, or lure
    one or two victims away for the kill. Brain oozes derive particular
    satisfaction from forcing an individual to commit terrible acts, then wiping
    away all knowledge of the crimes from the victim's memory. They torment such
    hapless puppets again and again, forcing them to commit ever greater
    atrocities. Once weary of their sport they return the modified memories with
    dispel magic, and feast upon the delicious misery of the victim's final
    despair.
  - >-
    Brain oozes feed through their tentacles by extracting the thoughts of
    living creatures. Animals and less intelligent creatures provide little
    nourishment, but they prize fey, outsiders, and spellcasters as delicacies.
    After several feedings, a brain ooze divides into two nearly identical
    brains, each retaining only a portion of the knowledge and experiences of
    the parent.
  - >-
    The similarities between intellect devourers and brain oozes have not gone
    unnoticed, but the two species appear to have little in common beyond
    appearance. Some theorize that brain oozes are actually the result of an
    ancient race's failed attempt to achieve immortality by preserving their
    minds via alien technology or magic.
