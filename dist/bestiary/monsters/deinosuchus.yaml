SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hold Breath (Ex)
    description: >-
      A deinosuchus can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times
      its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
  - name: Snap Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A deinosuchus making a full attack can make a second bite attack at a -2
      penalty if its primary bite attack misses.
Description:
  - >-
    The largest of all known crocodilians, the 35- to 50-foot-long, 6-ton
    deinosuchus is a massive beast. This crocodilian possesses a shorter,
    rounder snout than the typical crocodile, and thus resembles a giant
    alligator. A patient hunter, the deinosuchus is all but invisible beneath
    the surface of the water. Only its nostrils breach the water's surface,
    allowing the rest of its formidable mass to remain out of sight from even
    highly perceptive prey.
  - >-
    In combat, the deinosuchus grinds its prey between its powerful jaws,
    knocking back other foes with its formidable tail while it snaps bones and
    tears the flesh of its captured meal.
