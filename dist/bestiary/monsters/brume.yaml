Description_Visual: >-
  This semi transparent being has the appearance of a humanoid wrapped in a
  soggy funeral shroud. Long claws extend from the arms of the shroud, when its
  hood is thrown back a nose-less, ear-less face filled with needle like fangs
  and sunken black eye-sockets that glow with two wicked golden points of light.
  The creature has no apparent legs, seeming to hover inches from the ground,
  its "feet" nothing more than foul swirling vapors.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Charisma Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature touched or hit by a brume takes 1d6 points of Charisma
      damage. A creature reduced to Charisma 0 by a brume dies.
  - name: Memory Loss (Su)
    description: >-
      An opponent hit by a brume's claw attack must succeed on a DC 20 Will save
      or forget everything that has happened in the last 1d6 hours (treat this
      as a modify memory spell). The save DC is Constitution-based. Even if the
      save is successful, the opponent acts as if affected by a confusion spell
      (caster level 13th) for 2d4 hours. The confusion effects can be removed
      using break enchantment, dispel magic, or greater magic.
  - name: Insubstantial Form (Ex)
    description: >-
      A brume's insubstantial form gives it immunity to poison and critical
      hits. It cannot run, wear armor, or enter water or other liquids. It can
      pass through holes and small openings-even cracks. It can also occupy
      spaces occupied by its enemies. (This ability is similar to a gaseous form
      spell-note the brume is not subject to wind effects like the gaseous form
      spell allows.) Any piercing or slashing attack against a brume has a 20%
      miss chance. Bludgeoning attacks deal damage normally.
  - name: Lifesense (Su)
    description: >-
      A brume can automatically pinpoint the location of any living creature
      within 120 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. It also
      senses the strength of their life force automatically, as if it had cast
      deathwatch.
  - name: Natural Invisibility (Ex)
    description: A brume is effectively invisible in fog, smoke, or mist.
Description:
  - >-
    These strange creatures of extraplanar origin dwell within the mists of the
    Styx, where they are known to strangle the life from the living who finds
    themselves lost there. Brumes begin tracking enemies which enter their
    territory, seeking to steal personal effects from their target in an attempt
    to gain information about its strengths and weaknesses.
  - >-
    Brumes are almost invisible in fog, making them difficult to spot and even
    harder to kill. They feed off the energy of lost souls, devouring the lost
    dead of Styx as readily as they do the living, absorbing whatever energy
    remains in its victims and leaving behind a dried husk in their wake.
  - >-
    Occasionally brumes find their way into the material planes and reside near
    planar conduits and crossing points that lead into the Styx. Brumes may be
    bribed to act as guides through passage into Styx, but usually demand some
    form of living sacrifice in return.
  - >-
    Brume are believed to understand several languages though they are not known
    to speak.
  - >-
    Brumes rise from the mists, attacking with claws in an attempt to strangle
    their enemies silently and unseen. When faced with overwhelming numbers they
    seek to escape into the fog, where they bide their time, tracking foes over
    great distance, until such time that their foes leave the misty areas that
    they call home. Many who have been attacked by a brume and lived have no
    recollection of having fought them and seem withdrawn from others, having no
    memory of the attack itself and missing large pieces of their own identity.
  - >-
    A brume's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of
    overcoming damage reduction. A brume's natural weapons, as well as any
    weapon it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
    damage reduction.
