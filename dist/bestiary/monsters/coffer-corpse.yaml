SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Grip (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because the coffer corpse grasps the victim's throat, a creature in its
      death grip cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.
  - name: Deceiving Death (Ex)
    description: >-
      In any round in which a coffer corpse is struck for 6 or more points of
      damage (whether the damage bypasses the creature's damage reduction or
      not), the creature slumps to the ground, seemingly destroyed. If it has
      fastened its death grip on a victim, it releases its hold when it falls. A
      DC 20 Sense Motive check sees through the ruse (necromancers gain a +2
      competence bonus on this check). On its next turn, the coffer corpse rises
      again as if reanimated, triggering its fear ability.
  - name: Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature viewing a coffer corpse rise after it uses its deceiving death
      ability must make a DC 13 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds.
      This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The coffer corpse is an undead creature formed as the result of an
    incomplete death ritual. It is often found haunting stranded funeral barges
    or in other situations where a corpse has not been delivered to its final
    resting place. The creature hates life and attacks living creatures on
    sight.
  - >-
    A coffer corpse appears much as it did in life. At a distance, a coffer
    corpse is often mistaken for a zombie.
  - >-
    In combat, a coffer corpse attacks with a slam attack. It attempts to grab
    an opponent around the throat, and if successful, the creature does not let
    go until either it is destroyed or the opponent is dead. Small percentages
    (25%) of coffer corpses carry weapons (usually either longswords or clubs)
    and use those in combat instead of their slam attack. Most however, rely on
    their natural attack as it allows them to use their death grip ability
    against an opponent.
  - >-
    A coffer corpse's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
