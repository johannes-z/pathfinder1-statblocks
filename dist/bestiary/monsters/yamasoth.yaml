SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gaze Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action at the start of his turn, Yamasoth can gape his central
      maw wide to expose the horrific red eye lodged in what should be his
      throat. This gaze weapon has a range of 30 feet, and polymorphs creatures
      affected by it into giant vermin, animals, or magical beasts (Fortitude DC
      37 resists). Yamasoth chooses what creatures to transform victims into as
      they fail their saving throws. This effect otherwise functions as
      polymorph any object (CL 20th), and is a polymorph effect. Yamasoth can
      keep his maw open for up to 3 consecutive rounds, after which his
      throat-eye closes and this gaze weapon cannot be used again for 1 minute.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures that succumb to Yamasoth's horrific appearance are stunned. At
      the start of each round thereafter, a creature stunned in this way can
      make a choice- fight the overwhelming chaos and horror and attempt a new
      DC 29 Will save to end the stun effect and act normally on that round, or
      accept the chaos into its soul and automatically succeed at the save to
      recover from the stun effect. This latter option immediately shifts the
      creature's alignment one step closer to chaotic evil. This shift in
      alignment can be fixed via atonement, but counts as a voluntary alignment
      shift for the purposes of atonement's material component requirements. A
      creature that becomes chaotic evil as a result of this also becomes a
      willing minion and ally of Yamasoth.
  - name: Maw (Ex)
    description: >-
      Yamasoth's central maw is a primary attack that threatens a critical hit
      on a roll of 19-20. A creature hit by Yamasoth's maw while his gaze weapon
      is active takes a -4 penalty on its next saving throw against the gaze
      attack.
  - name: Polymorph Plague (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature that has been affected by one of Yamasoth's polymorph effects
      becomes "contagious." For 24 hours after the creature's initial
      transformation, any other creature that touches or is touched by the
      polymorphed creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the
      polymorphed creature's HD + the polymorphed creature's Constitution
      modifier) to resist polymorphing into a creature identical to the current
      form of the polymorphed creature. Qlippoth Lord Traits A qlippoth lord is
      a powerful and unique qlippoth that rules a significant portion of an
      Abyssal realm. Qlippoth lords possess the following traits. • Immunity to
      cold, death effects, mind-affecting effects, and poison. • Resistance to
      acid 30, electricity 30, and fire 30. •
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability functions similarly to the typical qlippoth ability, save
      that qlippoth lords' horrific appearances often create physical effects
      and changes in their victims. Despite these physical effects, a qlippoth
      lord's horrific appearance remains a mind-affecting effect. •
  - name: Summon Qlippoth (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a qlippoth lord can summon any qlippoth or combination of
      qlippoth whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always
      works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell. • Telepathy 300 feet. • A
      qlippoth lord's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are
      treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage
      reduction. • Qlippoth lords can grant spells to their worshipers. Granting
      spells does not require any specific action on the qlippoth lord's behalf.
      All qlippoth lords grant access to the domains of Chaos and Evil; in
      addition, they grant access to two other domains and a favored weapon that
      vary according to each qlippoth lord's themes and interests.
  - name: Tentacle Transformation (Su)
    description: >-
      At the start of every odd-numbered round, three of Yamasoth's tentacle
      tips transform into one of three different types of appendages-a serpent's
      head, a clawed hand, or a metallic blade. The three tentacles all change
      into the same type of attack, and the change persists for 1 full round,
      after which the three tentacles revert to normal tentacles on every
      even-numbered round. While transformed, the limbs make the following types
      of attacks instead of tentacle attacks. • Blade: talon +36 (3d6+13/19-20)
      • Clawed Hand: claw +36 (2d6+13 plus bleed damage equal to the damage
      dealt by the claw) • Serpent Head: bite +36 (1d8+13 plus poison: bite-
      injury; save Fort DC 37; frequency 1/round for 12 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex
      drain and slowed for 1 round; cure 3 consecutive saves)
Description:
  - >-
    Yamasoth, known also as the Polymorph Plague, dwells in the endless cavern
    realm of Sekatar- Seraktis in the Abyss. Constantly at war with bickering
    balor lords and other powerful demons, Yamasoth has held his own as the lord
    of the Abyss's largest, most centralized region: the Kingdom of New Flesh.
    The "new flesh" in question consists of the qlippoth lord's subjects- men
    and women from countless worlds who may have been kings and queens at one
    time, but here are nothing more than base monsters, vermin, and beasts to
    serve at Yamasoth's whim. Some he feeds upon. Others he keeps for his harem.
    But the bulk of the denizens of the Kingdom of New Flesh are soldiers. In
    this army, other qlippoth serve as commanders and generals, particularly
    Yamasoth's favored minions, the gongorinans (see page 90).
  - >-
    Unlike most qlippoth, Yamasoth does not necessarily prefer to kill but
    rather to transform. A human who sins and dies produces a soul that fuels
    the demonic horde, but a dumb beast or feral monster who dies is merely
    carrion. By transforming free-willed mortals into monsters, Yamasoth's Army
    of the New Flesh only becomes more capable of ending worlds. Yamasoth's
    centuries-long alliance with Runelord Alaznist may have eventually resulted
    in such an assault on Golarion, but the devastation of Earthfall ended those
    plans before Yamasoth's burgeoning realm could finalize its gestation-proof
    that even in the greatest of disasters, some good is wrought.
  - >-
    Yamasoth's interest in transformations goes far beyond mere polymorphing.
    The qlippoth lord is also fascinated by the act of fleshwarping and
    reworking life into new forms of mutants. Rumors state that the nature of
    the experiments that take place deep in the Kingdom of New Flesh closely
    mimic those the daemons performed in the Abyss so long ago that resulted in
    the first demons. In fact, some dissident demonologists claim Yamasoth
    himself is a nascent demon lord, and is in fact that first, primal demon
    born of daemonic tampering with Abyssal quintessence and sinful souls.
