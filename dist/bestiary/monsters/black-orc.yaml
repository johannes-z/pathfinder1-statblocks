Description:
  - >-
    Fully a head taller than an ordinary orc these foul brutes have been known
    to make other orcs cringe in fear. Unlike normal orcs, black orcs move in
    daylight as well as they do the darkness of their subterranean lairs (they
    do not have the light sensitivity penalty that normal orcs have). Black orcs
    were taken in early ages by Orcus the Demon Lord of Undead and bred with
    demonic blood in a matter that would accommodate his diabolical needs. Black
    orcs refer to their dark master as "Old Man Death". These orcs fairly
    worship death and display the death's head prominently upon their standards
    and devices. They are often found in the service of necromancers and move
    easily in mixed groups of zombies, skeletons, and even ghouls. Larger and
    more intelligent than their lesser kin, black orcs look down on other orc
    races as inferior to themselves. When forced to cooperate with other orc
    tribes in large forces black orcs consistently plot to overthrow the other
    tribe's chieftain and take command. This treachery is likely the reason
    there are so few bands of the black orc nation known to exist, as the
    infighting tends to keep their numbers down. Black orcs stand 7 feet tall
    and weigh 200 to 280 pounds. Females tend to be about the same height, but
    are a bit lighter. Both males and females have blue-black skin with red eyes
    and more pronounced tusks than their smaller cousins. Black orcs have a
    decent understanding of tactics. They are adept in the use of reach weapons
    such as longspears and glaives. Many of their number are proficient in the
    use of light crossbows. In melee they prefer to gang up on powerful
    opponents and dispatch them quickly before moving on to lesser foes whenever
    possible. As they are often led by clerics and necromancers in the service
    of Orcus, they are likely to take prisoners if possible with the intent of
    sacrificing them to the Demon Lord of Undead at some future time. Black Orc
    Characters Black orc leaders tend to be clerics or barbarians. Black orc
    clerics worship Orcus. A black orc cleric has access to two of the following
    domains: Chaos, Death, Destruction, Evil, and War. Black orc clerics favor
    spells that deal damage or create undead. +8 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +4

    natural armor bonus. Blessing of Orcus: (see above) Ferocity DR 1/- Light
    Sensitivity Weapon Familiarity: Black orcs are always proficient with
    greataxes and falchions, and treat any weapon with the word "orc" in its
    name as a martial weapon. Languages: Black orcs begin play speaking Common
    and Orc. Black Orcs with high Intelligence scores can choose from the
    following languages: Abyssal, Dwarven, Giant, Gnoll, Goblin, Undercommon.
