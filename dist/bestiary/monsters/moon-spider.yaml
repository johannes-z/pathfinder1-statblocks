SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Moon Spider Webs (Ex)
    description: >-
      The webs created by a moon spider are especially strong and sticky, and
      the creatures weave net-like snares to trap their enemies. A moon spider's
      web attack is a ranged touch attack with a +6 racial bonus to the save DC
      needed to burst or escape the web. The spider also holds a trailing tether
      that prevents an entangled creature from moving away from the spider until
      it gets free. Moon spiders frequently set web traps throughout areas where
      they live. Anyone who enters a square of moon spider web must succeed at a
      Reflex save (DC 13) or become entangled as though it had been hit by a web
      attack (though the spider doesn't have a tether to it). If a creature that
      is already entangled enters a square of moon spider web, it must save
      again or become grappled. The save DC is Constitution-based. A moon
      spider's webs have 10 hit points and DR 5/ slashing. A web that's set on
      fire takes an additional 1d6 points of fire damage each round until it's
      destroyed.

Description:
  - >-
    Moon spiders are malevolent giant spiders that haunt the Echo Wood and other
    forests in the western vales of the Sellen River. They are far more
    intelligent than most of their arachnid kin; while they aren't as smart as
    humans, they possess a sly cunning and magical talents that make them much
    more dangerous than other giant spiders-they even hunt cooperatively and
    share their kills.
  - >-
    Moon spiders are web-weavers, and often create huge traps of sticky webbing.
    A creature that enters a square of moon spider webbing can easily become
    entangled or grappled. Typically, a moon spider uses its obscuring mist to
    hide the extent of its webs when prey approaches, using its tremorsense to
    keep track of its prey's struggles.
  - >-
    Moon spiders do not speak any humanoid language, but communicate with each
    other in clicks and taps of their legs on the ground, and they can
    understand simple concepts in Common (which is useful when they're listening
    to prey).
