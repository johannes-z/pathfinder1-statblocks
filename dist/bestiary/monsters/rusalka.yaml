SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Beckoning Call (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a rusalka can sing or speak, causing all non-fey
      creatures within a 300-foot spread to approach its position as if
      compelled to do so via a suggestion spell (DC 27 Will negates). A creature
      that successfully saves is not subject to the same rusalka's beckoning
      call for 24 hours. When an affected creature begins its turn adjacent to
      the rusalka, it is dazed for that round. These effects continue as long as
      the rusalka takes a standard action to maintain the effect, plus 1
      additional round. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Staggering Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature touched by a rusalka must make a DC 27 Fortitude save or be
      staggered for 1 round by overwhelming feelings of desire and shame. This
      is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Tresses (Su)
    description: >-
      A rusalka's long hair is strong and capable of making powerful primary
      natural attacks. When it uses its tresses to grapple an opponent, a
      rusalka does not gain the grappled condition itself. In addition, a
      rusalka uses its Charisma modifier in addition to its Strength modifier
      for all combat maneuver checks made with its tresses.
Description:
  - >-
    Rusalkas are cruel and bitter fey who inhabit waterways near humanoid
    settlements. Although rusalkas are not undead, some persist in believing
    that these fey form from the spirits of those who met a sinister end in the
    water. Rusalkas do little to dissuade such rumors. Rusalkas are fond of
    keeping a few charmed monsters or powerful humanoids nearby to aid in their
    defense or for other forms of cruel and humiliating entertainment, but
    quickly grow bored with such pets. When this occurs, rusalkas generally
    murder the creatures and seek more interesting replacement pets.
