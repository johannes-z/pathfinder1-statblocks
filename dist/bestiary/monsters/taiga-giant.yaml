SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Spirit Summoning (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a taiga giant may perform a 10-minute ritual to tap into the
      power and insight of his ancestral spirits. These spirits provide a +4
      deflection bonus to AC, immunity to enchantment and illusion spells, and
      one of the following spell effects: bless, endure elements, protection
      from evil, protection from good, or see invisibility. The effects of a
      spirit summoning persist for 24 hours.
Description:
  - >-
    Taiga giants wander endlessly to keep from depleting the food supply of any
    one area. Aurochs and mammoths are their preferred inland prey, while
    whales, seals, and walruses provide food in coastal regions. These animals
    form the cornerstone of tribal survival, not just for the food they provide
    but because nearly all of a tribe's possessions, from their portable
    shelters to their weapons, are crafted from the bone, hides, and sinews of
    felled beasts. Little is wasted.
  - >-
    Taiga giants are also deeply spiritual, worshiping their ancestors. Every
    tribe member learns to call forth ancestor spirits at a young age. Taiga
    giants are ashamed of being the ancestors of rune giants as, like most
    giants, they both hate and fear rune giants as slavers and monsters.
  - >-
    A typical taiga giant stands 20 feet in height and weighs 10,000 pounds.
    Skin tones vary from dark to pale gray, with hair color ranging from dark
    brown to red.
