Description:
  - >-
    In their humanoid forms, wereboars tend to be stout with upturned noses,
    bristly hair, and a noticeable overbite. They usually have red, brown, or
    black hair, though a few are golden blond, pale blond, or even bald. Chin
    whiskers are common, but males often can't grow full beards. Because they
    can be stubborn and aggressive when riled up, wereboars usually live in
    their own communities rather than mixing with non-lycanthropes; a wereboar's
    farm or ranch doesn't look out of the ordinary. Wereboars tend to have large
    families with many children.
  - >-
    Many wereboars are known to have especially bad tempers, rivaling those of
    murderous werewolves, and even other lycanthropes tend to avoid them. This
    suits the wereboars fine, especially as some weretigers and werewolves have
    been known hunt young wereboars.
  - >-
    Note that the statistics presented here for wereboars assume that the
    creatures are in their barbarian rage-if the creatures are encountered at
    another time, simply adjust their statistics accordingly.
