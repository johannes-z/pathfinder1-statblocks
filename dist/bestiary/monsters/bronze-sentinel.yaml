SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alert (Su)
    description: >-
      A bronze sentinel can take simple orders and identify intruders, and it
      possesses the ability to alert its creator or another creature to which
      it's keyed. When a bronze sentinel detects a trespasser, it can choose to
      alert the creature to which it's keyed in one of two ways. The sentinel
      can create a loud sound like that of a bell, chime, or gong that can be
      clearly heard at a range of 500 feet. Alternatively, a bronze sentinel can
      send a mental alert to the creature to which it is keyed as long as that
      creature is within 1 mile of the sentinel. The mental alert wakes the
      keyed creature from sleep, but doesn't affect normal concentration. A
      bronze sentinel's creator is the first creature to which it is keyed, and
      the creator can pass its link to another creature as part of a 4-hour
      ritual that uses materials costing 500 gp.
  - name: Fiery Bolt (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a bronze sentinel can fire a bolt of flame as a
      ranged touch attack out to a maximum range of 30 feet. This bolt deals 1d6
      points of fire damage.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bronze sentinel is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow
      spell resistance, save for spells with the electricity descriptor.
Description:
  - >-
    Bronze sentinels were among the most common of Thassilonian sentinels, and
    saw widespread use in ancient Bakrakhan and Eurythnia. Thassilonian nobles
    and wizards used these creatures to protect their goods, magical
    laboratories, and libraries. A bronze sentinel's fiery bolt burns hot, but
    its flames are short lived. This construction is in place to minimize the
    risk of the sentinel setting fire to the very things it is set to protect.
