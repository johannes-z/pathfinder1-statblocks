SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fascinating Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Target is fascinated, 30 feet, Will DC 14 negates. Fascination lasts as
      long as the scarecrow is "alive" or remains within 300 feet of the
      fascinated creature. Note that the approach or animation of the scarecrow
      does not count as an obvious threat to the victim of this particular
      fascination effect (although the scarecrow's attack does count as an
      obvious threat and ends the fascination). This is a mind-affecting effect.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      The touch of a scarecrow infuses its target with overwhelming waves of
      fear. If the victim fails a DC 14 Will save, he is cowering and can take
      no actions other than attempting a new DC 14 Will save at the end of the
      following round (and each round thereafter) to throw off the effects of
      this fear. A successful save leaves the victim shaken for 1 round. This is
      a mind-affecting fear effect. The Save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The animated scarecrow is nearly indistinguishable from a normal scarecrow.
    Close examination, however, reveals a tiny spark of red light in its eyes
    (DC 15 Perception check to notice). Each scarecrow is unique in construction
    and design, but most are about 6 feet tall, constructed of wood and ropes,
    and stuffed with straw or grass. Scarecrows are most often used as guardians
    to keep out would-be treasure hunters or trespassers.
  - >-
    A scarecrow attempts to fascinate the most powerful opponent it faces using
    its gaze attack. If it succeeds, it pummels that foe with its fists until
    the opponent is dead. It does not completely ignore other combatants as it
    uses its gaze attack to charm them so it can deal with them once its primary
    foe is dead.
  - >-
    Construction Each scarecrow varies in appearance: one may have a stuffed
    straw head, for example, while another may have a pumpkin for its head.
  - >-
    Whatever the differences, scarecrows do have some elements in common: their
    bodies and all limbs are constructed of wood and bound by ropes; their
    clothes are almost always dirty and ragged; and most scarecrows are stuffed
    with straw or grass. Regardless of the materials used, unguents and special
    powders totaling 500 gp are also required.
