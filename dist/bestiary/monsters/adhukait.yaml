SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dance of Disaster (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever an adhukait hits with a melee attack during a full-attack action,
      it can move 10 feet before making its next attack. The adhukait's normal
      speed does not limit this movement-it can move 10 feet after any
      successful hit among its four attacks, as long as it has another attack to
      make.
  - name: Dual Mind (Su)
    description: >-
      An adhukait is a single creature with two distinct minds, so it can
      attempt two saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If either saving
      throw succeeds, the mind-affecting effect fails to affect the adhukait.
Description:
  - >-
    Known also as the twinned ones, adhukaits are warrior asuras, specialized at
    quick raids designed for theft, assassination, or kidnapping. An adhukait is
    adept at infiltration and escape. In killing, the fiend is brutally
    efficient unless it wishes to prolong pain to demoralize or enrage its
    enemies.
  - >-
    Although an adhukait appears to be two connected creatures, it is one entity
    with two minds. The creature's personality and purpose is as unified as its
    bizarre form. An adhukait is 6 feet tall. It weighs 330 pounds.
  - >-
    Adhukaits prefer desolate spots as lairs, especially those that recall past
    terror or sorrow. In such dens, they keep trophies from their engagements as
    focuses for meditation and objects of study. Adhukaits also keep treasures
    stolen from temples and holy places. While at rest, adhukaits remain near
    any ill-gotten items to ensure no meddling magician can locate the lost
    objects.
  - >-
    Legend holds that the first adhukaits emerged from the shattered remains of
    two godlike brigands. These burglars, their names long since lost to
    history, attempted to raid a celestial hall. The resident deity and his or
    her servants slew the thieves, crushed their bodies together into one, and
    hurled their remains to the earth. As their crumbling, entwined bodies
    struck the world, they caused terrible earthquakes and tsunamis that slew
    thousands of innocents-including many worshipers of the headstrong deity who
    accidentally caused the devastation. The first adhukaits grew from the
    shattered, mingled remains of these brigands, rising from the blasted crater
    to serve the asuras as elite soldiers.
