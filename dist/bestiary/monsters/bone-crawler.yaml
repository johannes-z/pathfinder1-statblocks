Description_Visual: >-
  Unarmored, the bone crawler is a fleshy disc-shaped lump approximately six ft.
  in diameter, with a slightly concave top. The bottom curves downward, and ends
  with a circular mouth at its nadir. From the central mass sprout several dozen
  tentacles, each specialized to perform different functions: stubby muscular
  ones provide movement, thin graceful tendrils are tipped with sensory organs,
  and the long, limber whipfronds are used as a means of attack and
  manipulation. The flesh of a bone crawler ranges from olive green to slate
  grey to jet black. When it is encased in bone armor, the bone crawler appears
  much different. When still, it resembles a 15 ft. diameter mound of bones,
  piled haphazardly together. A canny observer may note fleshy tendrils or roots
  webbed through the mass. Once it begins to move, the armored crawler is a
  whirling nightmare of interlocked bones forming a 15 ft. diameter central
  mass, with bony tentacles extending out from it in all directions.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bone Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      The bone crawler is normally encountered encased in a shell of iron-hard
      bones. This shell has a hardnes of 10, takes half damage from energy
      attacks (except sonic attacks) and has hit points equal to 10 x (HD + 1).
      Bone armor weighs 1 pound per hit point. It can take damage like any
      object, though it receives the bone crawler's saving throws and spell
      resistance. Unlike carried objects, area of effect attacks require the
      bone crawler to roll a separate saving throw for its bone armor, even if
      it makes the saving throw itself. Spel l resistance is checked just once
      for the overall creature and its armor, however. While it bears bone
      armor, the bone crawler receives no bonus to AC for its Dexterity. After
      the first 10 hi tpoints of damage, every 10 hit points worth of bone armor
      provides the bone crawler with one bone blade that it can use in melee as
      described below. As its armor receives damage, it likewise loses these
      bone blades. The last 10 hit points of bone armor represent those
      protecting the main body itself; until the armor is destroyed, the central
      body is considered to have total cover. A bone crawler can repair its
      armor by absorbing new bones into its mass. This requires a 24-hour period
      while enzymes secreted by specialized tendrils harden the bone. The number
      of hit points gained depends on the size of the skeleton or bone
      collection absorbed: a Tiny skeleton repairs 1 hit point, a Small skeleton
      1d4 hit points, a Medium skeleton 2d4 hit points, and Large and larger
      skeletons 4d4 hit points. Note that skeletons of Huge size and larger
      contain many bones that are too large for the bone crawler to absorb
      effectively into its mass, which is why the hit points gained do not
      increase after Large size.
  - name: Bone Blade (Ex)
    description: >-
      The bone crawler has a number of bony limbs that it can manipulate with
      its whipfronds. When attacking with these, it gains its full attack bonus
      as a primary weapon attack. It can only attack a creature or creatures in
      a single 5 ft. square with a maximum of 4 bone blades at once. Sunder
      attacks directed at bone blades do damage to the creature's bone armor
      (see above).
  - name: Whipfrond (Ex)
    description: >-
      The bone crawler's primary attacking tentacles are called whipfronds. It
      has one whipfrond per hit die. A whipfrond can be severed with a
      successful Sunder attack with a slashing weapon that inflicts, in a single
      blow, a number of points of damage equal to or greater than the bone
      crawler's hit dice. Whipfronds cannot be sundered while encased in bone
      armor; the armor must be destroyed first. As with the bone blades, the
      bone crawler can only attack a single 5 ft. square area with up to 4
      whipfronds at a time, no more.
  - name: Whirling Frenzy (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full round action the bone crawler may whirl its bone blades around
      it in a swirling storm of sharpened edges. This attack inflicts 1d8+4
      points of damage per three bone blades used (round down) on anyone within
      the bone crawler's reach. A DC 19 Reflex save is allowed to take only half
      damage from this attack; alternately, a targeted creature may opt instead
      to make an attack of opportunity against the bone crawler instead. The
      save DC is Dexterity-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The bone crawler is an unusual aberration that girds itself with hardened
    bones, fused together and manipulated by lenticular limbs called whipfronds,
    to serve as both a weapon and a defense.
  - >-
    Bone crawlers exist by attacking and killing just about anything they can
    come to grips with. They feast upon the flesh of their enemies, and then
    integrate the bones of their prey into their armor, repairing any damage it
    has sustained. Some bone crawlers have been known to seek out crypts and
    graveyards, exhuming bodies for their bones.
  - >-
    Bone crawlers understand and may speak Aklo, but rarely converse with their
    victims.
