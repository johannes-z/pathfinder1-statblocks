  horns. Its legs are covered in thick brown fur and end in hooves. Large
  powerful arms wield a wicked skull-tipped wand. Two large, black, bat-like

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sting-injury; save Fort DC 43; onset immediate; frequency 1/round for 10
      rounds; effect 2d6 Constitution; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Wand of Orcus: Mighty Orcus wields a huge black
      skull-tipped rod that functions as a Large +5 unholy greatclub. It slays
      any living creature it touches if the target fails a DC 40 Fortitude save.
      Orcus, can at will, shut this ability off so as to allow his wand to pass
      into the Material Plane (and usually into the hands of one of his
      servants). Further, the Wand has the following powers (Caster Level 20th;
      save DC 25 + spell level): - 3/day-animate dead, deeper darkness,
      desecrate, fear, unhallow • 2/day-blasphemy, unholy aura
Description:
  - >-
    Orcus is the Prince of the Undead, and it is said that he alone created the
    first undead that walked the worlds. Orcus is one of the strongest (if not
    the strongest) and most powerful of all demon lords. He fights a
    never-ending war against rival demon princes that spans several Abyssal
    layers. From his great bone palace he commands his troops as they wage war
    across the smoldering and stinking planes of the Abyss. Orcus spends most of
    his days in his palace, rarely leaving its confines unless he decides to
    leads his troops into battle (which has happened on more than one occasion).
    Most of the time though, he is content to let his generals and commanders
    lead the battles. When not warring against rival demon princes, Orcus likes
    to travel the planes, particularly the Material Plane. Should a foolish
    spellcaster open a gate and speak his name, he is more than likely going to
    hear the call and step through to the Material Plane. What happens to the
    spellcaster that called him usually depends on the reason for the summons
    and the power of the spellcaster. Extremely powerful spellcasters are
    usually slain after a while and turned into undead soldiers or generals in
    his armies. Orcus stands 15 feet tall and weighs nearly 6,000 pounds. Orcus
    prefers to conduct battles using his Wand or natural weapons (tail and
    fists). Generally he avoids direct combat with powerful foes preferring to
    hang back and pepper them with an array of spells and effects. If pressed
    into melee, he uses his tail sting against the strongest opponent while
    focusing his fear gaze on the spellcasters. When given the chance, he
    summons demons and undead to aid him. If combat goes against him, he uses
    his greater teleport ability to escape, leaving a retinue of demons and
    undead monsters to deal with the interlopers. Servants of Orcus The
    followers of the Prince of Undead are clerics and adepts that venerate
    death, sorcerers and wizards fascinated with death, and halffiend variants
    of the aforementioned creatures. His followers are most often clerics,
    necromancers, and sorcerers. Followers of Orcus are known as Disciples of
    Orcus and must sign a pact of evil. Disciples of Orcus can receive spells
    from Orcus and are granted access to the domains of Chaos, Death,
    Destruction, Evil, and War (a cleric can choose any two of these domains).
