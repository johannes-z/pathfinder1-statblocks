Description_Visual: >-
  Larger than an elephant, this towering insectile nightmare wields a scythe
  made of bone. Its wings are swarms of biting flies, and its inhuman eyes
  glitter with cruel intelligence.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, Deskari can spit out a line of
      noxious black slime in a 120- foot line that creates a
      20-foot-radius-spread puddle of the stuff on the ground where the line
      terminates. Any creature caught in this area of effect takes 20d10 points
      of acid damage and is subject to the effects of Deskari's poison. A
      successful DC 42 Reflex save halves the damage, but does not mitigate the
      poison's effects. The line and puddle created by this attack remain as
      active acid on the ground for 1d4 rounds, affecting any creatures that
      move through an affected area. Damage caused by this breath weapon does
      not persist into additional rounds, but on the round a creature takes this
      damage, it is considered to be taking continuous damage for the purposes
      of spellcasting and concentration checks. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Enhanced Venom (Su)
    description: >-
      Any poisons created by Deskari (or even those used by him) become
      enhanced, and can affect creatures normally immune to poison. If an
      affected creature is mythic and is normally immune to poison, it instead
      receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw against Deskari's poison effects.
  - name: Infestation (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a creature becomes poisoned by Deskari, it also becomes infested
      with thousands of microscopic demonic eggs that quickly multiply and
      spread throughout the victim's bloodstream and flesh alike. Once infested,
      a creature remains infested even after the poison's effects end or are
      cured. A creature that has been infested by Deskari is recognized by all
      mindless swarms as a host, and such swarms never deal damage to the
      creature unless influenced and compelled to do so by an outside influence.
      An infested creature takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws made against
      Deskari's attacks or spells cast by his clerics. As a swift action,
      Deskari may command a creature's infestation to accelerate; this deals
      20d6 points of damage and stuns the target for 1 round (a successful DC 42
      Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stun effect) as the eggs
      hatch and a fiendish locust swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 183) bursts
      out of the creature's body (ending the infestation). Infestation is a
      disease effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite, breath weapon, sting, or Riftcarver-injury; save Fort DC 42;
      frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution drain plus
      infestation; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Rasping Armor (Su)
    description: >-
      The armor plates that protect Deskari's body rasp together whenever he is
      damaged by a physical attack, creating a discordant shrieking and grinding
      sound. Every time a creature strikes Deskari with an attack that deals
      bludgeoning, force, piercing, or slashing damage, all creatures within 10
      feet of Deskari must succeed at a DC 42 Fortitude save or be sickened for
      1d6 rounds. A sickened creature that fails this save becomes staggered for
      1 round. A staggered creature that fails this save becomes nauseated for 1
      round. Finally, a nauseated creature that fails this save becomes stunned
      for 1d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect that does not affect
      demons. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Swarm Master (Su)
    description: >-
      Deskari is immune to swarm damage and other swarm effects (such as
      distraction). As a swift action, he can direct the movement of any swarm
      within 30 feet. An intelligent swarm can resist this compulsion by
      succeeding at a DC 36 Will save. Any swarm created by or conjured by
      Deskari deals +3d6 points of swarm damage, and the damage caused by such a
      swarm is treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of overcoming
      damage reduction. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Swarmsight (Su)
    description: >-
      Deskari can see through the eyes of any swarm he commands or controls,
      including the swarm of biting flies that makes up his wings (this swarm,
      incidentally, grants him all-around vision).
  - name: Wall Crawler (Su)
    description: >-
      Deskari can climb any vertical surface with ease and never has to attempt
      Climb checks to avoid falling as a result of taking damage. This grants
      him a +16 racial bonus on Climb checks.
Description:
  - >-
    Known as the Lord of the Locust Host and the Usher of the Apocalypse,
    Deskari has long plagued the region of Sarkoris, ever since he discovered a
    strange thinness between that nation and his own Abyssal realm. His first
    attempt to capitalize upon this strange feature ended with his defeat at
    Aroden's hands, but after the god's death at the outset of the Age of Lost
    Omens, Deskari and his cult wasted no time in opening the Worldwound to
    allow the demon lord's plans for Golarion to continue.
  - >-
    Deskari carved his realm from the raw matter of the Abyss using a great
    scythe called Riftcarver (see page 63), a weapon he crafted from the remains
    of the strange creature his father, Pazuzu, mated with tens of thousands of
    years ago. Today, Pazuzu and Deskari have what passes as a cordial
    relationship-the two demon lords do not work together, but neither do they
    oppose each other's goals on the Material Plane and beyond.
  - Deskari's Cult
  - >-
    Deskari is worshiped primarily by the denizens of the Worldwound on
    Golarion-by tief lings, fallen crusaders, demons, half-fiends, and all
    manner of other vile creatures that dwell within that devastated land.
  - >-
    Deskari's symbol is a pair of crossed locust wings dripping with blood. His
    favored weapon is the scythe, in honor of his devastating weapon of choice,
    Riftcarver, but his worshipers sometimes prefer to use smaller weapons,
    especially when they must move unnoticed among enemies. Deskari grants
    access to the domains of Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and War, and to the
    subdomains of Blood, Catastrophe, Demons, and Tactics.
