Description_Visual: >-
  This horribly withered creature moves in jerks and twitches as if constantly
  wracked with pain. Waves of shadow undulate through the creature's body,
  emerging like appendages from just beneath its dry, stretched skin.

Description:
  - >-
    The means of attaining lichdom are extremely personal for mortal
    spellcasters, fraught with misinformation and peril. The smallest
    miscalculation in the potion of lichdom's formula or most minute flaw in
    one's phylactery can interrupt the process that infuses one's mortal soul
    with overwhelming arcane and negative energies. Other times, an
    inexperienced wizard attempts the
  - >-
    transformation, or erroneously consumes a formula produced for another
    spellcaster, instantly dying from the backlash of potent forces or
    condemning himself to a terminal but far more terrible end. In these
    sorrowful cases, the process traps the soul of the would-be lich outside a
    phylactery that will not accept it and a body that has rejected it. The
    potent arcane forces tampered with by the lich's failed creation also find
    themselves unleashed but uncontrolled, surrounding the newly formed
    abomination, empowering it but also slowly consuming its essence. This
    creature, known as a forsaken lich, is granted the undeath it sought in
    life, but in a terrifyingly temporary fashion. For the miscalculations of
    its ambitions, the creature's once-vibrant body shrivels and decays like
    that of a lich, but becomes a lifeless shell manipulated by the malicious
    soul and unchecked magical storm that envelop it, forces that control the
    corpse's actions almost like a marionette. Yet this doom is temporary for
    nearly all who attempt this foul transition. With the soul unbound from the
    body and both spirit and corpse exposed to destructive arcane tides, both
    are slowly eroded. After 1d10 days, the forsaken lich's body and soul are
    both consumed like a lit candle, eventually reduced physically to ashes, and
    spiritually to nothing-its essence utterly annihilated, scoured from
    existence for all time. Creating a Forsaken Lich "Forsaken lich" is an
    acquired template that can be added to any living creature (referred to
    hereafter as the base creature), provided it can create the required
    phylactery. Rarely, a creature unable to create a phylactery stumbles upon
    this state through tragic ambition. A forsaken lich retains all the base
    creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: Same
    as the base creature +2. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The creature's type
    changes to undead. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks. Senses: A
    forsaken lich gains darkvision 60 ft. Armor Class: A forsaken lich has a +3
    natural armor bonus or the base creature's natural armor bonus, whichever is
    better. Hit Dice: Change all of the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. All
    Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As undead, forsaken
    liches use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead
    of Constitution). Defensive Abilities: A forsaken lich gains channel
    resistance +4, DR 15/bludgeoning and magic, spell resistance 25, and
    immunity to cold and electricity, in addition to immunities granted by its
    undead traits. The forsaken lich also gains the following defensive
    abilities. Soul Shield (Su): The shadowy double superimposed over the
    forsaken lich's corporeal form flits around its body, granting the creature
    concealment (20% miss chance). The miss chance increases to 50% in dim
    light. This ability never grants total concealment; it only increases miss
    chances. Spell Storm (Su): A forsaken lich is the epicenter of a squall of
    unchecked magical energies. If a spell targets the forsaken lich and fails
    to overcome its spell resistance, this uncontrolled magic redirects the
    spell as per spell turning. The forsaken lich is always considered to have
    10 spell levels of turning left for the purposes of this effect, even if it
    is affected by multiple spells in the same round. Special Attacks: A
    forsaken lich gains the special attack described below. Save DCs are equal
    to 10 + 1/2 the forsaken lich's HD + the forsaken lich's Charisma modifier
    unless otherwise noted. Disembodied Strike (Su): The forsaken lich has a
    special touch attack that it can make as a standard action, using its
    highest base attack bonus. This attack originates when its disembodied soul
    reaches out independently and uses negative energy to deal 1d8 points of
    damage to living creatures + 1 point of damage per every 2 Hit Dice
    possessed by the forsaken lich. This attack has a reach 5 feet greater than
    the forsaken lich's normal reach, and may be directed at nearby undead
    creatures to heal them, or used on the forsaken lich itself to heal damage
    inf licted on its corporeal form. Soul Lash (Su): Unbridled magic endlessly
    funnels into a forsaken lich's body, scouring its body and soul with mighty
    energies. As a swift action, each round a forsaken lich can unleash this
    dark energy in a blast of pure magical destructiveness. This blast takes the
    form of a 240-foot line of destructive energy that deals an amount of damage
    equal to 1d6 per 2 Hit Dice the forsaken lich possesses (to a maximum of
    20d6) and paralyzes those affected for 1d10 rounds. Creatures that make a
    Ref lex save partially avoid the arcane lash, taking only half damage and
    avoiding the paralysis. This energy is not completely under the forsaken
    lich's control. If the forsaken lich does not spend a swift action to
    discharge the energy every round, it takes an amount of damage equal to 1d6
    x 1/4 of its total Hit Dice. Special Qualities: A forsaken lich gains the
    following special quality. Delusory Aura (Su): Like its soul, a forsaken
    lich's mind is discorporated and scattered across the area around its
    corpse. This fills the area within 100 feet of the forsaken lich with an
    ever-shifting panoply of its darkest dreams, dashed ambitions, and enraged
    insanity. This area is considered to be under the effects of mirage arcana,
    but of a particularly disturbing variety. All living creatures within the
    area take a -4 penalty on any saves against fear effects. If the effect is
    dispelled, it reconstitutes 1 round later. Abilities: Str +6, Cha +6. Being
    undead, a lich has no Constitution score.
