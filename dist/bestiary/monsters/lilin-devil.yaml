Description:
  - >-
    Lilins are thought to be the descendants of Lilith, the former Queen of Hell
    (see her entry elsewhere in this book). Before her coming, lilins were
    unknown in the Hells. Rumors spoken in hushed whispers say lilins are the
    offspring of Lilith and an incubus (male demon akin to the succubus). For
    this, lilins are often viewed with contempt and hatred among devilkind.
  - Among the devilish ranks, lilins serve as spies and information gatherers.
  - >-
    Though they possess decent combat skills, they generally do not serve in the
    hellish armies in any other role. Many an arch-devil, ignoring the foolish
    rumors that lilins are indeed some demon-devil crossbreed, has employed the
    services of a lilin on more than one occasion. Even now, many arch-devils
    keep a small retinue of these devilish mistresses stashed in a rival's
    palace gathering as much information as they can on each other.
  - >-
    A lilin appears as a crimson-skinned woman about 5-1/2 feet tall with long
    dark hair. Her eyes are deep black with flecks of blue. Her wings are black
    and leathery and her arms end in clawed hands. Lilins dress in light colored
    flowing gowns and robes and carry their longswords slung at their hips.
  - >-
    A lilin always enters combat with her protection from good in effect and
    begins by attempting to charm the closest foe. A weak-minded foe that comes
    within range is subjected to a suggestion. Afterwards she usually attacks
    with her longsword. If combat goes poorly for a lilin she attempts to flee
    but not before summoning a host of devils to cover her escape.
