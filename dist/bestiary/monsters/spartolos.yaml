Description_Visual: >-
  A skeleton clad in tarnished armor clatters in its grim march. A polished
  bronze breastplate, greaves, and helmet dutifully remain to protect this
  felled warrior, while its naked, skeletal hands still clutch a short spear and
  a round bronze shield. Yet, beneath its decrepit armor and moldering bones, a
  deftness and deadly intent linger on, embodied in a hellish light smoldering
  in its shadowed eye sockets.

  - name: Deadly Ally (Ex)
    description: >-
      Spartoi cooperate exceptionally well in battle. A spartolos flanking a
      target with another spartolos gains a +4 flanking bonus instead of +2.
  - name: Disjoin (Su)
    description: >-
      As a move action, a spartolos can crumble into a pile of bones and
      tarnished weaponry. While in this state, the undead gains a +8 racial
      bonus to its Stealth check and its DR rises to 10/bludgeoning. As a move
      action, a spartolos can reform itself, jolting into its armored skeletal
      form even if its pieces have been scattered.
  - name: United Resistance (Su)
    description: >-
      A spartolos ignores 5 points of damage caused by channel energy. This
      resistance rises by 5 for every other spartolos within 10 feet to a
      minimum of 0 damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Raised from the corpses of famed warriors and legendary legionaries, spartoi
    (singular "spartolos") walk again, dragged from death to do battle once
    more. Greater than mere unthinking corpses, like skeletal champions spartoi
    carry with them some vestige of their past lives and experiences. Yet what
    sets them apart from lesser undead are their retained caginess and knowledge
    of tactics, allowing them to function with deadly efficiency in troops of
    their brethren. Sometimes called the "sown men," spartoi hold a fundamental
    connection to the near-mythical magical items known as a spartoi seeds,
    teeth that when planted in the earth summon forth these undead, fully armed
    and ready for command. Although ancient versions of these items prove
    especially rare, the well-known nature of their myth has led to dozens of
    modern versions being created and, with them, a rise in the appearance of
    spartoi. A typical spartolos stands about 5-1/2 to 6-1/2 feet tall, weighing
    approximately 70 pounds with its full compliment of equipment. Ecology As
    undead beings, spartoi have no need for food or shelter and have little
    effect on their environments. Yet despite being obedient undead, all spartoi
    seem to favor resting as disjoined piles of bones rather than standing
    corpses. Although the undead know no sensations of exertion, spartoi left to
    their own devices or without commands to do otherwise collapse into
    scattered remains. Whether such is a matter of tactics and subterfuge or
    fulfills some other need, the animate corpses give no hint. Spartoi detect
    as being of evil alignment merely because the powers animating them prove
    fundamentally foul. In some cases, spartoi raised from the corpses of
    particularly goodly or otherwise forceful individuals might retain the
    alignment they possessed in life. Habitat & Society The spartoi are undead
    skeletons-albeit much more powerful than other versions-designed for war.
    They have no wants or desires other than to serve their masters, and they
    carry no fear. Though they have some defense against channeled energy, the
    spartoi are just as susceptible to divine spellcasters as any other undead.
    All spartoi spring into being with weaponry, typically a spear, buckler, and
    breastplate, though some rare individuals have been known to arise with more
    unusual armaments. In such cases, short swords, punching daggers, glaives,
    and great clubs prove most common. Only the rarest of spartoi have been
    known to arise brandishing ranged weapons, their undead forms seeming to
    lack the coordination for such arms. In any case, spartoi weaponry and armor
    typically bear the markings of ancient cultures, often appearing to be from
    lands near where the undead (or its spartoi seeds) were created. Despite
    their skill and cooperation in battle, spartoi have little interest in one
    another. Even spartoi apparently risen from rival nations or cultures seem
    to forget all past rivalries in death. The mind of a spartolos is a mind
    possessed by a will to do battle and a skill or instinct seemingly inherent
    in the bones of great warriors, actual vestiges of personality lingering on
    only in the rarest cases. Even those spartoi retaining some hint of their
    former personalities seem interested only in completing their master's will
    and swiftly returning to their rightful place in death. Such causes many
    concerned with the necromantic arts to ponder over whether their magic draws
    forth an actual spirit to its bones, or merely causes a corpse to act with a
    hint of the personality that was bound to it in life. Creating a Spartolos A
    spartolos might be created in a number of ways. Most simply, a create undead
    spell cast by a magic-user of caster level 16 or greater can infuse a dead
    body with a heroic spirit, resurrecting it as a spartolos. Alternatively,
    one might seek out rare items known as spartoi seeds. Although relatively
    rare, the oldest seeds might summon forth the corpses of legendary heroes
    rather than typical spartoi. These slain champions, while possessing the
    same statistics as normal spartoi in death, possess the ability to speak and
    often bear great insight into the ways of battle or memories from their
    lives. Mythic Seeds Numerous myths across Golarion tell of legendary,
    magical fangs that summon forth the spirits or corpses of powerful warriors.
    The most pervasive of these tales comes from the ancient myth of the Jiskan
    hero Strada, though countless variations exist in dozen of cultures across
    Avistan. Legends tell of the mythic hero Strada tasked by the devil Alichino
    with the impossible charge of besieging an unconquerable city. Seeking out
    the oracle of Gorum, god of battle, the hero was gifted the thousand fangs
    of the dragon Kathalphas, who was said to have grown an additional tooth
    with every champion she had slain. Told to sow these fangs into the dust
    surrounding the city, the hero praised Gorum and departed graciously. Upon
    reaching the city, he did as the priest had advised, and to his
    astonishment, the skeletons of the dragon's thousand victims leapt from the
    ground, clad in all the finery of epic warriors, and arrayed to do battle in
    Strada's name. The unconquerable city fell in an hour, much to the fury of
    capering Alichino, and for 90 splendorous years Strada ruled as king with an
    army of the world's greatest warriors ever guarding his palace gates. See
    the spartoi seeds sidebar for rules on using the magical teeth drawn from
    this myth.
