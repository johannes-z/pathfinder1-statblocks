Description:
  - >-
    The people known as scorpionfolk (known as sadara among their own kind) are
    a race of nomadic desert-dwellers known for their cruelty and combat
    prowess. Believed to have once been a just and kind race that became
    corrupted by magic, scorpionfolk are feared and avoided by most intelligent
    desert-traveling races.
  - >-
    Most scorpionfolk tribes tend to be nomadic and move around frequently, only
    settling in one place until the food source runs out. These tribes use tents
    for shelter and care little for any belongings other than what they can
    carry. Some few tribes settle in an area and construct small towns and
    villages of hardened mud, rock, and occasionally limestone. These tribes
    tend to be slightly more civilized than the nomadic scorpionfolk, and are
    often looked upon with disdain by their nomadic brothers. Larger tribes,
    both nomadic and settled, often have a shaman (a cleric or sorcerer of
    5th-8th level) in their midst. These shamans tend to the sick and injured
    and sometimes take part in raids or excursions by the scorpionfolk. Tribal
    leaders are fighters or barbarians of 6th-9th level.
  - >-
    Scorpionfolk stand just over 6 feet tall and are over 10 feet long from head
    to the base of the tail. Tails range from 8 to 10 feet long. Scorpionfolk,
    on average, weigh around 2,000 pounds. Their skin is usually bronze, brown,
    or black, and the lower scorpion torso dark tan or the color of dark sand.
    Hair color varies, with most males shaving their heads and females wearing
    their hair long in tightly knotted ponytails.
  - >-
    Scorpionfolk prefer to attack with weapons and a tail sting, only resorting
    to their clawed hands if necessary. Favored weapons of these creatures
    include falchions, spears, scimitars, and shortbows.
