  A pool of greenish muck, blossoming with weird vegetable-like growths and

  outward, dragging the entire grotesque mass forward with an ameboid life.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      A verdurous ooze secretes a digestive acid that dissolves flesh and metal
      quickly. Each time a creature takes damage from a verdurous ooze's acid,
      the creature's metal equipment and armor take the same amount of damage
      from the acid. A DC 21 Reflex save prevents damage to such items. A metal
      or natural weapon that strikes a verdurous ooze takes 1d6 points of acid
      damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex save. If a
      verdurous ooze remains in contact with a metal object for 1 full round, it
      inflicts 20 points of acid damage (no save) on the object. The save DCs
      are Constitution-based.
  - name: Enliven (Sp)
    description: >-
      The chemicals emitted by a verdurous ooze cause nearby plants to twitch
      into life. While in areas covered in natural growth, all squares within 15
      feet of the verdurous ooze are affected as if by the spell entangle. The
      verdurous ooze has no control over this effect, and if dispelled the
      effect renews after 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Sleep Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      The chemicals emitted by a verdurous ooze have a stronger and opposite
      effect on living, non-plant creatures that come within a 30-foot radius.
      All living creatures within the area must make a DC 21 Will save or fall
      asleep for a number of rounds equal to the ooze's HD. Creatures immune to
      poison are also immune to this effect. Whether or not the save is
      successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same verdurous
      ooze's sleep aura for 24 hours. This is a nonmagical sleep effect. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Split (Ex)
    description: >-
      Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a verdurous ooze. Instead,
      if the verdurous ooze would have taken 10 or more points of damage from a
      single slashing or piercing attack, it splits into two identical oozes,
      each with half of the original's current hit points (round down). Slashing
      or piercing attacks that deal less than 10 points of damage do not cause a
      verdurous ooze to split. Damage from multiple slashing or piercing attacks
      is not cumulative. A verdurous ooze with 15 hit points or less cannot be
      further split and dies if reduced to 0 hit points.
Description:
  - >-
    Verdurous oozes are animate masses of protoplasm of a sickly green hue. At
    rest, their flat bodies stand roughly 5 inches tall and can stretch out to a
    wide diameter, their surfaces blossoming into what look like thick tangles
    of mossy roots and gnarled vegetation as they lie still. Known to emit
    invisible but dangerous chemicals, these masses of slinking muck cause
    nearby plants to writhe and coil as if alive, while shocking animals into a
    temporary but deathly torpor. As such, they rarely must hunt to find food,
    instead sensing passing creatures and preying upon them after they succumb
    to the oozes' sleep aura. Always ravenous, the powerful acids that comprise
    these oozes quickly dissolve the flesh of their meals. A verdurous ooze
    typically weighs 300 pounds and can easily spread to fill a 5-foot-square
    area. While moving, such crawling muck rises only a few inches tall, though
    its structure might grow and boil up to a height of 2 or 3 feet if let
    undisturbed for a matter of days. Spontaneously grown structures collapse
    and melt back into the ooze's body as soon as it begins moving again.
    Ecology Verdurous oozes settle in locations with abundant food, rarely
    moving far except to feed upon comatose prey that has come too close or to
    reproduce. Verdurous oozes primarily gain sustenance from the small birds,
    mammals, and insects that fall prey to their sleep aura, but also prove well
    suited to devouring larger creatures that fall asleep nearby. Every 2 or 3
    years, verdurous oozes collect deep in forests and swamps, clustering in
    secluded locales tainted by reeking natural compost or the escape of natural
    gases from the land. As many as 10 oozes might gather during one of these
    grotesque moots. To reproduce, four verdurous oozes merge to become a
    greater verdurous ooze. Greater oozes are far more active and hungry than
    their lesser kin, constantly wandering, feeding, and growing. After several
    months, the greater verdurous ooze splits into 10 to 15 new verdurous oozes.
    These new verdurous oozes grow to full size within 6 months. Habitat &
    Society Verdurous oozes primarily live in temperate forests and plains among
    high grasses or cultivated crops, though they might also be found in warm
    plains and jungle environments. As mindless creatures, they pay little
    attention to others of their kind, save when drawn to reproduce. A notable
    fact about verdurous oozes is that they beneficially impact nearby plant
    life; their secretions act as a kind of natural fertilizer. Trees, grass,
    flowers-all flora benefits from the existence of a nearby verdurous ooze.
    Over time, this can lead to an increase in the fauna in the area, as they
    seek to enjoy the rich, lush plants that make up their diet and in turn
    become prey for the stealthy ooze. Thus, another sign that a verdurous ooze
    is, or has been, in a particular area is the skeletons of animals that it
    has consumed, which are left behind once the flesh has been absorbed.
    Resourceful evil humanoids sometimes take advantage of verdurous oozes'
    relative lassitude and difficultly escaping from simple pits or other
    containers, trapping them near the entrances to their lairs. In such
    instances, the oozes' chemical secretions provide an extra defense for those
    aware of their presence and the dangers of coming too close. Greater
    Verdurous Ooze Greater verdurous oozes are formed when several green oozes
    merge together as part of their reproductive process. They are similar in
    form but much larger, and while still green, exhibit white and red lines
    that resemble veins running through them. They are even more voracious and
    dangerous than standard green oozes, as they eat and eat to gain enough mass
    to reproduce. A greater verdurous ooze typically weighs 2,400 pounds and can
    easily spread to fill a 10-foot-square area.
