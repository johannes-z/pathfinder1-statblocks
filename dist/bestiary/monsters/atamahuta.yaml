SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Double Weapon Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      An atamahuta fights with an orc double axe. While making a full attack, an
      atamahuta controls its arms with both heads and does not take a penalty on
      attack or damage rolls for attacking with a double weapon.
  - name: Spellstrike (Su)
    description: >-
      An atamahuta can imbue its weapon with magical properties using its
      spell-like abilities. Whenever an atamahuta casts a spell with a range of
      "touch" from its spell-like abilities, it can deliver the spell through
      any weapon it is holding as part of a free melee attack at its highest
      base attack bonus as part of casting its spell. If successful, this melee
      attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. This
      attack uses the weapon's critical multiplier (usually x3), but the spell
      effect only deals 2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon
      damage uses its own critical modifier. An atamahuta cannot make a full
      attack during the same round that it uses a spell-like ability unless
      another effect would allow it to do so.
  - name: Ward Off Distractions (Ex)
    description: >-
      An atamahuta uses one of its heads to defend against attacks while the
      other is using a spell-like ability, giving it a +4 bonus to AC against
      attacks of opportunity while casting.
Description:
  - >-
    Atamahuta are immensely strong oni spirits who have donned the physical
    guise of ettins. Combining oni's trademark guile with ettins' unadulterated
    brawn, atamahuta use their two-headed forms to inf lict as much damage as
    possible by fusing their arcane powers with their distinctive melee combat
    style.
  - >-
    Because of the raw power they infuse into the bodies they inhabit, atamahuta
    are slightly bigger than normal ettins. An atamahuta is 14 feet tall and
    weighs 5,500 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    While many might think an atamahuta possesses two heads and is therefore
    made up of two distinct oni, each being is composed of only one oni spirit.
    When an atamahuta takes form, it divides its powers into two parts, granting
    one half of its being its ingenuity and magical prowess and the other its
    anger and savage strength. An ettin's body is the most suitable for this
    division of powers, which manifests itself physically as one head having a
    seeming dominance over the other. The atamahuta's right head most directly
    controls its actions in physical combat, and is also the only one that
    talks; the left head, meanwhile, constantly spills nonsense words and
    mutterings under its breath, and is the source of the oni's arcane power.
    Oni scholars have speculated that an individual atamahuta's underlying,
    unvoiced wishes and desires are encoded in the gibberish that burbles from
    its left head, and that by listening closely enough, one can garner valuable
    information about the oni spirit, but few have survived an atamahuta
    encounter long enough to test this theory. Regardless of whatever babbling
    the left head produces, most witnesses agree that atamahuta strive for power
    and fear-induced respect more than anything else, and will go to grotesque
    lengths to garner them, through means both violent and utterly despicable.
  - >-
    Atamahuta possess the ability to change shape just as other oni, but the
    visage of an uncontrollably violent ettin is often even more horrifying to
    civilized creatures than that of an oni, whom most regard as equally evil
    but at least somewhat reasonable. Thus, most atamahuta find it beneficial to
    procure a silver-tongued ally who can act as a gateway to the more powerful
    and wise oni itself. Once they have established control over a certain
    realm, atamahuta will usually either kill or enslave their allies, seeing
    the beguilers as potential threats to their rule. Atamahuta have little
    patience for any individual that wastes their time, and oversee their domain
    with an unforgiving and steadfast fist. Oni who inhabit the form of an ettin
    usually possess violent and unruly dispositions to begin with, but most know
    better than to act brashly when they first arrive in their physical forms
    and keep their rage at bay-at least until they establish their dominion over
    the lesser beings around them.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Atamahuta resemble ettins in both temperament and physical form, but their
    similarities end here. Most atamahuta look down upon the monstrous giants as
    barbaric, imperfect versions of an ideal form, and impose their superior
    strength and intellect upon the creatures in order to enslave them. While a
    single atamahuta can easily coerce and garner the aid of several ettins, the
    oni tend to establish elaborate slave rings in order to most effectively
    "recruit" high numbers of individuals, including ettins as well as other
    intelligent humanoids. Several atamahuta oversee the operation, while their
    shackled minions act as both enforcers of the slavers' rules and prisoners
    themselves, hoping to garner some miniscule form of freedom through
    cooperation. Their sheer cunning allows atamahuta to trick their prisoners
    into thinking this, when in reality the only escape an atamahuta's slave can
    hope to achieve is through transfer to another owner or death.
  - >-
    When atamahuta establish slave rings, they often make a business of selling
    their prisoners to the highest bidder in private auctions and black market
    deals. Occasionally, atamahuta will also run economically viable businesses
    on the side, putting their enslaved minions to work in remote fields or
    mines far from civilization. Atamahuta are rarely content to remain rulers
    over a stagnant position, and seek to advance their dominion as far as
    possible. Their prowess for ruthless business tactics and intimidating
    rivals into positions of subservience makes them potent forces in whatever
    realm they seek to control. Atamahuta often join merchants' guilds and other
    such organizations after starting their slave rings, creating legitimate
    business fronts in order to infiltrate the guilds and wrest control of them.
    With this power, they can impose seemingly fair taxes upon their
    competitors, ultimately running them out of business and establishing
    themselves as the sole means of trade within a community. Of course, they
    must do this all through surrogates, as few trade organizations would permit
    an oni or an ettin into their ranks, and even then, many guilds have imposed
    strict rules regarding representatives into their systems in order to
    prevent such atamahuta-run monopolies from developing in the first place.
  - >-
    Atamahuta are typically distrustful of other oni, as they see them as
    potential threats to their power, and thus only rarely ally themselves with
    other such beings. Occasionally, however, such alliances can prove to be
    mutually beneficial, and so atamahuta team up with weaker oni such as
    yamabushi tengus or kuwa, so that they can reap the rewards of such a
    coalition while still retaining the most power. More intelligent or powerful
    oni recognize atamahuta for their oblivious nature and will often manipulate
    the beings for their strength, tricking the ettin-shaped oni into thinking
    they are dominant in the friendship until the more powerful oni has used the
    atamahuta for their intended purpose, at which point the beings are swiftly
    discarded.
