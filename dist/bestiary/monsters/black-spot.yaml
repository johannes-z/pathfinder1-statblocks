  The spines of this sizable sea urchin bristle, revealing a strange, multipart
  beak gnashing in their midst.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      Instead of poison, the spines of black spots bear what is for some a minor
      annoyance, but for sailors nearly a death sentence. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. Spines-injury; save Fort DC 13; onset 1 round; frequency
      constant; effect target takes a -10 penalty on Swim checks and cannot hold
      its breath. If forced underwater, the target must save each round (Core
      Rulebook 445) or drown.
  - name: Leaping Charge (Ex)
    description: >-
      A black spot ignores rough terrain and gaps less than 10 feet wide when
      charging. Additionally, its charges do no provoke attacks of opportunity.
  - name: Spines (Ex)
    description: >-
      A black spot's spines can swivel to face any approaching creature. Any
      creature that attacks a black spot urchin with an unarmed strike or a
      natural attack is automatically attacked by the black spot's spines as an
      immediate action. If the spines hit, they can curse the target as well.

      All giant urchins and similar creatures-like black spots-receive a +8
      bonus to CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt.
Description:
  - >-
    Though not actually intelligent, black spots are terrifyingly adept at
    locating prey and potential threats, leaping forth from tide pools in great
    bounds to skewer their victims. However, the true danger of a black spot
    urchin comes not from its gnashing, star-shaped beak or its needle-pointed
    spines, but rather from its weird magical nature.
  - >-
    Instead of simply poisoning those it punctures, a black spot urchin in fact
    curses them, inhibiting their ability to swim. How exactly black spots came
    by such a strange ability and what they gain from drowning their victims
    days or even years after first encountering them are anyone's guess, but
    sailors stung by one of the beasts often refuse to go to sea again for fear
    of their lives.
  - >-
    A black spot urchin is typically several feet in diameter, but is mostly
    made of its long spines and so weighs only a few pounds.
