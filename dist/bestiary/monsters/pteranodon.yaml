Description:
  - >-
    The pteranodon is not itself a dinosaur but rather a large flying reptile
    that is often found in areas dinosaurs are common. Its flight lacks grace,
    so it lands on the ground to fight foes it can't carry away. A pteranodon
    has a wingspan of 30 feet but only weighs 40 pounds. Pteranodon Companions
