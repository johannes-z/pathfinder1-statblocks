SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Graft Flesh (Su)
    description: >-
      Umasi can graft the flesh and even limbs of other humanoids to their own
      bodies in a ritual that takes 1 hour to complete. To heal damage, an Umasi
      must have a supply of flesh (either living or dead), and the Umasi must
      make a DC 20 Heal check to treat deadly wounds. The Umasi can only heal
      damage with his graft flesh ability once per day, but there is no time
      limit on healing wounds and the Umasi does not need a healer's kit (and
      does not take a penalty for lacking one). This ability otherwise functions
      as the treat deadly wounds use of the Heal skill. Umasi can also graft
      additional limbs onto their bodies; each extra arm gives the Umasi an
      additional unarmed strike, while each additional leg adds +5 feet to the
      Umasi's speed. An Umasi can have a maximum of six arms and six legs.
  - name: Harvest Organs (Su)
    description: >-
      An Umasi can remove a vital organ when he delivers a coup de grace against
      a humanoid opponent with a slashing or piercing weapon. The next round,
      the Umasi can consume the harvested organ as a move action to gain the
      benefits of the death knell spell (caster level equal to the Umasi's Hit
      Dice).
  - name: Immortal Flesh (Su)
    description: >-
      Umasi are immune to disease and aging effects, and they gain a +2 racial
      bonus on saving throws against poison.
  - name: Immune to Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      Umasi do not heal damage naturally, and are not healed by positive or
      negative energy.
Description:
  - >-
    Reclusive and shrouded in mystery, the Umasi-or Harvestmen, as they are
    known across the Mwangi Expanse-are a race of humanoids who exist between
    life and death. Unable to heal or procreate naturally, the Umasi extend
    their lives by transplanting the skin, organs, or even entire appendages of
    other humanoids onto parts of their own bodies. As a result, there is no
    typical description for a Harvestman-each is a patchwork conglomeration of
    different features, though most Umasi have multiple limbs of varying sizes.
    The need to use body parts of generally the same size and shape makes most
    Umasi human-sized; few are over 6 feet tall. Most weigh between 150 and 300
    pounds, and the constant addition of new flesh has left little distinction
    between genders.
  - >-
    Ecology Zenj legends say the Umasi were an ancient tribe of arrogant
    scholars who lived deep in the Mwangi Jungle. When a powerful witch doctor
    came to the Umasi seeking their wisdom, he was rebuffed as being unworthy of
    receiving the Umasi's knowledge. Enraged, the witch doctor used a taboo
    ritual to curse the Umasi, stealing away fragments of their very souls and
    binding them to the flesh of others, forcing them to harvest the bodies of
    humanoids to sustain a bitterly extended existence. This curse left the
    Umasi a sterile, aff licted people somewhere between the living and the
    living dead.
  - Contrary to their appearance, Umasi are living creatures.
  - >-
    They eat, breathe, and sleep like other humanoids, but their bodies are in a
    constant state of decay. This divided nature grants the Harvestmen immunity
    to disease and resistance to toxins, but even minor injuries don't heal
    naturally; Umasi must graft new flesh onto existing tissue to heal their
    wounds.
  - >-
    Staving off the endless decay of their bodies requires more extreme
    measures. As limbs and organs rot, Umasi elders use obsidian blades to
    remove the subject's decaying parts, replacing them with similar parts from
    fresh corpses and linking the replacements to the original body through a
    complex ritual combining ancient Umasi knowledge with the forbidden juju
    rites of their original curser. When the ritual is complete, the new body
    part joins perfectly with the Umasi and death is cheatedâ€¦ for a time.
  - >-
    In much the same way, Harvestmen are not born, but made. Barren, infertile,
    and missing pieces of their souls,
  - >-
    Umasi are unable to breed. Their only recourse is to tear off chunks of
    their own flesh, bind them together with the remains of dead humanoids, and
    animate the results using the same ancient juju rites.
  - >-
    Many people have sought the secret to the longevity of the Harvestmen, only
    to be turned away with little explanation. Because the joining ritual
    requires one to give away a part of his soul willingly, the Umasi only
    accept those ready to make such a dire compact because they have no other
    choice. The Harvestmen only give their "gift" to humanoids who find
    themselves at the edge of death, whether from a grievous wound or some
    magically resistant aff liction or disease. During the ritual, a piece of
    the dying humanoid is exchanged with a corresponding piece of an Umasi
    "donor." Once the stitches are sewn, the dying creature's wounds are healed,
    and he joins the ranks of the Harvestmen forevermore.
  - >-
    Habitat and Society Umasi society is as much a patchwork as its members.
    Some live off the jungle, hunting and farming as they did before the curse.
    Other tribes lead sedentary lives, trading ancient artifacts of the first
    Umasi with explorers in exchange for needed goods. Umasi have no organized
    leadership or traditional families, and children are unheard of among their
    kind. Regardless, all Umasi tribes form around a council of elders.
  - >-
    While some Umasi still dwell deep in the Mwangi Jungle amid the skeletal
    ruins of their former kingdom, the majority of the Harvestmen have spread to
    the Kaava Lands and the Screaming Jungle, distancing themselves from the
    memory of their curse. Umasi are reclusive wherever they dwell, preferring
    to stay on the fringes of settlements. Although they need humanoid flesh to
    survive, most Umasi kill only as a last resort, taking flesh from the newly
    dead instead. This practice often stigmatizes them further, with other races
    considering them little more than grave robbers. A few Umasi embrace their
    near immortality in a darker way, viewing other humanoids as prey. These
    Harvestmen roam the Bandu Hills with undead ghouls, hunting travelers and
    harvesting what they wish, sometimes before their victims are even dead.
  - >-
    However, some Umasi use their peculiar nature to live harmoniously with
    other humanoids. Pathfinders tell of human villages where Umasi act as
    gravediggers during plague outbreaks. Their immunity to disease allows the
    Harvestmen to safely dispose of infected corpses, while at the same time
    gaining the flesh they need and also garnering goodwill from those they
    help.
  - >-
    Harvestmen rarely fight with other races, but competition over resources
    like water or hunting grounds can cause conf lict, and those knowingly
    trespassing on Umasi land may court their anger. When driven to combat,
    Umasi are extremely dangerous, laying ambushes for enemies and swarming
    their targets in the hope of harvesting their strength. With their obsidian
    blades, Harvestmen can punch through the chest cavities of helpless or dying
    humanoids to extract vital organs. Any Umasi who consumes these pieces of
    their victims gains a ferocious surge of power, turning the tide of even a
    desperate battle.
  - >-
    All Harvestmen know the heavy price they pay to cheat death. Some, over the
    lonely centuries, have come to regret their existence, roaming the lengths
    of the Mwangi Expanse and beyond in search of powerful magic to free them
    from their curse. Sadly, no mortal magic has yet proven strong enough to
    undo the fell curse of the Umasi.
