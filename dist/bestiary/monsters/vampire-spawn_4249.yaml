SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A vampire spawn can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the vampire
      spawn establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points
      of Constitution damage. The vampire spawn heals 5 hit points or gains 5
      temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit
      points equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood.
  - name: Dominate (Su)
    description: >-
      A vampire spawn can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action.
      Anyone the vampire spawn targets must succeed on a Will save (DC 14) or
      fall instantly under the vampire spawn's influence, as though by a
      dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30
      feet. At the GM's discretion, some vampire spawns might be able to affect
      different creature types with this power.
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by a vampire spawn's slam (or other natural weapon) gains
      one negative level. This ability only triggers once per round, regardless
      of the number of attacks a vampire spawn makes.
  - name: Gaseous Form (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a vampire spawn can assume gaseous form at will
      (caster level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly
      speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.
  - name: Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)
    description: >-
      A raise dead or similar spell cast on a vampire spawn destroys it (Will
      negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material
      component.
  - name: Shadowless (Ex)
    description: A vampire spawn casts no shadows and shows no reflection in a mirror.
Description:
  - >-
    Vampire spawns cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by
    someone with the authority to do so.
  - >-
    Reducing a vampire spawn's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but
    doesn't always destroy it (see fast healing). However, certain attacks can
    slay vampire spawns. Exposing any vampire spawn to direct sunlight staggers
    it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second
    consecutive round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion
    in running water inflicts damage on a vampire spawn equal to one-third of
    its maximum hit points-a vampire spawn reduced to 0 hit points in this
    manner is destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless vampire
    spawn's heart instantly slays it (this is a full-round action). However, it
    returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the head is also severed and
    anointed with holy water.
