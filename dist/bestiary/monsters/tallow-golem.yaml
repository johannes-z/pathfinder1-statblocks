    description: >-
      A tallow golem can break down and absorb chemicals from a living victim by
      making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it deals 1d4 points
      of Constitution damage each round the pin is maintained. Additionally,
      this causes skin discoloration. The victim must make a successful DC 17
      Fortitude save or take 1 point of Charisma drain. Whether the save
      succeeds or fails, that victim cannot be affected again by the skin
      discoloration of that tallow golem's chemisorb attack for 24 hours. The
      save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    The tallow golem is a humanoid construct composed entirely of wax. It stands
    about 6 feet tall and usually bears no facial features, unless the creator
    chooses to render a lifelike "wax dummy," in which case the golem can appear
    quite real indeed. Wizards who specialize in the creation of tallow golems
    refer to themselves as "chandlers." Unlike other golemsculptors, chandlers
    consider their work a form of art. The golem wears whatever clothing (if
    any) that its creator desires, usually rags or trousers. It has no
    possessions and no weapons. The golem cannot speak or utter any sound. It
    moves slowly, but relentlessly. A tallow golem attacks by pounding its foes
    with its massive fists. Construction The tallow golem is formed from a large
    block of candle wax mixed with special powders worth at least 500 gp. TALLOW
