      Because of their high intelligence, angazhani are proficient with light
      and medium armors, simple weapons, and one martial weapon of choice.
Description:
  - >-
    Physically, high girallons are larger, more powerful versions of their
    lesser cousins. Yet the most dangerous thing about the angazhani (as the
    creatures call themselves) is not their strength, but rather their
    intellect. For behind each angazhani's fury lies a cold, calculating mind.
    Whether this intelligence is the product of evolution or meddling by unholy
    powers, all angazhani honor the demon lord Angazhan. Reclusive by nature,
    high girallon clans settle the most secluded depths of the jungles,
    generally inhabiting ruined cities and misty mountain temples. There they
    rule as divine priestkings over tribes of lesser apes. These congregations
    sometimes even include humanoid slaves or cultists, though the angazhani
    prefer raiding and collect tribute over commanding direct service. They
    rarely reveal themselves to outsiders, and instead quietly gather strength
    against the day their patron sends them out to claim all the world's
    forests. High girallons stand 9 feet tall and weigh nearly a thousand
    pounds. They often dress in hides, and they fight with exotically shaped
    throwing axes or sacrificial knives.
Gear: masterwork hide armor, masterwork throwing axes (8), leather axe harness
