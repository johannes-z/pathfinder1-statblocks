Description_Visual: >-
  This creature is a vaguely cone-shaped creature with six tentacles and a
  large, gaping mouth filled with serrated teeth.
Group: Roper
Source: Tome of Horrors Complete
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Stony Hide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone roper's tough hide renders it immune to damage from nonmagical
      ranged attacks, save those of unusually large size (such as boulders
      hurled by a giant).
  - name: Strands (Ex)
    description: >-
      Most encounters with a stone roper begin when it fires up to six strong,
      sticky strands up to 50 feet away (no range increment). A roper's attacks
      with its strands are treated as ranged touch attacks. Strands can be
      severed by any amount of slashing damage (a strand is AC 20). Once a
      strand has successfully struck a victim, it remains attached until severed
      or retracted by the stone roper (which it may do as a free action).
      Attached strands do no further Strength damage, but the struck individual
      is subject to the pull effect each round, and is subject to the stone
      roper's venom pulse ability. A creature that begins its turn attached to a
      strand is numbed and weakened by the strange material, and for each strand
      attached must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Strength
      damage. The save DC is Constitution-based, and poison resistances and
      immunities apply.
  - name: Venom Pulse (Ex)
    description: >-
      Twice per day, a stone roper can exude a pulse of venom through all of its
      attached strands as a free action. A creature attached to a strand must
      succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be paralyzed (multiple attached
      strands to not require multiple saves or increase the save DC). A
      paralyzed creature appears to have been turned to stone (DC 20 Spot check
      or close inspection reveals that this is in fact not the case). One round
      after being paralyzed, the victim recovers and must succeed on a DC 15
      Will save or act as if under the effects of a charm monster spell for 2d4
      minutes. A charmed creature fights for and defends the stone roper. If the
      stone roper is killed, a charmed victim acts as if under the effects of a
      confusion spell for 1d6+2 rounds. The save DCs are Constitution-based, and
      poison resistances and immunities apply.
Description:
  - >-
    Stone ropers are distant relatives of the common roper though the two races
    are do not (as far as sages know) associate with one another. Stone ropers
    are always found underground and never venture forth to the surface world.
    They have a dislike for sunlight, though it doesn't harm them in any way.
  - >-
    Stone ropers are primarily predators, dining on a diet of fresh meat taken
    from whatever they can find and kill. When food is scarce, stone ropers
    become scavengers and dine on carrion.
  - >-
    Stone ropers are mottled gray and brown like stone and have a rock-like
    body. Cutting a stone roper open reveals its treasure (inside its gizzard).
  - >-
    Most encounters with a stone roper begin when it fires its strong, sticky
    strands. A stone roper attacks anything that comes within 50 feet by
    suddenly shooting out its tentacle strands. It prefers to attack two victims
    at once, each with three strands. The first two victims struck are affected
    with its venom pulse. If this succeeds, they are immediately released before
    they can be affected by the stone roper's Strength damage weakening effect.
    If the venom fails, the stone roper continues to hold the creatures and the
    weakness takes effect on the creatures' turn.
  - A typical stone roper stands 5 feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds.
