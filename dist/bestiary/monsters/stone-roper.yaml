Description:
  - >-
    Stone ropers are distant relatives of the common roper though the two races
    are do not (as far as sages know) associate with one another. Stone ropers
    are always found underground and never venture forth to the surface world.
    They have a dislike for sunlight, though it doesn't harm them in any way.
  - >-
    Stone ropers are primarily predators, dining on a diet of fresh meat taken
    from whatever they can find and kill. When food is scarce, stone ropers
    become scavengers and dine on carrion.
  - >-
    Stone ropers are mottled gray and brown like stone and have a rock-like
    body. Cutting a stone roper open reveals its treasure (inside its gizzard).
  - >-
    Most encounters with a stone roper begin when it fires its strong, sticky
    strands. A stone roper attacks anything that comes within 50 feet by
    suddenly shooting out its tentacle strands. It prefers to attack two victims
    at once, each with three strands. The first two victims struck are affected
    with its venom pulse. If this succeeds, they are immediately released before
    they can be affected by the stone roper's Strength damage weakening effect.
    If the venom fails, the stone roper continues to hold the creatures and the
    weakness takes effect on the creatures' turn.
  - A typical stone roper stands 5 feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds.
