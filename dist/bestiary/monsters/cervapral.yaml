SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Enchantment Sense (Ex)
    description: >-
      Cervaprals have an innate sense for magical compulsion and control. A
      cervapral can attempt a Sense Motive check to sense an enchantment as a
      move action, rather than requiring the normal 1 minute.
  - name: Mercies (Su)
    description: >-
      A cervapral's lay on hands ability removes disease (as remove disease) and
      fatigue in addition to curing damage.
  - name: Pronghorn (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cervapral's gore attack is considered a primary natural weapon, even
      when used in conjunction with a weapon attack.
  - name: Sprint (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per minute, a cervapral can move at 10 times its normal speed (500
      feet) when it makes a charge.
Description:
  - >-
    Cervaprals embody the essence of liberty and are passionately devoted to
    both the overthrow of tyranny and the abolition of slavery. They have no
    moral objection to the concepts of royalty or nobility, but hold any group
    that is granted authority through inheritance or tradition to a very high
    standard, insisting that the rights of the ruled must be protected at least
    as strongly as the rights of the rulers.
  - >-
    Cervaprals frequently serve on the Material Plane as willing allies to
    servants of good who engage in daring raids to free slaves and unjustly held
    captives. Cervaprals believe nearly any sacrifice is justified to break the
    chains of bondage, and are equally at home in frontal assaults as they are
    in stealthy scout missions and infiltrations. They fervently reject the
    notion that "the ends justify the means," and refuse to accept evil acts in
    the name of promoting greater good. They are willing to give up considerable
    personal comfort and safety to promote their goals of freedom and
    independence for all.
  - >-
    If called with the lesser planar ally spell, cervaprals generally demand
    that payment for their services is donated to a cause that fights slavery
    and supports freedom. Such a cause must not already be closely allied with
    the spellcaster or her allies. A cervapral who is called to aid in the
    immediate and direct liberation of prisoners or slaves often halves the
    payment he requires for granting such assistance.
