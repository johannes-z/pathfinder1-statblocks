SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gremlin Lice (Ex)
    description: >-
      All grimples are infested with gremlin lice. Whenever a warm-blooded
      creature comes in physical contact with a grimple, there is a 25% chance
      it contracts gremlin lice. 1d4 rounds later, the creature begins to itch.
      The itch proves so distracting that for the duration of the infestation,
      the individual takes a -1 penalty on all concentration and initiative
      checks. Fortunately, these annoying parasites cannot live long on
      non-gremlins, and only survive for 24 hours. Submersion in water or
      exposure to freezing temperatures also kills a gremlin lice infestation.
  - name: Putrid Vomit (Ex)
    description: >-
      Every 1d4 rounds, a grimple can spew a 30-foot line of vomit as a standard
      action. Treat this as a ranged touch attack with no range increment.
      Anyone struck must succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or be nauseated for
      1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Grimples are filthy urban scavengers that lurk beneath the eaves of
    abandoned buildings, clock towers, belfries, and steeples. Sickly-looking
    and ragged, they shed constantly as a result of the small parasites they
    host. Quick climbers, grimples also have loose flaps of skin that stretch
    between their arms and allow them to glide short distances. Grimples despise
    humans and show it by attacking drunks, unlocking stables, torturing guard
    dogs, and loosening hanging storefront signs so that they fall on people.
    This does not stop them from sometimes allying with humans and other
    humanoids, but such collaborations are always temporary, as a grimple is
    ever plotting betrayal. Although a grimple is often arrogant and
    overbearing, its ability to vomit at will (and propensity for doing so
    constantly) remains its most unappealing quality. Voracious omnivores,
    grimples feast off garbage. They frequently target inns, restaurants, and
    other places where they can scavenge a steady supply of food.
