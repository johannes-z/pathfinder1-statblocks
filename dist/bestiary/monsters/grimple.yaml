Description:
  - >-
    Grimples are filthy urban scavengers that lurk beneath the eaves of
    abandoned buildings, clock towers, belfries, and steeples. Sickly-looking
    and ragged, they shed constantly as a result of the small parasites they
    host. Quick climbers, grimples also have loose flaps of skin that stretch
    between their arms and allow them to glide short distances. Grimples despise
    humans and show it by attacking drunks, unlocking stables, torturing guard
    dogs, and loosening hanging storefront signs so that they fall on people.
    This does not stop them from sometimes allying with humans and other
    humanoids, but such collaborations are always temporary, as a grimple is
    ever plotting betrayal. Although a grimple is often arrogant and
    overbearing, its ability to vomit at will (and propensity for doing so
    constantly) remains its most unappealing quality. Voracious omnivores,
    grimples feast off garbage. They frequently target inns, restaurants, and
    other places where they can scavenge a steady supply of food.
