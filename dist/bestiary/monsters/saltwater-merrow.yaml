Description:
  - >-
    Merrows are best described as the aquatic cousins of ogres. Although their
    green, scaled skin and webbed hands and feet make them appear different,
    merrows are just as cruel, savage, and wicked as their ogre relatives. The
    saltwater variety grows much larger than the freshwater variety, but the
    behavior and society of the two types are otherwise similar.
  - >-
    Merrows are known for pillaging small fishing villages and towns under cover
    of night. Similar to ogres, merrows have a strong sense of family and
    typically hunt in gangs, preferring to grab a couple of villagers and head
    back into the water rather than sticking around and dealing with armed
    resistance. Merrows have a stronger sense of unity than ogres do, and rarely
    will the leader of a tribe be challenged. When they have chosen a village or
    town to plunder, they attack as a gang and share the spoils.
  - >-
    A freshwater merrow is 12 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. Saltwater merrows
    easily reach 20 feet tall and 4,000 pounds, and have been known to hunt
    whales. The two species do not often come in contact, but when they do,
    feuding and conf lict are swift to develop.
