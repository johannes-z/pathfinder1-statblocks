SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Devastating Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hungerer's bite deals x4 damage on a successful critical hit. If this
      damage is enough to reduce a victim to negative hit points, the victim
      must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save to avoid being decapitated, bitten
      in half, or otherwise instantly killed by the horrific wound. The save DC
      is Strength-based.
  - name: Vile Spew (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a hungerer takes damage, the resulting wound spews a great gout
      of vile blood and acid. Any creature adjacent to a hungerer when it is
      wounded takes 2d6 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 25 negates). The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Wisdom Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A hungerer drains 2 points of Wisdom each time it strikes a foe with its
      bite or claw attacks. Unlike with other kinds of ability drain attacks, a
      hungerer does not heal any damage when it uses its Wisdom drain.
Description:
  - >-
    Once regular lamias, these hideously deformed creatures are the result of
    terrible fleshwarping experiments that have rarely been repeated since the
    fall of Thassilon. The heads and torsos of these creatures are nearly 10
    feet in diameter, and a typical hungerer weighs about 20,000 pounds.
  - >-
    Hungerers are unnatural creatures, re-released into the world with Karzoug's
    awakening. These terrors live in constant pain and serve as living
    embodiments of hunger, insatiable in their constant quests for sustenance.
    Although they prefer to tear and rend living flesh, hungerers can consume
    almost any organic material, and might even gnaw on stone or metal without
    ill effect when nothing else is available.
