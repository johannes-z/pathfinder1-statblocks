SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ghost Touch Fangs (Su)
    description: >-
      A hypnalis's bite attack is treated as if it has the ghost touch special
      weapon quality.
  - name: Phasing (Su)
    description: >-
      A hypnalis can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a
      free action and shift back again as a move action (or part of a move
      action). The ability is otherwise identical to ethereal jaunt (CL 15th).
  - name: Poison (Su)
    description: >-
      If a hypnalis poisons an ethereal creature while on the Ethereal Plane
      (including creatures under the effects of spells or effects that grant
      etherealness such as ethereal jaunt), the creature is immediately forced
      onto the Material Plane and takes the specified Constitution damage.
      Creatures on the Material Plane are affected by this poison as normal.
      Hypnalis Venom: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6
      rounds; effect 1d3 Con and effects listed above; cure 2 consecutive saves.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Sometimes called an ether serpent, a hypnalis resembles a snake the size of
    a python sporting a hood like that of a cobra with gray stripes. The
    creature's fangs carry a potent venom that is not only deadly, but can force
    creatures off the Ethereal Plane. While other denizens of the Ethereal Plane
    focus their attention on warring with each other, spying on others, or
    feeding on dreams, a hypnalis hunts those not native to its plane. Different
    hypnalises deal with such interlopers in their own ways. Some sinister or
    young and hotheaded hypnalises hunt such trespassers for sport, tormenting
    them for a while before killing them or expelling them to the Material
    Plane. Other older or inquisitive hypnalises are more curious about such
    strangers and pragmatic in their dealings with them, approaching interlopers
    in attempts to find out their method for traveling to the Ethereal Plane and
    whether or not they can return. If they can, these hypnalises might request
    that these interlopers leave, backing such requests with threats if the
    interlopers seem uncooperative. If the interlopers don't have a method to
    return to their home, some rare good-natured hypnalises may help them find a
    way to leave the Ethereal Plane without using its poison. Even when this is
    the case, hypnalises are wary creatures, and are always on guard against
    treachery. A hypnalis is approximately 8 feet long and weighs about 20
    pounds.
