  star.

  - name: Guiding Star (Su)
    description: >-
      When the estuarine worm is in ahket form, its bioluminescence attracts
      weak-minded creatures. Any creature within 120 feet that attempts to move
      during its turn must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be forced to move
      toward the estuarine worm instead of in its intended direction. This
      ability is otherwise treated a gaze attack. This ability is a
      mind-affecting illusion (pattern) effect, though vermin are not immune to
      this effect. The estuarine worm can activate and deactivate this ability
      as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Seasonal Transformation (Ex)
    description: >-
      An estuarine worm has two forms: ahket (wet season) and shemu (dry
      season). In its shemu form, the estuarine worm is one size category
      smaller than when it's in its ahket form. Further, its Strength and
      Dexterity decrease by 8 and it loses its damage reduction. It also loses
      its guiding star ability and its willful special quality. Its natural
      armor bonus increases by 8 and it gains DR 15/ bludgeoning. In addition,
      all of the creature's movement speeds are decreased by 10 feet. An
      estuarine worm assumes its shemu form if it goes 24 hours without exposure
      to water. An estuarine worm that is targeted by a control water (lower
      water), greater polymorph, flesh to stone, or transmute mud to rock spell
      immediately shifts to its shemu form (instead of experiencing the spell's
      normal effect). An estuarine worm takes on ahket form if it is submerged
      in water for 24 hours. An estuarine worm that is targeted by a control
      water (raise water), greater polymorph, stone to flesh, or transmute rock
      to mud spell immediately shifts to its ahket form (instead of experiencing
      the spell's normal effect).

      In ahket form, an estuarine worm gains a +4 competence bonus to Will saves
      against enchantment spells and effects.
Description:
  - >-
    When Alboras, one of the brightest navigable stars, returns to the night
    sky, it is a sure sign the River Sphinx will soon flood its banks and
    replenish the land after the harvest. The inundation also revives the rare
    but deadly estuarine worms. During the wet season, which is called akhet in
    Osiriani, the giant worms hunt the flooded plains. When the waters recede
    and Alboras disappears below the horizon again, the estuarine worms retreat
    as well. During shemu, the dry season, they enter a semi-torpid state and
    lie buried beneath the dry soil for protection.

    A typical estuarine worm measures 25 feet long and 3 feet wide during the
    wet season. The worms have a bioluminescent organ atop their heads. At
    night, the tiny,
  - >-
    flickering light might be mistaken for a star low on the horizon. When the
    dry season comes, the estuarine worm contracts to become half as long and
    half as wide. Its skin, once soft and spongy like wet mud, becomes as hard
    as stone.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Estuarine worms are most active when the River Sphinx is at its highest
    levels and crests its banks. Though the farmers leave when their lands
    flood, those who live on the edges of the flood plain, as well as those who
    sail the river, are still at risk of attack by these predators. Estuarine
    worms bury themselves in the mud during the day and emerge to hunt at night
    when it is cooler. The carnivorous worms eat whatever they can find, from
    fish and frogs, to livestock and people. They have even been known to gorge
    on crocodiles and hippopotamuses, after which they bury themselves for a
    time in order to digest their hefty meals. The lights on their heads attract
    small animals above and below the water, which in turn can attract larger
    prey. Stories are told of travelers who mistake the light for Alboras and
    navigate their small riverboats right into the maw of a worm.
  - >-
    As the floods recede, the estuarine worms become less active. When the land
    above them is no longer underwater, the worms remain buried in the moist
    soil. For the rest of the year, they live off fat and water stored during
    the wet season. The worms' flesh contracts, becoming denser in the process.
    It is commonly believed that the worms, like the soil, harden from
    dehydration, but it is, in fact, a natural defense mechanism. Though they
    might seem to be asleep, estuarine worms remain a danger in the dry season.
    When the worm's resting spot is too shallow or a plow digs too deep, farmers
    risk disturbing a worm in its hibernation. Though the worms may not be as
    agile or as hungry during this time, they are still dangerous predators.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Estuarine worms are typically solitary hunters. They reproduce
    parthenogenetically, and thus have little need for contact with others of
    their kind. Estuarine worms reproduce rarely, but birth large numbers of
    offspring when they do. Most of the spawn, however, are eaten by other
    predators long before they reach full size. When multiple worms are found
    together (usually because of lower-than-normal floodwater), only the alpha
    worm uses its bioluminescence. This sign of dominance also keeps potential
    prey from being drawn to multiple light sources.
  - >-
    Several cults in Osirion keep estuarine worms as sacred beasts in their
    secret temples. Worshipers of both Lamashtu and Rovagug believe it was their
    respective god who birthed these worms. Members of the Old Cults revere
    estuarine worms for their connection to the star Alboras and the Great Old
    One who supposedly dwells there. The cultists seek out the worms during the
    season of shemu, when the worms are less violent and more tractable. A
    combination of brute force and magic are necessary to find, exhume, and
    contain these elusive creatures. In captivity, estuarine worms can be made
    to change form regardless of the season through the application or exclusion
    of water. The high priests of these cults also know certain spells that can
    trigger an immediate change. The cultists connect to their god through the
    worms, offering sacrifices to them and reading omens in their violent
    squirming. The worms serve as guards against intruders, and can also be used
    as weapons against the cult's enemies.
