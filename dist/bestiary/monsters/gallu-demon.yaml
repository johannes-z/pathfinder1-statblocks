SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alter Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A gallu-demon can assume any humanoid form, or revert to its own form, as
      a standard action. This ability is similar to the alter self spell
      (CL18th), but the gallu-demon can remain in the new form indefinitely.
  - name: Dimension Door (Su)
    description: >-
      At the gallu-demon's option, it can use dimension door to transport a
      grappled victim (who gets no saving throw) within the same plane, instead
      of its plane shift ability. It is otherwise similar to the spell of the
      same name.
  - name: Plane Shift (Su)
    description: >-
      A gallu-demon can enter any of the elemental planes, the Astral Plane, or
      the Abyss. This ability transports the gallu-demon and one grappled victim
      (who gets no save to avoid the shift). It is otherwise similar to the
      spell of the same name.
Description:
  - >-
    Gallu-demons are shape-shifting demons of the underworld. They are often
    employed as soldiers and spies by various demon lords and balors in their
    abyssal armies. Gallu-demons are quick to anger and hard to control, so
    companies of these demonic beings are loosely organized at best. Where the
    gallu-demon excels however, is entering the material planes, disguising
    itself as a normal humanoid, and abducting a mortal it has befriended,
    quickly whisking it back to its abyssal lair where it turns said mortal over
    to its master. Gallu-demons have been known to spend months at a time on the
    Material Plane just to befriend and eventually abduct a chosen target.
    Abducted targets are sometimes devoured by a gallu-demon before it has
    completed its task, but more often than not, an abducted victim is given to
    the gallu-demon's master who enslaves the victim (or sometimes devours it
    himself). A gallu-demon stands 9 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds. Its
    flesh is glossy black and other than a large mouth lined with teeth, it has
    no facial features, though it does seem to be able to see, hear, and smell
    normally. Gallu-demons attempt to snatch opponents and transport them to the
    nether spheres of the underworld, where other demons and undead lie waiting
    in ambush, eager to consume such hapless victims. The galludemon often uses
    its shape-altering power to approach unsuspecting victims, or to perform
    special missions such as escorting mortals out of the underworld to claim
    another in their stead. It must reveal its true form to employ its improved
    grab ability. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
