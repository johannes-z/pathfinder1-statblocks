Description:
  - >-
    Deathstroke serpents are greatly feared predators found dwelling in forests,
    jungles, marshes, and bogs. These creatures generally sustain themselves on
    a diet of large game and other animals, but eat anything readily available,
    including humanoids if the opportunity presents itself. These creatures are
    generally solitary, so mating and reproduction information is unknown,
    though scholars assume these rituals mimic other serpentine creatures.
  - >-
    Deathstrokes, because of their intelligence and cunning are often worshipped
    by scaly humanoids as gods or quasi-deities. The deathstroke does nothing to
    dismiss these beliefs as the worshippers keep it supplied with a steady
    supply of animal and humanoid sacrifices.
  - >-
    Deathstroke serpents can reach lengths of 50 feet. Colorations may also vary
    depending on climate and habit, but most deathstrokes are dark green with
    mottled scales. Deathstroke serpents spend large parts of their days
    sleeping, being mostly active at night. Prey is often ambushed and killed,
    and then returned to the deathstroke's lair to be devoured. After feeding,
    deathstrokes can sleep for up to one week.
  - >-
    A deathstroke serpent attacks by biting and grabbing its opponent. A
    grappled foe is quickly wrapped in its coils and constricted, while
    remaining foes are assaulted by the deathstroke's lightning bolts and
    blasphemy spell-like abilities.
