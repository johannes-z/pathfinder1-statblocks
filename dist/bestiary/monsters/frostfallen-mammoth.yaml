Description:
  - >-
    Frostfallen creatures are mindless undead infused with icy cold and animated
    by a hatred for all living things. Their bodies radiate a devastating chill
    that cloaks them in patches of ice that act as armor. Frostfallen creatures
    appear otherwise as they did at the time of their reanimation, except for a
    cold gleam in the eyes.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    In the harshest reaches of the world, cold is an ever-present enemy. When a
    creature dies from exposure to such harsh conditions, bitter anger and the
    searing cold sometimes combine to reanimate the dead as one of the
    frostfallen. Once reanimated, frostfallen creatures prowl the cold lands in
    which they fell, wreaking indiscriminate vengeance on living creatures out
    of spiteful rage.
  - >-
    Although frostfallen creatures can be created through necromantic magic like
    other undead, arcane scholars are fascinated by the necromancy that brings
    frostfallen creatures to unlife, for the animating force is a synthesis of
    negative energy and a bone-numbing cold. This cold empowers the creature's
    attacks, wreathing its natural weapons in a deathly chill. Those who have
    fought these creatures describe great wounds instantly numbed by the lethal
    touch of frostbite. In addition, a frostfallen creature's body emanates an
    aura of cold that flash-freezes moisture in the air around it, coating the
    creature in a patchwork of ice capable of def lecting blows from even the
    heaviest weapons. The creature's affinity for cold also allows it to locate
    nearby warm-blooded creatures, even in driving blizzards and on moonless
    nights.
  - >-
    Frostfallen creatures move with the same gaits they had in life, while
    gaining a savage surge in physical power. Additionally, unlike normal
    zombies, the frozen condition of the creature fortifies its unlife, making
    it extremely durable. Indeed, throughout the northern reaches of Avistan,
    legends persist of specific frostfallen mammoths, dire bears, and even
    giants that have hunted the Crown of the World for centuries.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    The corrupt animus that powers frostfallen creatures imbues them with a
    hatred of all living things, and most spend their time wandering wintry
    terrains near where they died, looking for life to snuff out. Sometimes,
    vestiges of behavior from their original forms lead to groups banding
    together, like frostfallen wolves that hunt in packs. Even those frostfallen
    that have never encountered others of their kind seem to instinctively
    recognize their own, and band together if prey is nearby.
  - >-
    In Irrisen, winter witches and other ice casters prefer creating frostfallen
    creatures, as such creatures' bodies more readily withstand the decay and
    brittleness often faced by skeletons and zombies in harsh northern climes.
    Casters who create frostfallen creatures often use minor magic to emblazon a
    creature's ice armor with carvings or specific colors, effectively branding
    the creature as a servant.
  - >-
    On rare occasions, casters will create frostfallen creatures in warmer
    regions like the Mwangi Expanse or the deserts of Thuvia. Despite the
    scorching heat of such places, frostfallen creatures retain all of their
    powers. In such cases, the undead's creator normally employs her minions
    against creatures that are susceptible to the frostfallen creature's
    freezing attacks. Some frostfallen creatures have even survived independent
    of their creators. When such a rarity comes to pass, the frostfallen
    creature simply begins hunting the region for fresh life to end, though it
    will often lie in wait in cooler places like deep caves, or under the water
    of an oasis so as to better ambush creatures and travelers who would never
    expect to see a frostfallen creature so far south.
  - Animating a Frostfallen Creature
  - >-
    A magic-user can create any form of frostfallen creature by casting animate
    dead upon the corpse to be animated and providing an amount of ice of equal
    weight, plus two blue topazes or turquoises worth at least 100 gp each. The
    creator can only create a number of Hit Dice of frostfallen creatures equal
    to the amount allowed by animate dead. Frostfallen creatures count against
    the number of Hit Dice of skeletons and zombies that can be created using
    animate dead.
  - Creating a Frostfallen Creature
  - >-
    "Frostfallen creature" is an acquired template that can be added to any
    corporeal creature (other than an undead), referred to hereafter as the base
    creature. A frostfallen creature uses the base creature's statistics and
    special abilities except as noted here.
  - 'CR: As base creature + 1.'
  - 'Alignment: Always neutral evil.'
  - >-
    Type: The creature's type changes to undead and it gains the cold subtype.
    It retains any subtypes except for alignment subtypes (such as good) and
    subtypes that
  - >-
    indicate kind (such as giant). It does not gain the augmented subtype. It
    uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as
    noted here.
  - 'Armor Class: The natural armor bonus improves by +4.'
  - >-
    Hit Dice: A frostfallen creature drops any HD gained from class levels and
    changes racial HD to d8s. Creatures without racial HD are treated as if they
    had 1 racial HD. A skeleton uses its Charisma modifier (instead of its
    Constitution modifier) to determine bonus hit points.
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: Frostfallen creatures gain DR 5/ bludgeoning (or DR
    10/bludgeoning if it has 11 HD or more). They are immune to cold.
  - 'Weaknesses: Frostfallen creatures gain vulnerability to fire.'
  - >-
    Speed: A winged frostfallen creature's maneuverability drops to clumsy. If
    the base creature flew magically, its fly speed is unchanged. Retain all
    other movement types.
  - >-
    Attacks: A frostfallen creature retains all the natural weapons,
    manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature.
    It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the frostfallen
    creature's size, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual
    size.
  - >-
    Special Attacks: A frostfallen creature retains all of the base creature's
    special attacks and also gains the following.
  - >-
    Cold (Su): A frostfallen creature's body generates intense cold, dealing an
    amount of cold damage with its touch determined by its Hit Dice. Creatures
    attacking a frostfallen creature with unarmed strikes or natural weapons
    take this same cold damage each time one of their attacks hits.
  - Frostfallen Creature
  - Hit Dice Cold Damage
  - 1-5 1d6
  - 6-10 2d6
  - 11-15 3d6
  - 16+ 4d6
  - >-
    Abilities: A frostfallen creature's Strength increases by +2 and its
    Charisma by +6. A frostfallen creature has no Constitution or Intelligence
    score, and its Wisdom becomes 10.
  - >-
    BAB: A frostfallen creature's base attack bonus is equal to 3/4 of its Hit
    Dice.
  - >-
    Skills: A frostfallen creature loses all skill ranks possessed by the base
    creature and gains none of its own.
  - >-
    Feats: A frostfallen creature loses all feats possessed by the base creature
    and gains Toughness as a bonus feat.
  - >-
    Special Qualities: A frostfallen creature loses most special qualities of
    the base creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that
    improve its melee or ranged attacks. It also gains the following special
    quality.
  - >-
    Lifesense (Su): The frostfallen creature notices and locates living
    creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.
