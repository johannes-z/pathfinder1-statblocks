SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ablative Adaptation (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, the Grand Defender can shed its outer layer of
      metal, revealing a slightly smaller version of itself underneath. This new
      form may be made of cold iron (changing its DR to 15/cold iron), mithral
      (DR 15/silver), or iron (DR 15/adamantine, as normal). Its attacks count
      as this metal type for overcoming damage reduction. If the herald is
      brought to 0 hit points, it becomes inert; 1d4 hours after it last took
      damage, it sheds its outer layer and reanimates at half its normal hit
      points. Once shed, the outer layer decays into worthless powder over 1d4
      minutes.
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      The herald's poisonous breath weapon functions like that of an iron golem
      (free action every 1d4 rounds, 10 ft. cube, Fort DC 19, 1d4 Con, 2
      consecutive saves). The save DC is Constitution-based. The cloud persists
      for 1 round. Defender's
  - name: Shield (Ex)
    description: >-
      The herald's shield is a +3 heavy steel shield, though it becomes
      nonmagical if the herald is destroyed or is no longer holding or wearing
      it.
  - name: Hammer Storm (Ex)
    description: >-
      The herald can expel a volley of warhammers from its mouth, which
      functions like a breath weapon (30-foot cone, 15d6 bludgeoning damage plus
      Awesome Blow, Reflex 19 half, usable 1/day). If the herald is in its cold
      iron or mithral form, these hammers count as cold iron or silver,
      respectively. The herald can exclude any number of squares in the cone.
      The hammer storm creates 24 physical warhammers that persist after the
      instantaneous attack and may be used by creatures (though they're normal
      warhammers, not masterwork, cold iron, or mithral). The herald can spend 1
      minute eating 24 warhammers (or an equivalent amount of metal such as that
      created by its ablative adaptation ability) to recharge this ability. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Su)
    description: The herald has the same immunity to magic as an iron golem.
Description:
  - >-
    The Grand Defender is a powerful golem-like tomb that serves as the communal
    body and resting place of Torag's greatest dwarven heroes. It stands 18 feet
    tall and weighs approximately 10 tons.
