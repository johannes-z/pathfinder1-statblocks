SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Curse of Frozen Flesh (Su)
    description: >-
      Slam-contact; save Will DC 24; effect Creature gains vulnerability to
      cold. Anytime the cursed creature fails a saving throw against a spell or
      effect with the cold descriptor, it is also slowed for 1d4 rounds.
  - name: Lingering Curses (Su)
    description: >-
      An indarugant is an accursed creature, and so has dominion over misfortune
      and curses. An indarugant can apply the effects of its curse of frozen
      flesh with its bestow curse spell-like ability (in place of bestow curse's
      normal effects). Additionally, the DC of any attempt to remove a curse
      inflicted by the indarugant increases by 5. If a caster level check to
      remove an indarugant's curse fails by 5 or more, the curse appears to be
      lifted and is temporarily suppressed until the next time the victim enters
      combat or is otherwise faced with a life-threatening situation (subject to
      the GM's discretion).
Description:
  - >-
    In times of need, the taiga giants of Varisia turn to the spirits of their
    ancestors for aid, relying on signs and omens from the spirit world to guide
    them out of danger. Yet sometimes the power and insight of these ancestral
    spirits is not enough. When invaders overhunt the land, when disease and
    pestilence run rampant, or when war and slavery threaten to decimate
  - >-
    whole tribes, some giants seek a different sort of aid-one that comes at a
    far higher price. High above the snow line, trapped within ancient glacial
    floes, the indarugants wait to be unleashed so they might once again bring
    disaster and ruin to the enemies of their tribes.
  - >-
    Most indarugants resemble the desiccated corpses of taiga giants, though
    other types of giants may become indarugants as well. After taiga giants,
    stone giants are the most likely to follow through with this ritual, though
    by doing so they risk being shunned by neighboring tribes.
  - >-
    Indarugants stand 20 feet tall, but weigh only 3,000 pounds due to the lack
    of water in their shriveled, skeletal bodies. The ritual that creates an
    indarugant involves marking and maiming the body of the candidate, and many
    still bear these fading tattoos and ancient scars.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Indarugants are remarkable among corporeal undead in that they can't be
    created from a deceased creature's corpse-a creature must be alive and
    willing to be transformed into an indarugant. This process usually begins
    with a pilgrimage of a group of taiga giants into the icy mountains. The
    tribe's shaman or chieftain accompanies the candidate in order to perform
    the profane rituals necessary for the transformation. Once above the snow
    line, the candidate is subjected to a week-long ritual designed to sever its
    connection to the spirits of its ancestors, the intent being that the future
    indarugant can do whatever must be done to protect the tribe without fear of
    offending the spirits or bringing dishonor to the tribe. At the ritual's
    conclusion, the candidate is killed with a single blow to the head, then
    buried in the ice and snow along with the weapons and tools it will use once
    it rises as an indarugant. How long it takes the indarugant to rise
    varies-some rise as early as the following evening, while others remain in
    the ice for months or even years.
  - >-
    Not all giants who agree to undergo the transformation successfully complete
    their promise. Many lose their gall at the ritual's outset and attempt to
    escape back down the mountain to safety. Those who flee are hunted
    ruthlessly by their fellow pilgrims and the rest of the tribe, who fear
    offending the spirits. If possible, such escapees are captured alive and
    brought back to the frozen heights to undergo the ritual at spear point.
    This forced ritual does not produce an indarugant, but serves as a deterrent
    to those who would think to renege on their commitments in the future.
  - >-
    Some tribal leaders claim that those who successfully escape their promise
    to serve as an indarugant are cursed. They say that these traitors to their
    people transform into even more grotesque and sinister creatures, though no
    evidence of such monsters exists-these claims are widely thought to be a
    scare tactic to elicit compliance.
  - >-
    Those that successfully undergo the transformation come back changed. They
    are no longer constrained by moral concerns such as honor, fear, or mercy.
    Indarugants are capable of committing any act, no matter how taboo, so long
    as it furthers the interests of the tribe and its people. They treat their
    foes with such brutality that even the most wicked of giants cringe at the
    sight.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Indarugants reside high in the mountains of Varisia, in places where the
    snow never melts. They hide themselves away in glacial caves, deep
    foreboding crevasses, and other secluded chasms where only those initiated
    into the secrets of their creation will know to find them. In times of need,
    a giant shaman or oracle will journey to the hidden places, braving the
    dangers of the cold and high elevation in order to beseech the indarugants
    for aid. Usually this aid comes in the form of exacting violence against the
    tribe's enemies, as indarugants are powerful warriors and cunning
    strategists. Rarely, an especially evil or desperate tribe may entreat an
    indarugant to serve as its chief or shaman, though usually only for a
    limited period of time, and only when the tribe is leaderless and under dire
    threat.
  - >-
    Whatever form the indarugant's aid takes, it comes at a steep price. A giant
    who would petition an indarugant for aid must first swear a profane pact
    with the creature to someday undergo the transformation and become an
    indarugant itself. Once the indarugant has accomplished its agreed-upon
    task, it will lead the petitioner back up the mountain to its desolate home,
    and perform the necessary rituals to add the petitioner to the ranks of the
    undead. This serves both as a deterrent to keep the giants from calling on
    the indarugants too readily, and as a way to ensure the indarugant
    population grows along with the tribe. In this way, the tribes of giants
    will always have guardians waiting for them in the high ice, ready to defend
    them against any threat.
  - >-
    Scholars of giant lore claim that all the races of giants once buried their
    dead in this manner, or at least created indarugants through similar
    rituals, if they did not live in icy climates. In Varisia, this changed
    during the Age of Legend, when the runelords of Azlant enslaved the giants
    and bent them to their sinister will. Those giants who fought back against
    the runelords called upon the might of their undying ancestors, sending
    legions of indarugants down into the plains to defend the giant tribes.
    Though the undead guardians fought fiercely, they were unable to stand
    against the might of Thassilon, and all were eventually destroyed. Since
    that time, only the taiga giants, who largely escaped slavery, continue the
    practice of creating indarugants. This may not be true for much longer,
    however, as reports of stone and frost giants burying their dead in the high
    ice now grow ever more common.
