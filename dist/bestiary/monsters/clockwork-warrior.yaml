  - name: Repair (Ex)
    description: >-
      A clockwork warrior regains 3 hit points per round. Damage dealt from
      acid, cold, or fire effects cannot be self-repaired. If reduced to 0 or
      less hit points, it regains 1 hit point per round (but still cannot repair
      damage caused by acid, cold, or fire effects).
Description:
  - >-
    Clockwork warriors are constructed from a wide range of materials but take
    the same general form of a 6-foot tall humanoid. In battle, clockwork
    warriors rely on relentless waves of attacks to overwhelm their foes. They
    are far too slow to engage faster units and generally serve as the primary
    defensive troops for a clockwork colony. Clockwork warriors are usually
    formed of cast-off equipment and detritus scavenged from battlefields.
  - >-
    They all feature a "nervous system" of thin steel wires that controls their
    individual pieces. Tiny clockworks that look much like metallic cockroaches
    infest the warrior, working to repair damage sustained by this construct.
    Acid, fire, and cold effects destroy these maintenance clockworks thus
    preventing the warrior from repairing. Unlike clockwork swarms (see below),
    the clockworks that repair the warrior lack the intelligence and
    sophistication to tackle any other task.
  - >-
    When facing an enemy, clockwork warriors typically move forward and attempt
    to immobilize and kill quickly dispatch their foes. Warriors are designed to
    take advantage of their great strength, often utilizing grapple and bull
    rush attacks to overwhelm foes.
