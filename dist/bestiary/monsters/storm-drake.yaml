SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Lightning Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      A storm drake can, as a standard action, breathe a ball of electricity
      that explodes upon contact with a solid surface or target. This attack has
      a range of 100 feet and deals 7d6 points of electricity damage (DC 18
      Reflex half) to all creatures within a 20-foot radius spread. Once a storm
      drake has used its lightning breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Savage Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A storm drake applies 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to damage dealt with
      its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.
  - name: Speed Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a swift action, a storm drake may draw on its
      draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional
      move action in that round.
  - name: Storm Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A storm drake can see through fog, clouds, and similar obscuring effects
      with perfect clarity, including areas affected by spells such as obscuring
      mist and fog cloud.
Description:
  - >-
    Storm drakes are fierce creatures that make their lairs high atop
    storm-ravaged mountains. From here, they can survey their territory, and
    dive to the attack when a potential meal is spotted. Favored meals include
    humanoids of all kinds, and large game such as deer, elk, and moose.
  - >-
    Storm drakes are generally 20 feet long from nose to tail and weigh over
    3,000 pounds. Colors range from dark, dull gray to slate gray mottled with
    lighter grays. Claws and talons are black and its eyes are the color of dark
    storm clouds. Storm drakes typically live 300 years.
  - >-
    A storm drake is merciless in combat, biting and slashing its foes with its
    dagger-like teeth and claws. An ambush hunter by nature, a storm drake's
    approach is usually foreshadowed by a sudden shift in the weather from clear
    or slightly overcast skies to dark skies and storms.
