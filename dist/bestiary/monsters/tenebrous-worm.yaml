  This pallid beast clatters upon dozens of small legs. Writhing bristles twitch

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Su)
    description: >-
      The acid of a tenebrous worm's bite affects only organic matter-as it
      dissolves creatures, it converts their flesh to shadow that swiftly fades
      away, leaving raw, jagged wounds behind. In dim light, acid damage dealt
      by a tenebrous worm's bite increases to 8d6 points of damage, while in
      darkness or bright light, the acid damage is reduced to 4d6.
  - name: Bristles (Su)
    description: >-
      Long bristles of shadowstuff extend from between the tenebrous worm's
      armor plates. These bristles react swiftly to attacks, stabbing at any
      creature that attempts to harm the worm. Each time a creature attacks a
      tenebrous worm, it must make a DC 18 Reflex save to avoid being punctured
      by several bristles. Each time a creature is punctured by these bristles,
      it takes 1d4 points of piercing damage and is exposed to the tenebrous
      worm's poison. A creature that grapples a tenebrous worm is automatically
      hurt by these bristles. The save DC to avoid the bristles is
      Dexterity-based.
  - name: Poison (Su)
    description: >-
      Bristles-injury; save Fort DC 20, frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds, effect
      paralysis for 1d4 rounds plus 1d2 Con (the duration of the paralysis is
      cumulative with each failed save), cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The caterpillar-like tenebrous worm is a voracious predator that hungers for
    mortal flesh. The tenebrous worm is the larval stage of the gloomwing (see
    page 133)-but in a strange reversal, these younger creatures are more
    dangerous than the adults they grow into. A native of the Plane of Shadow, a
    tenebrous worm hatches from the body of an unfortunate creature that has
    been implanted with an egg by a gloomwing. The tenebrous worm is fully grown
    upon hatching, and immediately begins to scour its environs for flesh to
    consume.
  - >-
    Although the tenebrous worm tends to be relatively palecolored, its internal
    organs seethe and roil with shadowy energies and dark fluids. As the
    creature feeds, these shadowy innards begin to grow out of its body, forming
    strange bristle-like filaments of semisolid shadowstuff not only capable of
    piercing the flesh of those who would attack the worm, but also possessing a
    deadly paralytic poison. Additional shadowy fluids constantly seep from the
    worm's mandibles-when it bites prey, these fluids melt flesh into shadows
    that the creature can then consume. When a tenebrous worm feeds on enough of
    this shadowy flesh, the creature seeks out a secluded, shady area (typically
    just within a cave entrance or in a ruined building) and spins a shadowy
    cocoon around itself. A tenebrous worm's cocoon exudes the effects of a
    darkness spell (CL 8th), muting the surrounding light. After a period of
    several days, the cocoon tears open and a fully grown gloomwing emerges,
    ready to seek a host for its eggs.
