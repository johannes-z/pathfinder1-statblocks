Description:
  - >-
    Though great horned owls seem large, most of their apparent bulk comes from
    their particularly fluffy feathers and rather large heads. Great horned owls
    have wingspans of up to 5 feet and weigh up to 4 pounds.
  - >-
    Great horned owls primarily hunt at night, locating prey through their
    excellent hearing. Their diet consists of rodents supplemented by smaller
    birds and rabbits.
