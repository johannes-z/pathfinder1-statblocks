Description:
  - >-
    Leopards are 4 feet long and weigh 120 pounds. The statistics presented here
    can describe any feline of similar size, such as jaguars, panthers, and
    mountain lions-what differentiates these big cats from the similarly sized
    cheetah is primarily their habitats-leopards and their kin prefer to hunt at
    night and ambush their prey from above, pouncing down from trees or high
    rocks. Leopards eat almost any animal they can run down and catch,
    preferring Small prey but capable of downing Large herbivores or surviving
    on rodents, birds, and insects. Healthy leopards are generally not
    aggressive toward humanoids, and if they aren't hungry and don't feel
    threatened, it is possible to approach closely without a hostile reaction.
    Yet a leopard that settles in an area bordered by humanoid civilization can
    easily and swiftly become a dangerous predator.
