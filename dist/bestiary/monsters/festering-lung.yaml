SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature whose space is occupied by the living disease at the end of
      its move is exposed to the form of disease of which the swarm is composed.
      Such a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save each round that it is in
      the swarm or take ability damage for that round as indicated under the
      disease type. There is no incubation period for this type of exposure and
      its method of delivery is irrelevant due to the sheer concentration of
      disease organisms present. Even after a creature leaves the area of a
      swarm, it must make the appropriate Fortitude save or continue to take
      ability damage each day as indicated by the disease. At this point two
      successful saving throws in a row indicate that the creature has fought
      off the disease and recovers, taking no more damage. However, the disease
      can be contracted again through regular exposure or another encounter with
      a living disease. Once a creature has made a successful saving throw
      against the disease of a living disease, it is immune to future bouts of
      disease of that particular living disease for 1 year. Festering Lung: This
      infection gets into the lungs of the affected creature and begins to break
      down the respiratory system, producing choking and copious amounts of
      bloody phlegm. It saps the strength from the victim due to poor
      oxygenation and renders him unable to speak or make any vocal noises two
      days after contraction. Creatures that do not breathe are immune to
      festering lung. Festering Lung: Swarm-inhaled; save DC 24 Fort; onset
      immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str damage and 1d4 Con damage; cure
      2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Evasion (Ex)
    description: >-
      Due to its composition of billions of highly resilient microscopic
      organisms, if it makes a Reflex saving throw against an attack that
      normally deals half damage on a successful save, a living disease instead
      takes no damage. It is identical to the rogue ability of the same name.
  - name: Lifesense (Ex)
    description: >-
      The overpowering drive to propagate itself gives a living disease the
      ability to notice and locate living creatures within 60 feet, just as if
      it possessed the blindsight ability.
  - name: Vulnerability to Remove Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a remove disease is cast on a living disease or a victim currently in a
      space occupied by a living disease and the living disease fails a
      Fortitude save against the spell, it deals 5d10 points of damage to the
      living disease. A creature that has remove disease cast on it is not cured
      unless outside of the swarm's area when the spell is cast or unless the
      living disease was destroyed by the casting of the spell. Otherwise, an
      infected creature will require an additional remove disease upon leaving
      the living disease's space if it contracted the disease while within.
Description:
  - >-
    Living diseases are swarms of microscopic organisms, harmful bacteria or
    viruses that have supernaturally gained limited sentience as a cohesive
    swarm under certain exceedingly foul or magical conditions. They seek out
    hosts through which to propagate their contagion. Though they are considered
    swarms, their individual components are so small as to be invisible to
    unaided sight, exponentially smaller than even Fine creatures, and they are
    thus considered one Medium creature. They are only visible at all due to the
    sheer number of individual organisms that comprise the swarm; literally
    billions of them make up a single living disease.
  - >-
    Living diseases offer no resistance to items or creatures entering their
    midst and cannot be physically felt. They make no sound whatsoever. A living
    disease in the dark is terrible indeed, as there is no indication it is
    present until its effects are first felt.
  - >-
    Living diseases neither see nor sleep. Their movements are by pure instinct,
    and they locate potential hosts with their lifesense. Because of their
    resilience and extremely high reproductive rate, the microorganisms of a
    living disease give it fast healing 10.
  - >-
    Though extremely rare, there are many different kinds of living diseases -
    potentially as many kinds as there are diseases. Two in particular are
    described here: festering lung and black rot.
  - >-
    A living disease seeks to surround any potential host it senses. It
    instinctively avoids undead, oozes, plants and constructs, which do not make
    suitable hosts for the spreading of disease. Unlike normal swarms, a living
    disease does not deal physical damage. Instead it exposes any creature whose
    space it occupies at the end of its move to its form of disease.
