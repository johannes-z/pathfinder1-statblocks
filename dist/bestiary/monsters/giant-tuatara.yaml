Description_Visual: >-
  This reptile has a beak like upper jaw, a long narrow body and is covered in
  hard scales and short spines running along its back.
Group: Tuatara
Source: Tome of Horrors Complete
Description:
  - >-
    This burrowing reptile has a sharp beak designed to crack and tear through
    the carapace or scaled hide of its prey. A tuatara's diet consists of
    anything it can find: plants, insects, and adventurers. Prey that is not
    devoured immediately is dragged back to its lair and either fed to the
    young. Their slow metabolism allows them to go long periods of time without
    eating so food is generally not kept or saved. In times when food is scarce,
    tuataras often eat their own kind.
  - >-
    They generally bury their eggs in a burrow with females producing 1d0+4 eggs
    per litter during the warmer months of the year. Females mate once about
    every four or five years, and rarely before 20 years of age (tuataras have a
    slow metabolism and do not reach maturity until about 20 years of age).
    Mating occurs in the early spring months and incubation lasts 13 to 15
    months with young being born the following summer.
  - >-
    Young are helpless and depend solely on their mother for survival for the
    first few months of their life. Tuataras live to be about 100 years old.
  - A giant tuatara is about ten feet long and weighs close to 400 pounds.
  - >-
    Its color ranges from gray or olive to dull red. It lacks ears but has two
    small openings on either side of its head that seem to function as such. On
    top of its head is a "third eye" (or parietal eye) that helps the tuatara in
    regulating its body temperature. Males have a noticeable crest down the
    center of its neck and back; females have the same crest, but it is much
    less pronounced.
  - >-
    Tuataras stalk their prey at night, having excellent vision in low light and
    a keen sense of smell. They generally avoid contact with creatures larger
    than themselves if they can help it. When threatened, a tuatara inflates its
    body, raises and flares its crest, and darkens the scales between its
    shoulders and neck.
