Description:
  - >-
    Tigers stand more than 3 feet tall at the shoulder and are about 9 feet
    long. They weigh from 400 to 600 pounds. Tigers are usually the top animal
    predators in their territories, and have been known to kill bears,
    crocodiles, giant snakes, wolves, and even other great cats. Even humanoids
    are far from safe, especially in cases where a tiger has developed a taste
    for humanoid flesh. Tigers prefer terrain with plenty of cover and proximity
    to water as their hunting grounds. While the tiger itself is a fearsome
    predator, its strength and ferocity pales in comparison to that of the
    larger dire tiger. Known to many scholars as the smilodon and to tribal
    societies as the saber-toothed tiger, the dire tiger is invariably one of
    the region's top predators. Its defining feature is a pair of huge incisors
    that hang down like fearsome knives from the upper jaw, protruding
    menacingly even when the creature's mouth is shut. These immense hunting
    cats grow to be over 12 feet long and can weigh up to 6,000 pounds.
