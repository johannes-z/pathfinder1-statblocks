SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sprint (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per minute, a shadow demon increase its fly speed to 240 feet for 1
      round.
  - name: Shadow Blend (Su)
    description: >-
      During any conditions other than bright light, a shadow demon can
      disappear into the shadows as a move-equivalent action, effectively
      becoming invisible. Artificial illumination or light spells of 2nd level
      or lower do not negate this ability.
  - name: Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shadow demon is utterly powerless in bright light or natural sunlight
      and flees from it. A shadow demon caught in such light cannot attack and
      can take only a single move or attack action. A shadow demon that is
      possessing a creature using magic jar is not harmed by sunlight, but if it
      is struck by a sunbeam or sunray spell while possessing a creature, the
      shadow demon is driven out of its host automatically.
Description:
  - >-
    Shadow demons resemble standard shadows with wings. They are the incorporeal
    form of a demon trapped in the form of a shadow as punishment for some
    wrongdoing. If anything can release a demon trapped in shadow form, only the
    dukes, princes, and lords of the Abyss know such secrets. As a result of
    their new form, shadow demons are malign and evil, destroying all life they
    encounter.
  - >-
    A shadow demon lurks in dark places, waiting for its prey to pass nearby.
    Often before leaping to attack, it uses its deeper darkness to gain the
    advantage. It then leaps from the shadows and attacks with its incorporeal
    attacks. It selects the most powerful foe in a group and uses its magic jar
    against it.
  - >-
    A shadow demon's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
    treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
    damage reduction.
