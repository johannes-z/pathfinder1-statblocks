SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Yamabushi Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      A yamabushi tengu is proficient with all monk weapons and all swordlike
      weapons (including katanas and wakizashi), and gains a +1 bonus on attack
      rolls and damage rolls with such weapons. Yamabushi tengus who do not use
      swords favor the kusarigama.
  - name: Steal Voice (Su)
    description: >-
      Up to three times per day, but no more than once per target, a yamabushi
      tengu can attempt to steal a victim's voice as part of its bite attack.
      When it does so, the creature bitten must make a DC 16 Will save or lose
      the ability to speak aloud. This prevents the use of any spell with verbal
      components and the use of command-word-activated magic items, among other
      difficulties. The yamabushi tengu's voice changes to match the one stolen.
      The victim's voice remains stolen until the oni steals another voice,
      until the oni agrees to give the stolen voice back (a standard action
      requiring the oni to touch the victim), or until the next sunrise. Any
      effect that removes curses (such as remove curse or break enchantment) can
      restore a stolen voice (DC for success equals the save DC of the steal
      voice ability-DC 16 for most yamabushi tengu), as does the death of the
      oni who stole the voice in the first place. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Susceptible to Patterns (Ex)
    description: >-
      A yamabushi tengu takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against illusion
      spells of the pattern subschool. For 1 round after a yamabushi tengu
      either makes a successful save against a pattern or recovers from the
      effects of a pattern, it is dazzled.
Description:
  - >-
    Yamabushi tengus are oni with a predilection toward thievery and trickery,
    wearing the flesh of wicked, fiendish tengus. When a yamabushi tengu first
    appears, its first course of action is invariably to seek out a well-hidden
    nest or other nook to serve as a lair. Despite their ability to fly, most
    yamabushi tengus are nervous in open areas, since it's easy to be seen in
    such environs. A yamabushi tengu is more at home indoors or at night, where
    it can skulk in the shadows when it's unsure of its surroundings.
  - A yamabushi tengu is 5 feet tall and weighs 120 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    While most yamabushi tengus look like normal tengus, they can actually
    manifest in a number of humanoid bird shapes. Ravens and crows are the most
    common model which these creatures take their appearance from, yet tales
    exist of yamabushi tengus with features more akin to cranes, eagles,
    peacocks, gulls, vultures, and even pelicans. Only the features of ducks and
    other billed avians (like geese) are notably absent from yamabushi tengus.
    In fact, yamabushi tengus have a strange loathing for ducks-they find these
    birds to be a mix of comic tragedy and pitiful hideousness, from the blunt
    shape of their bills to their distinctive gait and their warbling quacks.
    The presence of a duck can often provoke even the most restrained and crafty
    yamabushi tengu into making poor choices: faced with choosing between
    attacking a truly dangerous foe or using their weapons and magic against a
    nearby duck, most yamabushi tengus make the choice to kill the duck, even if
    such an act might compromise their position to their actual enemy.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Yamabushi tengus are driven by greed, particularly for shiny treasures like
    coins, jewels, gems, and polished weapons. Many extend this obsession to
    clothing (favoring brightly colored silks) and armor (preferring light armor
    over medium or heavy armor). Most of what a yamabushi tengu plots or plans
    can be traced to a desire to gather as much shiny treasure as possible, but
    they are also especially entranced and intrigued by avian
    humanoids-particularly tengus, dire corbies (see Pathfinder Campaign
    Setting: Misfit Monsters Redeemed) and garudas (see Pathfinder Module: Cult
    of the Ebon Destroyers). Yamabushi tengus share the most in common with
    tengus, of course, for it is from these creatures that the oni take their
    forms. Dire corbies and garudas, being non-humanoid monsters (monstrous
    humanoids and outsiders respectively) are in strange ways both similar and
    quite different from tengus, and as such yamabushi tengus find them
    endlessly fascinating. In the case of dire corbies, the creatures' feral
    natures, xenophobic personalities, and overall lack of civilization make
    them ideal groups for a yamabushi tengu to infiltrate and take control
    of-although in most cases, a yamabushi tengu who infiltrates a dire corby
    flock eventually grows tired of the crude creatures and moves on. Garudas
    are more difficult for yamabushi tengus to interact with, for these
    outsiders are generally good. Encounters between garudas and yamabushi
    tengus almost always end in combat, typically with the more powerful garuda
    the victor. As a result, when confronted by a garuda, most yamabushi tengus
    choose subtlety over direct confrontation. In a best-case scenario, a
    yamabushi tengu's minions or allies capture and restrain the garuda, giving
    the yamabushi tengu ample opportunity to interrogate or even vivisect the
    garuda prisoner.
  - >-
    Most yamabushi tengus, though, find greatest comfort dwelling among thieves'
    guilds-particularly among those populated by tengus, in which case a
    yamabushi tengu appears in its natural form, using its wings as an obvious
    badge of superiority over its flightless tengu kin. Among thieves of other
    races (such as humans), a yamabushi tengu prefers to stay in its humanoid
    form. However, when a yamabushi tengu assumes the form of anything other
    than a tengu, its true nature is difficult for it to hide, for invariably
    the shapechanged oni's nose remains quite prodigious, usually to an almost
    comical degree. Strangely enough, however, yamabushi tengus generally don't
    think of their unusual noses as flaws in their magical disguises. A
    yamabushi tengu can also retain its wings when using its change shape
    ability, and these pinions, as well as its beaklike nose, are a sure way to
    tell a disguised yamabushi tengu apart from others.
