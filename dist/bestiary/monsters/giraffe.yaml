      A giraffe's hoof attacks are primary attacks and its slam attack is a
      secondary attack.
Description:
  - >-
    These long-necked animals roam across plains in loose-knit groups, grazing
    on the upper reaches of acacia trees. Giraffes usually avoid conf lict.
    However, when its young are threatened or if the giraffe is cornered, it
    attacks ruthlessly, striking with its powerful hooves. Giraffes rarely use
    their necks to make slam attacks unless they are fighting among themselves
    as part of their mating displays. A giraffe is between 16 and 20 feet tall
    and weighs 3,500 pounds.
