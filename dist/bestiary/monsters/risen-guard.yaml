SpecialAbilities:
  - name: The Constant (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Risen Guard has elevated influence in Osirion because of her privileged
      station as a guardian of the Ruby Prince and her title of "the Constant."
      She gains a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks against Osirians (Pathfinder
      Player Companion: Faction Guide 45).
Description:
  - >-
    The warriors of the Risen Guard are the elite bodyguards and champions of
    the pharaohs of Osirion. Each has been raised from the dead by order of the
    pharaoh, which they hold as a mark of high honor; the most honored are those
    revived by a pharaoh's own hand. In gratitude, Risen Guards swear to defend
    the monarch with their renewed lives. Distinguished in Osirian society,
    especially when defending a popular ruler, Risen Guards can call upon
    assistance from many quarters.
  - >-
    Risen Guards usually patrol the pharaoh's palace in squads of three, guard
    his person in security details of 24 or more, or lead groups of other guards
    in maintaining pharaonic property that the pharaoh is not currently using.
    In addition to defending the pharaoh, Risen Guards also look after the
    throne's household and guests. Thus, an escort of three to 12 guards is
    likely to be found around any visiting dignitary or Ruby Prince Khemet III's
    twin younger siblings, Ojan and Jasilia. Both twins are fond of exploring
    the forgotten wonders of Osirion's desert, and up to six squads of Risen
    Guards are immediately dispatched to track them down when they slip off on
    their own to conduct field research.
  - >-
    Some Risen Guards also collaborate with the city guard of Sothis or
    safeguard certain interests of national security.
