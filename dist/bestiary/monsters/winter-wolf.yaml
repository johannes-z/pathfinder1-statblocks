Description:
  - >-
    Winter wolves are larger, smarter, more ferocious variants of worgs with
    white fur and a deadly breath weapon. A typical winter wolf is 8 feet long,
    stands 4-1/2 feet tall at the shoulder, and weighs about 450 pounds. Winter
    wolves will often ally themselves with frost giants, hill giants, and other
    large humanoids, serving entire tribes of giants as both scouts and guards.
