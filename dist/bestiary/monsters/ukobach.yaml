Description_Visual: >-
  The light of a flaming pitchfork illuminates a creepily malformed little man,
  his red skin scarred and raw like the victim of horrific burns. Although
  barely taller than a child, his features mock those of a terrible old man with
  an oversized head, knife-like nose, and crazed round eyes flickering with wild
  flames.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animate Flames (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an ukobach can animate an existing fire of Small
      size or larger. Doing so requires an ukobach to make a DC 15 Wisdom check
      as it impresses its will upon the fire. This DC increases by +5 for every
      size category of the flame above Small. If an ukobach succeeds, the flame
      animates with the statistics of a fire elemental of the same size, and
      follows the ukobach's mental commands. The flames remain animate for a
      number of rounds equal to the ukobach's Wisdom modifier-usually 3-after
      which they return to being simple flames, setting the square they cease
      moving in alight or being extinguished, as their surroundings warrant. Up
      to five ukobachs can make use of the aid another action to each grant an
      adjacent ukobach a +2 bonus on this Wisdom check to animate flames
      (granting a maximum +10 bonus).
  - name: Fire Leap (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, an ukobach occupying the same space as a fire, pool of
      lava, vent of searing steam, or similar blaze can teleport from that
      burning feature and emerge from another within 100 feet. This ability
      functions similarly to the spell dimension door, but only between fires.
      Upon entering a flame, an ukobach is instantly aware of all flames within
      range through which it might exit. If an ukobach enters a flame and there
      are no others to exit through within 100 feet, the devil's movement
      immediately ends and it is stunned for 1 round.
  - name: Firebreathing (Su)
    description: >-
      An ukobach can spend a standard action to guzzle a pint of oil, alcohol,
      or similarly flammable fluid and hold the combustible liquid within its
      body. At any point within 10 minutes of doing so, the ukobach can expel
      the liquid either as a 10-foot cone of fire or a 20-foot line of flame,
      both dealing 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 13 for half). Upon
      breathing fire an ukobach cannot make use of this ability again until it
      drinks another pint of oil. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Scorch (Su)
    description: >-
      An ukobach's touch is searing hot, causing its claws and any metal weapon
      it grasps to deal an additional 1d4 points of fire damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Maniacal and clever, ukobachs embody the tenacity and ever advancing genius
    of Hell. Legions of these tiny devils labor throughout the it, and from
    their efforts rise new heresies and tools of depravity. They revel in the
    fires of Hell and manipulate them not toward destruction, but to the
    creation of ever greater and more innovative diabolical ends. The keepers of
    Hell's furnaces, they delight in their mad work, breaking only to torment
    the damned with their burning tools or newest inventions. Ukobachs stand
    approximately 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 70 pounds on average. Their fire
    pokers are fundamentally tied to their beings and disintegrate in a flash of
    cinders and ash upon the devil's death. These tools hold up to 10 fistsized
    embers, which an ukobach can fling at its enemies. Ecology Born from the
    burning depths of Hell, ukobachs find themselves most at home amid the
    choking and sultry pits where mortals dare not delve, proving well adapted
    to such stifling environs. While they must breathe, they prove equally well
    adapted to breathing smoke, cinders, and steam as air. Like all devils, the
    ukobachs' infernal eyes gaze through even the most stygian night, but unlike
    their brethren, they dislike the dark. While they harbor no fear of darkness
    and certainly see its value when tormenting mortals, they view it largely as
    a waste, seeking to dispel even the most fleeting shadow with an explosion
    of flame. Habitat & Society Most ukobachs originate from the flaming canals
    of Dis or the fiery pits of Phlegethon. Although rarely born from Moloch's
    crematoriums at the heart of Citadel Ba'al, hordes of ukobach furnace
    keepers tend the flames of the archdevil's ceremonial ovens. Devastating
    ukobach engineers also tinker in the foundries at the heart of Phlegethon,
    creating ingenious devices of intentional or incidental immolation-some
    infernal rumors claim a particularly insidious ukobach inspired the
    invention of the first fireworks, leaving these devils with a universal love
    of such creations. On the mortal plane, ukobachs gravitate to cities. While
    many metropolises prove ill prepared to defend against the flames these
    devils delight in spreading, most ukobachs take more subtle approaches,
    finding lairs in abandoned smithies, large furnaces, stone ruins, and other
    places likely to survive the occasional errant flame. While indisputably
    pyromaniacal, ukobachs are more than merely crazed marauders. Seeing a small
    hovel, pile of leaves, or alley cat burn is nothing to creatures born from
    the flames of Hell. Rather, they enjoy the order and progression of flames,
    exalting in striking the spark that ignites a wildfire, upturning the
    lantern that sets a whole city quarter aflame, or immolating the leader
    whose death results in the dispersal of a formerly devout congregation.
    Further satisfying their methodological obsessions, ukobachs prefer setting
    elaborate traps for their victims over direct combat, often turning whole
    structures into burning deathtraps, trapping and retrapping the same
    location, or setting obvious snares that cause their quarries to overlook
    more devious ambushes. These impish devils understand the use of flammable
    fluids and materials well, often employing barrels of oil, casks of alcohol,
    heaps of coal, and even alchemical items like tindertwigs in their
    creations. Among diabolists, it is said that all ukobachs know the secret of
    creating berith, an alchemical element by which any material might be
    distilled into gold. Stories tell of ukobachs trading knowledge of this
    element for wild prices or only after an alchemist gathers components from
    exotic lands. Such tales often offer blatant moral lessons and warnings
    against these unnatural obsessions, such as the Taldan author and former
    alchemist Smardina's cryptic and symbol-laden work Shagreen, wherein an
    obsessed alchemist adventures across the world and ultimately trades an
    ukobach 23 years of his life, only to find his age and journeys have made
    his hands too crippled to work-he dies soon after and is dragged to Hell in
    a golden coffin. Summoning Ukobachs Ukobachs prove unusually congenial when
    it comes to answering the summons of many diabolists, especially those with
    an obvious creative streak, interest in alchemy, or queries regarding the
    inventions of Hell. Any diabolist who draws the magic circle necessary to
    bind an ukobach with mercury or silver powder, or who lights their
    diabolical summoning with chemical fire rather than normal oil or tinder,
    increases how difficult an ukobach finds it to escape from the magical trap
    by +2. Additionally, a diabolist gains a +2 bonus on the opposed Charisma
    check made to obtain an ukobach's service if the task involves creating
    alchemical or metallurgical works, or otherwise involves fire. In addition,
    ukobachs who know and favor their summoner sometimes bring gifts with them
    from Hell. While on the surface such boons might seem like blessings, they
    are always carefully selected by an ukobach and meant to encourage a
    summoner toward a destructive end. Commonly, such infernal gifts take the
    form of fireworks and explosives-especially in lands where such creations
    are uncommon-inscrutable blueprints or formulas for fiendish devices or
    magic items, or powerfully volatile alchemical reagents.
