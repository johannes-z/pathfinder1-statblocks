Description_Visual: >-
  This small vaguely humanoid looking plant creature is mottled green and brown.
  Its lower roots are splayed and resemble legs and feet. Its upper roots are
  long and resemble humanoid arms. Its head, if it could be called that, is a
  mass of solid vegetable matter covered in lumps.

Description:
  - >-
    The mandragora is a small carnivorous and vaguely humanoid-looking plant
    that loves the taste of humanoid flesh (particularly human flesh).
  - >-
    If the mandragora goes more than three days without devouring flesh, it
    burrows into the ground and attaches to local tree roots, from which it
    draws its sustenance until living prey can be found.
  - The mandragora stands about 5 feet tall and weighs about 120 pounds.
  - >-
    A mandragora attacks its opponent by slashing and striking with its upper
    root-tentacles. It attempts to grab its prey and strangle it. If it
    succeeds, the mandragora hangs on until either it or its opponent is dead.
    Slain creatures are covered in a thick layer of mucus and slime and devoured
    at the mandragora's leisure.
