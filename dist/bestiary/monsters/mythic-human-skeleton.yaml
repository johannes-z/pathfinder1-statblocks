Description:
  - >-
    A mythic skeleton is an animated corpse created with mythic magic such as
    mythic animate dead. It has an unnatural cunning that belies its mindless
    nature and a natural instinct for killing.
  - Creating a Mythic Skeleton
  - >-
    "Mythic skeleton" is an acquired template that can be added to any creature
    with the skeleton template (referred to hereafter as the base skeleton).
  - >-
    Mythic Subtype: A mythic skeleton gains the mythic subtype, with a rank
    equal to half the CR of the base skeleton. Instead of gaining additional
    abilities according to its CR, it always gains channel resistance +2,
    relentless, and superior two-weapon fighting. The mythic skeleton gains all
    other benefits of having the mythic subtype: ability score bonuses, bonus
    hit points, mythic feats, mythic power, natural armor bonus, and spell
    resistance increase (if any).
  - >-
    CR: Adjust the base skeleton's CR according to its mythic rank (this
    template doesn't increase the base skeleton's CR other than from the mythic
    rank).
  - >-
    Hit Dice: A mythic skeleton's Hit Dice are determined as though it were a
    zombie (Bestiary 288) instead of a skeleton.
  - >-
    Relentless (Ex): Any melee attack made against a mythic skeleton provokes an
    attack of opportunity from the skeleton.
  - >-
    Superior Two Weapon Fighting (Ex): A mythic humanoid skeleton usually fights
    with a scimitar in each hand. It does not take a penalty on attack or damage
    rolls for attacking with two weapons.
  - Other Mythic Skeletons
  - Other types of skeletons have the following additional or altered abilities.
  - >-
    Mythic Bloody Skeleton: Destroying a mythic bloody skeleton in the area of a
    non-mythic bless spell doesn't prevent it from returning to unlife.
  - >-
    Mythic Burning Skeleton: Add half the burning skeleton's mythic rank to its
    fiery aura damage and melee attack fire damage. Add its mythic rank to the
    DC of its fiery death ability.
  - Mythic Skeletal Champion
  - >-
    To create a mythic skeletal champion, increase its channel resistance by +2,
    and add the mythic subtype, additional Hit Dice as if the skeletal champion
    were a zombie of its size, and mythic abilities according to the base
    skeletal champion's Hit Dice.
