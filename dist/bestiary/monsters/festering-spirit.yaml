SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      A humanoid creature killed by a festering spirit's Constitution damage
      becomes a festering spirit under the control of its killer in 1d4 days.
      Giving the corpse a proper burial (or cremation) prevents it from becoming
      a festering spirit.
  - name: Ghost Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      A festering spirit can manipulate corporeal objects that weigh up to 25
      pounds as if those objects had the ghost touch special ability.
  - name: Slime (Su)
    description: >-
      A festering spirit's slime resembles the putrefying sludge of decaying
      corpses. Any creature that is hit by the spirit's incorporeal touch
      attack, passes through its square, or hits it with a natural weapon or
      unarmed strike must attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save. On a failure, the
      creature is nauseated for 1d4 rounds, and on a success the creature is
      staggered for 1 round. A festering spirit's slime persists on objects and
      creatures for 1d10 minutes but has no harmful effect after its initial
      contact. Creatures immune to poison or disease are immune to this ability.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Trample (Ex)
    description: The DC of a festering spirit's trample is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A festering spirit arises when a vile person's corpse is put in a mass
    grave, or when such a person is buried, exhumed, and placed in a charnel
    house or ossuary. The lingering hatred and evil of the dead mixes with the
    worst remnants of dozens of other people, creating a frustrated incorporeal
    shade of sickness, hate, and rot. Powerful mortals might arise as multiple
    festering spirits, each spawned from a different aspect of the original
    creature's personality. A festering spirit can't travel more than a mile
    from its remains. When left alone for long periods, a festering spirit
    usually wanders the halls and rooms near its burial site, destroying things,
    indulging in pranks, or trying to eat and drink anything it finds palatable
    (which falls through its incorporeal body to no effect). Its senses can
    barely detect these treats, though some adventurers report that strong
    alcohol and spicy foods can distract the spirit as it savors these
    sensations.
