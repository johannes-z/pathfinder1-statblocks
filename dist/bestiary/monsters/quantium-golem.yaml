SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Eldritch Surge (Su)
    description: >-
      A Quantium golem can hurl a lance of eldritch energy that deals 30d6
      points of damage to all creatures in a 240-foot line (Reflex DC 25 for
      half). The crimson Quantium golem deals half electricity and half fire
      damage, and slows a creature (as the slow spell) that fails its save for
      2d4 rounds. The green Quantium golem deals half acid and half fire damage,
      and nauseates any creature that fails its save for 1d4 rounds. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Quantium golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted. • A magical attack that deals
      cold damage against the crimson golem or electricity damage against the
      green golem slows it (as the slow spell) for 1 round, with no saving
      throw. • A Quantium golem and its equipment are immune to rust attacks.

  - name: Urban Defender (Su)
    description: >-
      A Quantium golem gains 150 bonus hit points as long as it's within 1 mile
      of the city. If it moves beyond this range, it loses these bonus hit
      points.
Description:
  - >-
    Around the perimeter of Quantium, two immense golems march a patrol
    uninterrupted since the days of the archmage Nex himself. They stand as
    mirror images of each other, one crimson in hue and bearing a sword in the
    right hand, the other green and with sword in the left. Legend holds that
    Nex crafted the golems to defend his capital during a time of desperate
    struggle in which he foresaw his own absence.
  - >-
    The golems only pause in their unending patrol if attacked or obstructed,
    and then only until they eliminate or circumvent the obstacle, whichever is
    most direct. The golems always patrol at opposite ends of the city, marching
    counterclockwise and pausing if their partner is interrupted. They last
    broke from patrolling in 576 ar, when they fought the Gebbite horde in the
    very battle in which Nex vanished from Golarion.
  - CONSTRUCTION
  - >-
    The secret of the Quantium golems' construction vanished with their creator,
    the archmage Nex.
