Description:
  - >-
    Barbegazis are often referred to as snow or ice gnomes, a name they do not
    appreciate. They inhabit frigid hills and mountains where they spend their
    time engaging in activities they enjoy: hunting, fishing, and wrestling.
    Barbegazi homes are constructed of large blocks of ice and stone and are
    often built into the sides of hills and mountains or are in fact part of the
    mountain itself. Their homes are frequently targeted by white dragons (who
    consider their flesh a delicacy). A barbegazi prefers to avoid combat, using
    misdirection and deception (including well-placed traps and pitfalls)
    whenever possible to mislead and detour potential opponents. If a barbegazi
    knows an enemy is coming, it will most certainly have several traps and
    snares in place by the time the enemy arrives. If a barbegazi engages an
    opponent, it usually opens combat with its icicle blast before moving to
    attack with its short sword. A barbegazi is not stupid and will not risk its
    life in battle (unless it is defending its clan). If forced to flee, a
    barbegazi burrows into the snow and attempts to escape. Barbegazis stand
    about 3 and a half feet tall and weigh 45 pounds on average. Barbegazi
    Society A barbegazi clan is led by the eldest male. Females play a lesser
    role than males in barbegazi society, though many are as capable (or more)
    than many of the males in the clan. Young barbegazi are trained from a young
    age in the art of combat and survival. Aside from white dragons, barbegazis
    have tolerable relations with most cold-dwelling races and often initiate
    trade with frost giant clans. Typical goods traded by a barbegazi clan are
    furs and meat. They do not associate or particularly care for frost men
    (q.v.). Barbegazi Characters Barbegazi leaders tend to be rogues or clerics.
    Barbegazi generally worship Pharasma, and their clerics favor the ice
    subdomain and the death and knowledge domains. +2 Dexterity, +2

    one feat. AC: +2 natural armor bonus. Speed: Barbezagi have a base land
