SQ: infernal duke traits (see page 43), irresistible force
Environment: any (Hell)
Organization: solitary (unique)
Treasure: triple standard (Avernus Claw, other treasure)
Description_Visual: >-
  This giant, centaurlike creature's body is made of hardened, thorny vines. A
  crown of laurels graces its brow.
Group: Infernal Duke
Source: Hell Unleashed
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Armor of Thorns (Ex)
    description: >-
      A network of thorny vines armors and invades Furcas's body. Any creature
      that strikes Furcas with a non-reach melee weapon, unarmed strike, or
      natural weapon takes 1d8+7 points of piercing damage from the barbs
      studding the infernal duke's body and must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude
      saving throw or be poisoned (potentially in addition to the effects of
      unholy aura). This living, toxic armor also feeds off of all manner of
      corruption. Any attempt to poison Furcas or magically control his vine
      armor heals him for 4d6 points of damage. Furcas can also use his poison
      barbs to heal himself in this way.
  - name: Crown of Laurels (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a move action, Furcas can bestow his laurel crown upon an
      adjacent creature. For the next 24 hours, the creature is affected as per
      the spells greater heroism and unholy aura. At the end of this period,
      these benefits cease and the creature is infected with a particularly
      resilient form of devil chills (see below). This version requires six
      consecutive successful saving throws to cure, and can be magically cured
      only by a lawful evil spellcaster. Creatures immune to disease suffer no
      negative effects. The crown always returns to Furcas after 24 hours.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Devil chills: hooves-injury; save Fort DC 40; onset immediate; frequency
      1/day; effect 1d3 Str damage; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Immovable (Ex)
    description: >-
      While conscious, Furcas cannot be moved, tripped, or knocked prone by any
      attack, combat maneuver, spell, or similar effect generated by any
      creature lesser than a deity or object of less than artifact-level power.
  - name: Irresistible Force (Su)
    description: >-
      Anytime Furcas's attack moves a foe-whether through the use of a combat
      maneuver, Awesome Blow, telekinesis, or a similar effect-that creature is
      moved double the normal distance.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Poison barb-injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds;
      effect fatigued; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison Barb (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Furcas can grow and fire a toxic barb from his body.
      This is a ranged attack with a range increment of 60 feet. Any creature
      struck by the barb must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude saving throw or be
      poisoned. Furcas can decide what type of poison the barb bears, whether
      his own fatiguing toxin or any poison conveyed through injury that appears
      on the chart on page 559 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. After using
      this ability, Furcas cannot grow another barb for 1d4 rounds.
  - name: Powerful Hooves (Ex)
    description: >-
      Furcas's hoof attacks are considered primary attacks. He always adds his
      full Strength bonus to the amount of damage dealt by his hooves.
  - name: Swat (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a free action, Furcas can use the Awesome Blow feat with his slam
      attack. Because of his irresistible force ability, any creature affected
      by this attack is hurled 20 feet.
Description:
  - >-
    Called the Knight of the Laurels and the Sentinel of Dis, Furcas is the
    infernal duke of duty, flames, and herbalism. His disparate concerns model
    him as a true knight of Hell, a sentry armed with fire and girded by thorns.
    His patience and wisdom make him one of the multiverse's greatest military
    commanders, but also a sage of all things green and growing. It might take
    eons, but Furcas knows that a relentless will can forge even the most
    delicate petal into a weapon deadlier than any spear.
  - >-
    While laurels do crown Furcas's brown, his title stems from the tangle of
    parasitic, cassytha-like growths that riddle the remains of his stern,
    once-angelic form. These vines constitute a mighty, tauric body-one that
    serves as armor for the infernal duke and as a bed for innumerable toxic
    plants. Furcas is rarely seen without the Avernus Claw, a trident gifted to
    him by Typhon, the deceased former archdevil of Avernus. The burning trident
    holds
  - >-
    the power to block any escape from the first layer of Hell, and serves as
    Furcas's divine symbol.
  - >-
    As Furcas's demesne-the Hanging Marches-lies on Avernus, the infernal duke
    is the subject of the layer's ruler, Barbatos. However, Furcas also
    maintains strong ties with Dis, the second layer of Hell, and its imperious
    ruler, the archdevil Dispater. These dual loyalties stem from the ancient
    hellmouth Voulgaz, which yawns at the center of Furcas's realm. The infernal
    duke's fortress, the Forked Pyre, guards the hellmouth and serves as the
    stronghold from which Furcas oversees his legions as they conduct travelers
    and damned souls into the plane-city beyond. Furcas has overseen this post
    for countless eons, and despite numerous sieges by celestials and proteans
    alike, the gate to Dis has never fallen.
  - >-
    Whether seeking to reclaim a damned soul (rightfully or otherwise), to gain
    some wisdom of the natural world, or to secure passage to Dis, characters
    with business in Hell are likely to travel through the Hanging Marches. This
    is made all the easier from Golarion by a permanent portal that connects a
    forested valley within Brevoy's Icerime Peaks with Olikscourt, a toppled
    outpost on the shore of the Crawling Sea. Few who trespass in the Hanging
    Marches escape the notice of the Knight of the Laurels.
