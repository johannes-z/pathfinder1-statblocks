  - name: Scorpion Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy ability, save that it
      works only on scorpions. A girtablilu gains a racial bonus on this check
      equal to its Hit Dice (normally +10). Scorpions are normally mindless, but
      this empathic communication imparts upon them a modicum of implanted
      intelligence, allowing girtablilus to train scorpions and use them as
      guardians (though it does not grant them skills or feats).
Description:
  - >-
    Girtablilus fiercely guard ancient places and treasures lost to history. Far
    from civilized eyes, they thrive and piously protect their charges with the
    aid of monstrously large scorpions that girtablilus keep as pets.
  - >-
    All girtablilus share a zeal for religion, although the objects of
    veneration vary from tribe to tribe. Some girtablilu tribes still serve
    long-forgotten deities, preserving the divinities' names and holy rituals.
    Others embrace religions derived from prehistoric worship, devoted to the
    idea of gods that once were or might never have been.
  - >-
    Girtablilu leaders are clerics or oracles, and are responsible for the
    tribe's religious observances and laws. Tradition and service to the group
    are important. Those who violate tribal beliefs are killed or exiled into
    the harsh wasteland.
  - >-
    Girtablilus believe that no sacrifice in life (including death in the
    service of the gods) goes unrewarded in the hereafter; this belief makes
    them fierce and fearless fighters.
  - A girtablilu is 13 feet long and weighs 800 pounds.
