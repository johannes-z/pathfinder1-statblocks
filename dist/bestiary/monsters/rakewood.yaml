    description: >-
      As a standard action once every 1d6 rounds, a rakewood can release a cloud
      of deadly spores in a 20-foot-radius burst. Creatures caught in the cloud
      must succeed on a DC 21 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds.
      Creatures succeeding their save are sickened for 1d4 rounds instead. The
      cloud lasts for 1 round before dispersing. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A rakewood is a barely sentient plant creature that lives deep within
    old-growth forests. It consists of a filthy, spheroid fungal mass with a
    ring of three brown tendrils at the top. The tendrils surround a
    sphincter-like mouth lined with razor-sharp spiny teeth. Although it can
    move of its own accord through the use of finger-like cilia at its base, a
    rakewood rarely moves once it has settled itself. Rakewoods live on decaying
    plant matter, and generally they are content to let the world go by as the
    soak up nutrients from the leaf litter. In less productive seasons such as
    winter, rakewoods supplement their diet with animal flesh.
  - >-
    Rakewoods are about 10 feet long and weigh 1,000 pounds. Coloration can vary
    from rakewood to rakewood, but most are dark green in color and covered in
    various fungi and molds. When at rest, a rakewood's tendrils appear to be
    tree roots or large, thick vines.
  - >-
    A rakewood enters combat by releasing its cloud of paralytic spores. Any
    opponents left standing are then pummeled with its slam attacks. A grappled
    or paralyzed opponent is pulled into its maw to be swallowed.
