Description:
  - >-
    Natural wererats tend to be short and wiry, with constantly darting eyes and
    frequent nervous twitches. Males often have thin, ragged moustaches.
    Wererats prefer cities where they can blend in with the humanoid and rat
    population. Their abilities make them especially good at thieving and
    spying, and in many cities the thieves' guild employs numerous wererat
    members.
