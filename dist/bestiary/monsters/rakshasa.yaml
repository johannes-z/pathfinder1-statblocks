SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Detect Thoughts (Su)
    description: >-
      A rakshasa can detect thoughts as per the spell of the same name (CL
      18th). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. When a
      rakshasa uses this ability, it always functions as if it had spent three
      rounds concentrating and thus gains the maximum amount of information
      possible. A creature can resist this effect with a DC 18 Will save. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The rakshasa is an evil spirit that cloaks itself in the guise of a humanoid
    creature that it might walk unseen among its prey. They embody what is taboo
    among most societies, and in the shape of those it seeks to defile, a
    rakshasa gorges itself on these hideous acts. Were they human, these acts of
    cannibalism, blasphemy, and worse would mark them as criminals condemned to
    the cruelest of hells. When not disguised as a humanoid, the otherwise
    humanoid rakshasa has the head of an animal. Often, they possess the heads
    of great cats (such as a tiger or panther) or a snake (like a cobra or
    viper), yet other heads are not unknown-apes, jackals, vultures, elephants,
    mantises, lizards, rhinos, boars, and more are possible. In most cases, the
    type of head a rakshasa possesses speaks in some way to its personality-a
    tiger-headed rakshasa is stealthy and ravenous, while a boar-headed one
    might be gluttonous and crude. These changes rarely impact the rakshasa's
    base statistics, although there are more powerful variants of the standard
    rakshasa that possess multiple heads, more potent spellcasting powers, and
    additional deadly and unusual special abilities. Rakshasas scoff at
    religion- they understand the power of the divine, but see themselves as the
    only thing worthy of worship from the mortal races. Rakshasa clerics are
    thus quite rare. Although rakshasas are outsiders, they are also very much
    creatures of the Material Plane, and many believe the first rakshasas chose
    this exile over some other role offered them by a longforgotten god.
    Although they usually work alone, it isn't unheard of to find extended
    families of rakshasas working together to ruin a mortal civilization from
    the inside out over the course of many generations. A rakshasa is 6 feet
    tall and weighs 180 lbs.
