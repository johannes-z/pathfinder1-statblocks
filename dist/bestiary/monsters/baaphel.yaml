    Baaphel is a grand duke in the service of Belial, leading 2 legions of
    bearded devils in battle for his lord. Baaphel is constantly scheming
    against the other dukes in Belial's service and takes every opportunity to
    discredit them in the eyes of their lord, though he never does this openly;
    it is always through lesser dukes and other devils that his machinations
    come to fruition. Baaphel yearns to be ruler of an entire plane and is
    waiting anxiously until the time comes that he can overthrow his lord.
  - >-
    Baaphel makes his home in a great castle of basalt and iron called Evermore
    on Hell's fourth plane.
  - Baaphel stands 7 feet tall and weighs about 400 pounds.
  - >-
    Baaphel attacks with Hell's Gleaning and spell-like abilities. He usually
    opens combat with flesh to stone, taking out the most able bodied attackers.
  - Baaphel wears +3 chainmail and is rarely encountered without it.
