SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cold Vulnerability (Ex)
    description: >-
      A basidirond takes no damage from a cold, but is slowed (as the spell) for
      1 round per two caster levels. During this time, a basidirond cannot use
      its spores or hallucination cloud special attacks.
  - name: Spores (Ex)
    description: >-
      A basidirond's slam attack transfers poisonous spores to its opponent. A
      creature struck must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or these spores
      take root in his flesh and deal the listed amount of Constitution damage.
      The save DC is Constitution-based. A remove disease spell cast on an
      affected character halts the Constitution damage. Basidirond Spores:
      Disease-contact; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 5 rounds; effect
      1d4 Con damage; secondary effect 1 Con damage; cure 1 save.
Description:
  - >-
    The basidirond is believed to be related to the ascomoid (see that entry),
    and like its distant relative, makes its lair in underground natural
    caverns. Unlike the ascomoid's lair that is usually damp or wet, the
    basidirond's lair is unusually dry. A basidirond stands about 7 feet tall.
    The basidirond attacks by striking with its cone-shaped cap or by firing a
    line of spores at an opponent. Basidirond Hallucination Cloud Rather than
    confusing an opponent, you can randomly determine hallucinations for each
    creature affected. The duration remains the same as detailed under the
    creature's special attack. BASIDIROND HALLUCINATION CLOUD 1d8 Hallucination
    1 Individual believes he is in a swamp and strips off gear and armor to
    avoid sinking. 2 Individual believes he is being attacked by a swarm of
    spiders. He attacks the floor and surrounding area. 3 Individual believes

    Suffocation-Individual believes he is suffocating and gasps for air and
    clutches throat. 5 Individual believes he has shrunk to 1/10 normal size. He
    begins yelling for help. 6 Individual believes his associates have
    contracted a disease. He will not come closer than 10 feet. 7 Individual
