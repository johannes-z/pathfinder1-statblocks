SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cackle Hex (Su)
    description: >-
      As a move action, the penanggalen may cackle. Any creature within 30 feet
      that is under the effects of the penanggalen's evil eye or misfortune hex
      has the duration of that hex extended by 1 round.
  - name: Evil Eye Hex (Su)
    description: >-
      This hex causes the target creature to take a -2 penalty on one of the
      following (penanggalen's choice): AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving
      throws, or skill checks. This effect lasts for 6 rounds, or only 1 round
      if the target succeeds at a DC 15 Will save. This is a mind-affecting
      effect.
  - name: Misfortune Hex (Su)
    description: >-
      This hex causes a creature to suffer grave misfortune for 1 round.
      Whenever the target makes an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or
      skill check during this time, it must roll twice and take the worse
      result. A DC 15 Will save negates this effect. A creature may only be
      targeted by this hex once per day.
Description:
  - >-
    The hideous penanggalen is one of the most horrific vampiric monstrosities.
    By day, a penanggalen appears to be a normal humanoid, but at night or when
    provoked, the creature's head rips free from the rest of her body, coils of
    viscera and entrails dangling from her throat as she launches into the air,
    seeking blood to sate her unholy thirst.
  - >-
    Unlike most undead, the penanggalen is more akin to the lich in that she
    willfully abandons both her mortality and morality to become a hideous
    undead monster. While penanggalens are traditionally female spellcasters,
    any creature capable of performing the vile ritual of transformation can
    become one.
  - >-
    Similar to a lich, a creature works toward becoming a penanggalen. More than
    one such transformation ritual exists, but all require heinous acts that
    symbolize the casting aside of kindness, benevolence, and any semblance of
    feelings other than cruelty. Many of these rituals call for the repeated
    consumption of blood, bile, tears, and other fluids drawn from captured and
    tortured innocents.
  - >-
    A penanggalen keeps a vat of vinegar in her lair. When returning from a
    night of feeding, a penanggalen's organs are swollen with blood. In order to
    fit back into her body, the penanggalen must soak for 1 hour in this vat of
    vinegar. Once reduced, a penanggalen slides back into her body. If a
    penanggalen is slain away from her body, the body rapidly deteriorates into
    foul-smelling grit.
  - >-
    The penanggalen presented above was a witch in life. The witch class is
    presented in full in the Advanced Player's Guide.
  - CREATING A PENANGGALEN
  - >-
    "Penanggalen" is an acquired template that can be added to any living
    creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base
    creature). Most penanggalens were once humanoids or monstrous humanoids and
    nearly every penanggalen is female. A penanggalen uses the base creature's
    stats and abilities except as noted here.
  - 'CR: Same as base creature +1.'
  - 'Alignment: Any evil.'
  - >-
    Type: The creature's type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate
    class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.
  - 'Senses: A penanggalen gains darkvision 60 ft.'
  - 'Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +6.'
  - >-
    Hit Dice: Change the base creature's racial HD to d8s. All HD derived from
    class levels remain unchanged. As undead, a penanggalen uses her Charisma
    modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: A penanggalen gains channel resistance +4, DR 5/silver
    and slashing, resistance to cold 10 and fire 10, and all of the defensive
    abilities granted by the undead type. A penanggalen also gains fast healing
    5.
  - >-
    Weaknesses: A penanggalen gains light sensitivity. In addition, a
    penanggalen is staggered while outside of her human body and exposed to
    direct sunlight.
  - >-
    Speed: When a penanggalen is attached to her body, she retains the same base
    speed as the base creature. When a penanggalen is separated from her body,
    she has only a fly speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability.
  - >-
    Melee: A penanggalen gains a bite attack and a slam attack when she is
    detached from her body. Damage is standard for attacks of these types for
    the penanggalen's size. Both natural attacks are treated as magic for the
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
  - >-
    Special Attacks: A penanggalen retains all of the base creature's special
    attacks. She also gains the following additional special attacks. Save DCs
    are equal to 10 + 1/2 the penanggalen's HD + the penanggalen's Charisma
    modifier unless otherwise noted.
  - >-
    Blood Drain (Su): A penanggalen's blood drain special attack causes 1d4
    Constitution damage.
  - >-
    Create Spawn (Su): When a penanggalen slays a female humanoid via blood
    drain, and if that slain humanoid had at least 10 Hit Dice in life, that
    slain humanoid rises as a manananggal at the next sunset. This manananggal
    is under the command of the penanggalen who created it, and remains enslaved
    until that penanggalen's destruction. A penanggalen may have enslaved spawn
    totalling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that
    would exceed this limit become free-willed undead.
  - >-
    Disease (Su): Any creature a penanggalen bites is exposed to filth fever-the
    save DC against this disease is set by the penanggalen, not the disease
    itself.
  - >-
    Wither (Su): A penanggalen's entrails drip with a foul bile that blisters
    and weakens living flesh. Any creature that is damaged by a penanggalen's
    slam attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 Dexterity and 1d4
    Charisma damage.
  - >-
    Ability Scores: Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an undead
    creature, a penanggalen has no Constitution score.
  - >-
    Skills: A penanggalen gains a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Fly, Knowledge
    (arcana), Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks.
  - 'Special Qualities: A penanggalen gains the following special quality.'
  - >-
    Separate (Su): During the day, a penanggalen has the same appearance as she
    did in life, and does not detect as undead (though she is still an undead
    creature). At night, she can detach her head and entrails as a full-round
    action. Her physical but now hollow body exists as dead flesh, but can be
    destroyed if it suffers damage equal to the penanggalen's normal hit point
    total. Before a penanggalen can return to her body, she must soak her
    entrails in vinegar for 1 hour-she can then reattach to her body, at which
    point any damage done to the body immediately heals (although damage the
    penanggalen herself suffered remains). A penanggalen whose body is destroyed
    can never again walk the day in living form, but is otherwise unharmed (save
    for no longer having a safe way to travel in direct sunlight). When a
    penanggalen wears her body, she cannot use her natural attacks, her fly
    speed, or any of her special penanggalen attacks.
