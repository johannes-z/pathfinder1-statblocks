  - name: Bardic Performance (Su)
    description: A dapsara has the bardic performance ability of a 5th-level bard.
  - name: Ghostly Arms (Su)
    description: >-
      A dapsara's two spectral arms may manipulate corporeal or incorporeal
      creatures and objects, as if they had the ghost touch weapon property. She
      may manifest or hide these arms at will in any shape, even in gaseous
      form.
  - name: Versatile Performance (Su)
    description: >-
      A dapsara has the bard's versatile performance ability, using one Perform
      bonus in place of the skill bonuses of that Perform skill's associated
      skills.
  - name: Weapon Proficiencies (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dapsara is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the glaive,
      longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip.
Description:
  - >-
    A dapsara is a physical representative of beauty and grace. Each studies one
    type of music, dance, poetry, or singing, and together they create elaborate
    performances for Shelyn and the other inhabitants of Nirvana. Some come to
    the Material Plane to be muses for mortals and still others protect sacred
    theaters and places of great natural beauty. They prefer to remain hidden,
    either in gaseous form, invisibly, or both, so they can advise and watch
    over the mortal world on behalf of the goddess.
  - >-
    A dapsara in her natural form looks like a beautiful humanoid woman (usually
    an elf or human), sometimes with an unusual skin color such as jade green or
    sky blue, but she can take the shape of any humanoid or any gender. She
    typically uses her second pair of arms to play musical instrument or assist
    some other type of performance, such as holding a sheet of lyrics for a song
    or manipulating a cloak or dress to look like wings or flowing wind. A
    dapsara is a mediocre flier and normally only uses her flight to augment a
    performance or to garner attention. A dapsara can use many kinds of weapons,
    but prefers to use magic to confound and defeat opponents; in a pinch, she
    can attack with all four arms.
  - >-
    Although these servitors of Shelyn respect and revere art is all of its
    forms, they especially delight in performance art, song, dance, and other
    arts of the moment.
  - >-
    They delight in the intimacy of sharing beauty with a limited group and
    knowing that a single masterful performance will never be reproduced in
    exactly the same way. They will also go far to help servants of Shelyn
    recover lost works of art, so long as they get to attend the eventual
    exhibition.
