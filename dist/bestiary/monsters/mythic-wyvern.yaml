      Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is

  - name: Power Lift (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mythic wyvern can expend one use of mythic power to withdraw as a move
      action (instead of a full-round action), moving up to its speed instead of
      double. It can even move straight up. If it's grappling a creature, the
      wyvern can bring the grappled creature with it. Usually a wyvern uses this
      ability to carry off its prey and drop it from above onto a hard surface.
      Since this is a move action, the wyvern can damage its target, withdraw,
      and drop its target all in the same round.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic wyvern has one or more true dragons in its recent ancestry, making
    it strong and resilient. Despite its greater power and ego, it is more
    inclined to accept a rider than other wyverns, perhaps because it recognizes
    the value of an alliance.
  - Variant Mythic Wyverns
  - >-
    Some mythic wyverns are closely related to one specific type of chromatic
    dragon. These lose their energy resistances and the power lift ability, but
    gain the energy immunity and breath weapon of the appropriate chromatic
    dragon (80 foot line or 40 foot cone, DC 17, 8d6 energy damage, 1d4 rounds).
