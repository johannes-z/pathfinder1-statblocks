  This many-branched and twisted tree has few leaves on it. In the center of its
  trunk is a long, deep scar. Its roots are twisted and dark, blackened as if by
  fire.

Description:
  - >-
    Scythe trees are malevolent plant creatures found in heavily forested areas
    where they naturally blend in with normal trees. Scythe trees are
    carnivorous by nature and draw very little sustenance from sun, air, or
    water, preferring a diet of dryad or elf flesh.
  - >-
    A scythe tree, on average, is 20 feet tall, but may reach or exceed heights
    of 30 feet. It weighs about 3,500 pounds and has a trunk diameter of 3 feet.
    Its bark is dark brown, shading darker as it nears the roots. What few
    leaves a scythe tree has are reddish-brown (and do not change color or fall
    out as the seasons change).
  - >-
    The branches of a scythe tree resemble wicked-curving scythes (this is where
    the tree gets its name). The scar that appears on the trunk is the tree's
    mouth (it appears as a scar when closed). Scythe trees hate treants and
    dryads and attack both on sight (though a scythe tree usually only confronts
    a treant when it outnumbers it).
  - >-
    A scythe tree stands motionless, appearing to be a tree of normal sort,
    until prey comes within range. It then slashes with its scythe-like limbs
    attempting to cut its foe to pieces.
