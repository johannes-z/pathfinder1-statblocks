Description:
  - >-
    These large land animals, majestically wandering the plains in tightly knit
    family herds, are symbols of wisdom and strength. Having few natural
    predators, elephants are sometimes hunted for their ivory tusks. These tusks
    often become jewelry, statuettes, and trinkets for the wealthy.
