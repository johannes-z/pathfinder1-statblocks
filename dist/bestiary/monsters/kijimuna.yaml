Description_Visual: >-
  At first glance, this creature appears to be a mischievously smiling young
  child with bright red hair clad only in a grass skirt. A closer look reveals
  goblinoid ears and a mouth full of pointed teeth.

  - name: Steal Fire (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a kijimuna can call out to a nonmagical fire within
      30 feet equivalent in size to the flames of a burning torch. Doing so
      causes the flame to become a light similar to that created by a dancing
      lights spell, under the control of the kijimuna. An attended object can
      make a DC 13 Reflex saving throw to avoid this effect. Unlike a dancing
      lights spell, a kijimuna's steal fire ability can cause a stolen fire to
      strike a creature, either ringing the target in light as per the spell
      faerie fire for 5 minutes, or dealing 2d6 points of fire damage (DC 13
      Reflex, half ). Both save DCs are Charisma-based. A lantern, candle,
      torch, or similar item that has its flame stolen cannot be relit by any
      means for 24 hours.
Description:
  - >-
    The childlike kijimunas bear physical similarities to their Inner Sea
    cousins, the goblins, sharing their small size, leathery skin, and large,
    pointed ears. However, kijimunas' hair stands out as their most prominent
    features-long, wild manes of blazing red. These tricky creatures nearly
    always wear devilish grins, causing some who first see them to mistake them
    for trouble-making urchins.
  - >-
    Kijimunas take pleasure in two pastimes: fishing and playing pranks. When a
    kijimuna grows distracted from its catch, it seeks out targets for its
    practical jokes. These hijinks often prove relatively harmless, but some
    escalate to the point of becoming injurious or potentially lethal. Most
    kijimunas genuinely do not understand how their "play" frustrates, harms, or
    otherwise impacts the targets of their tricks and are insulted when victims
    become angry rather than seeing the comedy of the situation. The insulted
    kijimunas then take retribution the only way they know how: with more
    elaborate pranks.
  - >-
    A kijimuna stands only about 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 50 pounds.
    Its size belies its sinewy strength, gained from years of fishing and
    climbing tall banyan trees.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Consummate fishermen, kijimunas while away the hours fishing on the shores
    of oceans or large lakes. Although they delight in the taste of
    fish-especially the eyes- they easily grow bored and become distracted,
    sometimes leaving their fishing spears and a pile of fish to rot onshore.
    The creatures alleviate their boredom by playing tricks on fishermen and
    villagers living near their cavern or treetop homes. A kijimuna makes every
    effort to hide its involvement in the tricks it pulls, more out of a sense
    of pride about a well-executed joke than fear of reprisal.
  - >-
    A young kijimuna grows to adulthood in a matter of 5 months, but retains its
    childish appearance for the entirety of its life. In the unlikely event that
    its activities don't cause its premature demise, the creature lives for
    about 15 years. An elderly kijimuna, having reached the ripe old age of 12,
    settles down and does little else beyond fish in solitude, except perhaps to
    bargain with children from nearby villages for its catch. It extracts a
    promise from a child in return for the fish, as well instructions for a
    devious prank or practical joke to pull on an elder.
  - >-
    Although their societies and world view differ wildly from those of the
    goblins of the Inner Sea Region and elsewhere in Golarion, physiologically
    kijimuna are little different. As true goblinoids, any sort of device,
    concoction, or magical effect that only affects goblins affects these
    erratic tricksters as well.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Tribes of kijimunas maintain small lairs in seaside caves, amid groves of
    banyan trees, or in other secluded, enclosed areas near the shore. Their
    homes typically stink of rotten fish from catches brought home and promptly
    forgotten, while the walls often bear half-completed diagrams of pranks
    members intend to pull on neighboring creatures. Kijimunas rarely pull
    pranks on each other, mostly because they hold their peoples'
  - >-
    cleverness in high regard, and believe that it's impossible to trick their
    own kind. Occasionally, however, some event leaves a kijimuna the victim of
    some accidental hilarity- well-placed meal scraps left on its face, tripping
    into a tide pool, falling down-such occurrences are the height of kijimuna
    comedy.
  - >-
    Much like their Inner Sea cousins, kijimunas have a strong, bizarre hatred
    for a particular creature-in this case, the octopus. When faced with
    octopuses, kijimunas either flee in terror or desperately attack, their
    whoops and howls vastly exaggerating the threat the cephalopods pose.
    Kijimunas often share frightening stories about octopuses at night, scaring
    one another with fearful tales of squirming tentacles and clutching suckers.
    Occasionally these stories incite groups to action, leading them to go on
    raids of local tide pools and rocky beaches where the sea creatures
    regularly lurk. The resulting battles prove loud but brief, with skewered
    octopuses and the occasional "hostage" taken as supplies for the goblinoids'
    most startling jokes.
  - >-
    Kijimunas have few strong feelings about other animals, especially as
    predators more dangerous than large lizards and the occasional hunting cat
    rarely occupy the same lands that they do. They delight in sharing their
    homes with large tropical birds, however, a sentiment that is hardly
    reciprocated, as they frequently employ the creatures (and the creatures'
    eggs) in their pranks and take endless delight in mimicking the birds'
    squawking. Spiders, with their numerous legs, are generally avoided by
    kijimuna, many of which suspect the insects might be just miniature
    octopuses in disguise.
  - >-
    Kijimunas share goblins' affinity for fire, but this attraction manifests in
    a less overtly destructive way. These creatures have developed secret
    techniques allowing them to befriend small fires, calling such flames to
    them to light their paths, lead travelers into their pranks, or steal a
    lantern's ability to hold a light. No kijimunas remember how their people
    managed to make friends with small fires, just that they did a long time
    ago. Large fires remain dangerous to kijimunas, however, and not only do
    they have no power over such blazes, but they generally have nothing
    pleasant to say about any flame larger than a campfire.
  - >-
    Kijimunas often form relationships with other humanoids who fish along the
    same shore. Some befriend such creatures, eagerly sharing all manner of
    trivial secrets-where the best fishing spots are, what trees grow the
    stinkiest fruit, and which rocks octopuses hardly ever visit. As a show of
    friendship, kijimunas make their companions favored targets for particularly
    embarrassing practical jokes.
  - >-
    Those of a superstitious bent view kijimunas as evil spirits, pointing to
    the ghostly flames that often follow
  - >-
    the creatures and their mischievous behavior as proof. Once in a while,
    someone discovers kijimunas' hatred for octopuses and carries one around as
    a ward. This typically backfires spectacularly, as the kijimunas then focus
    their ire on the person-who is obviously some sort of octopus spy or ally.
    Kijimunas reserve their most elaborate tricks for cephalopod sympathizers.
  - >-
    The only counter to most humanoids' distrust and wariness regarding
    kijimunas manifests in times of famine or poor fishing seasons. In numerous
    such cases, a town on the brink of starvation has found its food stores
    replenished on a daily basis by an energized tribe of kijimunas, as these
    creatures apply their considerable fishing talents to feed their neighbors.
    After all, kijimunas realize that corpses are considerably less entertaining
    than living creatures, especially when serving as the butts of jokes. Thus,
    most communities accept that if their benefactors happen to play a trick or
    two on them, matters could be far worse.
