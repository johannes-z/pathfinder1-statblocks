Description:
  - >-
    Bison are large herd animals. They can grow as long as 12 feet and as tall
    as 7 feet at the shoulder. Average bison weigh 2,200 pounds. The bison's
    statistics can be used for almost any larger herd animal, such as the
    buffalo. Bison frighten far less easily than their domesticated cousins and
    are much more aggressive when protecting the herd or their young. Adult
    bulls are extremely confontational in mating season, and even kill one
    another in pursuit of particular females. After mating season, herds of
    bison tend to separate into smaller herds in preparation for the arrival of
    new calves. Bison companions are identical to aurochs animal companions.
