Description_Visual: >-
  These hideous masses of floating flesh appear to be covered with staring eyes
  and hungry mouths. The lesser gibbering orb is a pulsing mass of sickly
  greyish-green flesh, roughly 8 ft. in diameter. The orb seems to fly in starts
  and fits, but this is a ruse, for the creature is nimble for its bulk. It may
  be a distant cousin to the eye of the deep or similarly-orbed entities.

Description:
  - >-
    The lesser gibbering orb is either a smaller or younger version of the
    gibbering orb, or so similar it makes no difference for naming purposes.
    These odd beasts are not quite the force of nature their larger brethren
    are, but they are every bit as chaotic and hungry as the larger version.
    These creatures are very distinct, and no two lesser gibbering orbs
    encountered are the same, if the encounter is survived at all!
  - >-
    The gibbering orb has the ability to bite its foes by extending a pseudopod
    with one of its mouths protruding from the end. The orb can extend two of
    these at any one foe, or a total of six in any given round. At the same
    time, the legions of eyes have the ability to cast a host of spells at a
    rapid rate.
  - >-
    Like their larger kin, lesser gibbering orbs speak any language, and
    constantly babble and gurgle unintelligible gibberish to confuse and
    disorient their foes.
