Description:
  - >-
    Ommoth are diurnal hunters that dine on giant insects and rodents; and the
    occasional adventurer that wanders too close to their nest. Hunting bands
    consist of both male and female ommoth with the strongest male being the
    leader of the pack. Favored prey of an ommoth includes large game,
    humanoids, and the occasional giant scorpion. Prey is always killed and
    carried back to the lair to be devoured or fed to the young. Young ommoth
    remain in the lair for three to six months generally, before dispersing into
    the world. A typical ommoth can live up to 30 years.
  - >-
    An ommoth lair is an underground burrow, either of their devising or an
    existing and abandoned burrow created by some other burrowing creatures. An
    existing burrow is often reconfigured to consist of a single long passageway
    that empties into a large main chamber. Here in the main chamber is the
    ommoth's nest. Any other passageways and chambers are sealed off by the
    ommoth with dirt, rocks, debris, and anything else it can find.
  - >-
    An ommoth is highly aggressive and attacks any creature that wanders into
    its territory. If cornered or threatened, it responds by rearing its claws
    and poising its tail overhead. Creatures that continue to harass the ommoth
    are met with a series of tail stings and claw attacks. An ommoth flees if
    confronted by a superior opponent, but if the nest is threatened, it fights
    to the death.
  - >-
    An ommoth appears as a twelve foot long giant scorpion with four large
    claws, two long tails that each end in a wicked stinger, and a carapace of
    reddish-brown or black. It has one set of eyes on the front of its head and
    two other pairs just behind those on the sides of its head. The creature has
    two sets of serrated mandibles that help in rending its food. Its forelegs
    are slightly longer and thinner than its others legs and it uses these to
    detect prey and explore its surroundings. Some species have white or tan
    markings on their undersides or white bands on their forelegs.
