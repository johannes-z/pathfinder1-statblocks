Description:
  - >-
    Cave trolls are smaller cousins of the normal troll and are found in all
    types of subterranean realms. They are as deadly, or more so, than their
    larger brethren. Cave trolls have the same voracious appetite of the normal
    troll and sustain themselves on whatever they can find in their Underdark
    realms. They rarely venture to the surface world, preferring the security
    and tranquility of the darkness they inhabit. If extremely hungry or if food
    is scarce, however, a cave troll ventures to the surface and attacks
    whatever it finds near its lair. Cave trolls stand 6 feet tall and weigh 300
    pounds. Cave trolls do not walk with the same hunched gait of their larger
    relatives. They stand upright and move with blinding speed. Cave trolls
    often use deception when they first encounter prey, especially intelligent
    prey. Their troll heritage often leads to the misconception that they are
    slow in combat, which they gladly allow their opponents to believe - until
    the cave troll strikes or moves. Only then is the ruse negated and the true
    nature of the troll revealed. Cave trolls attack by grabbing and rending an
    opponent. Cave Troll Characters Cave troll characters possess the following
    racial traits. +4 Strength, +12 Dexterity, +10 Constitution, -4 Intelligence
