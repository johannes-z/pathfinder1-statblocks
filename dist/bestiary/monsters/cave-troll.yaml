Group: Troll

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Haste (Su)
    description: >-
      A cave troll is affected by a permanent haste spell (caster level 8th).
      This grants the cave troll a +1 bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 dodge
      bonus to AC and Reflex saves (both already figured into the stat block
      above). Any condition that makes the cave troll lose its Dexterity bonus
      to AC also makes it lose its dodge bonus. This is an inherent bonus and
      cannot be dispelled or negated. When making a full attack action, a cave
      troll can make one extra attack with any weapon it is holding or one extra
      claw attack (if using natural weapons). The extra attack is at the cave
      troll's full attack bonus.
  - name: Spider Climb (Su)
    description: >-
      A cave troll can climb sheer surfaces as though by a spider climb spell
      (caster level 4th). This ability is always active, but can be negated or
      dispelled. The cave troll can restart it again on its next turn as a free
      action.
Description:
  - >-
    Cave trolls are smaller cousins of the normal troll and are found in all
    types of subterranean realms. They are as deadly, or more so, than their
    larger brethren. Cave trolls have the same voracious appetite of the normal
    troll and sustain themselves on whatever they can find in their Underdark
    realms. They rarely venture to the surface world, preferring the security
    and tranquility of the darkness they inhabit. If extremely hungry or if food
    is scarce, however, a cave troll ventures to the surface and attacks
    whatever it finds near its lair. Cave trolls stand 6 feet tall and weigh 300
    pounds. Cave trolls do not walk with the same hunched gait of their larger
    relatives. They stand upright and move with blinding speed. Cave trolls
    often use deception when they first encounter prey, especially intelligent
    prey. Their troll heritage often leads to the misconception that they are
    slow in combat, which they gladly allow their opponents to believe - until
    the cave troll strikes or moves. Only then is the ruse negated and the true
    nature of the troll revealed. Cave trolls attack by grabbing and rending an
    opponent. Cave Troll Characters Cave troll characters possess the following
    racial traits. +4 Strength, +12 Dexterity, +10 Constitution, -4 Intelligence
    (minimum 3), -2 Wisdom, -4 Charisma. Base speed: A cave troll's base land
    speed is 60 feet. Its permanent spider climb ability gives it a climb speed
    of 20 ft. Darkvision: Cave trolls can see in the dark out to 90 feet.
    Low-light vision: Cave trolls can see twice as far as humans in conditions
    of dim light. Scent: Cave trolls can detect opponents within 30 feet by
    sense of smell. Racial Hit Dice: A cave troll begins with four levels of
    humanoid, which provide 4d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +3, and base
    saving throw bonuses of Fort +4, Ref +1, and Will +1. Racial Skills: A cave
    troll's humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 4 x (2 + Int modifier,
    minimum 1). Racial Feats: A cave troll's humanoid levels give it two feats.
