SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Steam Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a steam hog can emit a cloud of steam from its snout
      in a 10-foot-radius spread. The initial burst of steam deals 2d6 points of
      fire damage to any creature in the area. The cloud remains for 1d4 rounds
      once created, acting as a 10-foot-radius obscuring mist. Any creature that
      begins its turn in the area of the steam must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude
      save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. A steam hog can use its steam
      cloud only once every 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The military advancements of fire giants aren't restricted only to arms and
    armor-just as ore is dredged from the mountains for these giants' cruel
    forges, animals are culled from the wilds to serve as fire giant weaponry.
    In addition to using hell hounds, red dragons, and other fiery fauna for
    their brutal campaigns, fire giants have created several unique species of
    war beasts all their own. Chief among these amalgamations of flesh and steel
    are the malformed swine known as steam hogs-enormous snorting brutes charged
    with heading the front lines of fire giant armies, each one capable of
    laying low an entire platoon of enemy soldiers.
  - >-
    While fire giants are more than capable of crafting new armor for their
    steam hogs, they take great pleasure in bedecking their prized war beasts
    with the reforged arms and armor of their vanquished foes. In this way, the
    armor and accoutrements of a veteran steam hog serve as a record of the
    battles and wars the beast has fought in. When such a steam hog falls in
    battle, its armor-and thus its history-are often kept by sentimental fire
    giant handlers as treasured heirlooms.
  - >-
    Steam hogs average 16 feet long from snout to tail and 8 feet tall at the
    shoulder. They can weigh up to 3 tons, or 4 tons when equipped with
    adamantine scale barding.
