      Every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, a thunder beast can exhale a cloud of
      poisonous gas in a 20- foot cone. Living creatures in the area must
      succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or sickened every round they remain in
      the area and for one round after leaving the area. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. The cloud lasts 1d4 rounds before dispersing. A strong
      wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round.
Description:
  - >-
    Thunder beasts are herd animals that spend their time roaming the
    uncountable layers of the Abyss sustaining themselves on a diet of rotted
    plants, minor demons, and other inconsequential life forms.

    If angry or frightened, a thunder beast bellows with a low, rumbling tone.
    If the object of their concern does not immediately withdraw, they then
    breathe their foul breath and attack with their vicious bite.

    A typical thunder beast is about 20 feet long. It is yellow-brown, ochre, or
