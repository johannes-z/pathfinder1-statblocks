Description_Visual: >-
  A delicate-looking creature floats silently in midair. Resembling a large
  jellyfish, it has a fringe of bird's feathers around its quivering central
  mass and long tentacles trailing from its center, with each tentacle ending in
  a snapping beak. It sings to itself as it flies, each beak making a different
  note in an eerie harmony.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Su)
    description: >-
      Levitation poison: Bite or contact-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency
      1/round for 5 rounds; effect 1 Dexterity damage + levitate (victim rises
      10 feet as per the spell per failed save); cure 2 consecutive saves. Skrik
      nettle poison can be cured by either remove poison or dispel magic, as if
      it were caster level 8th. The effect's CL equals the skrik nettle's Hit
      Dice. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Spill Poison (Su)
    description: >-
      Anytime a skrik nettle is damaged by a slashing or piercing melee weapon,
      it splashes its poison on the opponent who damaged it. That opponent must
      save or be affected by the skrik nettle's poison. Weapons with reach allow
      their wielders to avoid this effect.
Description:
  - >-
    Shoals of skrik nettles float through the skies of the First World. They
    sail like boats, driven before the wind and using their feathers to tack and
    turn. They sing as they fly, jabbering and chirping to each other in complex
    harmonies. The average skrik nettle shoal consists of three dozen or more of
    the majestic creatures, but these flocks are often split up during the
    roaring storms so common to the First World. Lone skrik nettles may be
    encountered in smaller numbers, confused and trying to find their way back
    to their kin. Skrik nettles range in size from a few inches across (for a
    newly spawned hatchling) to the size of gigantic, scintillating clouds.
    Most, however, are no more than 8 or 9 feet across. Ecology Skrik nettles
    are primarily scavengers, although they will attack suitable prey when
    hungry. Their method of attack is curious. The sharp beaks of a skrik nettle
    drip with a magical poison that is injected when the creature bites a foe.
    The victim of the poison feels slightly nauseous and light-headed at
    first-and then begins to float off the ground. As long as the poison pumps
    through the veins of the skrik nettle's victim, the victim keeps floating up
    into the sky. The victim has no control over this magical levitation-unless
    she has some other method of controlling her flight, such as wings or magic,
    or she can grab a convenient tree branch, she will keep ascending until the
    poison wears off and gravity takes hold once more. The skrik nettles usually
    float up alongside their prey, keeping it floating by injecting more poison
    as soon as it starts to drop. Especially dangerous or hardshelled prey might
    be poisoned, allowed to rise, and then dropped repeatedly from a height
    until dead. The poison's effects seem to be rooted in magic, rather than
    venom, and dispelling the ailment has proven to be just as effective as
    bleeding a victim. Before aiding a victim, however, one must take caution to
    tie said creature down securely, as there are few deaths more ironic than
    being cured of a skrik nettle's poison only to instantly plunge to earth
    from a great height. Oddly, in addition to traditional remedies, killing a
    skrik nettle also instantly cancels the effects of its poison. Once every
    year, skrik nettles return to their shoal's spawning grounds to reproduce.
    The jellyfish-like creatures form hard, rugged eggs inside their bodies,
    then float gently down to the spawning ground-usually a jungle clearing or
    warm swamp-and dig nests with their tentacles. Skrik nettles are
    hermaphrodites, so each one lays its eggs and then fertilizes those of its
    neighbor (this cross-breeding strengthens future generations of skrik
    nettles). The average skrik nettle lays three or four eggs, whose size
    ranges from that of a clenched fist to that of a giant's skull. These eggs
    incubate in the warm earth for several days, during which time the skrik
    nettles patrol above the spawning ground, attacking anyone who might disturb
    the eggs. When ready to hatch, the eggs explode out of the ground and shoot
    into the sky, bursting into a swarm of newborn skrik nettles. Unwary
    travelers who slip past the patrolling skrik nettles can trigger a premature
    hatching if they walk over the spawning ground; such travelers may be
    pummeled by flying, rock-hard egg shards, or even carried into the sky by a
    particularly large hatchling. Hatchling skrik nettles are ravenously hungry
    when born. To provide for the needs of their young, skrik nettle shoals
    assemble caches of poisoned meat and float them over the spawning ground. A
    wary explorer can spot a spawning ground from afar if she notices rotting
    corpses hanging overhead. Skrik nettle eggs can often be sold to the fey.
    Some train young skrik nettles as songbirds, teaching all six beaks to sing
    in harmony. Others wrap skrik nettle eggs in cloth filled with golden dust
    or brightly colored pollen; when an egg prepared in such a manner flies into
    the sky and explodes upon hatching, the cloth's contents scatter across the
    sky like a beautiful firework. Such entertainments are popular at
    parties-though the ensuing swarm of carnivorous jellyfish swooping down on
    the guests is considered less enchanting. Habitat & Society Skrik nettles
    dwell amid the clouds, descending only to feed and procreate. They use their
    songs to keep the shoal together, flying toward the chirping music of their
    kin. Bards are often able to lure skrik nettles down to them with their
    enchanting melodies, but once within range, the poisonous creatures usually
    trade this performance for a live meal. Skrik nettles are not especially
    intelligent predators- thus, they eat the bounty of the land, or, if
    particularly lucky, snatch a dead or weak creature from the ground. While
    skittish, they retaliate when attacked, regarding the assault as a chance to
    feed. Settlements in regions where skrik nettle migrations are common
    usually keep a few sacrificial animals handy to lure the skrik nettles away
    during a hunt. The one exception is where the skrik nettle's spawning
    grounds are involved-during the time before a hatching, the skrik nettle
    shoal patrols the area around the spawning grounds and viciously attacks any
    trespassers. Skrik nettles are also a hazard to flyers. They lurk in
    low-hanging clouds, letting their tendrils trail down out of the mist. An
    unwary bird or flying creature can be stung, grabbed, and whisked off to be
    eaten in a matter of seconds. When scavenging, they fly at a low level above
    the landscape, letting their tendrils play over the ground as they search
    for carrion. Skrik nettles themselves have few natural predators. They are
    reputed to taste so light and airy that eating one is like trying to eat a
    soap bubble, albeit a soap bubble with a half-dozen stinging beaks. Skrik
    nettles perceive the world by sensing air currents and shifting vibrations
    through their sensitive tentacles; during storms or strong winds, they
    secure themselves in the forks of large trees and wait out the harsh
    weather. Some fey hunt the skrik nettle shoals in little flying boats for
    sport, bringing them down with weighted nets or leaden harpoons. A few fey
    even try riding skrik nettles, "docking" them to make them harmless by
    clamping their beaks shut and then hanging a saddle from the tentacles, but
    the creatures are too weak to make good steeds. It is also the fashion in
    some regions for noble faerie-maidens to be accompanied by a small flock of
    "docked" skrik nettles, each one bearing a fan, mirror, or basket of fruit
    in its tentacles. Others capture skrik nettles and train them to speak-the
    skrik nettles are not intelligent, but they can be taught to imitate the
    speech of the First World, much like parrots can learn to imitate human
    tongues. A trained skrik nettle can even hold conversations with itself,
    with each of its half-dozen tentacles imitating a different voice.
