Description:
  - >-
    Zombie lords are the fleshy counterparts of skeletal champions-intelligent,
    cunning, and envious of creatures whose bodies aren't rotting away. Despite
    their decaying flesh, they are not slow like common zombies, and can easily
    pursue fleeing prey. Zombie lords are more powerful than common zombies and
    retain their class levels.
  - >-
    CREATING A ZOMBIE LORD "Zombie lord" is an acquired template that can be
    added to any corporeal creature (other than undead) that has a minimum
    Intelligence of 3. This corporeal creature is referred to hereafter as the
    base creature.
  - >-
    CR: A zombie lord's CR is 1 higher than that of a normal zombie with the
    same Hit Dice, plus the normal CR increase for class levels (if any).
  - >-
    Type: The creature's type becomes undead. It keeps subtypes except for
    alignment subtypes and subtypes that indicate kind.
  - 'Alignment: Any evil.'
  - 'Armor Class: Natural armor as per zombie (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 288).'
  - >-
    Hit Dice: Change all of the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s, then add 2
    racial Hit Dice to this total (creatures without racial HD gain 2 undead
    HD). Hit Dice from class levels are unchanged.
  - >-
    Saving Throws: Base save bonuses for racial Hit Dice are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref
    +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD + 2.
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: A zombie lord gains DR 5/slashing and channel
    resistance +4, in addition to undead traits.
  - 'Speed: As zombie (Bestiary 288).'
  - 'Attacks: As zombie (Bestiary 289).'
  - 'Abilities: Str +2, Dex +2. As an undead, it has no Constitution score.'
  - 'BAB: A zombie lord''s BAB for its racial HD is equal to 3/4 its HD.'
  - >-
    Skills: A zombie lord gains skill ranks per racial Hit Die equal to 4 + its
    Int modifier (class skills as the undead type). Skills gained from class
    levels remain unchanged.
  - 'Feats: A zombie lord gains Toughness as a bonus feat.'
  - >-
    Special Qualities: Unlike a common zombie, a zombie lord does not gain the
    staggered special quality.
