SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Madness (Ex)
    description: >-
      Derros use their Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of their Wisdom
      modifier, and are immune to insanity and confusion effects. Only a miracle
      or wish can remove a derro's madness. If this occurs, the derro gains 6
      points of Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma.
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      Derros are not at risk of poisoning themselves when handling poison. They
      use Medium spider venom to poison their crossbow bolts, and generally
      carry 10 prepoisoned bolts at all times.
  - name: Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex)
    description: >-
      A derro takes 1 point of Con damage after every hour it is exposed to
      sunlight.
Description:
  - >-
    Though derros dwell deep under most of the surface world's cities, very few
    know of the sadistic creatures' existence. Descended from mysterious fey
    that once dwelt deep underground, the derros lust for the comforts of the
    surface, yet the light of the sun causes them to blister, burn, and die.
    Derros often abduct surface dwellers to perform hideous experiments on them
    in their neverending quest to divine what protects those who dwell above
    from the burning death, yet the intrinsic madness that plagues all derros
    dooms these experiments to failure every time. In the end, traumatized
    victims are returned to their homes, memories not quite completely wiped of
    their ordeal, to live the rest of their lives in vague fear of a nightmare
    they can't quite recall. A typical derro fights with a short sword or a
    repeating light crossbow with plenty of poison bolts. Some derros also carry
    an aklys-a hooked throwing club attached to a 20-footlong cord. This cord
    limits the club's range, but allows the derro to retrieve it as a
    moveequivalent action after it has been thrown. Derro leaders are typically
    sorcerers of at least 3rd level, although they also make excellent rogues.
    Many derros wield strange and unusual weapons like hooked polearms, eerie
    whistling aklyses, long hollow spears that can be filled with toxins, or
    crystalline throwing wedges that shatter on impact to create horrif ic
    bleeding wounds. A derro stands 3 feet tall and weighs 70 pounds.
