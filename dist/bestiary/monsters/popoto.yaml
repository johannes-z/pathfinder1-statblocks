Description:
  - >-
    Popotos are the smallest breed of dolphin, and generally swim in shallow
    waters near shorelines. They are social hunters, traveling in small groups
    called pods, which normally contain three to five popotos. Like larger
    dolphins, popotos are popular with seafarers, who consider the creatures
    good luck and tell tales of popotos leading lost swimmers to shore and pods
    fighting off sharks much larger than themselves.
