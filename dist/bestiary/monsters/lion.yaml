Description:
  - >-
    Male lions are 5 to 8 feet long and weigh 330 to 550 pounds. Females are
    slightly smaller but use the same statistics. Lions are usually the top
    animal predators in their territories, though they resort to scavenging if
    convenient or necessary. They may kill other predators (such as leopards and
    hyenas) that encroach upon their haunts, but rarely eat these kills unless
    game is scarce. Most lions do not selectively hunt humanoids, but
    occasionally one learns what easy kills they are and becomes a man-eater.
    Lions prefer plains but can adapt to living in shallow caves as long as
    there's a large and stable supply of prey to keep them fed.
