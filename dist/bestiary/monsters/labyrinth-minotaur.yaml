SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bronze Mask (Su)
    description: >-
      A labyrinth minotaur draws agility and ferocity from its bronze mask. When
      it makes a full-attack action, a labyrinth minotaur wearing its bronze
      mask can give up its regular attacks and instead make one gore attack or
      bull rush against each opponent within reach. It must make a separate
      attack roll against each opponent, and it can't choose to move with
      targets that are pushed back. A labyrinth minotaur's bronze mask has 40
      hit points, hardness 20, and a break DC of 40. If a labyrinth minotaur's
      bronze mask is stolen or destroyed, it can create a replacement with 1
      week of work.
  - name: Natural Cunning (Ex)
    description: >-
      Like a normal minotaur, a labyrinth minotaur possesses innate cunning and
      logical ability, granting it immunity to maze spells and preventing it
      from ever becoming lost. Further, a labyrinth minotaur is never caught
      flat-footed. Steel-Shod
  - name: Hooves (Ex)
    description: >-
      A labyrinth minotaur's steel-shod hooves are particularly devastating when
      used to trample an opponent. A creature that takes full damage from a
      labyrinth minotaur's trample ability (because the creature either failed
      its Reflex save or chose to take an attack of opportunity instead of
      attempting a Reflex save) is knocked prone and is staggered for 1d4
      rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC equal to that of the labyrinth
      minotaur's trample ability) reduces the duration of the staggered
      condition to 1 round.
Description:
  - >-
    Labyrinth minotaurs are the elite guards and favored servitors of Baphomet.
    They are thicker and taller than mortal minotaurs, and possess skill in
    metalcraft that they use to forge armor, weapons, and their personalized and
    iconic bronze masks. Labyrinth minotaurs eagerly charge intruders, trampling
    smaller opponents and knocking back larger foes. As they are perceptive,
    tireless, and incapable of becoming lost, labyrinth minotaurs make excellent
    guardians of Baphomet's bewildering maze of a domain, the Ivory Labyrinth.
    Labyrinth minotaurs stand about 11 feet tall and weigh 1,200 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Labyrinth minotaurs resemble their mortal counterparts, as each has the form
    of a massive, burly humanoid with thick fur on the chest and legs and a
    horned, bovine head. The hairless skin of a labyrinth minotaur's head is
    thin and stretched so tightly over the bone that the beast appears to have
    just a skull atop its neck. This tight skin makes the creature's sharp eyes
    bulge from their sockets.
  - >-
    Unlike mortal minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs have no need to eat or sleep
    and consider the need for either activity a weakness. Labyrinth minotaurs
    don't age as mortal creatures do; over the centuries of their existence as
    guardians and enforcers, they instead accumulate masses of battle scars,
    which they wear with arrogant pride.
  - >-
    Labyrinth minotaurs speak little, but make a lot of noise. They breathe in
    great snorts, bang their weapons against their armor, and stomp their
    steel-shod hooves on the ground as they walk. Labyrinth minotaurs seethe
    with anger and energy, constantly moving about and shifting from hoof to
    hoof when required to stand in place for more than a few minutes. A
    labyrinth minotaur prefers to range throughout the narrow, turning corridors
    of its maze-like hunting grounds, even into dead ends and back, searching
    for hints of intruders upon which it can vent its bestial fury.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    The first minotaurs were created by Lamashtu, and the first and greatest of
    these creations was none other than Baphomet. These minotaurs came into
    existence on Golarion in the vast mazes beneath Iblydos. After becoming a
    demon lord, Baphomet collected the souls of these primal minotaurs and
    forged them into the labyrinth minotaurs, paragons of their kind and
    Baphomet's favored servants. The labyrinth minotaurs constantly patrol the
    twisting pathways of the Ivory Labyrinth to enforce Baphomet's will on
    lesser denizens of the domain (such as mortal minotaurs and cultists) and to
    challenge intruders.
  - >-
    Labyrinth minotaurs are as bestial as their mortal kin and prone to
    outbursts of violent rage, but their high status in Baphomet's service makes
    them haughty and given to boasting. They feel contemptuous disdain for all
    mortal creatures but are particularly derisive of mortal creatures lost or
    confounded by mazes. Like mortal minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs are
    perfectly at home in mazes of any kind and are incapable of becoming lost.
    This affinity for mazes applies to their thinking as well-despite their
    brutish demeanors, labyrinth minotaurs are good with puzzles and are keen
    tactical thinkers. When labyrinth minotaurs meet in peace, they sometimes
    exchange inscrutable riddles or short descriptive puzzles (such as, "How
    would you drink a drop of blood inside a severed eyeball while it's in an
    iron coffer sunk to the bottom of a well without getting wet or being seen
    by the eye?").
  - >-
    Labyrinth minotaurs prefer gear and armor made of bronze and steel, as few
    other materials are sufficiently sturdy for them to use over a long period
    of time. In addition to their steel shoes, heavy armor, and massive
    greataxes, all labyrinth minotaurs wear heavy bronze masks. Each labyrinth
    minotaur makes its own mask, and some spend weeks or even months obsessively
    shaping and reshaping the bronze over hot forges. At first glance, each of
    these bronze masks might seem superficially similar, but upon closer
    inspection a viewer can clearly see the subtle embellishments built in by
    the individual labyrinth minotaur. These flourishes communicate the
    minotaur's status and history to other servants of Baphomet. A labyrinth
    minotaur often adds an embellishment to its mask when it accomplishes an
    important task on Baphomet's behalf or kills a particularly powerful
    intruder. A labyrinth minotaur's obsession makes its mask more than mere
    ornamentation- each is mystically connected to its mask.
  - >-
    Labyrinth minotaurs prefer to patrol alone or in small gangs. They maintain
    a central communal headquarters that's usually crewed by about six members,
    with the fiercest labyrinth minotaur commanding the others through bullying
    and intimidation. This headquarters is concealed deep within a maze and
    serves as a safe storage area, a locus for discussing strategy, and the site
    of the gang's forge and metalworking tools.
  - >-
    When labyrinth minotaurs meet others of their kind while out patrolling a
    maze, they usually share a short exchange of riddles or boasts.
    Occasionally, labyrinth minotaurs recognize each other as being on opposite
    sides of sprawling, ancient rivalries. In such cases, the first labyrinth
    minotaur to recognize the other as an enemy surges forward with murderous
    fury, hoping to catch its rival off guard. Large congregations of labyrinth
    minotaurs are rare-even when large groups don't engage in these feuds,
    labyrinth minotaurs fall into divisive boasting that frequently erupts into
    bloodshed anyway.
  - >-
    Labyrinth minotaurs are rarely encountered outside of the Ivory Labyrinth,
    and therefore have little interaction with other races beyond visitors to
    their master's realm. Labyrinth minotaurs display grudging respect for
    glabrezu and vilsteth demons and undisguised contempt for mortal minotaurs
    and cultists of Baphomet. Their arrogance precludes true camaraderie with
    anyone other than those of their own kind.
