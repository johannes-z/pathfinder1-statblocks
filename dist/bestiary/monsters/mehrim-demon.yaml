Description:
  - >-
    Mehrims are man-sized goat-like demons that roam the various planes of the
    Abyss, grazing and feeding on the strange abyssal fauna as well as the flesh
    and ichor of fallen demons. While they are good hunters in their own right,
    mehrims are generally scavengers, following other demon hordes and feasting
    on their leftovers. Generally left to their own devices, mehrims play a
    minor role in the politics and machinations that take place within the
    Abyss. They rarely take part in the various wars and battles that rage
    across the abyssal planes.
  - A mehrim stands about 4 feet tall at the shoulders and is about 7 feet long.
  - It weighs about 650 pounds. Its skin is dark and its coat black and oily.
  - >-
    A mehrim charges into battle biting with its diseased bite and slashing with
    its front hooves. Most of the time, a mehrim opens battle with its
    protection from good and darkness spell-like abilities in effect. Against
    good-aligned foes that are susceptible, the mehrim uses its dispel good
    attack.
