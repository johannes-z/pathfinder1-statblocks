SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Group Casting (Sp)
    description: >-
      A group of three or more mimis together can use freezing sphere (DC 18
      half), once per day. Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Lower Temperature (Su)
    description: >-
      A mimi can, as a free action, lower the temperature in a 10- foot radius
      around its body by 20-80 degrees. Creatures in the area that are not
      immune or resistant to cold may take damage as detailed in the Pathfinder
      RPG Corebook (see Cold Hazards).
Description:
  - >-
    Mimis are 1-foot tall mischievous creatures that inhabit cold forests and
    fields and derive pleasure from playing tricks on creatures that wander into
    their icy realm. Mimi tricks are always harmless and include such things as
    throwing snowballs at a creature, creating a patch of ice on the ground and
    watching a creature slip and fall, or turning invisible and sneaking into a
    sleeping creature's camp wherein they put snow or ice in the creature's
    boots, clothes, or backpack.
  - >-
    While frolicsome, mimis are generally good-natured and friendly towards
    those they encounter. They often lend aid to creatures in need, especially
    those that have helped a mimi in the past. Mimis will not lend aid or
    assistance to creatures of a malign nature and tend to avoid such creatures
    if possible. They are on good terms with most other fey creatures, though
    they find brownies to be a little too "stiff" for their liking and buckawns
    to be a bit too gruff.
  - >-
    Druids and rangers can detect the presence of a mimi or group of mimis with
    a successful DC Survival check.
  - >-
    Mimis are non-aggressive creatures and rarely attack, unless potential
    adversaries are inherently evil. They prefer to avoid combat if at all
    possible but if drawn in, they open using their frost fingers. Against more
    powerful opponents, mimis begin combat by blasting their foes with a cone of
    cold.
  - >-
    A persistent foe that wishes to continue the battle against a mimi (after
    being hit with its frost fingers or cone of cold) is subjected to a rapid
    decrease in the surrounding temperature. A mimi lowers the temperature just
    enough to possibly damage an adversary (see cold dangers in the Pathfinder
    Core Rulebook) and maybe force it away; its goal is not to kill it.
  - >-
    Mimis usually turn invisible and flee if they cannot drive their opponents
    away.
