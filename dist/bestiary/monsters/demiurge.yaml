SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Soul Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      A demiurge can damage a creature's soul by moving through a space occupied
      by the creature. This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack
      of opportunity. The target can resist the attack by succeeding on a DC 18
      Will save. If the save fails, the target dies as the shock of unlife
      permeates its soul. If the save succeeds, that creature cannot be affected
      again by the same demiurge's soul touch for one day. This is a death
      effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Transfixing Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature within 30 feet meeting the demiurge's gaze must succeed on a
      DC 18 Will save or be transfixed for one minute as if affected by a hold
      person spell (caster level 10th). An affected creature can attempt a new
      save each round to break the effects.
  - name: Vulnerability to Iron (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cold iron weapon ignores the demiurge's incorporeal state and deals
      normal damage.
Description:
  - >-
    The demiurge is the undead spirit of an evil human returned from the grave
    with a wrathful vengeance against all living creatures that enter its
    domain. The demiurge is very territorial, usually haunting an area of up to
    three square miles from its place of death.
