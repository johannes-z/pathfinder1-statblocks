SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Absorb Electricity (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a rust-risen is damaged by electricity, it takes no damage (as if
      immune). Instead, the rust-risen gains 1 temporary hit point for every 4
      points of damage it would have taken. A rust-risen can only have a number
      of temporary hit points equal to 150% of its hit point total. These
      temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later. If a rust-risen takes more
      than double its normal hit point total in electricity damage from a single
      attack, the creature is destroyed.
  - name: Augmentations (Ex)
    description: >-
      Rust-risen have various pieces of malfunctioning machinery embedded in
      their bodies. Each of these augmentations provides the rust-risen with
      different abilities. A rust-risen has one augmentation plus one additional
      augmentation for every 3 Hit Dice the creature possesses (typically 2 for
      most rust-risen). The rust-risen presented here has the arm drill and
      metal jaw augmentations. See the next page for other augmentations.
  - name: Malfunction (Ex)
    description: >-
      The machinery embedded in a rust-risen functions unpredictably in
      stressful situations. When a rust-risen enters combat, there is a
      cumulative 1% chance each round that it malfunctions. This chance resets
      to 0% 1 minute after combat ends. When a rust-risen malfunctions, it takes
      a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability
      checks for 1d4 minutes.
Description:
  - >-
    Rust-risen lurk n the burned-out husks of ancient space-faring vessels and
    among the grease and blood stained laboratories of mad, technologist
    necromancers. These hideous undead mockeries riddled with the remnants of
    ancient technology-rotting creatures, outfitted with twitching relics of a
    space-faring race, that prey on the living by tearing their victims to
    shreds with gnashing drills, vivisecting scalpels, and flailing
    exsanguination tubes.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Necromancers with a twisted affinity for technology often forgo the usual
    ghoul or
  - >-
    zombie minions for a rust-risen ally. Far from mindless, rust-risen possess
    limited memories of their lives before undeath, though these recollections
    are more like misshapen shadows flickering on the walls of their minds, and
    are often distorted and highly inaccurate.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Rust-risen possess the unnatural hunger for the living shared by other
    undead, but they also maintain a strange obsession with technological
    artifacts. It's not uncommon when breaching a rust-risen lair to find it
    filled with baubles, gizmos, and other technological oddities-even
    schematics which rust-risen cannot make sense of. Rust-risen collect such
    items, which appear to give them some semblance of comfort in their rotting
    horror of an existence. Rust-risen also seek sources of electrical power,
    finding them comforting in the same way a warm bath soothes living flesh. If
    denied access to an electrical power source, rust-risen become sluggish and
    despondent, but spring to activity as soon as they are exposed to
    electricity.
  - >-
    Rust-risen are always bonded to their creator, serving them as loyally as an
    animal companion does its master. They rely on their creator to keep their
    malfunctioning technology from completely breaking down. Over time however,
    their bond grows into obsession; eventually it becomes an uncontrollable
    desire for their master to join them in undeath. Such obsessed rust-risen
    often overpower their necromancer overlords, who awaken to find themselves
    on an operating table, their machine-studded monstrosities hovering busily
    over their extracted viscera.
  - >-
    If a rust-risen's creator is destroyed, the undead becomes despondent and
    lost. It wanders, avoiding civilization and hovering at the fringes of
    communities, preying on stragglers and wallowing in misanthropic misery. At
    the same time, it constantly seeks the aid of anyone who can keep it from
    breaking down. This duality means that the mood of an uncontrolled
    rust-risen is nigh-impossible to predict.
  - >-
    Rust-Risen Augmentations As rust-risen are cobbled together from dead bodies
    augmented with barely-functioning machinery, no two are exactly alike. Some
    technologically minded necromancers with enough raw materials and a
    consistent design plan try to make their rust-risen conform to a template,
    but most packs of rust-risen are motley and violent amalgamations of flesh
    and steel.
  - >-
    A GM can further modify rust-risen in their games with augmentations of
    their own creation, but they should be no more powerful than those described
    below.
  - >-
    Additional Appendage: Some rust-risen are augmented with an additional
    mechanical limb. A rust-risen with this augmentation gains a slam attack
    that deals damage appropriate for its size (1d4 for most rust-risen). This
    arm
  - >-
    can manipulate objects as well as a normal arm, but cannot be used to wield
    a weapon.
  - >-
    Antifreeze: A rust-risen with this augmentation has an embedded series of
    tubes connected to a pump that keeps a chemical flowing through its body,
    preventing ice from forming inside it. The rust-risen gains resistance 5 to
    cold.
  - >-
    Arm Drill: A rust-risen with this augmentation has a deadly, spinning drill
    grafted onto its forearm. The rust-risen can use the drill to make a melee
    attack that deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
  - >-
    Cling Hooks: A rust-risen with this augmentation has barbed hooks grafted
    into its arms and legs. The rust-risen gains a +4 racial bonus on Climb
    checks and a +4 racial bonus on combat maneuvers to grapple opponents.
  - >-
    Cutting Arm: A rust-risen with this augmentation has one of its forearms
    replaced with a functional laser torch. The rust-risen deals 1d10 points of
    fire damage as a touch attack. This damage is not modified further by
    Strength. When the laser torch is used as a tool or as a weapon to sunder,
    damage dealt by it bypasses hardness up to 20 points and isn't halved (as is
    normally the case for energy damage applied to objects) unless the object is
    fire resistant. A laser torch's cutting beam passes through a force field
    and force effect without damaging that field. Invisible objects and
    creatures cannot be harmed by a laser torch.
  - >-
    Eviscerator: A rust-risen with the eviscerator augmentation has a number of
    twisting blades, reciprocating saws, and spinning drills built into its
    chest. The rust-risen deals an additional 1d8 points of damage when
    grappling.
  - >-
    Exsanguination Tubes: A rust-risen with exsanguination tubes can drain blood
    from creatures it has grappled. If the rust-risen establishes or maintains a
    pin, it bleeds the target, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage.
  - >-
    Metal Jaw: A rust-risen with this augmentation has a metal jaw replacing its
    natural one. The rust-risen gains a bite attack that deals damage
    appropriate for its size (1d6 points of damage for most rust-risen).
  - >-
    Multi-tool: A rust-risen with this augmentation has at least one of its
    hands replaced with a variety of tools. The rust-risen gains a +4 competence
    bonus on Disable Device checks and is considered to be trained in that
    skill. The rust-risen also gains a +2 competence bonus on one specific Craft
    skill.
  - >-
    Steel Clad: A rust-risen with this augmentation has sheets of metal riveted
    to is body. The rust-risen gains a +2 natural armor bonus.
  - >-
    Tripod: A rust-risen with this augmentation has an additional mechanical
    leg. The rust-risen gains a +2 bonus to CMD against overrun and trip
    attempts and a +2 bonus on Acrobatics when moving on narrow surfaces or
    uneven ground. The rust-risen isn't considered flat-footed nor does it lose
    its Dexterity bonus to AC when using Acrobatics in this way.
