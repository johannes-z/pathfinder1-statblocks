  What you thought was a section of ordinary stone floor unfurls itself before
  your eyes, assuming a humanoid form about 10 feet tall. The words "You shall
  not pass" echo throughout the area as the creature advances.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    description: >-
      While flattened, a flagstone golem is nearly indistinguishable from the
      surrounding floor. It takes a DC 25 Perception check to notice a flattened
      flagstone golem for what it is. Dwarves get a +2 bonus on Perception
      checks to notice a flattened flagstone golem.
  - name: Energy Absorption (Su)
    description: >-
      Any energy-based (acid, fire, cold, electricity, sonic) attack that
      directly targets a flagstone golem is absorbed into its body dealing no
      damage to the golem. A flagstone golem can use the absorbed energy to
      repair itself, healing 1 hit point for every 3 points of damage the attack
      would have otherwise dealt. Or it can release the energy in a 30-foot cone
      that deals 3d8 points of energy damage (of whatever type was absorbed) to
      all within the area. An affected opponent can attempt a DC 14 Reflex save
      to reduce the damage by half. The save DC is Constitutionbased. The
      flagstone golem can store the energy before releasing it as an energy
      blast for a number of rounds equal to half its Hit Dice (four rounds for
      the standard flagstone golem).
  - name: Flatten (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, once per round, a flagstone golem can flatten its
      form to become (or appear to become) a section of floor, road, or any
      other stone surface. While flattened it cannot move or attack and its
      damage reduction increases to 20/adamantine. A flagstone golem can reform
      into its humanoid shape as a standard action.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A flagstone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. A transmute rock to mud
      spell slows it (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. A
      transmute mud to rock spell heals all its lost hit points. A stone to
      flesh spell does not actually change the golem's structure, but it negates
      the flagstone golem's damage reduction for 1 round.
  - name: Stunning Blow (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature hit by a flagstone golem's slam attack must succeed on a DC
      16 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is
      Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    A flagstone golem is composed of large flat stones and bricks jointed and
    fitted together so as to allow the creature to fold itself flat. It is
    created to serve as guardians or servants by powerful spellcasters and has
    been the death of many an unsuspecting rogue. A flagstone golem stands 10
    feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds. Its humanoid form is composed of
    flattened stones and bricks. Two darkened sockets on its head function as
    eyes. Its arms are thick and powerful and end in stony clenched fists.
    Though a flagstone golem cannot speak, when constructed, its creator can
    program up to 4 simple words or phrases (no more than 4 words in length)
    into it that are released when certain conditions are met. These conditions
    are programmed into the golem when it is constructed. Conditions can be as
    general or specific as necessary, but must be fairly simple, such as "if
    anyone enters this room" or "if anyone touches this chest". A flagstone
    golem tasked with guarding or securing a location usually flattens itself so
    as to go unnoticed to would-be-trespassers. When an interloper treads upon
    the golem, it unfurls itself into its humanoid form and attacks, crushing
    and pounding its unsuspecting victim with powerful blows from its fists.
