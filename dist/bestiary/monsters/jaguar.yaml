Description:
  - >-
    The jaguar is a highly aggressive and ferocious great cat that makes its
    home in dense forests or swampy areas near a source of fresh water.
  - >-
    Of all the big cats, the jaguar is the most at home in the water. They are
    excellent swimmers and stalk their prey through deep water where other cats
    won't go. They also excel at climbing and often spend time hunting
    tree-dwelling animals (such as monkeys).
  - >-
    The jaguar is highly territorial with its personal hunting ground often
    covering an area of several square miles. The typical jaguar subsists on a
    diet of animals such as deer, tapir, elk, fish, armadillos, and other small
    animals. If hungry or its food supply is thin, jaguars have been known to
    attack prey much larger than itself. (Creatures as large as warhorses are
    known to have fallen victim to the powerful jaws of the jaguar.) The jaguar
    has no rival among the other big cats.
  - >-
    Jaguars are solitary creatures, but occasionally a lair is discovered that
    contains a female and 1d4 cubs. Cubs are often captured and sold on the
    market where they can be trained and raised.
  - >-
    Jaguars are sometimes confused with leopards. Both cats have a
    brownish-yellow base fur with dark spots or markings. The jaguar can be
    distinguished by the smaller markings inside the spots. A jaguar's forelimbs
    and head are slightly larger than the average leopard (another
    distinguishing characteristic). Black jaguars are often called black
    panthers (a misnomer applied to black leopards sometimes as well).
  - >-
    Jaguars stalk their prey and prefer to attack from ambush, swooping in and
    felling prey with one swift stroke of their powerful jaws. Jaguars often
    lock their jaws on its prey, hanging on until their prey is dead. The kill
    is then dragged to a safe locale and devoured or carried back to the lair
    where the food is divided among the cubs.
