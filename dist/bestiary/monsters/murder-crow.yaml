  emanates from it as it circles overhead.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      If a murder crow is reduced to 0 hit points or less, it explodes into a
      murder of standard crows. Use the statistics for the undead raven swarm
      found elsewhere in this book. These smaller crows continue to relentlessly
      attack all living creatures within sight.
  - name: Eye Rake (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a murder crow hits an opponent with both claws in the same round, the
      victim must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or be blinded as the crow
      scratches and tears at the victim's eyes. The blindness last for 1d4 days
      while the eyes naturally heal, or until healed (with remove blindness or a
      successful DC 15 Heal check). The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a
      +1 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Murder crows are undead avians found haunting cemeteries, graveyards, and
    charnel houses where they feast on the carcasses of humanoids, animals, and
    other once living creatures. These creatures are formed in desolate areas
    where the formless souls of birds condense into a solitary creature-a murder
    crow. Murder crows attack with their jagged beaks and sinister talons.
    Rarely does a murder crow face its adversaries on the ground, preferring
    instead to execute a flyby attack, enhancing this attack with its special
    eye rake ability.
  - >-
    Murder crows resemble standard crows except that they stand nearly 4 feet
    tall with a wingspan of 9 feet. Their tattered feathers are black and carry
    the stench of death. The eyes of a murder crow are bleak and hollow, showing
    no signs of emotion or life. Murder crows possess an intelligence level
    similar to that of their living counterparts; however, they have a great
    level of awareness that allows them to hunt and kill in a much more
    proficient manner.
