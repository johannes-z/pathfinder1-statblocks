SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burning Cold (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an owb can conjure a ball of flickering flames and
      hurl it at an opponent. The flames can be thrown as a ranged touch attack
      at a range of 120 feet with no range increment, and deal 3d6 points of
      cold damage.
  - name: Curse of Darkness (Su)
    description: >-
      With a touch, an owb can make bright light unbearable to the victim. Any
      creature touched must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or gain the light
      blindness weakness. This ability also robs the victim of its coloration,
      leaving the creature and its equipment in washed-out shades of gray. This
      effect can be removed with break enchantment or remove curse, unless the
      target has the dark folk subtype, in which case the effect can only be
      removed by wish or similar magic. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    An owb is a sinister visitor from the Shadow Plane, a creature resembling a
    humanoid torso draped in darkness. Alien in nature, this mysterious shade
    never speaks audible words, but it constantly uses its telepathy to project
    mumbles of curses and threats into the minds of those it encounters. The
    race's closest relationship is with the dark folk, who worship owbs as
    proxies to gods of the shadows. Most dark folk believe the first of their
    kind were created by owbs-or more powerful owb-like beings. An owb despises
    any light other than the dim flicker created by its burning cold ability,
    and shrinks from its presence. It often seeks to destroy those who bring
    light near it, relentlessly attacking the perpetrators until its enemies
    flee or die. An owb usually keeps its presence hidden from mortals. Lurking
    nearby, the shadowy creature listens in on nearby thoughts, always searching
    for a collection of fears and worries it can capitalize on for its own
    machinations. It may serve as an intermediary between doppelgangers on the
    surface world and dark folk in subterranean lands. An owb associated with a
    tribe of dark folk may scrutinize newborns and tune the children's
    connection to the Shadow Plane so they eventually grow into a different type
    of dark folk than the type they were born (allowing a dark creeper to become
    a dark stalker, and so on). An owb loves manipulation and runs
    conspiratorial plots involving denizens of the Shadow Plane and those of the
    Material Plane. An owb or cabal of owbs may control entire clans of dark
    folk, and use them as spies and pawns in some inscrutable plan. Though most
    of an owb's form measures only 3-1/2 feet tall, it typically floats so its
    head is level with that of a Medium humanoid. Deceptively light, an owb
    weighs only 20 pounds.
