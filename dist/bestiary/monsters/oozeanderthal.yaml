Description_Visual: >-
  Oozeanderthals are humanoid host beings that have been magically altered in a
  terrifying fashion. These host creatures are coated in a slimy substance about
  an inch thick, a product of ancient and forgotten magic. The bones of their
  forearms have been magically grown outward from the skin, and drastically
  elongated, with the fingers extending out into foot-long, semi-crystallized
  claws.

  - name: Ooze Coating (Su)
    description: >-
      Oozeanderthals are entirely covered in slime approximately 1 in. thick.
      This slime is highly toxic to others and if an oozeanderthal rakes an
      opponent with its slime-covered claws the victim must make a DC 15
      Fortitude save or fall twitching to the ground for 1d6 rounds from muscle
      spasms. The nonconductive nature of the ooze surrounding an oozeanderthal
      makes it immune to electrical damage. The save is Strength-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Undead creatures created from a lost form of magic, the oozeanderthals are
    truly horrible wretches. Not able to leave the mortal realm, the host body
    inside an oozeanderthal dies slowly to feed the enveloping slime. The power
    of the sustaining slime is enough to retain the oozeanderthal in a
    zombie-like existence for many years, although it weakens and deteriorates
    over the centuries. Oozeanderthals are completely non-intelligent and use
    straightforward tactics.
