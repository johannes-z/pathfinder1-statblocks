Description_Visual: >-
  This humanoid stands over seven feet tall, its features an amalgam of goblin
  and ogre. Coarse brown hair covers its sickly yellowish hide, though its
  hideous face remains entirely hairless, except for the long, knotted tangle of
  greasy hair spilling from its head. It stares coldly with deep-set eyes the
  color of pitch.

Description:

    Take the worst traits of a male ogre and the worst traits of a female
    hobgoblin and mix them together, the result is an ogren: a barbaric and
    primitive race of individuals that see combat as a way of life and means of
    entertainment and survival. Combat skills and battle prowess are taught at a
    very young age among the ogren clans, and it is not unheard of for an entire
    clan to be led by one who, by any other race would be considered a child,
    for the mighty rule the weak and the strongest and most combative ogren
    usually rules a clan. Ogren leaders often have the Battle Shout feat
    detailed in the sidebar. Ogrens pride themselves on combat and employ
    varying tactics and strategies when engaged in such affairs. Ogrens prefer
    straightforward tactics to ambush and chicanery, though if outmatched, they
    are not above employing such tactics. Ogrens usually use gang tactics in
    battle and prefer unmatched odds where they clearly have the upper hand
    (three- or four-on-one suits them just fine). Ogrens rarely if ever back
    down from a fight as they are taught that cowardice is equal to weakness.
    However, they are also taught that it is foolish to fight while your enemy
    clearly has the advantage and backing away is ok, so long as the odds are
    made even (or at least turned in the ogren's favor) the next time the two
    meet. Ogrens appear as 6-to-8-foot tall stocky humanoids with hairy hides of
    dark brown, yellowish-brown, or gray. Their eyes are generally gray or
    black, though some do have green or blue eyes (though blue eyes are
    extremely rare). Hair color ranges from brown or black to dark red or gray.
    Most ogren have long hair and rarely if ever sport facial hair. The typical
    ogren lives to 100 years of age. Ogren Society Being a primitive people, the
    ogren clans survive by hunting game and gathering wild fruits, berries, and
    herbs. Most hunting bands consist of 3-5 males and a tracker (usually an
    ogren ranger of 3rd level). Ogrens typically hunt large game such as moose,
    deer, buffalo, bison, elk, humans, and elves. Many a hunting foray has led a
    band of ogrens into a human or elven encampment or settlement. During these
    raids, targets are often taken alive and carried back to the ogren's lair
    where they are stored in cages for later consumption. Ogren often fatten up
    captive humans and elves before eating them (fattening them up provides the
    ogren clan with more meat). In times when food is scarce, some clans resort
    to cannibalism and hunt their own (though rarely if ever a member of the
    same clan; usually an ogren from a rival clan). Ogren clans are found just
    about anywhere save the coldest of climates, though they tend to favor
    temperate climates. Food is hard to come by in such harsh extremes, so they
    prefer moderate to warm climates where a food supply is readily available. A
    typical ogren settlement consists of crude huts constructed of wood with
    thatched or wooden roofs. The huts are spread in a circle around a central
    meeting ground where they dance, engage in combat, cook their food, and hold
    yearly rituals. Each clan typically holds three or more yearly rituals. Some
    ogren rituals include the Rites of Manhood, The Taking (marriage), and The
    Passing (death). During the rites of manhood, a young ogren must display his
    battle prowess against a member of his clan. These fights are never to the
    death, but the damage dealt is real. Many ogren proudly display the scars of
    such fights on their bodies. During The Taking, a male ogren selects a bride
    from another clan as a mate. The shaman from the male's clan oversees the
    ceremony and blesses such a union, usually through the ritual sacrifice of a
    captive human or elf (the blood of either is cast on the ground during this
    ritual). The last ritual, The Passing, is led by the shaman and consists of
    the shaman invoking the spirits of dead ancestors to watch over recently
    slain or deceased ogrens. Ogren Characters Strength +6, Constitution +4,
    Charisma -2. Ogren leaders tend to be barbarians. Ogren clerics are usually
