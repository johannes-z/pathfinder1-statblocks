  - name: Distracting Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Staggered for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Will DC 16 negates. This is a
      mind-affecting effect that requires the kodama to be visible to those it
      wishes to affect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Revered by druids and rangers for their attunement with the wilds, kodama,
    known also as tree kami, are the guardians of the wild trees of the
    forest-they do not protect trees cultivated and grown in civilized areas.
    (Those trees are protected by different kami, if at all.) A kodama takes a
    single tree under its protection; typically, all of the trees in a forest
    that are protected by kodama are clustered together in one particular area.
  - >-
    A kodama in its physical form resembles a barely humanoid creature with only
    the vaguest of features on its semispherical head. A tree kami is 3 feet
    tall and weighs 60 pounds. While one might expect the kami of something as
    large as a tree to itself be larger, the fact that forests are made up of so
    many trees tends to diminish the singular "presence" any single tree might
    have. In cases where a tree is particularly ancient or immense, however, the
    kodama associated with it is much larger-statistics for such rare kodama can
    be generated by advancing the kodama given here by several Hit Dice and
    increasing its size-theoretically, a Colossal kodama with more than 20 Hit
    Dice could exist somewhere in the world. Not all kodama increase in power by
    gaining racial Hit Dice, though, as some instead progress by gaining class
    levels, particularly levels of druid, though a rare few kodama kami-those
    possessed of minds more ordered and structured than is normal for their
    race-take the path of the monk.
  - >-
    Kodama are more curious about visitors than most kami, and often manifest
    their physical bodies simply to watch and observe newcomers to their groves.
    A kodama usually manifests on the far side of its tree, or in the shadows of
    the undergrowth, so that it can slowly step out into visibility to quietly
    observe with its distracting, empty-eyed gaze. This gaze can be particularly
    unnerving. Those who have fallen under its supernatural effects often have
    different descriptions of how the gaze made them feel (ashamed, frightened,
    curious, amused, and nervous being the most common reactions), yet the end
    result is essentially the same. While under observation by a curious kodama,
    few are those who can continue their actions without being at least somewhat
    distracted by the kami's attention.
  - >-
    When a kodama must fight (typically in order to defend its tree or other
    kami), it moves quickly-kodama work best in groups, and when confronted
    alone generally use tree stride to travel to another part of the forest to
    raise a small host of allies to aid
