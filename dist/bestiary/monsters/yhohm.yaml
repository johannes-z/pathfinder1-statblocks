SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Holy Fire (Su)
    description: >-
      Like a flame strike, half the fire damage from a yhohm's fire attacks is
      fire damage; the other half is divine power and is not subject to fire
      immunity or resistance. Self-Resurrection (Su) A slain yhohm remains dead
      for only 1d4 rounds unless its body is completely destroyed by an effect
      such as disintegrate. Otherwise, a fully healed yhohm emerges from the
      remains 1d4 rounds after death, as if brought back to life via
      resurrection. The yhohm gains 1 permanent negative level when this occurs.
      A yhohm can self-resurrect only once per year. If a yhohm dies a second
      time before that year passes, its death is permanent. A yhohm that dies
      within the area of a desecrate spell cannot self-resurrect until the
      desecrate effect ends, at which point the yhohm immediately resurrects. A
      yhohm brought back to life by other means never gains negative levels as a
      result.
  - name: Shroud of Flame (Su)
    description: >-
      A yhohm can cause its feathers to burst into fire as a free action. As
      long as its feathers are burning, it deals an additional 1d6 points of
      fire damage with each natural attack, and any creature within 5 feet must
      attempt a DC 14 Reflex save each round or take 1d6 points of fire damage
      at the start of its turn. A creature that attacks the yhohm with a natural
      or non-reach melee weapon takes 1d6 points of fire damage (no save) with
      each successful hit. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - A yhohm is a spirit of holy fire that serves the Dawnf lower.
  - >-
    According to the faithful, each time a phoenix is reborn, a portion of its
    soul incarnates in Nirvana as a yhohm.
  - >-
    Eternally young and obsessed with life, a yhohm is a creature of healing,
    joyful song, and cleansing fire.
  - >-
    While far less intimidating and wise than true phoenixes, yhohms prove far
    more carefree, as though a great weight has been lifted from their souls.
    Despite that, many yhohms also harbor a deep sadness, as though they have
    left some great work undone.
  - >-
    A yhohm looks like a white dove, but is as large as an eagle, with eyes like
    burning coals that shine with the light of the sun. The presence of evil
    fills it with righteous indignation. It does not need to eat, but enjoys the
    taste of roasted berries and nuts. A yhohm measures just under 2 feet long
    and weighs about 4 pounds.
