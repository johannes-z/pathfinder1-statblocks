Description:
  - >-
    Wolpertingers are a bizarre amalgamation of hare and bird with the antlers
    of a deer. A wolpertinger's mottled fur ranges from light browns and tans to
    nearly black. A pair of brown-and-tan feathered wings sprouts from its back.
    While on the ground, wolpertingers fold these wings tight to their bodies.
    Fierce predators, wolpertingers hunt in packs using clever tactics. While
    capable of flight, they find prolonged flight taxing and tend to stay on the
    ground most of the time. A wolpertinger has a 4-foot wingspan, is nearly 2
    feet long, and weighs around 15 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Wolpertingers are usually encountered in temperate forests and hills, though
    scarcity of their favored foods can sometimes drive them to warmer or colder
    climes. Though they are omnivores, wolpertingers prefer fresh meat to
    grasses and berries. They typically hunt creatures smaller than themselves
    (favoring rabbits, mice, squirrels, and the like), but often take on larger
    predatory animals, such as foxes. Given a large enough pack, wolpertingers
    can even take down a solitary wolf. Wolpertingers mate only once per year,
    in the spring. Kits stay with their packs until they are full-grown, but
    rarely remain with their birth-packs beyond a year, instead setting out to
    establish their own packs.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Though related to skvaders, wolpertingers are quite different beasts. Unlike
    their somewhat nomadic cousins, wolpertingers are aggressive and fiercely
    territorial. Packs stake out territories large enough for their hunting
    needs, and keep constantly vigilant against invaders. At the first
    indication of any significant threat, the pack mobilizes and attempts to
    kill or drive off the intruders. This territoriality extends to different
    packs of wolpertingers, though multiple packs have been known to coexist
    peacefully near one another as long as none of them violates another pack's
    territory. When on the hunt, wolpertingers vary their approaches, from
    slinking through the underbrush to flying in from above, as befits the
    terrain and the capabilities of their prey. When approaching from afar, they
    charge in quickly to get close enough to deal a forceful attack with their
    horns. Once in close combat, they gang up on their prey in flanking pairs.
    The strongest and oldest wolpertingers focus on melee, leaving the younger
    members of the pack to dart in for quick charges. Given their antlers, it's
    difficult for wolpertingers to create burrows like skvaders and normal
    hares. Instead, they seek shelter in naturally secluded areas as well as in
    the former dens of larger predators.
  - Skvaders and Wolpertingers as Familiars
  - >-
    While most skvaders and wolpertingers prefer the company of their families
    and packs, occasionally the more adventurous among them come to serve as
    familiars. Service to a powerful spellcaster brings with it protection and
    long-term companionship, which these creatures take advantage of. A neutral
    spellcaster can gain a skvader as a familiar at 3rd level by taking the
    Improved Familiar feat, and a neutral spellcaster can gain a wolpertinger as
    a familiar at 5th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat.
