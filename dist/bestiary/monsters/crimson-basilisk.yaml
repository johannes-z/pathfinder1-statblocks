SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acidic Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A crimson basilisk's saliva is corrosive. Any melee bite attack deals acid
      damage.
  - name: Blood Frenzy (Ex)
    description: >-
      A crimson basilisk that detects fresh blood within 30 feet enters a
      frenzied state the following round, along with all other crimson basilisks
      within 30 feet. Frenzied crimson basilisks fight until they or their
      opponents are dead. A frenzied crimson basilisk gains a +2 bonus on attack
      rolls and damage rolls and -2 AC for 1 minute. The creature cannot end the
      frenzy voluntarily. A crimson basilisk can enter a frenzy only once per
      encounter.
  - name: Wounding Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      A living creature within 30 feet that meets the gaze of a crimson basilisk
      must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or take 1d3 points of
      Constitution damage as blood weeps from the victim's eyes, ears, nose, and
      mouth. Creatures without blood (undead, plants, oozes) and other crimson
      basilisks are immune to the effects of this gaze. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Crimson basilisks are variants of the common basilisk, and in some cases
    more dangerous. Adventurers can be relieved that they will not be turned to
    stone, but such relief is usually short-lived as they soon realize their
    equipment begins to disintegrate under acidic bites and they begin bleeding
    uncontrollably when they meet the creature's gaze. Crimson basilisks are
    subterranean carnivores with a voracious appetite that is only whetted when
    they get the thing they desire most-blood. While they can survive on a diet
    of plants, mosses, and meat, they prefer blood above all else, even
    attacking their own kind when food is scarce. A typical crimson basilisk
    lair is a stony cavern that reeks of blood and whose walls and ground are
    typically covered and caked in dried blood. The lair usually contains up to
    5 of these creatures with an equal chance of males and females. From 1d4
    young are likely to be present as well. Young do not fight or enter combat.
    A crimson basilisk is about 6 feet long and weighs over 400 pounds. Its skin
    is dull crimson though it can easily change its color (as a free action) to
    match that of its surroundings. Its eight legs are thick and stout and end
    in sharpened claws. The spines on its back are crimson as well, though they
    tend to be darker than its overall body (especially in males). Its eyes glow
    with a ghostly blue light. A crimson basilisk most often attacks from
    ambush, using its ability to camouflage itself against its surroundings and
    lying in wait for prey to wander too close. Once prey moves within 30 feet,
    it attacks, first using its gaze to bleed a foe and then quickly moving in
    to bite. If it successfully bleeds an opponent, the basilisk enters a
    frenzied state and attacks until either it or its prey is dead. Copyright
