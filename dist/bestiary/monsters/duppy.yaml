SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ravenous Hounds (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a duppy can bring into being a pack of
      incorporeal hounds for 1d4+3 rounds. The ravenous hounds attack as a
      single unit, have a +11 attack bonus, deal 2d6+3 points of force damage on
      a successful hit, and threaten a critical hit on a natural 20. This
      ability is otherwise identical to mage's sword (CL 7th).
  - name: Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)
    description: >-
      A raise dead or similar spell cast on a duppy destroys it (Will negates).
      Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.
  - name: Strength Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures hit by a duppy's touch attack must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude
      save or take 1d6 points of Strength drain. On each successful attack, the
      duppy gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A duppy is the spirit of a cruel and brutal sailor who died by violence on
    land, away from his ship and crew, and thus was unable to receive a proper
    burial at sea. While its ghostly form is evidence enough of its twisted
    hatred, a duppy also possesses power over a pack of faithful, otherworldly
    hounds that share in their master's malignance. Duppies typically seek out
    sailors and pirates to exact their vengeance on, seeking to inf lict great
    violence on those living creatures who remind them of what they lost in
    life. For this reason, duppies are most often found in seaside towns or
    nearby beaches, and settlements that rely on the ocean know to fear and hate
    these ghastly beings.
  - >-
    The presence of a duppy is often preceded by the distant sound of unearthly
    howling. While a duppy's incorporeal form ensures that it cannot be captured
    via mundane means, those who do manage to trick a duppy into a trap are wise
    to keep the horror confined until day, when its otherworldly abilities are
    hindered and it can be more easily defeated. However, few creatures can
    muster powers strong enough to cage a duppy, whose hounds confound enemies
    and allow the ghostly monster to attack victims from all sides.
