SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Undersized Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although a lamia is Large, its upper torso is the same size as that of a
      Medium humanoid. As a result, lamias wield weapons as if they were one
      size category smaller than their actual size (Medium for most lamias).
  - name: Wisdom Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A lamia drains 1d4 points of Wisdom each time it hits with its melee touch
      attack. (Unlike with other kinds of ability drain attacks, a lamia does
      not heal any damage when it uses its Wisdom drain.) Lamias try to use this
      power early in an encounter to make foes more susceptible to charm monster
      and suggestion.
Description:
  - >-
    The hate-filled inheritors of an ancient curse, lamias appear as lean and
    attractive women from the waist up, while below they possess the bodies of
    powerful lions. Even their humanoid features bear distinctly feline traits,
    their eyes slitted and feral and their teeth like predatory fangs. A typical
    lamia stands over 6 feet tall, measures more than 8 feet long, and weighs
    upward of 650 pounds. Lamias are attracted to the ruined and forsaken parts
    of the world. Crumbling keeps, abandoned cities, and forgotten monuments all
    satisfy these deadly hunters' cruel aesthetic- particularly those in arid or
    otherwise lifeless environs. Foremost, though, lamias favor decrepit
    temples. They delight in seeing the shrines of good deities in ruins and go
    out of their way to bring hardship to thriving holy places. Lamias look to
    the eldest female of the group as their leader, mother, and shaman, cleaving
    to her with fanatical reverence. While lamias shun most religious
    followings- viewing such as the source of the curse that blighted them with
    bestial forms-lamia elders claim to hear the whispers of the scouring desert
    winds and know the cold whims of the stars, drawing upon such mystical
    sources to lead their people. The lamias presented here are but the most
    common and least powerful members of this cursed race, with others bearing
    serpentine, avian, and even more perverse forms.
