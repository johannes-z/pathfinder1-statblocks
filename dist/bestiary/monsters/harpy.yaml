  - name: Captivating Song (Su)
    description: >-
      A harpy's song has the power to infect the minds of those that hear it,
      calling them to the harpy's side. When a harpy sings, all creatures aside
      from other harpies within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 16 Will
      saving throw or become captivated. A creature that successfully saves is
      not subject to the same harpy's song for 24 hours. A victim under the
      effects of the captivating song moves toward the harpy using the most
      direct means available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such
      as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving
      throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Captivated creatures can
      take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of
      the harpy simply stands and offers no resistance to the harpy's attacks.
      This effect continues for as long as the harpy sings and for 1 round
      thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Often viewed as vicious and corrupted creatures, harpies know how creatures
    think and act. This understanding gives them an advantage when it comes to
    finding their favorite meals. While creatures of the wild easily fall victim
    to their captivating songs, these vile bird-women prefer their meals spiced
    with complex sentient thoughts.
  - Easy prey makes for a boring meal.
  - >-
    While ultimately savage and without remorse for their actions, a number of
    harpies live close to humanoid societies and enjoy parlaying with creatures
    that they see as potential meals.
  - >-
    Harpies tend to wear baubles and trinkets stolen from their victims, as they
    like to indulge in the shiny ornaments of mankind. Up close, these creatures
    reek with the stench of consumed victims, and they rarely let creatures not
    yet captivated too near, lest they smell the gore and decay upon their
    feathers. For this reason, many harpies wear perfumes and scented oils.
  - >-
    Harpies appear wildly different in different lands. Some seem like an
    amalgam of vultures and women, while others bear the regal markings of hawks
    or falcons in their feathers. Rare clutches of harpies in isolated and
    tropical parts of the world even have colorful feathers akin to parrots.
