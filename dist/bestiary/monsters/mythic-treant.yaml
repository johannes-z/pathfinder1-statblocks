Group: Treant
Source: Mythic Adventures
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animate Trees (Sp)
    description: >-
      A mythic treant can animate and control up to two trees within 180 feet at
      will. It takes 1 full round for a tree to uproot itself, after which it
      moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a non-mythic treant (Bestiary
      266). It has only one slam attack, lacks the treant's animation and
      rock-throwing abilities, and has the treant's vulnerability to fire. If
      the treant terminates the animation, moves out of range, or is
      incapacitated, the tree immediately takes root wherever it is and returns
      to its normal state. If the treant expends one use of mythic power when it
      animates a tree, the tree remains animated and under the treant's control
      up to a range of 1 mile, and it doesn't count toward the treant's limit of
      controlling up to two trees at a time.
  - name: Double Damage Against Objects (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mythic treant or animated tree that makes a full attack against an
      object or structure deals double damage.
  - name: Drink Deep (Su)
    description: >-
      A mythic treant can expend one use of mythic power to lose its
      vulnerability to fire for 1 hour.
  - name: Treespeech (Ex)
    description: >-
      A treant has the ability to converse with plants as if subject to a
      continual speak with plants spell, and most plants greet it with an
      attitude of friendly or helpful.
  - name: Druidic Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      A mythic treant can expend one use of mythic power to cast any druid spell
      of 3rd level or lower, or two uses of mythic power to cast any druid spell
      of 5th level or lower. Its caster level for this spell is 10th.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic treant is an ancient entity granted power by a deity or magical
    pool. They're the shepherds of forests, and even less likely to converse
    with short-lived races.
