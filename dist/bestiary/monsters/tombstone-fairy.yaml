    description: >-
      Once per night, a tombstone fairy can invoke a ritual to raise any evil
      creature from the dead. The ritual takes 10 minutes to perform and the
      target cannot have been dead longer than one day per HD of the tombstone
      fairy. Additionally, the target's body must be present during the ritual
      and its soul must be available for return (that is, if the target's soul
      is trapped, such as by a trap the soul spell, this ritual automatically
      fails). A target unwilling to return to life can prevent its raising by
      making an opposed Charisma check against the tombstone fairy's Charisma
      check. If the tombstone fairy wins the check, the target's soul is forced
      into its body and it returns to life. If the target wins the opposed
      check, it prevents its raising, and the tombstone fairy cannot attempt to
      raise that same target for one month. During the ritual a portion of the
      target's soul transfers to its funeral shroud or cloth. The tombstone
      fairy often retains this shroud so as to force compliance from the
      returned target. Once the target does what the fairy desires, the
      tombstone fairy finishes this ritual and transfers the last bit of the
      target's soul from the shroud into its body. If the funeral shroud is
      destroyed while it contains a part of the target's soul, the target
      instantly dies and can only be returned to life through the use of a
      resurrection, true resurrection, miracle or wish. This ability otherwise
      resembles a raise dead spell. A tombstone fairy can have only one funeral
      shroud (containing a target's soul) in its possession at one time.
Description:
  - >-
    Tombstone fairies are wicked beings that dwell within graveyards, raising
    murderers and evil heroes from the dead to go out and continue their deadly
    work. They often demand some form of repayment for the raising of such
    beings, keeping the creature's funeral shroud as a bargaining chip. This
    payment could range from magical or monetary treasures, the murder of a
    specific enemy and so on. Failure to make payment within 30 days usually
    results in the raised individual dying again. Upon payment, the formerly
    dead is given their shroud and is free to go about committing whatever foul
    deeds they wish.
  - >-
    Tombstone fairies are generally solitary creatures, but on occasion a small
    group of them comes together with a single goal: raise a small band of evil
    dead to further the fairies' own ends.
  - A tombstone fairy stands about 3 feet tall and weighs around 35 pounds.
  - >-
    Its skin is always slate gray and its hair is either dark brown or black.
    Its eyes are always black.
  - >-
    When pressed into combat, tombstone fairies fight with their wicked boning
    knife and spell-like abilities, seeking escape as quickly as possible.
  - If cornered, they fight to the death.
