SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acidic Missile (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a water yai can launch a bolt of acid from its third
      eye. Any creature struck by this bolt must also succeed at a DC 29
      Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round by the overwhelming stench of
      the acid. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Flowing Robes (Su)
    description: >-
      A water yai wears a special silk kimono infused with magical water. This
      kimono grants a +6 armor bonus. These robes function as armor only for
      water yai.
  - name: Liquid Form (Sp)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a water yai can turn into a mobile pool of water.
      This functions like gaseous form, except that the yai cannot fly in this
      form. It retains its own base speed, and its swim speed doubles to 120
      feet. The water yai can end this ability as a standard action.
Description:
  - >-
    The water yai clad themselves in the flesh of storm giants, yet these yai
    are more at home dwelling beneath the waves than they are above them. Unlike
    most oni, water yai have no real longing to rule or infiltrate societies-
    yet they still enjoy posing as humanoids. They often assume the forms of
    enormous merfolk in the water, but prefer to adopt the shapes of storm
    giants when on land. The water yai then pursues its favorite decadence-the
    acclimation of material wealth and luxuries. Water yai tend to be easily
    distracted by beautiful treasures, and despite their evil natures are prone
    to acts of unexpected frivolity.
