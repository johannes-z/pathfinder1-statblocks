    description: >-
      Three times per day as a standard action, a thriae dancer can consume a
      dose of merope (honey from the thriae queen) to channel her connection to
      the natural world into an awe-inspiring dance. This dance may have a
      variety of effects depending on which of the following performances she
      chooses. Once she has begun, the thriae dancer may maintain her dance as a
      free action, and the effects of the dance persist as long as the thriae
      performs her dance. A thriae dancer can dance for a number of rounds equal
      to her Hit Dice before becoming fatigued. After that, if she continues
      dancing for that same number of rounds, she becomes exhausted. A thriae
      dancer may switch between performances as a swift action. Targets must be
      within 60 feet and able to see the thriae dancer in order to be affected
      by her dance. This is a mind-affecting effect. Dance of Fervor: This
      performance affects all non-thriae creatures within its range with the
      effects of both confusion and rage (Will DC 17 negates). When this effect
      ends, affected creatures are fatigued for a number of rounds equal to the
      length of time they were affected by the dance of fervor. A creature may
      not be affected by the same thriae dancer's dance of fervor more than once
      in 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. Dance of Grace: This
      performance grants all thriae within its range (including the dancer) a +1
      insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saving throws. This bonus increases to
      +2 if three or more thriae dancers are performing a dance of grace within
      range of the target. Dance of Passion: This performance grants all thriae
      within its range (including the dancer) a +1 insight bonus on attack and
      damage rolls. This bonus increases to +2 if three or more thriae dancers
      are performing a dance of passion within range of the target.

Description:
  - >-
    For as stoic and pragmatic as the thriae may be, they do appreciate art,
    grace, and beauty. This is exemplified not only by their ornately crafted
    weapons, armor, and jewelry, but also by their renowned dancers. These
    talented individuals are the most honored performers of their race, and they
    grace the halls and temple chambers of every thriae colony.
  - >-
    While all thriae can be considered the epitome of alien grace and charm,
    thriae dancers are always among the most beautiful of their kind. They are
    typically 6 feet tall and weigh 140 pounds.

    Other races may scoff at the fact that thriae dancers seemingly rely on
    merope consumption in order to channel their mystical power into their
    dances, but there is much more to this act than one might realize. A thriae
    dancer's reliance on merope to execute her awesome performances is akin to a
    ballerina's reliance on her specialized shoes-while a ballet can be
    performed without them, the final result lacks a certain amount of finish
    without this integral element. So too does a thriae dancer's use of merope
    enhance her performance, with the potent serum pushing her body to its
    utmost limits. As the merope courses through a dancer, she channels her
    mysterious art into a spiritual energy capable of thrusting viewers to
    previously unknown heights of pleasure, awe, and sorrow. It's true that
    thriae are a stoic, nigh-unf linching race, but in the middle of a thriae
    dancer's performance, it's rare to see any thriae witnesses unmoved by such
    a powerful spectacle.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Like all thriae, a dancer's role in the colony is chosen for her during
    adolescence, and she's thereafter cared for and trained by elder members
    from the same occupation until ready to perform on her own. A dancer's
    training takes many years of concentrated effort and tutelage from her
    superiors, during which time she's permitted to see no one but her fellow
    dancers. Thriae seers reason that dancers must be completely virginal in
    order for them to channel only the purest forms of nature's secrets. All
    training takes place within a special temple room in the thriae colony,
    where incense derived from merope is burned constantly to ensure the
    dancers' focus is sustained for hours on end.
  - >-
    Dancers train in troupes, and most performances are choreographed group
    pieces performed once a month in the colony's largest hall, with an audience
    of thriae from all parts of the colony and caste system. The buzz of wings
    and even the sound of twitching antennae become muted as thriae soldiers,
    seers, and workers eagerly witness the highly spiritual dance ceremony.
  - >-
    Drones-those humanoid men inducted into thriae society-are not permitted to
    witness thriae dances, as to behold such beauty would surely drive them
    irreparably mad.
  - >-
    Only the most talented and coveted thriae dancers are permitted to perform
    alone-there's typically only one such dancer in the entire colony, though
    some colonies might host a pair of honored performers. The solo or duet
    performances of these honored individuals are considered sacred affairs, and
    are typically attended only by the queen and upper class thriae such as
    seers, royal consorts, and generals. Venerated by their peers, these dancers
    are known as thriae terpsichoreans, and occupy the upper echelons of thriae
    society. Thriae terpsichoreans typically have levels in bard, are at least
    CR 9, and have access to the following spell-like abilities: 3/day-heroism,
    suggestion; 1/ day-zone of silence.
