Description:
  - >-
    Gronks are the typical big, dumb brutes; a male gronk is on average
    approximately 9 feet tall, with females only slightly smaller. A gronk has
    mottled gray skin and shaggy brown hair that is thickest at its head and
    shoulders and gradually thins out around its waist. The arms and legs of a
    gronk are massive, like tree limbs attached to its thick barrel-like torso.
    The face of a gronk seems almost lost amid the long hair hanging from its
    head. The most notable feature of a gronk's face is the long,
    rhinoceros-like horn between its eyes. Gronks dwell in small family bands or
    nomadic packs. They are huntergatherers, wandering the cold plains they call
    home. Gronk packs never remain in one place for more than a month before
    moving on to greener pastures and better hunting grounds. They have been
    known to engage in barter with traders who cross their territories. Of
    particular interest to gronks are frost giants, with whom they have some
    sort of kinship or bond (though the extent of such a bond is unknown).
    Gronks are fiercely territorial, but will not attack strangers who are
    simply passing through. They know how long it should take to cross their
    lands, and anyone remaining there for longer than that is subject to a raid.
    During such raids, gronks often subdue rather than kill their opponents.
    Subdued opponents are left to fend for themselves in the wild while the
    gronks carry off their gear and supplies. The only creatures that are
    immediately attacked when they enter gronk lands are orcs. There is some
    ancient enmity between the two races that forces a gronk to attack any orc
    or half-orc on sight. Such creatures are never shown quarter in combat and
    all battles between a gronk and orc or half-orc ends when one or the other
    dies. Gronks enjoy combat and enter into melee with unashamed glee. They can
    fight either armed or unarmed, and actually prefer the latter. Among
    weapons, gronks tend to use simple weapons such as clubs. They rarely use
    missile weapons of any kind. Gronk Characters Gronks have racial Hit Dice
    and can have class levels. Most gronk leaders are barbarians. On rare
    occasions, a female gronk becomes an adept or druid; female gronks are the
    only members of their race who have ever shown any skill with magic. Gronk
    characters have the following racial traits. +8 Strength, +6 Constitution,
    -2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma: Gronks display the strength, ferocity and dull
    wits of the typical savage. Large size: Gronks are Large and have the
    following adjustments -1 penalty to Armor Class, -1 penalty on attack rolls,
    -4 penalty on Stealth checks, +1 bonus on CMB/CMD, lifting and carrying
    limits double those of Medium characters. Space/Reach: 10 ft./10 ft. Fast: A
    gronk's base speed is 40 feet. Darkvision: A gronk can see in the dark up to
    60 feet. Racial Hit Dice: A gronk starts with four levels of monstrous
    humanoid, which provide it with 4d10 HD, a base attack bonus of +4, and base
    save bonuses of Fort +1, Ref +4, Will +4. Racial Skills: A gronk's monstrous
    humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 4 x (4 + Int modifier, minimum
    1). A gronk has a +4 racial bonus to Survival skill checks. Racial Feats: A
    gronk's monstrous humanoid levels give it two feats. AC: Gronks have +4
    natural armor bonus. Natural Weapons: Gronks can fight with 2 slams (1d6)
    and a horn (1d6). Languages: Gronks begin play speaking Giant. A gronk with
    a high Intelligence can choose from the following languages: Common, Goblin,
    Orc. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.
