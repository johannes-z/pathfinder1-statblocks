SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fling (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a deadly mantis begins its turn with a Large or smaller creature
      grabbed in its claws, it can, as a standard action, fling that creature up
      to 30 feet away. Creatures thrown in this way take 3d6 points of damage as
      if they had fallen from the same distance.
  - name: Rending Mandibles (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a deadly mantis hits with both claws and successfully grabs a foe, it
      can make an immediate bite attack against that foe as a secondary attack.
      This bite attack has a +12 attack bonus and deals 4d6+6 points of damage.
      In addition to dealing damage, the mantis can tear away the victim's armor
      as a free action by making a combat maneuver check. If the mantis is
      successful, the target's armor is ripped from its body. If the target
      fails a DC 31 Reflex save, the armor subjected to this attack loses half
      its hit points and gains the broken condition. The save DC is
      Strength-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The legendary deadly mantis stalks the deepest jungles of Mediogalti Island
    and the Mwangi Expanse. Tales about this lethal predator preying upon such
    mammoth creatures as drakes and giants frighten even the bravest hunters.
    Deadly mantises are sacred to the followers of Achaekek, the Mantis God, who
    keep the massive beasts well fed, and bring them sacrificial victims and
    livestock. Followers of Achaekek have also been known to serve as protectors
    of the dens of deadly mantises. Though creatures of this size and power
    obviously need no guardians, the devout followers guard their lairs and
    prevent adventurers from slaying the mighty insects. The typical deadly
    mantis stands 40 feet tall, 60 feet long, and weighs several tons.
