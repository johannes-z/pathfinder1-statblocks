      As a standard action, a pooka can blow across her palm and create a
      5-foot-diameter cloud of intoxicating dust. The pooka decides when she
      uses this ability whether the dust acts as an inhaled poison or a mild
      intoxicant (equivalent to 1-2 glasses of beer).
Description:
  - >-
    Capricious in nature, pookas are always in search of fun, though they don't
    often care who they inconvenience with their antics-they're just in it for
    the whimsy. Always chaotic in nature, some pookas are cruel, some are
    good-natured, and others are slightly unhinged. There's no way to tell which
    kind one is just by looking at it; only by interacting with a pooka does its
    nature become clear. However, having a conversation with a pooka isn't easy.
    Though they're intelligent, pookas speak in choppy, simple sentences filled
    with obscure metaphors and nonsensical references. Most creatures who
    converse with a pooka usually misunderstand it the first time and have to
    ask the creature to repeat itself. Even their telepathy is filled with
    strange images and references, such as representing the word "elf " with the
    face of an elf it knew long ago, colloquialisms that only make sense to
    native speakers of Sylvan, and so on. Pookas thrive when in the company of
    others, and they frequently find companionship in a particular individual
    whether the camaraderie is wanted or not. Pookas prefer creatures of chaotic
    alignments, don't trust those with lawful alignments, and find most people
    with neutral alignments boring. Pookas pull pranks to get to know a person
    and stay near them to observe the results, invisibly perched on a shoulder
    or clinging to an article of clothing. As they usually communicate with
    their unlucky target (whom they call "friend") using telepathy, the person's
    erratic reactions to the unseen pooka's pranks and mental "voice" can make
    the target appear insane. The pooka doesn't mind a little rough retaliation,
    but flees any attempts to kill it. Some pookas can be helpful, and farmers
    often leave a portion of their harvest behind as a tribute for any resident
    pookas. A pooka who is satisfied with such a gift may leave that farmer
    alone for an entire year, while a pooka who feels slighted by the offering
    may relentlessly mock the farmer and cause minor accidents on the farm. A
    pooka measures 1 to 2 feet from eartips to tail and weighs up to 15 pounds.
    A non-lawful spellcaster of at least 7th level who takes the Improved
    Familiar feat can select a pooka as a familiar.
