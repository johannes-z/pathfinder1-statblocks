Description:
  - >-
    The wang liang are an infernal race of humanoid beings bred for power and
    cruelty by the authority of Lucifer himself. It is said that the blood of
    Lucifer himself and that of his most trusted advisors was mixed with that of
    mortal races to spawn this horrid hybrid. Before his fall, the wang liang
    were the former ruler of Hell's most devout worshippers. The wang liang
    organized themselves into monk-like sects and frequently acted as spies and
    enforcers in Hell and as emissaries and advisors to mortal rulers across the
    material planes. A typical wang liang stands 6 feet tall and weighs 200
    pounds. It speaks Infernal and Common. At will the wang liang may cause
    their iron clawed fingertips and razor sharp fangs to drip with an infernal
    venom. Wang liang prefer to use misdirection and intimidation to alter the
    outcome of fights and bide their time if possible to assault foes when they
    are at their most vulnerable. It is not uncommon for a wang liang to use
    allies to their advantage. When pressed into actual combat they use full
    attacks in an attempt to infuse their opponent with as much venom as
    possible. Wang liang masters are often found leading monasteries of wang
    liang monks dedicated to Lucifer. Such monasteries dedicated to the Dark One
    are located in remote, out of the way places or cleverly disguised as
    another business or monastery if found within a populated area. Wang liang
    were once greater than they currently are, having suffered great losses and
    in many cases a thinning of their infernal bloodline in the course of their
    masters defeat. Spiteful over their diminished authority, they now pursue
    strength through exercise of their old monastic ways and practice of martial
    arts or pursuit of sorcerous knowledge. The wang liang still organize
    themselves into regimented monastic orders, sending their most gifted
    champions out on missions to spread the words of Lucifer.
