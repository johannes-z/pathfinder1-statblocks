  - name: Shriek (Su)
    description: >-
      The shrill shriek of a hieracosphinx deafens non-sphinxes within a
      60-foot-radius spread for 2d4 rounds (DC 16 Fortitude negates). Once a
      creature successfully saves against this effect, it is immune to the
      hieracosphinx's shriek for 24 hours. Using this ability is a standard
      action. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The least intelligent of the common sphinxes, hieracosphinxes are a
    cowardly, cruel-hearted lot. All are male. They despise the larger and
    cleverer androsphinxes and criosphinxes. Toward gynosphinxes they hold a
    twisted mix of a lust and hate, simultaneously envying their beauty and
    power while craving them as mates. Hieracosphinxes attack other sphinxes
    whenever they have them at a disadvantage. Male sphinxes of other species
    they tear to shreds or drive away, whereas they prefer to leave gynosphinxes
    ravaged but alive. The other species of sphinx likewise hold nothing but
    disdain for hieracosphinxes, and typically attack these vile beasts on
    sight.
  - >-
    Hieracosphinxes guard their territory ruthlessly against weaker intruders,
    seldom giving warning before they attack. They have no use for banter and
    riddles, making most efforts at diplomacy rather ineffective, but can be
    convinced to call off their attacks by convincing shows of force coupled
    with information on the location of weaker prey or a gynosphinx. Though poor
    fliers, they still prefer to fight from the air, the better to escape if the
    combat turns against them.
  - >-
    As they lack the ego and resourcefulness of the rest of their breed,
    hieracosphinxes can be pressed into service of mounts, particularly by those
    of similarly evil dispositions. Hieracosphinxes chafe under such service but
    submit to more powerful riders, though they still inf lict their foul
    tempers on any weaker creatures that happen by. A grown hieracosphinx can
    easily consume a full horse's worth of meat in a day, making their upkeep
    rather expensive. Even with these drawbacks, hieracosphinx eggs command
    values of up to 1,500 gp on the open market, as do young hieracosphinxes. It
    takes 3 years for a hieracosphinx to reach maturity, after which an
    untrained hieracosphinx only rarely accepts a rider without magical
    compulsion. Trainers, though hard to come by, charge thousands of gold
    pieces to rear and train a hieracosphinx, owing to the risk to life and
    limb.
  - >-
    A light load for a hieracosphinx is up to 350 pounds; a medium load, 351-700
    pounds; and a heavy load, 701-1,050 pounds. A typical hieracosphinx is just
    short of 9 feet long and weighs 600 pounds. Hieracosphinxes detest bearing a
    rider into battle, thus increasing the DCs of any combat-related Ride checks
    by +5.
