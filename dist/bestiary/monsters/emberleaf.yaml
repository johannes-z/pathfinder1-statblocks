SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fire Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      An emberleaf subjected to fire damage regains 1 hit point for every 3
      points of damage the attack would have otherwise dealt.
  - name: Heat Aura (Ex)
    description: >-
      An emberleaf can suppress or restart its heat aura as a free action. If it
      uses its ring of fire ability, its heat aura automatically dissipates and
      it cannot restart it again for 1 hour.
  - name: Ring of Fire (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, an emberleaf can create an immobile,
      blazing ring of fire in a 30-foot radius around its form. This fire is
      similar to a wall of fire spell. The ring of fire is 20 feet tall, and
      deals 2d6 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet of it. Those
      beyond 10 feet but within 20 feet take 1d6 points of fire damage.
      Creatures passing through the ring take 3d6 points of fire damage. The
      ring deals this damage when it appears, and to all creatures in the area
      on the emberleaf's turn each round. The ring of fire lasts a number of
      rounds equal to the emberleaf's Hit Dice (6 rounds for a standard
      emberleaf). The emberleaf cannot use this ability to invoke its fire
      healing.
Description:
  - >-
    The emberleaf is a sentient plant found deep within darkened and desolate
    forests where it preys on insects and other small game animals. Often times,
    an emberleaf makes its lair near trails or roads that wend their way through
    the forests in hopes of catching a larger meal passing through.
  - >-
    An emberleaf appears as a small flowering plant with various yellow, sweet
    smelling flowers. It typical grows no taller than two or three feet and when
    at rest resembles an ordinary plant. The creature is active during the day
    and rests during the nighttime hours. During warmer months, the creature is
    more active, while during cooler months and winter, the creature is dormant
    most of the time. An emberleaf can go up to one month without eating.
  - >-
    Emberleafs do not actively hunt prey. Rather, they wait for their prey to
    come to them. The sweet smelling flowers and aroma given off by the flowers
    usually attracts insects and small game who unknowingly wander into range of
    the emberleaf's tendrils. Particularly tough opponents are subjected to its
    heat aura. If extremely hungry, an emberleaf uses its ring of fire attack to
    prevent its prey from escaping.
