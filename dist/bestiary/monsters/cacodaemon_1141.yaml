  this frightful creature's orb-like body.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Cacodaemonia: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 12; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d2 Wis damage, cure 2 consecutive saves. In addition to the normal
      effects of the disease, as long as a victim is infected, the cacodaemon
      can telepathically communicate with the creature over any distance (as
      long as they remain on the same plane).
  - name: Soul Lock (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a full-round action, a cacodaemon can ingest the spirit of
      any sentient creature that has died within the last minute. This causes a
      soul gem to grow inside of the cacodaemon's gut, which it can regurgitate
      as a standard action. A soul gem is a fine-sized object with 1 hit point
      and hardness 2. Destroying a soul gem frees the soul within, though it
      does not return the deceased creature to life. This is a death effect. Any
      attempt to resurrect a body whose soul is trapped in a soul gem requires a
      DC 12 caster level check. Failure results in the spell having no effect,
      while success shatters the victim's soul gem and returns the creature to
      life as normal. If the soul gem rests in an unholy location, such as that
      created by the spell unhallow, the DC of this caster level check increases
      by +2. The caster level check DC is Charisma-based. Any evil outsider can,
      as a standard action, ingest a soul gem. Doing so frees the soul within,
      but condemns it to one of the lower planes (though the soul can be
      returned to life as normal). The outsider gains fast healing 2 for a
      number of rounds equal to its Hit Dice.
Description:
  - >-
    The least of daemonkind, cacodaemons spawn from eddies of angry, violent,
    and demented souls amid the mists of Abaddon. Dim-witted but utterly evil,
    they endlessly seek to cause pain and indulge their hunger for mortal souls.
    Many more powerful fiends keep cacodaemons as pets, if only to be able to
    harvest the tiny creatures' soul gems. A 7th-level spellcaster can gain a
    cacodaemon as a familiar if she has the Improved Familiar feat.
