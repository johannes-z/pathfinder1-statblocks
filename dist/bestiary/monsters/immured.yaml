  - name: Aura of Breathlessness (Su)
    description: >-
      The agonized gasping of an immured displaces oxygen within 10 feet of it,
      automatically extinguishing nonmagical fires within this range. Breathing
      creatures within the aura must hold their breath or risk suffocation.
      Whenever an immured deals nonlethal damage to a creature holding its
      breath in the aura, the duration the target can hold its breath for
      decreases by a number of rounds equal to the nonlethal damage dealt. The
      immured cannot dismiss this aura.
  - name: Bound (Su)
    description: >-
      Immured are bound to the locations in which they died. Each hour an
      immured remains away from the tomb or building in which it died, it takes
      1d6 points of damage that can't be healed until it returns to its place of
      death.
  - name: Breach (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, an immured can touch a nonmagical wall and open a
      spatial rift. The touched 5-foot section of wall (which can be up to 2
      feet thick) effectively ceases to exist for 2 rounds, except for a dark,
      semisolid membrane that blocks line of sight through the rift. The immured
      can see, move, attack, or even drag a target through the rift without
      penalty. Other creatures can move through the rift, treating it as
      difficult terrain. After 2 rounds, the rift closes, pushing anything
      inside it into the nearest open space.
  - name: Seize (Ex)
    description: >-
      An immured can choose to deal nonlethal damage with its slam attack with
      no penalty on the attack roll. In addition, an immured that deals
      nonlethal damage with its slam attack can attempt a drag combat maneuver
      against the target as a free action.
Description:
  - >-
    Immured are undead remains of those who died of slow suffocation in a
    confined, lightless space. Their feelings of abject terror and desperate
    desire to escape before death manifest as an ability to open temporary rifts
    in reality. Although they loathe the bright lights and open spaces of the
    world outside, they occasionally emerge to violently hush any sounds that
    disturb their repose. Some immured find the last gasps of dying creatures
    intoxicating, so they seek out victims to choke night after night.
  - >-
    While an accidental live burial can trigger the birth of an immured, most of
    these unfortunates are brought about by purposeful malevolence, such as
    being walled in as a form of torture or execution in life. In cultures
    obsessed with undeath or the afterlife, living servants are sometimes
    honored by being entombed with their masters, which can create immured.
  - An immured is 6 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.
