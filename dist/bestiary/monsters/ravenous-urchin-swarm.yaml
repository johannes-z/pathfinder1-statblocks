SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Jet (Ex)
    description: >-
      While underwater, a ravenous urchin swarm can jet as a full-round action
      at a speed of 70 feet. It must move in a straight line, but does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Swarm-injury; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2
      Dex and reduce movement speed by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet); cure 1
      save. The venom of ravenous urchin swarms stiffens muscles and locks
      joints into painful configurations. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Underfoot (Ex)
    description: >-
      Each time a creature moves through a space occupied by a ravenous urchin
      swarm or starts its movement in such a space, it runs the risk of a
      ravenous urchin moving underfoot. The creature must succeed at a DC 13
      Reflex save or take 1 point of damage plus poison. Additionally, the
      affected creature's movement speed is reduced by half because its foot is
      wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is
      successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at
      least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must
      immediately stop if it steps on a ravenous urchin. Any creature moving at
      half its speed or slower can pick its way through a tidal pool of ravenous
      urchins (but not a ravenous urchin swarm) with no trouble. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Unlike most urchins, the creatures that make up the infamous urchin swarms
    are capable of propelling themselves beneath the waves at furious speeds,
    creating a dangerous threat to pearl divers and other aquatic
    creatures-often one that's dismissed as a myth until it's far too late.
