Description:
  - >-
    One of the cruelest members of the hag race, pit hags bear great pitchforks
    with which they comb through the embers and bone piles of the deepest pits
    of Hell looking for the most forlorn souls to torment.
  - >-
    They are known to gather armies of lesser souls into brigades with which to
    carve out their own fiefdoms in the lower planes.
  - >-
    A few powerful pit hags serve as concubines and wives of pit fiends (even in
    Hell there is torment for its devilish masters), ruling their palaces in
    their stead during the pit fiend's lengthy campaigns.
  - >-
    A pit hag appears as a 6-foot tall female humanoid with crimson red skin,
    small upward pointing horns of golden-red and eyes the color of the fires of
    Hell itself. Its hands and feet end in wickedly sharp curved claws and its
    mouth is filled with razor-sharp fangs that they constantly lick with their
    forked black tongues. A pit hag has a small barbed tail (useless in combat).
  - >-
    Pit hags attack with their spells before closing in with pitchforks and
    claws. Their melee abilities are prodigious. They prefer to attack a single
    foe at a time, choosing clerics and paladins over other enemies. Given the
    chance, a pit hag uses her aura of affliction ability to disease as many of
    her opponents as she can at once before unleashing a barrage of spells on
    her hapless opponents.
