Description_Visual: >-
  At the core of this multi-limbed monstrosity of claws and blades struggles a
  glistening mass of veins, organs, and twisted flesh.
Group: Kyton
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 3
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Surgical Strikes (Ex)
    description: >-
      An interlocutor's claws threaten a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. On a
      successful critical hit, that claw deals 2d6 bleed damage rather than 1d6.
  - name: Unnerving Gaze (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature that succumbs to an eremite's unnerving gaze becomes staggered
      for 1 round as it becomes convinced that it recognizes some of its own
      body parts entangled in the interlocutor's body.
Description:
  - >-
    Interlocutors are the self-proclaimed surgeon-sculptors among kytons,
    viewing their practice as more art than medical process. Each victim is a
    new chance to study the art of pain and sensation through horror-stricken
    eyes. Their ability to heal the damage they inflict, even to the extent of
    restoring life to a subject that has only just expired, is perhaps more
    feared than their eagerness to cut flesh. To an interlocutor's victim, death
    is a mercy that is rarely offered.
  - >-
    Nowhere is the interlocutor's mastery of flesh more apparent than in their
    bodies, for their apotheosis from mortal into kyton involves the shedding of
    useless parts down to a tangle of nerves, veins, and various organs. These
    are then incorporated into bodies made of semi-living metal fashioned from
    raw shadowstuff harvested in strange reaches of the Plane of Shadow, giving
    the kyton a terrifying body. Periodically, an arm or other "leftover" limb
    is retained by the kyton, but only in the same way someone might retain
    ownership of a treasured piece of jewelry as a keepsake or memento. Some
    interlocutors retain nothing of their old bodies of flesh save the brain,
    nerves, and portions of their circulatory system.
  - Interlocutors are 9 feet tall and weigh 800 pounds.
