SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Stampede (Ex)
    description: >-
      A frightened herd of aurochs (3 or more) flees as a group in a random
      direction (but always away from the perceived source of danger). They
      literally run over (as an overrun that does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity) anything of size Gargantuan or smaller that is in their path,
      but no CMB check is necessary, and the target cannot choose to let them
      pass without taking any damage. The stampede deals 5d6 points of damage
      for every two aurochs in the herd (rounded up). Any victims of the
      stampede can make a DC 25 Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is
      Strength-based.
Description:
  - >-
    These massive aurochs (singular and plural) are prehistoric cattle that once
    roamed the plains and forests of the world in vast herds but are now on the
    verge of extinction, being found only in the primeval forests and remote
    places of the Northlands where their horns are prized trophies of the
    hunt-though many a hunter has fallen beneath their spearlike horns and
    crushing hooves in the attempt. Massive beasts, these prehistoric aurochs
    have been used as symbols of fertility and strength for many cults down
    through the ages appearing in decoration from the crudest cave paintings to
    ornate temples. When captured they command a high price for use in the
    arenas of cosmopolitan regions, though they often take a heavy toll among
    the matadors who face them.
  - >-
    Northlands aurochs stand 6 feet or more high at the withers with their heads
    rising 2 feet above that. Their characteristic lyre-shaped horns extend
    upward another 2 feet. They grow up to 18 feet long and can weigh as much as
    8,000 pounds. Males have a black coat with a pale stripe down the spine, and
    females and calves have a reddish coat. A light load for a Northlands
    aurochs is up to 3,200 pounds; a medium load 3,201-6,400 pounds; and a heavy
    load 6,401-9,600 pounds. An aurochs can drag 48,000 pounds.
