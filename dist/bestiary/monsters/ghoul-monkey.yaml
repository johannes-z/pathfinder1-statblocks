Description:
  - >-
    Ghoul monkeys are cunning, undead monkeys 2-3 feet tall, weighing 10-20
    pounds. These monkeys often appear in jungle areas where there is great
    residue of evil and chaos, such as forgotten temples or altars where dead
    monkeys might rise in this vile form of undeath. Unlike "human-type" ghouls,
    their bite does not cause paralysis.
  - >-
    They extremely vulnerable to holy water (2d6 damage) and to being turned (no
    channel resistance).
  - >-
    Ghoul monkeys lose the social drive of normal monkeys, but occasionally
    group together when the draw of evil is powerful enough.
