SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Keen Scent (Ex)
    description: >-
      A piranha swarm can notice creatures by scent in a 60-foot radius and
      detect blood in the water at ranges of up to 100 feet.
  - name: Killing Frenzy (Ex)
    description: >-
      A piranha swarm that detects blood in the water enters a frenzied state
      the following round, along with all other piranha swarms within a 100-foot
      radius. Frenzied piranha swarms bite until they or their opponents are
      dead. A frenzied piranha swarm gains a +2 bonus to damage and -2 AC for 1
      minute. The swarm cannot end the killing frenzy voluntarily.
Description:
  - >-
    Piranhas are deadly carnivores found only in warm waters, such as seas,
    lakes, rivers, and streams. They are highly aggressive and attack any living
    creature encountered or detected in the water.
  - >-
    A piranha swarm's diet consists mainly of other fish, though mammals, birds,
    and amphibians caught in the water serve as a fine meal too.
  - >-
    Piranhas are small, 8 to 12-inch long black or silvery-black fish with large
    bulging eyes and a tiny mouth lined with razor-sharp teeth. They are
    generally black or silver with a red underbelly or mottled red spots on
    their scales. Eye color is usually gray or silver.
  - Piranhas are related to both quippers and giant caribes.
  - Piranha swarms hunt during the day and are usually dormant at night.
  - >-
    Some species are ambush hunters and hide in a single clump of seaweed or
    coral, shooting out to attack prey when it moves nearby. They attack using
    their razor sharp teeth, biting and gnashing their prey. Once blood is
    spilt, the piranha swarm enters a killing frenzy.
