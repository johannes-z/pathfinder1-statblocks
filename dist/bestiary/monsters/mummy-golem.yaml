    description: >-
      As a standard action a mummy golem can attempt to wrap bandages from its
      body around a grappled foe's throat. The mummy golem makes a grapple
      check. If the mummy golem wins the check, it slips several bandages around
      the foe's throat and deals 1d4 points of strangulation damage in addition
      to constriction damage. The bandages can come from anywhere on its body,
      not just its arm or hand. Therefore, a mummy golem can continue to use its
      slam attacks, constriction, and strangulation attack against other foes. A
      Medium mummy golem can strangle a maximum of 4 opponents at one time using
      this ability. A Large mummy golem can strangle a maximum of 6 opponents at
      one time using this ability. A mummy golem is not considered grappled
      while it is strangling an opponent, and can move and attack normally, but
      it cannot move more than 10 feet away from an opponent while strangling
      it.
Description:
  - >-
    Almost always mistaken for a mummy (and sometimes for an adherer), a mummy
    golem is comprised of funerary bandages and wrappings sprinkled with mummy
    dust and held together by magic. The creature has no association with true
    mummies and is not undead so it cannot be turned or affected by clerics.
    Mummy golems are often employed by clerics and necromancers as temple guards
    or crypt and tomb guards. A mummy golem stands 6 feet tall and weighs 300
    pounds. Its body is composed of tightly knotted and rolled bandages held
    together by magic (and more bandages). Mummy golems cannot speak or utter
    any sound. A mummy golem attacks by pounding a foe with its fists. It then
    grabs an opponent and attempts to wrap its bandages around its throat. If
    facing more than one foe, a mummy golem attempts to grab and strangle as
    many of its opponents as possible so it can concentrate on one foe. Mummy
    golems are often programmed to react in certain ways to particular words or
    gestures. This programming allows the mummy golem to recoil if a cleric
    mistakes it for a true mummy and attempts to turn it. While cowering, a
    mummy golem simply waits for its foe to move within range before lashing out
    with its slam attacks. Construction A mummy golem's body is crafted from
    bandages, mummy dust, and exotic oils and spices that cost at least 1,000
