SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      A wooden or metal weapon that strikes a choleric ooze swarm takes 1 point
      of acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 15 Reflex
      save. The ooze's touch deals 8 points of acid damage per round to wooden
      or metal objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the material
      for 1 full round in order to deal this damage. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Corrosive Slime (Ex)
    description: >-
      Choleric oozes are composed of caustic chemicals. Any living creature that
      begins its turn affected by the swarm's viscous ability takes 1d4 points
      of acid damage. Armor or clothing worn by the creature takes the same
      amount of acid damage unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 15 Reflex saving
      throw. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Viscous (Ex)
    description: >-
      As described in the sanguine ooze swarm's special abilities, except that
      the Reflex save DC is 15 and the patches are destroyed if the victim takes
      any amount of electricity damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Formed from accumulations of runoff from arcane laboratories and regions of
    magical calamity, alchemical oozes are fist-sized blobs of volatile
    chemicals. Although composed of unpredictable compounds and toxins, these
    mobile oozes pose little threat individually, but in polluted quagmires and
    tainted sewers can collect in numbers great enough to threaten creatures
    many times their size. Swarms of the slimes linger in such contaminated
    areas and seek new accretions of vital solutions, like those found within
    the bodies of higher life forms, to fuel their erratic life cycles. Found in
    numerous varieties with a host of differing abilities, these weird, clinging
    oozes have been differentiated by likening them to the humors said to
    compose the bodies of living beings. Appearing at first to be a collection
    of tiny blobs of viscous, translucent fluid, alchemical oozes become far
    more terrifying once their hungry nature becomes apparent. Each swarm is
    composed of several hundred palm-sized balls of ooze that all scuttle along
    as a single unit.
