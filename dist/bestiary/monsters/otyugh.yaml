Description:
  - >-
    Otyughs are particularly vile and horrid creatures that lurk in places most
    sane creatures avoid. Their lairs are middens, cesspools, offal pits, toxic
    swamps, and sewers-the greater a lair's filth, the greater the draw to the
    refuse-eating otyugh.
  - >-
    They glory in the role of scavenger, wandering through vast underground
    caverns in search of the choicest cuts of garbage and waste. Upon finding
    such refuse, they gorge upon it, gathering what cannot be consumed in one
    debauch to bring back to their foul-smelling lairs. Otyughs spend most of
    their time in these filthy dens, which they keep constantly filled with
    carrion, dung, and worse sorts of stinking eff luvia.
  - >-
    Intelligent creatures dwelling in subterranean areas near an otyugh often
    form a partnership of convenience with the disgusting beast. These creatures
    gladly provide their refuse and piles of raw meat to the otyugh,
    transforming the creature into an effective form of trash disposal. In
    return, the otyugh leaves its benefactors alone, and does not attack them,
    possibly even acting as a guardian.
  - >-
    The most horrifying thing to most races about the notorious otyugh is not
    the nature of its diet or its choice of lairs, but rather that a creature
    with an otyugh's tastes can be anything other than a mindless scavenger. In
    fact, otyughs are surprisingly intelligent, and often quite eager to form
    alliances with those who offer them a steady supply of delicious diversions
    in the form of offal and waste.
  - >-
    Most otyughs understand the fact that other creatures find them unpleasant
    and hideous, but few really care.
