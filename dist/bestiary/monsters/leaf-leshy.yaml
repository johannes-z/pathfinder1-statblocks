  This little plant person is clad in a winglike leaf cloak and pinecone armor,
  wielding a twig as a makeshift spear.
Group: Leshy
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 3
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A leaf leshy cannot use its fly speed to hover. When flying, a leaf leshy
      must end its movement at least 5 feet lower in elevation than it started.
  - name: Seedpods (Ex)
    description: >-
      Leaf leshys sprout explosive acorns, pine cones, or other seedpods, and
      can hurl these as ranged attacks. A seedpod has a range increment of 10
      feet and detonates on contact to deal 1 point of bludgeoning damage (this
      damage is not modified by Strength). Anyone struck by a seedpod must
      succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 round. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Leaf leshys tend to the well-being of trees, whether natural stands or
    cultivated orchards. In appearance, they have soft, pulpy-looking bodies and
    wear clothing made of dozens of leaves. Larger leaves cover their shoulders,
    often giving them the appearance of wearing cloaks, and most adorn their
    relatively featureless heads with helmets made from pine cones, nuts, or
    fruit rinds. This leafy layer of clothing functions as masterwork padded
    armor for a leaf leshy, but not for any other creature.
  - >-
    Leaf leshys love to play at war. When not laboring on their trees, they
    wheedle any companions to engage in mock duels with their twig spears,
    resorting to private weapon drills when they must. In actual battle, they
    are much more cautious, sticking to cover and harrying their foes with
    hit-and-run tactics, as they have a strongly developed sense of
    self-preservation.
  - GROWING A LEAF LESHY
  - >-
    Leaf leshys are usually grown under the shade of fruit or nut trees. To grow
    a leaf leshy, the maker plants an acorn and pine cone together, then mounds
    up leaves, sticks, and needles around them. When first born, a leaf leshy
    has no armor, leafy cape, or weapon, but can construct them from available
    materials given a day and left to its own devices (no Craft check required).
