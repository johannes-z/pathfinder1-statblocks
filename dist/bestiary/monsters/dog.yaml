    The normal dog statistics presented here describe any small dog of about
    20-50 pounds in weight. They can also be used for small wild canines such as
    coyotes, jackals, and feral dogs. In the wild, dogs are vicious and
    territorial creatures. Yet even more harrowing than a pack of wild dogs is
    the rabid dog. Rabies often affects animals like bats, wolverines, and rats,
    but the transformation of a normally friendly family pet goes through when
    it becomes rabid makes the dog perhaps the most notorious of the disease's
    classic carriers. A rabid creature can transmit rabies to a victim with a
    bite. Its CR increases by 1 (or up one step, in the case of a creature whose
    CR is less than 1). Rabies Type disease, injury; Save Fortitude DC 14 Onset
    2d6 weeks; Frequency 1/day Effect 1 Con damage plus 1d3 Wis damage (minimum
    reduction to 1 Wis); Cure 2 consecutive saves
