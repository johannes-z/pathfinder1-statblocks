SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Heat Metal (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, by making a melee touch attack, a forlarren can heat metal
      (as the spell, caster level 6th, DC 12 Will save). Once the affected metal
      reaches the searing stage (after 3 rounds), it remains at that stage until
      the forlarren is killed, moves more than 100 feet from the target, or
      dismisses the effect (as a free action). Once the effect has been
      dismissed, the metal slowly returns to its normal temperature (just as in
      the spell). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The powers of a nymph are such that she can enchant and seduce nearly any
    creature that has the capacity to know beauty. Some say that even the great
    and terrible daemons are not immune to a nypmh's charms. The forlarren, they
    say, is the proof. The forlarren is a lonely creature that feels cursed by
    its own existence. They detest themselves and everything they see, consumed
    by hatred of life itself. Such is their rage that they seek to vent their
    ire on good and evil alike.
  - A forlarren stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 160 pounds.
  - >-
    The forlarren attacks with its fists, using them to pummel an opponent. It
    focuses on a single opponent in combat and attacks until it or its opponent
    is slain. If a forlarren succeeds in killing an opponent, the kindly traits
    of its fey mother surface and it shows profound remorse. It ceases combat,
    if possible, or flees if other opponents insist on continuing the fight.
    Should its opponents allow combat to end, the forlarren may offer its solace
    to the surviving companions amid wails and sobs. After a few days, however,
    the dominant evil nature of its fiendish father resurfaces and the forlarren
    once more attacks all creatures on sight-including those it had previously
    befriended.
