SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      The breath weapon of an elemental water dragon is a 50 ft. cone of
      superheated steam. This breath weapon is effective both on the surface and
      underwater.
  - name: Capsize (Ex)
    description: >-
      An elemental water dragon can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming
      it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25,
      or the result of the boat captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever
      is higher. For each size category larger than the elemental water dragon's
      size, it takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.
  - name: Drench (Ex)
    description: >-
      The elemental water dragon's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed
      lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large
      size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel
      magic (caster level equals elemental's HD).
  - name: Water Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      An elemental water dragon gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if
      both it and its foes are touching water. If the opponent or elemental
      water dragon is touching the ground, the elemental water dragon takes a -4
      penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in
      the statistics block.)
  - name: Transparency (Ex)
    description: >-
      When submerged, an elemental water dragon is effectively invisible (DC 35
      Perception check when near the surface only) until it attacks.
Description:
  - >-
    From the Plane of Water comes the elemental water dragon (also called water
    wyrm by some sages). They make their homes in the deep oceans of the
    Material Plane and are rarely found far away from large expanses of water.
    An elemental water dragon is composed entirely of water and commands respect
    from the more intelligent sea creatures as well as those humanoids that ply
    their trade upon the waters. Elemental water dragons are evil and take great
    pleasure in demanding sacrifice from those that dare enter their realm. If
    the sacrifice placates the dragon, it lets the creature pass unabated;
    otherwise, it attacks with all of its might and most often destroys those
    that offend it or fail to appease its desires. Water dragons take great
    pleasure in capsizing and sinking ships. Particularly evil water dragons may
    accept a sacrifice and then sink the ship of those that crossed its path
    anyway. On occasion, a group of skum or other evil aquatic creatures can be
    found allied with an elemental water dragon, but this alliance is usually
    short-lived and often shaky. It generally ends with the elemental water
    dragon feeding on its former allies. Elemental water dragons prefer to fight
    in or near water where they can use their transparency and water mastery
    abilities to full advantage. They prefer to attack from ambush, often lying
    in wait for their opponents and then springing from the waves to assault
    their foes. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
