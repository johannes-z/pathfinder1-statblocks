Description_Visual: >-
  A massive amalgamation of jagged bones bears a multitude of wickedly clawed
  arms and a head formed of numerous skulls held in place together. It moves
  quickly on its many limbs before rising to its full height of 12 feet and
  bringing its four skeletal arms to bear.
Group: Spontaneous Golem
Source: Tome of Horrors 4
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disassemble (Ex)
    description: >-
      When at rest with no living prey nearby, an ossuary golem as a free action
      separates into its component skeletons that lie inert in true death. In
      this form it is immune to all damage short of disintegration. As a free
      action, an ossuary golem can reassemble into its conglomerate form to
      attack. While living prey is nearby, an ossuary golem will not use its
      disassemble ability. Use of this ability does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      An ossuary golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature as noted: An animate dead spell causes
      several of the golem's bones to spell) the golem for 1d4 rounds. A raise
      dead spell with a successful touch attack deals 5d6 points of damage. A
      resurrection spell with a successful touch attack deals 1d6 points of
      damage per caster level (15d6 maximum). A speak with dead spell stuns the
      golem for 1 round as the spirits of the many deceased temporarily confuse
      it while vying for control of their individual bodies. A true resurrection
      spell with a successful touch attack deals 10 points of damage per caster
      level to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level (as the harm spell).
  - name: Wounding (Ex)
    description: >-
      The jagged, bony claws of an ossuary golem function as wounding weapons,
      dealing 1 point of bleed damage per hit. Bleeding creatures take the bleed
      damage at the start of their turns. Bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15
      Heal check or through the application of any spell that cures hit point
      damage. A critical hit does not multiply the bleed damage. Creatures
      immune to critical hits are immune to this bleed damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Spontaneous golems are constructs, much like the more common golem
    varieties, but they have no creator and are completely independent. A place
    of great pain, great fear, or great sorrow may, if conditions are just
    right, become the birthplace of one of these hideous, soulless things. These
    rare and possibly unique creatures possess a degree of cunning spurring them
    on in whatever violent impulse takes them.
  - >-
    Ossuary golems form only after many souls were slain in some catastrophic
    calamity and large quantities of intact bone lie exposed for long periods of
    time.
  - >-
    An ossuary golem cannot speak. It walks with a spindly though agile gait.
    Composed entirely of dry bones calcified into hardened rods, it weighs only
    200 pounds.
  - >-
    An ossuary golem is vicious in combat raking with its many claws leaving
    horrid wounds in their wake. Typically it focuses its multitude of attacks
    on a single opponent until the target is reduced to bloody ribbons before
    moving on to another. Based on the Spontaneous Golem type from Creature
    Collection III: Savage Bestiary by Sword & Sorcery Studio.
