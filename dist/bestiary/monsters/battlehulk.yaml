Description_Visual: >-
  A massive block of stone rolls ponderously forward on great stone rollers.
  Iron plates armor this stone monstrosity, the front of which is studded with
  spikes of iron, adamantine and stone. Great stone clubs capped in iron sprout
  from loopholes in the sides like the arms of a giant. The top of this huge
  structure is a platform surrounded by stone merlons to provide cover for any
  defenders riding upon it. At the back edge of this platform extend two chains
  that end in great stone spheres that spin on a pivoted base and lay waste to
  anyone behind the mobile fortress.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bull Rush (Ex)
    description: >-
      If the battlehulk is charging it can opt to make a bull rush attack
      without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the bull rush is
      successful, the defender is automatically pushed back the distance that
      the battlehulk moves forward past his position. The battlehulk does not
      require a check result of 5 or more higher than the defender's check
      result to determine how far back the defender can be pushed. The
      battlehulk can bull rush as many opponents as occupy the squares in its
      path of travel with the usual -4 penalty to additional combat maneuver
      checks.
  - name: Charge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Each round a battlehulk double moves in a straight line, it adds an
      additional 10 ft. to its speed as its weight and inertia propel it
      forward. It can reach a maximum speed of 80 feet in this way. A battlehulk
      can stop after charging only by striking an unyielding obstacle (like a
      mountain) or by gradually slowing. It can reduce its speed by 10 feet per
      round as it slows its momentum. A battlehulk can only turn when going at a
      speed of 30 feet or less. If traveling downhill on a steep slope, the
      battlehulk accelerates twice as fast (i.e. it goes from 10 feet, to 30
      feet, to 50 feet, etc.) and decelerate twice as slow (i.e. it takes 2
      rounds to decelerate from 80 feet to 70 feet and so on). Likewise if
      traveling up hill on a steep slope it decelerates twice as fast and
      accelerates twice as slow.
  - name: Immunities (Ex)
    description: >-
      A battlehulk is immune to acid, cold, electricity, and fire and confers
      this immunity to anyone sealed within its inner compartment.
  - name: Ram (Ex)
    description: >-
      The ram attack of the battlehulk is with the ironplated and spike-studded
      front face. The damage this attack deals is considered both piercing and
      bludgeoning. Because of the different metal compositions used in the
      spikes and enchantments placed on this front facing, this attack is both
      cold iron and adamantine and is considered magic and good-aligned for the
      purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This attack is particularly useful
      against evil outsiders.
  - name: Sweep (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full round action a battlehulk can make a bull rush attack with each
      of its slamming arms on targets within range without provoking attacks of
      opportunity. Each stone arm is considered a Large creature for this
      purpose and has a combat maneuver bonus of +45. The flail on the back is
      also capable of making this bull rush attack on any targets atop the
      platform (roll separately for each target). Anyone moved off the platform
      results in a 15-foot fall to the ground below for 1d6 points of damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Battlehulks are constructs crafted for war. They were created by the Army of
    Light to roll over enemy lines, smash enemy fortifications and, if
    necessary, fight toe-to-toe with even the mightiest balor demon.
  - >-
    It resembles a squat stone building surmounting massive stone rollers that
    provide it mobility. From embrasures in the sides (one on each side and one
    in back) project long stone arms capped in iron that the construct uses for
    slam attacks. In addition at the upper edge of the back is a massive
    swivel-mounted double flail that also provides a slam attack.
  - >-
    The front is studded with many spikes for ramming opponents. Defenders can
    ride atop the platform and obtain cover from its merlons while firing down
    on enemy troops. Normally they would lower a rope or ladder to allow other
    riders on - otherwise it requires a DC 25 Climb check (DC 35 if the
    battlehulk is moving). The battlehulk is able to reach those atop it with
    its flail slam if enemies reach that position, though not with its club
    slams.
  - >-
    In the center of the platform is a secret door (DC 25 Perception check to
    locate) leading to an interior chamber large enough to hold two Medium
    creatures. This compartment is sealed against water and air and holds enough
    air to supply two Medium creatures for 10 minutes before the door must be
    opened again or suffocation begins. Ordinarily the controller would ride
    here. Anyone opening this door other than the controller must make a DC 40
    Strength check or deal 60 points of damage against a
  - >-
    Hardness 8. These hit points are not deducted from the battlehulk's total.
    Slaying the controller does not stop the battlehulk, which continues to
    carry out the controller's last command.
  - >-
    A battlehulk is a 15-foot cube atop three 5-foot diameter stone rollers. It
    weighs about 50,000 pounds.
  - >-
    A battlehulk is nonintelligent and has no forms of communication, taking
    direction telepathically from its controller. It rolls with a grinding
    rumble, crushing anything in its path. Despite its bulk it is able to
    maneuver well since its rollers are able to swivel individually to some
    extent.
  - >-
    A battlehulk is a terror to behold in combat, and very few will willingly
    stand against one. Entire enemy formations are often routed by the mere
    presence of a battlehulk on the field. Against obstacles and large masses of
    troops, the battlehulk usually attempts its bull rush, ram, and trample
    attacks, flailing with its slamming arms at any who linger near. Against
    smaller groups it divides its slam attacks against those within range and
    focuses its ram and trample attacks at those who appear to be inflicting the
    most damage.
  - Construction
  - >-
    A battlehulk is constructed from a single block of granite and exotic metals
    and processes that cost 10,000 gp. When created it is attuned to an amulet
    or ring that is worn by a controller who can command the battlehulk
    telepathically within a quarter mile.
