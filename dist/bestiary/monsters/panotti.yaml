Description_Visual: >-
  This bald humanoid looks strikingly human except for the long folds of skin
  that droop from his head and neck to just above his ankles.

    description: >-
      A panotti can flap its huge ears to fly awkwardly. A panotti can also wrap
      its ears around the length of its body for warmth and protection from the
      elements (similar to using a bedroll or heavy blankets), or use them as
      secondary natural attacks (as per wing attacks).
Description:
  - >-
    The panotti are a race of humanoids that strongly resemble humans except for
    one startling difference: their enormous ears. A panotti's ears are attached
    to the side of their heads, like those of a human, but they remain connected
    to the body down to the neck. When at ease, the folds of their ears hang
    loosely, like an elephant's, but extend almost the length of their bodies.
    These sheets of hanging flesh and skin appear limp and superfluous, but
    appearances are deceiving. Panotti possess remarkably smooth muscle control
    along the upper ridges of their ears, allowing them to extend and control
    their ears at will.
  - >-
    Even though panotti look ridiculous by most humanoid standards, the source
    of this ridicule offers them several distinct advantages. By flapping their
    ears, adult panotti can lift off, hover, and even fly. While in combat, a
    panotti can slam opponents with its ears to propel them away. Panotti's
    hearing is sharp enough to detect the presence of even an unseen adversary.
    Finally, panotti can wrap themselves up in their ears like a cocoon, staying
    warm on the coolest of nights. Some sages speculate the panotti originated
    in a kingdom that fell beneath a curse-though the panotti themselves deny
    it. The rare couplings between a human and a panotti usually result in
    panotti children.
  - >-
    Culturally, the panotti are a reclusive people, preferring the company of
    their own kind- mostly due to the reaction they receive from other
    humanoids. Nevertheless, panotti are not a cruel or unkind race, and their
    culture is rich with music and storytelling traditions. They adapt to most
    classes with ease, but favor bard, fighter, and ranger. Treated with respect
    and dignity, panotti can be generous and steadfast allies. When treated as
    laughingstocks, however, panotti can become fierce, and they're naturally
    hearty and capable warriors.
  - >-
    On Golarion, panotti live primarily in Casmaron and central Tian Xia, with a
    much smaller number residing in Avistan.
