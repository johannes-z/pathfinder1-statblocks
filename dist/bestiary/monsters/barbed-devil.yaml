SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Barbed Defense (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that strikes a hamatula with a melee weapon, an unarmed strike,
      or a natural weapon takes 1d8+6 points of piercing damage from the devil's
      barbs. Melee weapons with reach do not endanger a user in this way.
  - name: Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      A barbed devil's fear attack affects any creature it damages with its
      claws. A DC 20 Will save resists this effect, otherwise the victim becomes
      frightened for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save
      DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Grab (Ex)
    description: A barbed devil can use its grab attack against a foe of up to Medium size.
  - name: Impale (Ex)
    description: >-
      A barbed devil deals 3d8+9 points of piercing damage to a grabbed opponent
      with a successful grapple check.
Description:
  - >-
    Sentinels of the vaults of Hell, jailers of the darkest souls, and living
    weapons of the infernal forges, barbed devils-known as hamatulas to
    diabolists-enforce the strictures of the damned and safeguard the nefarious
    works of greater devils. A hamatula enjoys the feel of warm blood on its
    spines, and prefers to leap into melee when presented with an opportunity
    for battle. Hamatulas are collectors and organizers, and are favorite allies
    of greedy summoners as they often bring with them tempting treasures from
    Hell's vaults or know the paths to deadly riches. Left to their own devices,
    the lairs of these devils often bear the pierced trophies of their past
    victims, hung like perverse bug collections on bloodied walls. Most barbed
    devils stand upward of 7 feet tall and weigh 300 pounds, though their leanly
    muscled bodies appear much larger due to the constantly growing and
    adjusting spines that protrude from their razor-sharp bodies.
