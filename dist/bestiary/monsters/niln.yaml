Description_Visual: >-
  A large amorphous cloud of nearly transparent vapor hovers. Small water
  droplets dance and play around the form and occasionally drop to the ground.
  Three large sapphire droplets centered on their form function as eyes. When
  manipulating objects or attacking, nilns form wispy and vaporous tendrils.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Drench (Ex)
    description: >-
      The niln's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other
      open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or smaller.
      The creature can dispel magical fire as dispel magic (caster level equals
      the niln's HD).
  - name: Vapor Form (Su)
    description: >-
      The niln spends the majority of its time in more or less solid form, but
      it can assume vapor form at will. It can switch forms once per round as a
      free action and can spend up to 20 rounds per day in vapor form. A niln in
      vapor form can fly at 60 feet per round (perfect). This ability is
      otherwise similar to a gaseous form spell (caster level 5th).
Description:
  - >-
    Niln hail from a plane made of air and water; a vaporous and saturated realm
    known as the Quasi-Plane of Vapor. They are normally docile creatures, but
    are quick to anger, and relentless in their attack.
  - >-
    Like many elementals, niln are most at home on their native plane and rarely
    leave it. They sometimes travel the Elemental Plane of Air when not
    traveling through their own realm, but usually do not enter other planes
    unless summoned. Should one find itself on the Material Plane, it seeks to
    escape and return to its home plane unless confined or summoned by a
    spellcaster. Assigned tasks are completed to the best of the niln's ability
    and they rarely ask for much of anything in return. On the Material Plane, a
    niln seeks sources of vapor or steam in which to bathe its form so they are
    almost always encountered in such areas.
  - >-
    When first confronted, a niln surrounds itself with its drowning fog to
    deter would-be-aggressors. Those that insist on entering the fog and
    attacking the niln are met by its physical attack; the niln forms wispy
    tendrils from its form and lashes out at its foes. A niln will use its
    drench ability to extinguish any source of light its aggressors may be
    carrying, relying on its darkvision to aid it in the darkness thus created.
