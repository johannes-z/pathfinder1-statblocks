Description_Visual: >-
  The lake's surface is calm and serene, and a cool morning mist rises from it.
  Suddenly, it is alive with activity as a massive pseudopod, towering dozens of
  feet into the air, erupts like a cyclone.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Engulf (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living lake that has grabbed an opponent can try to engulf the creature
      in its body. This ability functions as swallow whole, except for the
      following changes. An engulfed creature is trapped in the living lake's
      body, where the ooze inflicts automatic slam damage each round. In
      addition, an engulfed foe has no air to breathe and must hold its breath
      or risk drowning (see the Pathfinder Core Rulebook for rules on drowning).
      A living lake can engulf 1 Gargantuan, 2 Huge, 8 Large, 16 Medium, 32
      Small, 64 Tiny, 128 Diminutive, or 512 Fine creatures. If an engulfed
      creature cuts its way free, living lake simply flows together again and
      can still use its engulf attack.
Description:
  - >-
    Hundreds of feet across, a living lake, also called an agrath-ogh in the
    language of the orcs, is an ooze of truly colossal proportions. The first
    living lake is said to have fallen from the heavens ages ago at a time so
    ancient that no eyes were around to witness its fall. The protoplasmic body
    of a living lake is fluid in nature and transparent in water, such that one
    of these creatures could remain unseen and unknown for centuries.
  - >-
    Unlike most oozes, a living lake is a not a mindless blob of muck. It is
    intelligent, but it is also highly receptive to the thoughts and beliefs of
    any large group of intelligent creatures that live near it. A living lake
    can become a god-so to speak-because of the will of the creatures that
    worship it. Thus, it responds in a manner dictated by its own worshipers.
  - >-
    The god is created by the worshiper, instead of vice-versa. Unfortunately
    for the world, living lakes are generally found in hills and badlands- the
    very same environs favored by orcs. Living lakes worshiped by orcs are
    cruel, chaotic, destructive things, since those are the qualities most
    revered in orcish deities.
  - >-
    Once it has been ensconced as a god, a living lake uses its abilities to
    live up to the expectations of its worshipers. It can reward a tasty
    sacrifice with a life-giving rain, or punish insolence with a plague of
    insects.
  - >-
    A living lake attacks by forming pseudopods from its oozy form and pummeling
    its opponents. A grabbed foe is constricted or engulfed in the creature's
    body, usually only released when it dies or falls unconscious.
  - >-
    Against powerful opponents, or those that press the combat, the living lake
    mixes its spells with its natural attacks, usually summoning animals or
    animating plants to help it. A living lake usually forms at least one
    pseudopod per opponent it faces. It can form a maximum of one pseudopod per
    3 Hit Dice it possesses.
