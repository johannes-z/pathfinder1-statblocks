SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alluring Scent (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Menotherian's subtle aroma causes creatures in her vicinity to become
      placid and react favorably toward her. Any creature that fails a DC 25
      Fortitude save against the aura improves its attitude toward the
      Menotherian one step closer to friendly. Creatures with the scent ability
      take a -4 penalty on this saving throw. Creatures in the aura must attempt
      a saving throw each minute. This is a mindaffecting poison effect. The DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Implant (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, the Menotherian can implant eggs in a creature using its
      sting. The creature must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save to resist
      implantation. The target is nauseated for the next 2d4 rounds while the
      eggs gestate. When the eggs hatch, they form a chaotic neutral hellwasp
      swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 146), kill the host in 1 round, and
      inhabit the corpse. The eggs can be surgically removed with a successful
      DC 30 Heal check (this check deals 2d6 points of damage to the host
      regardless of success) or by remove disease or similar spells. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Mind Control (Ex)
    description: >-
      The menotherian can inject its scent into the brain of a helpless or
      willing target, controlling it for the next 24 hours (as the spell
      dominate person, Fortitude DC 25 negates), although the Menotherian must
      verbally give the target instructions. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sting-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3
      Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Description:
  - >-
    The Menotherian is a personification of lust and vengeance. Bereft of
    morals, she seduces, tricks, or murders any creature necessary to complete
    whatever mission Calistria sends her to upon. The herald stands 14 feet
    tall, has a wingspan nearing 30 feet, and weighs 1,400 pounds.
