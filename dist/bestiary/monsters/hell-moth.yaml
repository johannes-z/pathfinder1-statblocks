SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Engulf (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a hell moth grapples an opponent it can wrap a Medium or smaller
      creature in its wings and body and automatically deal bite damage in each
      round it maintains the grapple. Attacks that hit an engulfing hell moth
      deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.
  - name: Immolation (Su)
    description: >-
      A hell moth that has engulfed an opponent can detonate its body in a blast
      of hellish fire that deals 6d10 points of fire damage to itself and the
      engulfed opponent (no save). (Reduce the damage dealt to the hell moth by
      its fire resistance.) A hell moth can immolate itself once every 3 hours
      (providing it survives the immolation). Creatures within 10 feet of the
      hell moth when it uses this ability must succeed on a DC 17 Reflex save or
      take 1d8 points of fire damage as clothes and combustibles ignite. The
      damage continues for another 1d4+4 rounds after the hell moth uses this
      ability or until the fire is extinguished. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The hell moth is thought to have come from another plane, though sages are
    not quite sure of its exact origin. The hell moth attacks living creatures
    that wander too close to its lair. It otherwise resembles a large moth with
    an 8-foot wingspan.
  - >-
    Hell moths wait for their prey to pass nearby before attacking. If facing
    multiple opponents, they attempt to bite and usually do not employ their
    engulfing ability. Multiple hell moths work in concert with one another
    against opponents. When a hell moth has successfully engulfed a foe, it sets
    its own body on fire in a display of self-immolation that consumes both it
    and its engulfed opponent.
