Description_Visual: >-
  The ground shudders and the seabirds take to wing with piercing cries of
  alarm. What once appeared to be a small, rocky island reveals itself to be a
  creature of titanic proportions as an enormous tail lifts ominously from the
  water. With a thunderous crash, it slams down, sending the island plunging
  beneath the waves.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Capsize (Ex)
    description: >-
      A aspidochelone can attempt to capsize a boat or ship of Gargantuan size
      or smaller by merely passing through its space and making a CMB check as a
      free action. The DC the aspidochelone must exceed is 25, or the result of
      the boat captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher.
  - name: Captivating Scent (Ex)
    description: >-
      An aspidochelone exudes intoxicating pheromones from its skin, causing
      nearby creatures to seek it out. Anyone within a 1-mile radius must
      succeed on a DC 12 Will save or feel inexplicably drawn toward the
      aspidochelone by the most direct route possible. This effect is not an
      overwhelming compulsion, but more a subtle suggestion. The save DC is
      Charisma-based with a -10 penalty.
  - name: Deep Sea Denizen (Ex)
    description: >-
      An aspidochelone can travel to extraordinary depths, and has adapted to
      the intense darkness and water pressure of the deep. It possesses
      darkvision with a range of 120 ft. and is immune to damage from water
      pressure.
  - name: Hibernate (Ex)
    description: >-
      After gorging itself on innumerable tons of deep sea life and unfortunate
      travelers, an aspidochelone floats to the surface and goes into a deep
      hibernation with only its mottled back jutting from the waves. While
      hibernating, it appears to be little more than a rocky outcropping or, in
      the cases of the largest aspidochelone, an entire island. A hibernating
      aspidochelone is considered to have taken 20 on its Stealth check to hide
      in plain sight as a rock or island. An aspidochelone rouses from its
      hibernation for one of two reasons: hunger or disturbance. After entering
      its hibernation, a aspidochelone sleeps for 2d10x10 years, rousing
      naturally after this time has elapsed. An aspidochelone about to awaken
      usually sleeps fitfully for the last year of its rest, quivering with
      tremors that feel like earthquakes to creatures upon it. These tremors are
      treated as a minor version of the earthquake spell that affects the entire
      island, forcing creatures on the ground to make a DC 29 Reflex save to
      avoid falling down and causing 30 points of damage to all structures. An
      aspidochelone might be awakened immediately if it takes 100 or more points
      of damage in a single day. If awakened in this manner, an aspidochelone
      typically dives to escape its attacker, then rises again to consume it.
      The save DC is Constituiton-based.
  - name: Hibernation of Ages (Ex)
    description: >-
      An aspidochelone in hibernation continues to exude its captivating scent.
      Over time, birds attracted by the aspidochelone's pheromones come to roost
      on the whale, inadvertently bringing the seeds of small plants and
      shrubbery to grow in the cracks upon the aspidochelone's thick hide. The
      preponderance of plants, seabirds, and even other beasts gives the
      creature the appearance of a rocky but natural island. Thus, any
      aspidochelone who has spent more than 10 years hibernating gains an
      addition +10 bonus on its Stealth check to look like a natural island.
  - name: Watery Grave (Ex)
    description: >-
      A startled aspidochelone descends rapidly into the depths of the sea,
      creating an undertow in the water that pulls creatures above the whale
      down with it. Anyone standing on or swimming within 100 feet of the
      aspidochelone when it dives must make a DC 29 Reflex save or take 10d6
      points of damage from the crushing waves and pressure, and be pulled 100
      feet below the water. Even if a creature escapes the undertow, the water
      within 100 feet of a passing aspidochelone is treated as rough water,
      requiring a DC 20 Swim check to move at half speed. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A legendary creature of the sea, aspidochelones are eldritch whales of
    titanic size. When floating near the surface of the water, aspidochelones
    have frequently been mistaken by desperate sailors for small islands due to
    the craggy, mottled flesh of their steeply humped backs. Yet, upon tethering
    their boats to the whale's tough hide and lighting a fire to ward off the
    cold, many castaways discover to their horror that the spur of land they
    have beached upon is in fact an enormous creature. This realization comes
    too late for many unfortunate souls as the creature plunges beneath the
    waves, dragging trespassers down with it. An aspidochelone appears to be a
    huge whale with an extraordinarily thick, rock-like hide. From tail to
    snout, the creature generally measures more than 500 feet in length, and
    weighs upward of 100,000 tons. Few ever see an aspidochelone for what it
    actually is, however, having only glimpsed the pitted and uneven skin of its
    topside. As seabirds and other creatures come to rest upon the hibernating
    creature, they carry with them plant seeds and dirt. Over time, the
    accumulated plants and wildlife gives an aspidochelone the appearance of a
    small, densely inhabited island. Ecology Aspidochelones universally live in
    the deep ocean, as only such large bodies of water can sustain their
    enormous appetites. Fortunately for seafaring civilizations that rely upon
    fishing and sea trade for their livelihoods, the gigantic whales are rarely
    seen. Thought by many to be creatures of myth, the incredibly long-lived
    aspidochelones spend most of their adult lives in extended periods of
    hibernation. The creatures possess sluggish metabolisms, allowing them to
    remain dormant for decades at a time as they slowly consume the fat built up
    during previous feeding frenzies. As they float near the surface of the
    water, drifting with the oceanic currents, the whales are frequently
    mistaken for small islands. Even while hibernating, aspidochelones exude an
    intoxicating pheromone, causing birds and animals such as sea lions to seek
    them out. While the huge numbers of creatures rarely cause the beasts to
    rouse from their slumber, foolhardy human explorers or would-be settlers
    often startle them out of their reveries when they mistake the creatures'
    skin for rock or clay. Even when provoked by humans, aspidochelones seldom
    remain awake unless stirred by their ferocious hunger. When they waken, the
    whales are wracked by terrible hunger pangs and rampage about the oceans,
    seeking tons of prey to consume before sinking into their torpor once again.
    An aspidochelone is a terror during its feeding season, rightfully feared by
    seagoing civilizations as a monster of the deep come to devour the world.
    When feeding, the whales consume vast quantities of food, devouring schools
    of fish, large sea creatures, and sailing vessels alike. Such immense
    consumption of sea life frequently devastates local ecosystems, wiping out
    all food sources for dozens of leagues in every direction. Habitat & Society
    Aspidochelones do not possess any society to speak of, as they spend most of
    their time floating aimlessly about the ocean. When two aspidochelones of
    the opposite gender encounter one another, however, each creature is roused
    from its hibernation by the other's pheromones. From these unions only one
    aspidochelone is ever born, and the whales spend 6 months raising the calf
    to maturity. Once the calf becomes full-grown, the aspidochelones part ways,
    never to see one another again. Among island cultures, a number of myths
    have sprung up around the creatures. Legends speak of how an irresistible
    smell lures sailors to remote islands, only to have the entire ship and crew
    devoured by the titanic whales in a single gulp. A few outlandish myths even
    claim that the creatures have devoured entire islands, while pirate tales
    tell of fantastic treasure buried within the hides of beasts like island.
    Many of these cultures regard aspidochelones as gods of the sea that call
    men to their deaths.
