SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adaptation (Su)
    description: >-
      A xacon can, by touching an earthen, metal, stone, or wooden item of Small
      or larger size, can absorb a portion of the item's properties. A xacon
      that touches a wooden or earthen item (including the ground), increases
      its natural armor bonus to +5 (granting the xacon AC 17, touch 12,
      flat-footed 15). If the xacon touches a metal or stone item, its natural
      armor bonus increases to +8 (granting the xacon AC 20, touch 12,
      flat-footed 18). This bonus to its natural armor lasts for 1 minute. After
      using this ability, the xacon must wait 1d4 rounds before it uses it
      again.
  - name: Tree Meld (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a xacon can meld its body and possessions into a tree. This
      ability functions similar to a meld into stone spell with no duration.
Description:
  - >-
    Xacons are plant creatures that inhabit thickly wooded forests and forested
    hills and mountains. They act as protectors of nature, often times working
    with good- or neutral-aligned druids and other forest denizens when the area
    comes under attack or defilement by evil-aligned druids, foresters, and
    others who destroy the trees and surroundings without care or recourse.
  - >-
    Xacons make their homes in treetops, using the largest and sturdiest of the
    trees to hold their dwellings (small wooden huts). A typical dwelling holds
    up to four of these creatures (who may or may not be an interrelated
    family). All inhabitants of a single dwelling are adults. No young xacons
    have ever been seen. Xacon reproduction methods are unknown but sages
    believe they procreate through some form of budding.
  - >-
    Xacons stand 6 feet tall and weigh around 160 pounds. They seem to converse
    with others of their own kind through a series of hand signals and other
    gestures. They understand Sylvan but cannot speak.
  - >-
    A xacon attacks by slashing and tearing at its foes with its thorny claws.
    During battle (or before battle if it is aware of its foes), a xacon
    contacts a natural object (such as a large stone or tree) in order to
    fortify its natural armor against its foes.
