Description_Visual: >-
  You can tell that this creature was once something else, but it has somehow
  been horribly misshapen. It still retains a vaguely humanoid form, but it now
  consists of a terrible conglomeration of exposed organs and bone, gnarled
  limbs, corded muscles with patches of strange, pebbly flesh and eyes and
  mouths in unnatural locations.

  - name: Acidic Sweat (Ex)
    description: >-
      The metabolism and biology of a protocreature has been so corrupted, that
      unidentifiable caustic fluids now course through its body instead of the
      traditional humors. In the third round of combat or heavy exertion, a
      proto-creature begins to secrete this fluid through the pores of its skin
      as sweat. Anyone physically touching a protocreature (not including with a
      weapon or other object) or who is hit by a slam attack after this sweating
      begins takes 1d6 acid damage. An opponent that is grappled by a
      proto-creature takes double this damage each round that the grapple is
      maintained. A living proto-creature continues to sweat this substance for
      10 minutes following the completion of the battle or other activity that
      initiated it.
Description:
  - >-
    Proto-creatures are the results of the failed early experiments with
    protomatter by the Disciples of Orcus in their attempts to create ever
    better and more powerful servants and warriors. The proto-creatures proved
    to be too dumb and too difficult to control. Rather than destroy the beasts,
    they were instead placed in suspended animation and secreted away at various
    locations in case a use should ever be found with them.
  - >-
    All proto-creatures encountered to date have come from either humanoid or
    giant stock. Proto-creatures stand about 7 feet tall and weigh as much as
    350 pounds. Giant proto-creatures are up to 12 feet tall and 1,500 pounds.
  - >-
    The secret of their accidental creation has been lost, and proto-creatures
    cannot propagate their own species, so their dwindling numbers are limited
    to those that were first created by the Disciples of Orcus.
  - >-
    Proto-creatures exist in constant pain. The only thing that distracts them
    from this pain is the release of combat. Therefore, they always seek to
    engage other creatures in combat upon first sighting them. The fact that
    these opponents also serve as their source of food is a merely a convenient
    byproduct. A proto-creature's body has been so warped and twisted by the
    experiments that created it, that it no longer has a recognizable
    physiology. This combined with its extreme resilience makes it immune to
    acid and electricity as well as sneak attacks, critical hits, and nonlethal
    damage.
  - >-
    In combat, a proto-creatures prefers to focus its attacks on a single
    opponent, grappling and subjecting the victim to its acidic sweat as soon as
    it begins to flow. They have been known to be fooled into dropping a victim
    who goes limp and plays dead in order to move onto other opponents. Such a
    subterfuge requires a Bluff check opposed to the proto-creature's Sense
    Motive.
