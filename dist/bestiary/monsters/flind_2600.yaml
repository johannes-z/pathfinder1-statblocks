Description:
  - >-
    Flinds are a race closely related to gnolls. The two races share some strong
    similarities, and at first sight inexperienced adventurers could easily
    confuse the two. Flinds are much stockier than their lanky kin, much
    stronger and hardier, and are certainly more dangerous. It is unknown if
    flinds are a subspecies of the gnoll or a genetic anomaly produced among
    large gnoll packs. Flinds are often found among gnoll bands acting as
    leaders, as their strength and relatively superior intelligence puts them
    above their lesser brethren. Flind combat tactics are similar to those of
    gnolls. They prefer to strike from ambush, using terrain and concealment to
    their best advantage. They are most often seen acting in the role of leaders
    to gnoll bands, keeping discipline with a ruthless hand and little mercy.
    Flind Characters Flind leaders are always fighters. Flind clerics usually
    worship the Demon Prince of Gnolls and can choose two of the following
    domains: Chaos, Evil, and Trickery. All flinds have the following racial
    traits +8 Str, +4 Dex, +6 Con, +2 Int, +4 Wis, +2 Cha: Flinds are
    exceptional gnolls, and excel in all areas over their lesser kin.
    Darkvision: Flinds cans see in the dark out to 60 feet. Armor: Flinds have a
    +1 natural armor bonus. Racial Hit Dice: A flind begins with two levels of
    humanoid, which provide 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +1, and base
    saving throw bonuses of Fort +3, Ref +0, and Will +0. Racial Skills: A
    flind's humanoid levels give it skill rank equal to 2 x (2 + Int modifier).
    Racial Feats: A flind's humanoid levels give it one feat. Automatic
    Languages: Gnoll. Bonus Languages: Common, Draconic, Goblin, Orc. Weapon
    Proficiency: Flinds are automatically proficient with the flindbar.

    Flindbar The wielder of a flindbar gains a +2 bonus on disarm attempts made
    with the weapon. Flindbars are otherwise identical to nunchaku. Anyone
    proficient with nunchaku is also proficient with flindbars.
