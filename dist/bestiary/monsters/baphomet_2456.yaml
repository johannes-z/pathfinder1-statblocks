SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Rend Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action Baphomet can make a single attack with his halberd
      against a foe. If he hits, he pulls apart any armor worn by his foe. This
      attack deals 2d8+23 points of damage to the opponent's armor. Creatures
      not wearing armor are unaffected by this special attack. Armor reduced to
      0 hit points is destroyed. Damaged armor may be repaired with a successful
      Craft (armorsmithing) check. Musileim: Baphomet's unique weapon is a Huge
      +4 unholy halberd of speed. He is able to wield the over-sized weapon
      without penalty.
Description:
  - >-
    Baphomet is revered by minotaurs as their lord and deity. His iron keep is
    located within a large stone cavern on a desolate plane of the Abyss.
  - >-
    It is said his castle is a maze of twisting rooms and corridors, with his
    personal throne room located at the heart of his maze keep. Those that have
    ventured there remember little about the place other than the never-ending
    corridors and maze of rooms.
  - Baphomet stands 12 feet tall and weighs about 4,500 pounds.
  - >-
    Baphomet attacks using his bite, butting with his head, and slashing with
    his Huge halberd, Musileim. He is relentless in combat and rarely shows
    mercy to his opponents. Should he become bored with combat, he summons a
    slew of demons or minotaurs to dispatch of his opponents as he stands and
    watches the slaughter.
  - >-
    Baphomet's natural weapons, as well as any weapons he wields, are treated as
    chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
    reduction. His natural weapons are also treated as epic weapons for the
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
  - >-
    Servants of Baphomet Followers of Baphomet are usually minotaurs and
    fiendish minotaurs and consist of clerics, necromancers, and sorcerers or
    adepts. Devout followers of Baphomet are called Horned Ones and must sign a
    pact of evil with Baphomet. Horned ones are granted access to two of the
    following domains: Chaos, Evil, and War.
