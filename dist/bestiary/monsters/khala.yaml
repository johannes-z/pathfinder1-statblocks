  and uncoiling with manic energy.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Every 1d4 rounds, the khala can fire a jet of frigid liquid up to 60 feet
      in a straight line from one of its three mouths, dealing 16d6 points of
      cold damage to the target (Reflex DC 27 half). Even if this save is
      successful, the target must succeed at a second save (Fortitude DC 27) or
      be encased in ice. A trapped creature must succeed at a DC 25 Strength
      check or a DC 26 Escape Artist check to break free. Attempting to break
      free of the ice is a full-round action.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      A target bitten by a khala must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or
      contract chillbane fever. Chillbane Fever: disease-injury; save Fort DC
      17; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage and target is
      sickened and fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Tenacious Grapple (Ex)
    description: >-
      A khala does not gain the grappled condition if it grapples a foe with its
      tail.
Description:
  - >-
    It is rumored that the khala was a rare breed of amphibious dragon before
    Baba Yaga came to Golarion. Her arrival and the supernatural winter that
    came with her warped these once-proud creatures into voracious, wicked
    things that delight in the suffering of others. Each of a khala's three
    heads can strike at a separate target, though if two or more heads hit a
    single target, they cause horrific wounds as they viciously fight to devour
    chunks of its flesh. Along with suffering terrible injuries, those bitten by
    a khala risk contracting chillbane fever, a disease unique to Irrisen. The
    creature can ambulate like a snake, slithering along the ground or through
    the boughs of trees with its batlike wings drawn close to its body, but it
    prefers flight whenever possible. The khala's breath weapon, usable by a
    single head every 1d4 rounds, is a jet of freezing liquid that freezes on
    contact, trapping the target in ice.
  - >-
    All khala are female, and scholars debate how the creature procreates. Some
    believe that the males of the species, known in legend as the zmey, were
    wiped out in a war with the khala prior to Baba Yaga's arrival.
