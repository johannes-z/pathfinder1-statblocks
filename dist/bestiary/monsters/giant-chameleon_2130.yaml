      A giant chameleon can grab a foe with its tongue and draw the victim to
      its mouth. This tongue attack has a reach of 15 feet. The attack does no
      damage, but allows the creature to grab. A giant chameleon does not gain
      the grappled condition while using its tongue in this manner.
