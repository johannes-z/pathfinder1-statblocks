Description:
  - >-
    The banderlog is a somewhat intelligent baboon-like primate that makes its
    home in warm forests and jungles. Though it appears as a larger version of
    the common baboon, it does not keep company with or associate with normal
    baboons. Banderlogs' intelligence allows them to form small tribal
    communities for protection and companionship. The leader of such a community
    is usually the largest and strongest banderlog of the tribe. It is not
    uncommon to find more than one tribe in the same area. Banderlogs generally
    coexist quite well with other banderlog tribes, though if food becomes
    scarce, they attempt to drive off all other tribes in the area. Banderlogs
    sustain themselves on a diet of fruits and nuts, with coconuts being their
    favorite food. Though omnivorous, they rarely eat meat of any sort. The
    typical banderlog stands just over 4-feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds.
    Banderlogs are non-aggressive unless they are threatened. They prefer to
    attack opponents from a distance using small rocks or coconuts to hit their
    foes. Should they be engaged in melee, they attack using a vicious bite.
