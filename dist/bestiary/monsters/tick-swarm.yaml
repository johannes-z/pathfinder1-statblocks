SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cling (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a creature leaves a tick swarm's square, the swarm takes 1d6 points of
      damage to reflect the loss of its numbers as several ticks cling to the
      victim. A creature with ticks clinging to it takes swarm damage at the end
      of its turn each round. As a full round action, the creature can remove
      the ticks with a DC 20 Reflex save. At least 10 points of damage from any
      area effect destroys all clinging ticks. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bubonic Plague: Bite- injury; save Fort DC 21; onset 1 day; frequency
      1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage, 1 Cha damage, fatigue; cure 2 consecutive
      saves. The DC is Con-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Tick swarms are merciless blights, able to quickly reduce the larger animal
    life of a region they infest to blood-drained, diseased husks.
