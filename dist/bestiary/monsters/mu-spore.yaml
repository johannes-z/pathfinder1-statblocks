SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Grasping Tendrils (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sticky, arm-length tendrils cover a mu spore. A mu spore can use these
      tendrils to attempt a grab as an immediate action when an adjacent
      creature hits it with a melee attack. As it is only using the tendrils
      (instead of conducting the grapple normally), it takes a -20 penalty to
      its CMB to make and maintain the grapple (+31 CMB with tendrils). The mu
      spore does not gain the grappled condition while grappling a creature with
      its tendrils.
  - name: Spore Cough (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a mu spore can release a cloud
      of burrowing spores in a 100- foot cone. The burrowing spores deal 20d8
      points of damage to all creatures and wooden structures in the area, or
      half damage to any creatures that make a DC 34 Reflex save. Plants and
      plant creatures are immune to this damage. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A mu spore is a thankfully rare plant of vast power and strange intellect.
    The smallest of mu spores (such as the one presented here) are never less
    than a hundred feet long from tentacle tip to tentacle tip, and weigh a
    minimum of 200,000 pounds. Yet despite their vast bulk, mu spores are
    capable of flying with an uncommon grace, venting jets of foul-smelling
    spores to guide their flight through the air.
  - >-
    Mu spores dwell in vast caverns, but sometimes drift up to the surface
    through immense pits or tunnels-they have no fear of sunlight, but prefer
    nocturnal habits. Mu spores are more than just ravenous eaters of
    nations-they possess uncommon intellects, and if peaceful contact can be
    made, their knowledge can be quite valuable. Even more valuable, to many
    debased alchemists, are the strange secretions and spores they emit, for
    these rare materials can be brewed into the strangest of drugs and elixirs.
