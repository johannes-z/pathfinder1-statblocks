SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Slippery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bloody bones are difficult to grapple or snare due to the constant flow of
      blood and mucus across their bodies. Webs, magic or otherwise, do not
      affect bloody bones. Against most other forms of confinement the bloody
      bones gains a +15 racial bonus to Escape Artist checks.
  - name: Tendril (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bloody bones can fire up to 4 sinewy tendrils from its body at a time,
      launching them to a range of 30 feet. A bloody bones's attacks with its
      tendrils resolve as ranged touch attacks. These tendrils are quite strong
      (10 hp) but can be severed with a slashing weapon or a sunder combat
      maneuver. Attacking a bloody bones's tendril does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity. If the tendril is currently wrapped around a target, the
      bloody bones takes a -4 penalty to CMD to resist the sunder attempt.
      Severing a tendril deals no damage to a bloody bones.
Description:
  - >-
    Bloody bones are evil undead spirits that haunts caverns, caves, and other
    desolate places. Their true origins are unknown, but they are believed to be
    the undead remains of those who desecrate evil temples and are punished by
    the gods for their wrongdoings.
  - >-
    From a distance, they are likely to be mistaken for skeletons, but those
    that make this mistake often regret it, for the bloody bones is far worse
    than the undead creature it resembles.
  - A bloody bones stands about 6 feet tall. It is unknown if they can speak.
  - >-
    A bloody bones prefers to hide in the shadows and wait for its prey to pass
    nearby. It then leaps to the attack, entwining its opponents with its
    tendrils and clawing its prey until dead.
