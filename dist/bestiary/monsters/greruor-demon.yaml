SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid and Fire Spittle (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a greruor can spit a 30-ft. long line of acid that
      deals 4d4 points of acid damage. On the greruor's next turn, the acid
      ignites and the opponent bursts into flames taking 1d6 points of fire
      damage per round until extinguished. A successful DC 21 Reflex save halves
      the acid damage and prevents the creature from catching fire. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Greruors serve in the infernal armies of several demon lords, particularly
    Tsathogga. They are strong, powerful, and brutal demons that delight in
    inflicting pain on others. They are extremely loyal and follow orders
    without question. Some greater demons, like nalfeshnees and glabrezus,
    relish the flesh of greruors' legs and often organize hunting parties to
    track and slay the frog demons. The greruors however are not the weak-minded
    brutes they appear to be and often win such confrontations using their
    deadly ranseurs and their large numbers to turn back their opponents.
  - >-
    A greruor appears as a massive, squat, bloated, frog-like demon with arms in
    place of its forelegs. Its wide, frog-like head has two 3-foot long horns
    protruding just above its deep, sunken eyes. It moves by hopping on its rear
    legs. Its arms end in talons which are usually clutched around the greruor's
    deadly ranseur. Its huge mouth sports razor-sharp teeth of a dull gray
    color. The greruor stands about 8 feet tall when on all fours.
  - In combat, they stand on their hind legs and attack with their ranseur.
  - >-
    The greruor's flesh is greenish-brown mottled with red or gray. Its skin
    constantly oozes and secretes a thick, mucus-like clear slime that is slick
    to the touch.
  - >-
    Greruors enjoy combat and seek it wherever they can find it. Normally they
    rely on their natural attacks, spittle, and weapons to fell opponents. If
    outmatched, they use confusion to disorient opponents, followed closely by
    shatter. Grabbed opponents are often held in the mouth of one greruor while
    another stabs the victim with its ranseur.
