  - name: Hypnotic Gaze (Ex)
    description: >-
      Creatures meeting the gaze of a floating eye must succeed on a DC 10 Will
      save or stand and stare blankly at the floating eye (similar to the
      effects of a hypnotism spell) for 1d6+1 rounds. A swimming creature that
      fails its save does not sink, but floats on the surface of the water. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Floating eyes are small saltwater fish that have transparent bodies and a
    single large eye about the size of a walnut located in the center of their
    body. Floating eyes are most often found underground in forgotten dungeon
    waterways and underground lakes and seas. The creature's eye is capable of
    bioluminescence, and it has such minute control over the intensity and
    patterns of the light that it can mesmerize other creatures that see it.
    Floating eyes are part of an unusual symbiotic relationship with a variety
    of predatory fish, including sharks. Once the floating eye has mesmerized
    its prey, predatory fish move in and consume it. After they have eaten, the
    floating eye moves in and gorges itself on the scraps.
  - >-
    Floating eyes avoid combat, relying on their hypnotic gaze ability. If
    forced into combat, they bite an opponent.
