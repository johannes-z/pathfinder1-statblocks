SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      Hutijin can cause fear by speaking (this is a free action). Creatures
      within 30 feet that hear his voice must succeed on a DC 30 Will save or be
      affected as though by a fear spell (CL 20th). A creature that successfully
      saves cannot be affected again by Hutijin's fear ability for one day. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Hutijin is a loyal servant of Mephistopheles and commands 2 companies of pit
    fiends in the infernal armies of the eighth plane of Hell. Hutijin is a
    noble Mephistopheles' court and commands much respect from the other dukes
    and nobles. His battle prowess and strong demeanor command respect from the
    other dukes of Hell.
  - Hutijin stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,000 pounds.
  - >-
    Hutijin prefers to summon devils to deal with interlopers or adversaries,
    rather than waste time fighting them in melee. However, if pressed into
    combat, he fights with his trident, all the while peppering his foes with
    fireballs.
