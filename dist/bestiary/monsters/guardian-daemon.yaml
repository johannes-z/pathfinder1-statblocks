    description: >-
      The realm of a guardian daemon encompasses only the area it is summoned to
      guard; a room, chamber, or treasure. The area can be no larger than 100
      feet + 10 feet per caster level of the one who summoned it. The guardian
      daemon can wander freely in its area, but cannot move beyond the precincts
      of the designated area.
Description:
  - >-
    Summoning a Guardian Daemon A guardian daemon can be summoned by a planar
    ally, greater planar ally, planar binding, greater planar binding or similar
    magic that allows a spellcaster to bring an outsider to the Material Plane.
  - >-
    A guardian daemon is summoned to the Material Plane by a spellcaster with
    the task of guarding an area or treasure. These daemons vary in size and
    appearance, though most resemble large bears, wild cats, or apes with added
    daemonic characteristics (horns, elongated fangs and nails, and so on).
    Despite its varying appearance and form, the guardian daemon is a dangerous
    adversary. A typical guardian daemon stands 9 feet tall and weighs about 800
    pounds. Most guardian daemons are of neutral slant, though many, due to
    their daemonic heritage, are evil and usually only serve those of like
    alignment. A guardian daemon only initiates combat if the area it is
    guarding is entered or the treasure it is watching over is disturbed. Though
    guardian daemons can move both upright and on all fours, it always fights in
    a bipedal stance. When engaged in combat, it may move freely, but never
    leaves the area it is guarding (see limited domain above). A guardian daemon
    attacks using its breath weapon, bite, and claws. It defends the area it is
    tied to until either it or its opponents are dead. Credit The Guardian
