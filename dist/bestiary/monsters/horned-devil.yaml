Group: Devil
Source: PFRPG Bestiary
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Infernal Wound (Su)
    description: >-
      The damage a horned devil deals with its tail causes persistent wounds
      that deal 2d6 points of bleed damage. Bleeding caused in this way is
      difficult to staunch-a DC 26 Heal check stops the damage, and any attempt
      to heal a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed on a DC
      26 caster level check or the spell does not function. Success indicates
      the healing works normally and stops all bleed effects.
  - name: Stun (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a horned devil hits with a spiked chain attack, the opponent must
      succeed on a DC 27 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. This
      ability is a function of the horned devil, not of the spiked chain. The
      save DC is Strength-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Among the deadliest of the archdevils' warriors and able commanders of
    lesser fiends, horned devils spread the rule of Hell wherever they tread.
    These greater devils are trained, forged, and reforged to be among the most
    lethal, merciless, and obedient warriors in the multiverse. While
    rank-and-file horned devils are called cornugons, the greatest of their kind
    are known as malebranche.
  - >-
    A typical horned devil rises to a hulking 9 feet tall, bears 14-foot-wide
    wings, and weighs 700 pounds.
