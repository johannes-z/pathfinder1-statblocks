SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      A humanoid slain by an apparition becomes an apparition itself in 1d4
      rounds. Spawn so created are less powerful than typical apparitions, and
      suffer a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks. They also receive -2 hp
      per HD, and a -2 penalty to the Will save DC of their spectral
      strangulation ability. Spawn are under the command of the apparition that
      created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose
      their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and free-willed apparitions.
      They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
  - name: Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)
    description: >-
      A raise dead or similar spell cast on an apparition destroys it (Will
      negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material
      component.
  - name: Spectral Strangulation (Su)
    description: >-
      An apparition attacks an opponent by implanting a suggestion in the
      victim's mind, convincing it that it is being strangled by the
      apparition's bony claws. The apparition must be on the same plane as the
      target creature to use this ability. The target of the spectral
      strangulation feels the bony, claw-like fingers of the apparition at its
      throat-even through armor. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Will save to
      disbelieve the suggestion. A creature that successfully saves cannot be
      affected again by the same apparition's suggestion for one day. On a
      failed save, the victim must immediately succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save
      or die from fright due to heart failure. If the Fortitude save succeeds,
      the victim acts as if affected by a fear spell for 1d4 rounds. A creature
      protected by magic circle against evil or protection from evil cannot be
      affected by an apparition's spectral strangulation. This is a
      mind-affecting fear effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)
    description: >-
      Apparitions on the Material Plane are utterly powerless in natural
      sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and flee from it. An apparition
      caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered.
Description:
  - >-
    Apparitions are undead spirits of creatures that died as the result of an
    accident. The twist of fate that ended their life prematurely has driven
    them totally and completely to the side of evil. An apparition is often
    mistaken for a ghost or spectre. Apparitions hate all living creatures and
    attack them on sight. Apparitions are ethereal creatures and they exist
    mainly on the Ethereal Plane.
  - An apparition looks much like it did in life.
  - >-
    An apparition has no physical attacks and attacks by fear alone. By
    implanting a suggestion in a victim's mind, it attempts to actually scare
    the life out of its opponent. Once the apparition selects a target, it uses
    its spectral strangulation ability. If overpowered or if it fails in its
    attempt to slay a living creature, the apparition flees back to the Ethereal
    Plane.
