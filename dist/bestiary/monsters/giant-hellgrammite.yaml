      Upon its death, a hellgrammite's massive jaws close tightly and lock. Any
      creature or object that is grappled at the time of the hellgrammite's
      death takes an additional 1d8+2 points of damage per round unless it makes
      a DC 22 Escape Artist check, makes a DC 20 Strength check, or deals an
      additional 10 points of damage to the hellgrammite's corpse to escape.
Description:
  - >-
    Giant hellgrammites are the fierce and predacious larvae of dobsonf lies of
    terrifying size. While their diminutive brethren measure several inches
    long, the monstrous variety measure 10 feet long and weigh up to 800 pounds.
  - >-
    The body of the giant hellgrammite is long and flattened, and generally
    ranges from dark brown to reddish in color.
  - >-
    The front third of its body consists of a well-armored head and thoracic
    segments, with stout, segmented legs. The head possesses a fearsome set of
    jaws, small antennae, and a set of clustered eye spots on either side. The
    posterior twothirds of the hellgrammite consist of nine densely haired
    abdominal segments, each with a pair of lateral filaments and gill tufts
    underneath for underwater breathing. The hellgrammite's abdomen ends in pair
    of terminal prolegs, each with a pair of hooks, which aid the creature in
    climbing or anchoring itself in fast-moving currents, and can be used in a
    tail slap to slash at its enemies.
  - >-
    The giant hellgrammite is a simple but ferocious predator. It latches onto
    its prey with its deadly jaws and proceeds to crush the life from it,
    feeding on the body after its victim can no longer struggle. The
    hellgrammite often attempts to drag the prey back to a protected area
    between or behind stream boulders, or down to the bottom of a deep
    side-pool. The strength of a hellgrammite's jaws is so great that, even in
    death, they clench tightly and do not relinquish their grip.
