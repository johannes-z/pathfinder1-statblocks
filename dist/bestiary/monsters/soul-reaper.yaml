  color. It grips a gleaming, silver-bladed scythe in its claws.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Soul Slash (Su)
    description: >-
      If a soul reaper scores a critical hit with its scythe, the target must
      succeed on a DC 26 Fortitude save or have its soul torn from its body and
      pulled into the soul reaper's scythe. If the save succeeds, the victim
      takes an extra 3d6 points of damage. A soul reaper's scythe can hold a
      number of souls equal to its Charisma bonus (four souls for a typical soul
      reaper). This effect is similar to a trap the soul spell. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. A creature's soulless body collapses into a desiccated
      husk, and in one day crumbles to dust. To reclaim a captured soul, the
      reaper must be destroyed and its scythe shattered on consecrated ground.
      When the scythe is shattered, all souls trapped are released and seek
      their original body (if it's been less than one day since the body was
      killed). Creatures without a body are left to wander in spirit form but
      can be returned to life through the successful casting of a miracle, wish,
      or true resurrection spell.
  - name: Inseparable Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A soul reaper has a mystic and magical connection to its scythe. If
      separated from its scythe (if the soul reaper is disarmed, for example)
      and within 100 feet of it, it may summon it to its hands as a move action.
      If an opponent is holding the weapon when the reaper summons it, that
      opponent must succeed on a DC 26 Strength check or the weapon flies from
      its hands to the soul reaper. The check DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Soul reapers are vile undead with a fierce hatred for the living. They exist
    only to kill, and take great pleasure in slaying any living creature they
    encounter. They kill without guilt, without feeling or remorse, and without
    emotion; drinking the soul of their victim to insure it never returns to
    life.
  - >-
    Soul reapers have no ties to the land of the living, in that they have
    always existed and have always been. Their origins are unknown, but
    speculation says they stepped from the great void at the beginning of
    creation. It is thought that only six or seven of these creatures exist (and
    most living beings are thankful of that).
  - >-
    Soul reapers are 12-foot tall humanoid creatures shrouded in long, black
    hooded cloaks. Though they are corporeal creatures, their form is either
    shrouded in utter darkness or formed of the stuff of shadows.
  - >-
    No discernible facial features are visible under the hood. The creature's
    hands end in wicked claws of inky blackness that are always clutched tightly
    around its gleaming, sharp scythe. These creatures never speak and no one
    knows if they even can (and if they could, what would one say to a soul
    reaper?) Soul reapers haunt civilized lands searching for the next victim
    who will fall prey to the deadly scythe and its soul-draining powers. When
    it encounters a living creature, the soul reaper casts unholy aura on
    itself.
  - >-
    It then pinpoints an enemy spellcaster and uses its deafness ability, or
    selects the most powerful foe (its best guess) and hits it with blindness.
  - >-
    Invisible opponents are no match for the soul reaper and it often targets
    them first, just to show them that they cannot hide from its deadly blade.
  - >-
    When it closes to melee, the soul reaper uses a full attack with its scythe
    against its closest opponent.
