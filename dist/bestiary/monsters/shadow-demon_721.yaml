SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sprint (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per minute, a shadow demon increase its fly speed to 240 feet for 1

  - name: Shadow Blend (Su)
    description: >-
      During any conditions other than bright light, a shadow demon can
      disappear into the shadows as a moveequivalent action, effectively
      becoming invisible. Artificial illumination or light spells of 2nd level
      or lower do not negate this ability.
  - name: Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shadow demon is utterly powerless in bright light or natural sunlight
      and flees from it. A shadow demon caught in such light cannot attack and
      can take only a single move or standard action. A shadow demon that is
      possessing a creature using magic jar is not harmed by sunlight, but if it
      is struck by a sunbeam or sunburst spell while possessing a creature, the
      shadow demon is driven out of its host automatically.
Description:
  - >-
    Tales of demonic possession are common, used often by the ignorant to
    explain strange or violent behavior. While the majority of such cases are
    merely manifestations of madness or derangement, those that are legitimate
    possessions are often the work of shadow demons. Unlike many demons, shadow
    demons are incorporeal. When a particularly envious and evil mortal soul is
    pulled into the Abyss, it is transformed, split apart, and combined with
    other souls until what emerges is little more than jealous malevolence
    without the impediment of a physical body.
