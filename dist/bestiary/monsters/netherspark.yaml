SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Negative Energy Aura (Ex)
    description: >-
      Being composed of negative energy, a netherspark radiates an aura of such
      energy in a 10-foot radius. Any living creature within this area takes 1
      point of damage per round until it leaves the area. Undead in the area
      heal 1 hit point each round they remain in the area. Undead cannot more
      hit points than their normal total from the netherspark's aura.
  - name: Negative Energy Burst (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a netherspark can release a burst of negative
      energy in a 20-foot radius around it. Creatures in the area take 1d8+10
      points of negative energy damage. Undead take no damage but heal a number
      of hit points equal to what the ray would otherwise deal.
  - name: Negative Energy Ray (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round as a standard action, a netherspark can release a ray of
      negative energy with a rangte of 40 feet as a ranged touch attack. A
      target hit takes gains one negative level if it fails a DC 22 Fortitude
      saving throw. On a successful save, the target avoids the negative level
      but still takes 1d8 points of negative energy damage. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Nethersparks are natives of the negative energy plane that sometimes find
    themselves lost in the material plane where they seek to transform positive
    energy into a negative charge. On their home plane, they are attracted to
    living organisms, and seek to transform them into nothingness where both
    they and their home plane absorb the creature's positive essence. On the
    material planes these creatures are often found haunting graveyards or in
    the employ of a powerful necromancer. Undead creatures are attracted to, and
    can detect the presence of a netherspark within 60 feet.
  - >-
    A netherspark stands about 6 feet tall and weighs about 180 pounds. Its body
    is entirely composed of negative energy and dark matter. No facial features
    are discernable on its head, though the creature can see, hear, and speak.
  - >-
    A netherspark begins combat using its negative energy ray before closing
    into melee range. In close combat, the creature rains blow after blow down
    on its adversaries with its powerful fists. The creature continually moves
    around during combat attempting to expose as many targets as possible to its
    negative energy aura. A netherspark's natural weapons are treated as magic
    weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
  - >-
    A netherspark's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are
    treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
