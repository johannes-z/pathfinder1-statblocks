Description:
  - >-
    Ryven are known as badger-folk by those of other races. In appearance, they
    resemble man-sized, bipedal badgers. They are a battlehardened race, warring
    mostly with elves or centaurs, and many ryvens carry the scars of such
    battles with pride. Ryven prefer to battle with their natural weapons,
    relying on their claws and fangs to down their foes. Some carry weapons,
    usually short swords, daggers, and light crossbows. More insidious ryven
    sometimes coat their weapons or crossbow bolts with death adder poison.
    Ryvens prefer to attack from surprise. Often, a ryven burrows underneath an
    unsuspecting foe and emerges from the ground in a blast of rock and dirt,
    catching the opponent by surprise. It then tears into its opponent with
    teeth and claws. Ryven have managed to gain some control over their
    animalistic behavior and when angered and raging, can attempt to end the
    rage. Ryven Society Ryven are tribal folk and build large burrows and
    tunnels that travel deep into the ground. Leaders are always the strongest
    and largest of a tribe. Tribes rarely number more than 20 creatures, so it
    is not uncommon to find more than one tribe sharing the same burrow. Ryvens
    are carnivores and actively hunt sources of meat. Favorite meals include
    sheep, goat, deer, and reptiles such as snakes, especially vipers. Ryvens
    are not adverse to eating humanoid flesh and sometimes dine on captured
    enemies. They consume massive quantities of meat, much more than one would
    normally expect a creature of their size and stature to consume, so most
    tribes keep a ready supply of meat handy. They are nocturnal creatures so
    most encounters occur at night. Raiding parties also conduct their business
    at night, seeking out those who would camp or sleep too close to the ryven's
    lair. Such unfortunates are either robbed or killed, or both. The goods and
    gear of slain foes are carried back to the burrow and stored. If the raiding
    party is also on a hunting excursion, slain foes are likewise carried back
    to the lair and stored until they are eaten. Entrances and exits to a ryven
    burrow are well camouflaged so enemies and predators cannot locate easily
    them. Each burrow consists of many interlocking passageways (most large
    enough to allow the ryvens to walk upright) and chambers. Such chambers
    function as living quarters, storage, battle grounds, or temples for the
    tribe. Temples are considered highly sacred places to a ryven tribe and are
    always well-protected and guarded. Most ryven tribes keep company with
    badgers or dire badgers. Ryvens as Characters +4 Strength, +6 Dexterity, +6
    Constitution, -4 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom. Strong and agile, ryven characters
    make excellent rogues or fighters. Each ryven tribe has at least one shaman,
    usually a druid. Ryven clerics worship Domga, "the Badger God" and can
