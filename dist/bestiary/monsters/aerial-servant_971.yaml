SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Link with Caster (Ex)
    description: >-
      When summoned, the aerial servant creates a mental link between itself and
      the caster who summoned it. Should the aerial servant fail the mission it
      has been assigned, it returns to the caster and attacks him. The aerial
      servant can find the caster as long as he is on the same plane of
      existence. If the caster leaves the plane, the link is temporarily broken.
      Once the caster returns or the aerial servant enters the plane the caster
      is on, the link is immediately reconnected and the aerial servant moves at
      the full speed toward the casters current location. Only when the aerial
      servant or caster is destroyed is the link permanently broken.
  - name: Natural Invisibility (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability is constant, allowing the aerial servant to remain invisible
      even when attacking. This ability is inherent and is not subject to the
      invisibility purge spell. This ability does not function on the Astral
      Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but instead grants the creature concealment
      (20% miss) chance.
  - name: Wind Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, an aerial servant can release
      a blast of wind in an 80-foot line. A creature struck takes 4d8 points of
      damage, and creatures up to the aerial servant's size or smaller are
      knocked knocked back 2d10 feet and prone. An affected creature can attempt
      a DC 22 Reflex save to reduce the damage by half and avoid being knocked
      down. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Aerial servants are semi-intelligent creatures from the Elemental Plane of
    Air that often roam the Astral and Ethereal planes. They normally are only
    found on the Material plane as a result of being summoned by a cleric (or,
    less frequently, a wizard) and commanded to perform some task, often being
    required to use their immense strength to carry objects of aid their
    summoner. Though an aerial servant performs whatever task is asked of it, it
    resents being summoned and forced to do the bidding of another; therefore,
    it attempts to pervert the conditions of the summoning and its mission. An
    aerial servant that fails or is thwarted in its mission becomes insane and
    immediately returns to the caster who summoned it, either killing the caster
    or carrying the caster back to the Elemental Plane of Air with it. Aerial
    servants are invisible on the Elemental Plane of Air. On other planes, they
    can be seen, though only vaguely, and appear as humanoids composed of
    whitish-gray vapor. Sometimes eyes, a nose, and a small mouth appear in the
    vapor. Aerial servants speak Auran.
  - They understand Common, but do not speak it.
