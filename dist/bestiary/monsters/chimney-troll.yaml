SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Inhale Flames (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a chimney troll can inhale a single nonmagical fire
      up to the size of a campfire within 30 feet. This extinguishes the fire
      and grants the chimney troll regeneration 3 (acid, cold) for 3 rounds. If
      the fire is attended (such as fire on a held torch), a successful DC 13
      Reflex save negates this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Soot Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a chimney troll can exhale a searing cloud of smoke
      and cinders that fills the lungs of a targeted creature within 30 feet.
      The victim takes 1d6 points of fire damage and becomes nauseated for 1d3
      rounds. A successful DC 13 Fortitude save halves the fire damage taken and
      negates the nausea effect. This ability can be used once each time the
      chimney troll inhales flames and only within 3 rounds of using that
      ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Wicked Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      Chimney trolls cannot heal hit point damage naturally (such as by
      resting).
Description:
  - >-
    Chimney trolls are gaunt, pale giants that skulk among the shadowy rooftops
    of towns and cities, searching for flames to heal their cursed wounds and
    flesh to sate their bellies. To claim the fire they need to survive, they
    twist their limbs into impossible positions, hiding in chimneys and sucking
    up the flames from frightened townsfolk's hearths.
  - >-
    By some cruel twist of fate or malicious necromancy, chimney trolls'
    accursed bodies can heal wounds only if they consume the very substance
    trolls loathe most: fire. This desperate reliance on fire has made them
    anathema to their kin, who long ago drove them from their mountain homes and
    into civilized lands.
  - Chimney trolls are 9 feet tall and weigh 350 pounds.
