Description:
  - >-
    Chimney trolls are gaunt, pale giants that skulk among the shadowy rooftops
    of towns and cities, searching for flames to heal their cursed wounds and
    flesh to sate their bellies. To claim the fire they need to survive, they
    twist their limbs into impossible positions, hiding in chimneys and sucking
    up the flames from frightened townsfolk's hearths.
  - >-
    By some cruel twist of fate or malicious necromancy, chimney trolls'
    accursed bodies can heal wounds only if they consume the very substance
    trolls loathe most: fire. This desperate reliance on fire has made them
    anathema to their kin, who long ago drove them from their mountain homes and
    into civilized lands.
  - Chimney trolls are 9 feet tall and weigh 350 pounds.
