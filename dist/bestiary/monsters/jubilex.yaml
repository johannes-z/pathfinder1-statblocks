SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      Jubilex secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material and
      metal quickly, but does not affect stone. Each time a creature takes
      damage from Jubilex's acid, its clothing and armor take the same amount of
      acid damage. A DC 38 Reflex save prevents damage to clothing and armor. A
      metal or wooden weapon that strikes Jubilex also dissolves immediately
      unless it succeeds on a DC 38 Reflex save. Jubilex's acidic touch deals 38
      points of damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but he must remain
      in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage. The save
      DCs are Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Jubilex is the ruler over all slimes, oozes, jellies, and other disgusting
    and foul ooze-like creatures. Known by some as the Faceless Lord, his
    Abyssal home is a steaming, bubbling lair of putrid ooze and slime pits that
    are constantly shifting and changing at his whim. Even the other demonic
    rulers loathe to journey here. Jubilex makes his home in a huge slime pit
    somewhere on one of the many planes he controls. He is constantly attended
    by and surrounded with all sorts of slimes and oozes. When confronted, he
    usually takes the form of a 12-foot tall column of bubbling and squirting
    ooze. Jubilex weighs about 6,000 pounds. Jubilex lashes out with a slimy
    appendage, attempting to grab and constrict opponents. Grabbed creatures are
    crushed and cast aside, to be dissolved and devoured at a later time.
    Jubilex can flatten his body, thereby enabling him to squeeze through cracks
    and openings of Tiny or larger size. Servants of Jubilex Followers of
    Jubilex are evil humanoids with an affinity for slimes, jellies, and all
    things that ooze. Devout followers of Jubilex are called Masters of the Ooze
    and must sign a pact of evil with Jubilex. Masters of the Ooze can receive
    spells from Jubilex and are granted access to two of the following domains:
    Chaos, Evil, and Water. If you have G5 Chaos Rising by Necromancer Games you
    can allow clerics of Jubilex to select spells from the Ooze domain rather
    than the Water domain. Credit Jubilex originally appeared in the First
    Edition Monster Manual (Â© TSR/ Wizards of the Coast, 1977) and is used by
