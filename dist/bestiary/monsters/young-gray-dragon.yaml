    Gray dragons are evil dragons that inhabit mountains and hills near
    coastlines. They have little regard for other races and often enslave others
    to do their bidding. Adult and older gray dragons are rarely found without a
    retinue of humanoid slaves. Gray dragons mate for life and a single mated
    pair often terrorizes nearby villages, laying waste to those that oppose the
    dragon's will.
