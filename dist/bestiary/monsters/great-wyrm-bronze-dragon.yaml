SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Electricity Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      An old or older bronze dragon has an aura of electricity. All creatures
      within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the start of the
      dragon's turn. An ancient dragon's aura is 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage
      increases to 2d6. A bronze dragon can suppress this aura at will.
  - name: Repulsion Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Instead of a line of electricity, a bronze dragon can breathe a cone of
      repulsion gas. Targets must make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing
      but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age
      category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.
  - name: Tidal Wave (Su)
    description: >-
      A great wyrm bronze dragon can cause the sea to rise up and crush his
      enemies once per day as a standard action. This affects an area of
      coastline 120 feet in length and targets all creatures within 40 feet of
      the shore-treat the targets as if struck by an avalanche. Treat all
      creatures as if they were in the bury zone. The save DC to halve this
      damage is equal to the dragon's breath weapon DC. Those who fail their
      saves take full damage and are drawn 60 feet off shore and deposited 20
      feet under the surface on the round after the wave hits.
  - name: Vortex (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, an ancient or older bronze dragon can create a vortex as a
      standard action, just like an elder water elemental. A bronze dragon can
      maintain this vortex for 1 round per age category.
  - name: Water Breathing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bronze dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and
      abilities underwater.
  - name: Wave Mastery (Su)
    description: >-
      For up to 10 minutes per age category per day, a juvenile bronze dragon,
      along with creatures or vessels within 50 feet, can move at twice its
      normal speed in water.
Description:
  - >-
    Bronze dragons have been known to ally with travelers and adventurers if the
    cause and reward is right and just.
