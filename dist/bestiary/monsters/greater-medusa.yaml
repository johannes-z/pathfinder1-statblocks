      The blood of a greater medusa is highly poisonous even to the touch. A

      described above. The blood loses its potency one hour after being exposed
      to air.
Description:
  - >-
    The greater medusa is a rare form of the normal medusa. They are very
    solitary creatures and dwell far from civilization, rarely leaving their
    lairs. In all other respects, they behave as the normal medusa (see the
    Pathfinder Roleplaying Games Bestiary).
  - >-
    A greater medusa attempts to disguise itself until its prey is within range.
    It then unveils its face and attempts to petrify its chosen victim.
  - >-
    Creatures that avert their eyes are attacked with the greater medusa's
    snakes and weapons.
