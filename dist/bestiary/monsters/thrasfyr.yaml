SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Entangling Chains (Su)
    description: >-
      A thrasfyr can control the six chains that hang from its body as if they
      were its own limbs. As a standard action, it can cause these chains to
      snake outward to a radius of 30 feet. All creatures in this area take 10d6
      points of slashing damage and become entangled-a DC 20 Reflex save halves
      the damage and negates the entangled condition. An entangled creature can
      escape with a DC 20 Reflex save or a DC 30 Escape Artist check made as a
      full- round action. The chains can also be sundered (hardness 10, hp 20,
      Break DC 28). The thrasfyr creates these chains from its own
      body-destroyed chains regrow in 24 hours. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
      Master's
  - name: Bond (Su)
    description: >-
      A thrasfyr can form a bond with a willing creature by touching that
      creature. This allows the thrasfyr to communicate telepathically with the
      bonded creature with no range restriction (provided the thrasfyr and its
      master are on the same plane). Both thrasfyr and master can sense the
      other's condition as if both were under the effect of a status spell. A
      thrasfyr can maintain a bond with only one master at a time.
  - name: Planar Acclimation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A thrasfyr is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of
      what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.
Description:
  - >-
    The legendary thrasfyr is one of the Tane-a group of powerful monsters
    created by godlike beings from the primal world of the fey. A thrasfyr
    without a master prefers to dwell in rugged hilly regions, where it spends
    most of its time slumbering and dreaming-it is said that all thrasfyrs dream
    of themselves as graceful and beautiful fey, for legends say that the first
    thrasfyrs were created from such creatures as a form of punishment.
