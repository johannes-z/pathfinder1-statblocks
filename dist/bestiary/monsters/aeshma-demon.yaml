SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Rage (Ex)
    description: >-
      An aeshma that takes 50% or more of its total hit points in damage in
      combat flies into a berserk rage on its next turn, swinging madly with its
      spear. A raging aeshma fights until either it or its opponent is dead. An
      enraged aeshma gains +4 Strength and -2 AC. The aeshma can end its rage
      voluntarily.
Description:
  - >-
    Aeshma are the demons of rage and anger. An aeshma is sometimes referred to
    as "the fiend of the wounding spear." Aeshma are thoroughly malign and evil
    and care little for anything or anyone else. They are actively recruited
    into the Abyssal armies of the demon lords and princes for their skill and
    combat prowess. Often an aeshma is given the rank of commander or lieutenant
    and granted control over a retinue or battalion of lesser demons (usually
    vrocks or dretches).
  - The typical ashema stands 8 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds.
  - Most aeshma disdain the use of armor, but occasionally don chainmail.
  - Aeshma are very potent fighters and prefer a straight fight to subterfuge.
  - >-
    They fight aggressively against any foe, relying on their claws only if they
    are unarmed.
  - >-
    An aeshma's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated
    as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
    reduction.
