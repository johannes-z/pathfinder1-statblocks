Description:
  - >-
    A wasp swarm is a flying mass of thousands of carnivorous wasps. In such
    large numbers, they become voracious hunters, capable of taking down large
    creatures with their venom-filled stings. While a wasp swarm is capable of
    inf licting hundreds of stings, its true danger arises from its insatiable
    appetite for meat.
  - >-
    Wasp swarms surround and attack any living prey in their paths, and are
    swift to seek out new prey once their anger is aroused. An enraged wasp
    swarm often loses track of its hive or the original source of its anger, and
    presented with a constant series of new targets to swarm and sting, a swarm
    can continue its rampage nonstop until it is destroyed or dispersed.
