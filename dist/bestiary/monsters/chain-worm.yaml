  - name: Trilling (Ex)
    description: >-
      By rapidly vibrating its carapace, a chain worm emits a high-pitched
      trilling sound that stuns and deafens all creatures within range. All
      living creatures within 30 feet that hear it must succeed on a DC 22
      Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds and deafened for 24 hours. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Chain worms are subterranean predators with an insatiable appetite for meat.
    The creature has a particular fondness for dwarf, gnome, and bugbear flesh.
    Chain worms often build their nests near communities of these creatures so
    their food supply is readily available. Though not particularly fond of cold
    or damp weather, a chain worm can be found just about anywhere as its
    chitinous body offers it ample protection against less than friendly
    environments.
  - >-
    A chain worm's nest is a hole or tunnel littered with rocks, bones, refuse,
    and debris, and often located on a rocky outcropping or ledge making it
    inaccessible to most creatures. Any valuables found in its lair are simply
    the remains of a previous meal that the chain worm couldn't digest or didn't
    bother eating.
  - >-
    Chain worms stand nearly 6 feet tall and are about 10 feet long with silver
    carapaces and dull silver legs. Their heads sport oversized dull black
    mandibles that constantly drip brownish-gray saliva. Its tail stinger is
    about a foot long and black (as it ages, its tail stinger changes to dull
    gray).
  - >-
    A chain worm lies in wait for a meal, attacking whenever its target comes
    within range. It attacks using either a nasty bite or by curling its rear
    body forward and stinging with its tail stinger. If a chain worm grabs a foe
    in its mandibles, it holds it and repeatedly stings it until it is dead.
