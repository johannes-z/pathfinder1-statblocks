Description:
  - Poisonous frog swarms are composed of small, fierce, poisonous frogs.
  - The swarm moves collectively, hopping or jumping toward their prey.
  - >-
    Single poisonous frogs mate during the second half of the year. The male
    attracts a female through a series of unique mating calls consisting of
    strange guttural sounds. When a female answers the call, she lays a clutch
    of 1d6 eggs in a damp, dark area covered with leaves. The male fertilizes
    the eggs and protects them during their incubation period. Two weeks later
    the eggs hatch and the male carries the tadpoles to the water on its back.
    Tadpoles reach maturity in two to three months.

    A single poisonous frog is a small dark green frog with black bands or
    stripes on its hind legs. These stripes function as a warning to predators
    that the frog is poisonous. The skin of a poisonous frog is very smooth to
    the touch. The middle digit on each of its extremities is slightly shorter
    than the others.
  - >-
    Poisonous frog swarms attack by engulfing their prey and subjecting it to
    the frog's deadly poison. Creatures that begin their turn in a poisonous
    frog's space suffer swarm and poison damage.
