  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A dracolisk's breath weapon depends on what type of dragon parent it had,
      as summarized on the table below. Regardless of its type, a dracolisk's
      breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds (and no more than three
      times per day), deals 4d8 points of damage, and allows a DC 19 Reflex save
      for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. Dracolisk Variety

Description:
  - >-
    The vicious dracolisk is a rare crossbreed of dragon and basilisk. No one is
    quite sure how the dracolisk species came to be, but all who have
    encountered it are well aware of its lethality. There is believed to be one
    species of dracolisk for every species of dragon. Thus far, however, most
    dracolisks encountered have been of the black variety. At first glance, a
    dracolisk appears to be a juvenile dragon of whatever color its dragon
    parent was-but thanks to the petrifying gaze it inherited from its basilisk
    parent, most who encounter a dracolisk never get a second glance. A
    dracolisk has a scaled body the same color as its dragon parent that fades
    to a lighter shade on its underside. A short, curved horn, similar to a
    rhino's, juts from its nose. Its dragon-like wings match its body color but
    fade to a slightly darker shade near the tips. A dracolisk's eyes are pale
    green with sparkles that match its dragon-parent color. A typical dracolisk
    is 15 feet long and weighs about 3,000 pounds. A dracolisk's environment
    varies based on its dragon heritage: black dracolisks can be found in warm
    marshes, deserts, or underground; blue dracolisks favor warm hills and
    mountains, rarely being found underground; green dracolisks favor temperate
    or warm forests and underground settings; red dracolisks favor warm
    mountains and underground settings; and white dracolisks favor cold
    mountains, cold deserts, and underground. The dracolisk attacks first with
    its breath weapon and gaze attack. After this, it attacks with its bite and
    clawed forelegs. Credit The Dracolisk originally appeared in the First
