SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cheek Pouch (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant hamster can try to stuff a grabbed opponent of two sizes smaller
      than itself into its cheek pouch by making a successful grapple check. A
      creature stuffed into the giant hamster's cheek pouch takes no damage, and
      can escape by making a successful DC 16 Strength check or can cut its way
      out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 10 points of
      damage to the cheek (AC 11). Once the creature exits, muscular action
      closes the hole; another trapped opponent must cut its own way out. A
      Large hamster's cheek can hold 1 Small, 2 Tiny, or 8 Diminutive or smaller
      opponents. The check DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Immune (Ex)
    description: Giant hamsters are immune to all diseases (magical and otherwise).
Description:
  - >-
    Giant hamsters are larger, slightly more aggressive relatives of the normal
    hamster. Like their smaller cousins, they come in a variety of colors,
    shapes, and sizes. Giant hamsters are omnivorous, but prefer to feast on a
    diet of grains, berries, nuts, and water. On occasion, they indulge in and
    eat meat, usually insects and the like. Also like its smaller cousin, the
    giant hamster can store food in its cheek pouches. The average giant hamster
    can store about 200 pounds of food at any given time.
  - >-
    Giant hamsters normally shun combat, but if cornered or extremely hungry
    they may attack. Note that even domesticated giant hamsters attack if their
    young are threatened. The giant hamster attacks by biting with its long,
    sharp teeth.
