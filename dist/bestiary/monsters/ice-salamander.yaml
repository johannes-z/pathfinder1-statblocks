Description:
  - >-
    Ice salamanders are malign creatures that dwell on the elemental planes
    where Water meets Air. Scholars speculate an entire plane (a para-elemental
    plane of cold or ice) exists where the Plane of Air and Plane of Water meet.
    There, the great ice salamanders make their homes carved into great icebergs
    or upon vast sheets of ice. Upon their home plane, the ice salamanders
    gather in large, loose tribes, led by the strongest member of the group.
    Infighting is common among tribal members and should a dispute escalate, it
    is usually settled in a makeshift arena where all participants fight to the
    death.
  - >-
    When summoned to the Material Plane ice salamanders can be found in arctic
    regions where the temperatures are constantly freezing or lower (which to an
    ice salamander is still too warm). On the Material Plane, ice salamanders
    are often found acting as guards for high-level wizards or temple guardians
    for clerics of the frost gods. Some ice salamanders find their way to the
    Material Plane on their own, in areas where the elemental planes have
    spilled over to the Material Plane.
  - >-
    An ice salamander stands about 6 feet tall with a serpentine head and the
    lower torso of a salamander. Its scales are blue mottled white, and its
    underbelly is stark white. Its eyes are ice blue and its pupils are dark.
    Cold seems to emanate from the creature at all times.
  - >-
    Ice salamanders jump headlong into melee, slashing their opponents with
    their wicked spears or claws. Prisoners are rarely taken, unless the ice
    salamanders are instructed to do so. Most of the time, prey is devoured as
    soon as it's killed.
