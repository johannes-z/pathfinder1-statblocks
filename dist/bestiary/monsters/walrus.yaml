Description:
  - >-
    Walruses normally have gray or brown hides, fading to nearly white when
    immersed in cold water, and turning pink from increased blood flow when
    basking in the sun. A thick layer of blubber serves as protection from both
    predators and cold. A typical male walrus weighs 1 to 2 tons and measures 10
    feet in length, with females about a third lighter and about 9 feet long.
    Both sexes have tusks up to 3 feet long, and stiff whiskers used to feel out
    the hiding places of shellfish. A walrus lives up to 40 years. Owing to
    their fearsome tusks, prodigious strength, and willingness to fight as a
    herd, only the most aggressive or hungry polar predators risk attacking an
    adult walrus. People hunt walruses for meat and for their tusks, valued for
    their worth as ivory and as impressive trophies in their own right.
