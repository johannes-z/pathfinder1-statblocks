SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Advanced Analytics (Ex)
    description: >-
      A director robot gains a bonus equal to its Intelligence bonus on all
      saving throws.
  - name: Cling (Ex)
    description: >-
      A combination of magnetic pads and electrostatic emitters in its feet
      allow a director robot to climb and travel on vertical or horizontal
      surfaces without having to attempt Climb checks, even allowing it to
      traverse these surfaces while upside down.
  - name: Electromagnetic Pulse (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a director robot can unleash an
      electromagnetic pulse that deals 6d6 points of electricity damage to any
      robots or creatures with cybernetic implants within a 20-foot radius
      (Reflex DC 20 half). This bypasses any active force fields or similar
      effects, but doesn't harm other living creatures or the director robot.
      Any technological item within this radius is drained of 1d6 charges unless
      it succeeds at a DC 20 Reflex save. The save DCs are Intelligence-based.
  - name: Grasping Tentacles (Ex)
    description: >-
      A director robot's tentacles are primary attacks and have the grab special
      ability.
  - name: Integrated Laser Rifle (Ex)
    description: >-
      A director robot has a built-in laser rifle. This weapon has a range of
      150 feet and deals 2d6 points of fire damage on a hit. The weapon can fire
      once per round as a ranged touch attack. A laser attack can pass through
      force fields and force effects, such as a wall of force, to strike a foe
      beyond without damaging that field. Objects like glass or other
      transparent barriers don't provide cover from lasers, but unlike force
      barriers, a transparent physical barrier still takes damage when a laser
      passes through it. Invisible creatures and objects are immune to damage
      from lasers. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to
      concealment from laser attacks. Darkness (magical or otherwise) has no
      effect on lasers other than providing concealment.
  - name: Override (Ex)
    description: >-
      A director robot can usurp control of an otherwise functional robot. In
      order to gain control of a robot, the director robot must first make a
      ranged touch attack against a target robot within a range of 60 feet. If
      the attack is successful, the targeted robot must succeed at a DC 20 Will
      saving throw to prevent the director robot from linking to the target's
      command processor. On any subsequent turn after a link is established, the
      director robot can issue a command to the targeted robot as a standard
      action. The targeted robot can attempt another Will save (DC 20) to resist
      following each command. To command its target, the director robot must be
      within 60 feet of the targeted robot and must issue the command in a
      language the robot understands. The types of commands it can issue are
      similar to those allowed by a suggestion spell-once a command is
      successfully issued, the robot does its best to carry out the orders over
      the course of the next hour. Additionally, any robot affected by this
      ability also gains a +2 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage
      rolls. These save DCs are Intelligence-based.
  - name: Repair Robot (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity, a
      director robot can repair damage done to either itself or an adjacent
      creature with the robot subtype, healing the target for 1d10 points of
      damage.
Description:
  - >-
    No society endures without order, and among robots that order is enforced by
    directors. Clad in gleaming metal and viewing the world through a rotating
    array of lenses, a director is a robotic overseer designed to maximize
    efficiency and command the loyalty of lesser automatons. Its torso rests
    upon a utilitarian egg-shaped pod loaded with manipulators, tools, and
    dozens of thin mechanical tendrils. Four long, mechanical legs support its
    bulk and carry it across any terrain, even allowing the robot to cling
    magnetically to vertical surfaces. While the upper frame sports human-like
    arms to manipulate traditional tools and weapons, two powerful tentacles
    extend from below its frame to facilitate combat and handle heavy lifting.
    Though its humanoid torso is barely larger than that of a human, the
    director's entire frame stands over 10 feet tall and weighs nearly half a
    ton.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Directors are middle managers built to ensure efficiency, productivity, and
    obedience. They oversee complex projects and protect networks of robots from
    outside corruption. A unit of robots controlled by a director goes about its
    business swiftly and with mechanical precision, taking what organic beings
    might mistake for pride in conserving resources or completing projects
    rapidly.
  - >-
    Naturally, director robots need neither rest nor food, and their internal
    generators provide nearly limitless power. Designed to be adaptable, they
    function with equal ease on the battlef ield, within winding corridors, deep
    underwater, and upon starship hulls in the vacuum of space. The magnetic
    claws that carry the director's bulk up sheer surfaces with surprising speed
    and grace are also perfectly suited to dragging damaged robots from the
    field.
  - >-
    To better analyze and respond to threats, directors are programmed with a
    remarkably advanced artif icial intelligence, capable of limited
    self-awareness and interaction with others. Their sophisticated systems
    easily overwhelm and seize control of other computer-operated devices,
    dredging memories and secrets from robotic minds, setting them to whatever
    work the director prioritizes, and removing any corrupting outside inf
    luence.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    A director robot's role is to break down the high-level goals of their
    superiors into simple instructions for lesser robots. While not fully
    self-aware in ways organic beings appreciate, their cold, clean minds take
    something like comfort in hard work, and experience distress if kept from
    their duties or left devoid of purpose-those without a clear goal often
    become obsessive, directing lesser robots to create order for its own sake.
    Surprisingly social, they fare poorly in isolation without other machines to
    interact with and direct.
  - >-
    Like all robots, directors are built, not born. With neural networks almost
    as advanced as androids', newly activated units undergo a learning period
    during which they reconcile their reams of programmed knowledge with the
    unpredictable tendencies of reality. This digital "infancy" is a confusing
    time, and these robots exhibit extreme frustration while learning to adapt.
    Other directors are especially wary of these child units, and keep a
    cautious eye sensor on them, always prepared to jump in and override the new
    robot if it proves incapable of translating theory into practice.
  - >-
    Directors rarely stray from their heavily technological environments. On
    Golarion, they usually cling to Silver Mount, but sometimes accompany a
    legion of the Technic League gearsmen unbidden, ignoring orders from human
    masters and watching over their mechanical charges with an almost religious
    devotion. Some directors operate within Starfall where they direct other
    robots used by the Technic League.
  - >-
    Tightly guarded reports held by the Technic League claim that a rogue
    director robot maintains a hidden lair somewhere in central Numeria. The
    robot has taken over a splintered section of Divinity that contains a
    technological laboratory, and the reports claim that it's building its own
    army of robotic followers.
