Description:
  - >-
    The goblinoid race of bugbears infests all regions of the world, and these
    cruel creatures have adapted to the various climes where they make their
    homes. In the icy wastes, a race of albino bugbears called wikkawaks stalk
    the windswept glaciers and frozen mountaintops. Well adapted to the cold,
    wikkawaks are masters of stealth and arctic survival, and they have the
    ability to quell lanterns, torches, and campfires with a thought. Wikkawaks
    leave no trail in even the heaviest of snows, though salt sprinkled on snow
    can supposedly reveal a wikkawak's tracks. Of course, by the time one has
    discovered a wikkawak's trail, it could already be too late.
  - >-
    Like most bugbears, wikkawaks normally lead a solitary existence, preying on
    isolated settlers and hunters like pale arctic serial killers. Their
    powerful noses can sniff out a humanoid or animal over great distances. The
    rank smell of fear is a powerful stimulant to wikkawaks, and an individual
    wikkawak hunter might stalk and terrorize a potential victim for several
    nights, "steeping" its prey in dread and terror before finally pouncing.
    Wikkawaks consider humanoid flesh a great delicacy, and one might freeze a
    dead humanoid in a remote area, only to return to its grisly cache again and
    again to savor the taste of the victim for weeks on end. Wikkawaks enjoy
    keeping mementos of their victims, and prefer fingers as trophies. Wikkawaks
    occasionally congregate in larger groups, either to find mates or to better
    terrorize a large settlement. Wikkawak pairings seldom last longer than a
    winter, and young wikkawaks are pushed out into the cold to fend for
    themselves as soon as they've grown their fur. Wikkawaks don't enjoy the
    company of other goblinoids, and are just as likely to kill and eat a tribe
    of snow goblins as they are to rule their lesser kin. A wikkawak is covered
    in a thick pelt of insulating white fur, and its beady eyes are a dead white
    color. A typical wikkawak stands just over 7 feet tall and weighs around 450
    pounds.
