Description_Visual: >-
  This creature appears to be formed of crystal or glass. Its scales are
  semi-transparent and appear razor-sharp. Its head is angular with two
  blade-like horns swept back across its crown. A glass fin-like crest starts
  near the base of its skull, runs down the center of its back and tapers off as
  it reaches the monster's tail. Its large wings are translucent and the sound
  of grating glass can be heard as the beast moves.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A glass wyrm's breath weapon is a 40 ft. cone of razor-sharp shards of
      glass.
  - name: Reflective Hide (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any mundane or magical light source brought within 30 feet of a glass wyrm
      causes the light to be reflected as a burst that blinds all creatures
      within 30 feet for 1d6+4 rounds. A creature can attempt a DC 22 Fortitude
      save to negate the blinding effect. This otherwise operates like a gaze
      attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Spell Reflection (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance and targets a
      glass wyrm (or includes it in its area of effect) is reflected back on the
      caster if the glass wyrm successfully resists the spell or effect. The
      original caster becomes the spell's target (or its point of origin in the
      case of area spells). A reflected spell can be resisted normally by the
      caster (and any other creatures affected). A glass wyrm cannot reflect a
      sonic-based spell or spell-like ability, even if it allows resistance.
Description:
  - >-
    Glass wyrms are relatives of other dragons and are believed to have their
    origin on another plane of existence. They make their home beneath the
    surface world and enjoy the relative solitude of the underground world.
  - >-
    Their lairs normally consist of a maze of twisting and winding corridors
    meant to confuse and befuddle trespassers. Their lairs are littered with
    scores and scores of gemstones and broken glass (thought to come from the
    glass wyrm's scales).
  - >-
    Glass wyrms sustain themselves on a diet of gemstones and natural minerals,
    and rarely eat meat (though their draconic heritage does occasionally rise
    to the surface thereby instilling the taste for such things in them).
  - >-
    In battle a glass wyrm relies on their breath weapon and natural attacks,
    switching between them as the battle warrants. Powerful foes are always
    targeted first and subjected to the monster's breath weapon. Some glass
    wyrms keep torches or other light sources scattered about their labyrinthine
    lairs so they can use their reflective hide to blind trespassers and enter
    combat quickly before their opponents can react.
