SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Deepest Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      A bogeyman is cloaked in a 30-foot aura of fear. This aura manifests as a
      shifting haze of images that reflect the viewer's deepest fears. The first
      time it ends its turn within the aura, a creature must make a DC 25 Will
      save or become shaken for as long as it stays within the aura. If the
      creature succeeds at the saving throw, it cannot be affected again by the
      aura for another 24 hours. This is a fear effect. The DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Striking Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      If a bogeyman confirms a critical hit or a sneak attack with one of its
      claws on a target currently suffering a fear effect, that effect
      automatically becomes one step more severe (shaken creatures become
      frightened, frightened creatures become panicked, and panicked creatures
      cower in fear). A DC 25 Will save negates this increase. In addition, a
      critical hit from the bogeyman's claw forces any target that has
      successfully saved against the creature's fear aura to make another Will
      save against its effects, even if 24 hours have not yet passed. This is a
      fear effect. The DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Terrible Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      A bogeyman gains fast healing 5 while any creature within its deepest fear
      aura is suffering from a fear effect, including any fear effect created by
      the aura itself.
Description:
  - >-
    Many believe that the most cruel and mischievous fey become bogeymen as a
    punishment or a reward for their actions. Others see bogeymen as
    supernatural manifestations of society's willingness to do itself harm.
  - >-
    Bogeymen use their powers to haunt houses or secluded natural places where
    they can hunt prey unobserved. They relish using their ghost sound ability
    to hint at their presence long before they fully reveal themselves. It is
    not uncommon for a bogeyman to hide under a bed, or in a closet left
    slightly ajar, for days or even weeks, all the while feeding on its victims'
    growing realization that they are not alone.
  - >-
    The most evil bogeymen are those who abandon the tactic of feeding on one
    person's fears at a time and take up roles of mass murderers or serial
    killers, or other pursuits designed to drive fear into the hearts of an
    entire city of victims. True to their name, all bogeymen are male.
    Sometimes, children whom they steal away to secret lairs emerge years later,
    transformed into new bogeymen, and return home to continue their
    supernatural father's work.
