Description:
  - >-
    Pandas spend most of their lives alone, avoiding even other pandas except
    during mating season. They are excellent climbers, with front paws
    configured much like humans' opposable thumbs to help them grip bamboo
    stalks and tree branches. Bamboo shoots make up almost their entire diet,
    although pandas are technically omnivorous. In part because of the low
    nutritional value of bamboo, pandas lack the energy for aggression, and
    avoid danger wherever possible.
