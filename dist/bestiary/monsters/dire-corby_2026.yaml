    description: >-
      A dire corby can perform a special kind of pounce attack by jumping into
      combat. When a dire corby charges, it can make a DC 20 Acrobatics check to
      jump into the air and land next to its enemies. If it succeeds at this
      Acrobatics check, it can make a full attack (two claw attacks, plus a rend
      attack if both claws hit) against foes in reach. If it fails, it can still
      make its one attack as normal for a charge.
Description:

    Dire corbies are subterranean predators that resemble humanoid crows with
    muscular arms and fearsome claws. Though they make their cliff-side homes on
    the walls of underground chasms, where they climb and leap with
    death-defying agility, they are most frequently encountered in the tunnels
    where they wait to ambush prey, leaping down from the ceiling to rend and
    tear.
  - >-
    Dire corbies are intelligent, but have little use for society outside of the
    rough, squabbling pecking order of their rookeries, where their social order
    is little better than that of the
