SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Slime Strand (Ex)
    description: >-
      A leopard slug can turn its mucus into a 30-foot-long strand, much like a
      spider's silk. It can hang from this strand indefinitely, and lower itself
      safely at a rate of 10 feet per round. It can climb back up the strand at
      the same rate. Once the slug breaks contact with the strand, the mucus
      disintegrates in 1d4 rounds.
  - name: Suction (Ex)
    description: >-
      A leopard slug secretes sticky mucus, which allows it to apply its 10-foot
      climb speed to any surface, even sheer walls and ceilings. Once attached
      to a surface, it has no chance of falling off, unless it's grappled and
      actively peeled away.
Description:
  - >-
    Leopard slugs are among the largest species of slug, and are certainly the
    most distinctive due to their unique coloration, which often resembles that
    of a leopard. This characteristic pattern allows leopard slugs to blend in
    with foliage and stones in the forest environments they call home.
    Occasionally, one can find more colorful varieties of leopard slug (such as
    fluorescent orange, bright yellow, or flaming red), bred specifically as
    pets or familiars by the esoteric masters who prefer such creatures.
  - Leopard slugs are about 6 inches long and weigh less than a pound.
