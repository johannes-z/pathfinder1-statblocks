  This four-armed fiend has blue-green skin covered in white scars. Its two

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Damning Scourge (Su)
    description: >-
      Each of a nixudaemon's upper arms functions as a Large +1 deadlyUE
      mercifulUE viciousUE whip. Attacks with these whips count as natural
      attacks for the nixudaemon, have a reach of 20 feet, and don't provoke
      attacks of opportunity. The whips can't be disarmed or sundered, nor can
      they be dropped to allow the nixudaemon to avoid being tripped because of
      failing a combat maneuver check to trip. The nixudaemon decides before
      each attack roll whether to apply the weapon's merciful special ability,
      its vicious special ability, both, or neither.
  - name: Dead Tired (Su)
    description: >-
      A nixudaemon's attacks drain every bit of vitality from its victims when
      they die. Raising a creature killed by a nixudaemon (via raise dead or
      another effect that restores life) requires a successful DC 20 caster
      level check. The restored creature gains the exhausted condition,
      regardless of the spell used to raise it. The DC of this caster level
      check is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. A nixudaemon can
      use its temporary resurrection spell-like ability without attempting this
      check, even if another nixudaemon killed the subject.
  - name: Enslave (Su)
    description: >-
      If a nixudaemon successfully uses its grab ability to grapple a foe with
      its whip attack, its tendril wraps around the victim's throat. The daemon
      can forgo its constrict damage and instead attempt to dominate the
      subject, as the spell dominate monster (Will DC 18 negates). A creature
      dominated by a nixudaemon is immune to fatigue, exhaustion, and pain
      effects. At the beginning of its turn, a dominated slave automatically
      receives a new saving throw to end the effect. The nixudaemon can dominate
      only one creature at a time per whip arm it possesses (typically two). The
      save DC for this ability is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Nixudaemons, or "toil daemons," epitomize death by exploitation and extreme
    exertion. These fiends savor the moment when a desperate scholar collapses
    while putting in long, unappreciated hours, or when a galley slave finally
    succumbs to the lash. They drive burdened subjects before them to great
    effect, even resurrecting fallen servants for a brief time to complete vital
    tasks. Their skill for squeezing the last bit of energy from those under
    their supervision makes them invaluable to slavers, who pay the daemons in
    coin, information, and souls for their aid.
  - >-
    Nixudaemons exemplify the cruelty and disdain all daemonkind display toward
    the living. They lash out at their subjects, whipping the life out of them
    slowly. If it serves the daemon's purposes, or if time allows for another
    game of torture, a nixudaemon will revive its subject for another day.
    Typically, a nixudaemon uses this ability to incite a band of slaves to work
    harder; it dominates the weakest members of the workers to temporarily
    bolster them, then saps their last ounce of strength before discarding them
    as spent husks.
  - >-
    Most nixudaemons stand 10 feet tall and weigh 600 pounds. Sages report that
    the fiends grow larger and stronger as they age, absorbing the weariness of
    their victims over centuries. The greatest toil daemons are said to tower
    over their younger cousins, growing additional whip-arms and learning
    powerful spells that exhaust or even kill those who dare offend them.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Nixudaemons roam the shores of the Styx. The daemons use their impressive
    reach to press new souls into service as soon as the doomed arrive on
    Abaddon, throwing the
  - >-
    ill-fated souls into enormous slave pens and hauling them to the realms of
    wealthy customers. Nixudaemons frequently visit the Material Plane, where
    greedy despots and desperate commandants pay high prices to the daemons in
    exchange for providing additional labor.
  - >-
    Rituals designed to call nixudaemons must be conducted while an intelligent,
    mortal creature labors physically, and the daemon's preferred sacrifice is
    working that creature to death as part of the ritual. One ancient story
    alleges that a mighty hero among an oppressed people worked for weeks,
    dragging great stone blocks to build a grand ziggurat. When he finally fell,
    the story claims, his death summoned a nixudaemon over 30 feet tall that
    lashed out with a dozen whips.
  - >-
    Nixudaemons despise laziness in both mortals and outsiders. They work their
    subjects past the point of exhaustion or death as suits their current needs.
    The nixudaemons view other creatures as weak or prone to sloth, challenging
    even other daemons they perceive as less than diligent.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Nixudaemons occupy the role of merchants in daemonic society. They buy and
    sell the hunted, as Abaddon petitioners are known, when not outright
    capturing or stealing them. Powerful mortal slavers sometimes increase the
    value of their wares by hiring a summoned nixudaemon to drive slaves to
    maximum efficiency, but such arrangements still benefit Abaddon in the end.
    While summoned to the material world, nixudaemons obtain multiple forms of
    currency for the Four Horsemen's coffers. They engage in a dark form of
    proselytization, beating those who grow weary in their work and spreading
    the belief among the oppressed that there is no hope of recognition or rest.
    More discerning nixudaemons assail the mortal merchant classes, driving
    entire firms to adopt competitive climates until the stress of achievement
    reveals itself in the form of failing health, or pushing lone inventors to
    complete magical theories with their dying breaths. Because soft, wealthy
    mortals rarely succumb to the temptation to work themselves to death, some
    nixudaemons have been known to engineer the sale of wealthy scions into
    slavery, as their nightly sobbing and rapidly developing sores are music to
    the toil daemons' ears.
  - >-
    Nixudaemons understand the value of teamwork and work tirelessly together to
    great effect. In service to mortals and greater daemons, they have driven
    hordes
  - >-
    of slaves to erect legendary monuments. They revel in the misery they cause,
    and the crack of their whips against backs and around necks.
  - >-
    While their industrious natures and affinities for mortal business make them
    useful to each of the Four Horsemen, most of nixudaemons serve Szuriel,
    Trelmarixian, and the daemonic harbingers that scheme below them. The
    Horseman of War uses them as morale officers-a most effective paradox during
    the heat of battle. She also maintains special units of indentured prisoners
    under nixudaemon care, always breaking her promise to send her weary
    combatants home after a costly battle. The Horseman of Famine offers mere
    crumbs for sustenance to his legions of soldiers and slaves. He takes
    delight in using pet nixudaemons to drive his legions past their limits,
    accelerating their spiritual and physical starvation.
