  With burning eyes and a snapping maw, this blood-red serpent rises from the
  ocean's depths. Sweltering heat radiates from its rippling scales.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Boiling Seas (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per minute, a gargiya can concentrate the heat within its body,
      causing seawater in a 20-foot radius to boil for 1d6 rounds. All creatures
      caught in this boiling seawater take 4d8 points of fire damage. Creatures
      spending 2 or more consecutive rounds subjected to this damage must
      succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or fall unconscious. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Dying Gasp (Su)
    description: >-
      When a gargiya is killed, it disgorges from its gullet the molten boulder
      that heats its body. Its fiery death throes deal 6d6 points of fire damage
      to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst. A DC 22 Reflex save halves
      this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Scalding Scales (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gargiya generates such intense heat that anything touching it takes 2d6
      points of fire damage. Creatures striking a gargiya with natural attacks
      or unarmed strikes are subject to this damage. Any metal weapon striking a
      gargiya must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or melt, gaining the broken
      condition. A metal weapon that fails a second save is destroyed. Wooden
      weapons are destroyed after only one failed save. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Crueler and more volatile than their sea-serpent cousins, gargiyas gravitate
    toward and sustain themselves on seismic hotspots. Far from being a danger
    to the beasts, these bubbling crevices spew a form of magma that imbues
    gargiyas with incredible abilities. From birth, gargiyas ingest magma
    bubbling up from the ocean floor. By the time they've reached maturity, the
    monsters develop a molten core in their gullets that allows them to call
    forth scalding heat at will. Gargiyas' aggressive tendencies toward
    seafarers have garnered them a well-earned nickname-"boiler beasts."
  - >-
    Gargiyas' affinity for all things volcanic has left a pattern of stippled
    crimson on their massive, snake-like bodies. The spiny frills jutting from
    their heads and necks resemble enormous, iron-forged blades, and hundreds of
    stubby appendages line the sides of their underbellies, wriggling ominously
    when the beasts rear from the sea. Of all the gargiyas' features, though,
    perhaps the most intimidating are their eyes and maws, which seethe with the
    light and heat of burning coals-particularly when the beasts are aggravated.
    Capable of slithering through water like an enormous python, a gargiya
    stretches 30 feet in length and weighs up to 5 tons.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Legends of the seas say that early in gargiyas' existence, as the ocean
    floor around them shuddered and stretched, the warmth of the seas'
    burgeoning volcanoes fascinated the beasts. To the gargiyas, these seismic
    regions offered a siren call of safety, isolation and-unbeknownst to the
    animalistic creatures-power. While it's unclear just how it lends gargiyas
    such power, scholars agree that this magma serves as gargiyas' primary
    sustenance and as the source of their hyperthermal abilities.
  - >-
    Scholars believe that as gargiyas became more adept at manipulating heat,
    they became more protective of the magma vents they call home. Whereas early
    legends speak of gargiyas that rarely surfaced, preferring to stay close to
    their volcanic lairs, modern stories tell of gargiyas that see any sentient
    creatures-even if they're sailing a mile away-as threats to be met head-on.
    The few sailors who have survived these encounters warn of gargiyas that
    actively patrol the waters surrounding their magma vents, surfacing at even
    the slightest sign of unlucky passersby. Apparently, to the gargiyas, any
    who venture near their precious lairs must covet them.
  - >-
    Because of gargiyas' aggressiveness, a small subset of oceanic cartographers
    has devoted itself to recording the locations of their known lairs. These
    maps, available in many southern ports' markets, are popular among traders
    and pirates who wish to skirt fiery confrontation. However, in testament to
    the cutthroat competition between many port merchants, it's not unheard of
    for these maps to contain "mistakes"-oversights built into the guides by
    their previous owners, hoping to lure rivals to horrific doom, or protect
    favored shipping lanes.
  - >-
    Despite gargiyas' destructive reputations, some Golarion cultures revere
    their molten cores as a symbol of status and wealth. Taldans, in particular,
    are drawn to the cores' seductively mysterious glow. The richest Taldan
    patriarchs often believe owning such a rare treasure-and showing it off, of
    course-is a worthy life goal. Careless of the risks gargiya hunts entail,
    these patriarchs sometimes sponsor teams of adventurers to quest for these
    cores. Most of these expeditions end in bloody and burning tragedy, but to
    some hardy sea-goers, the potential rewards of glory and riches are too
    alluring to resist.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Gargiyas mostly live alone near major archipelagos with abundant volcanic
    activity. They are most numerous in the isolated waters surrounding the
    Shackles, though scattered sightings have been reported throughout
    Golarion's warmer seas. There is a significant concentration of gargiyas
    near the Smoker where magma seeps up from the sea floor, and also talk of a
    stretch north of Shark Island where gargiya lairs speckle the ocean floor by
    the dozens. No one knows, however, whether this latter story is true or
    rather was concocted to deter authorities from the hideouts of buccaneers
    who roamed the islands before the sahuagin staked their claim there.
  - >-
    Gargiyas do not typically share their homes with others of their kind.
    However, sailors have told stories of defeating a gargiya after a long and
    brutal struggle only to come face to face with another one-ostensibly coming
    to its kin's aid. The question of whether these tales are simple
    exaggerations or evidence of gargiya collaboration has prompted many a
    fistfight in portside taverns. How well these braggarts fare in such brawls
    often indicates whether they're capable of the outlandish adventures they so
    boldly claim.
  - >-
    Although tales of collaborating gargiyas are unsettling enough, even more
    sinister rumors have surfaced from seafarers who dare to brave the Eye of
    Abendego. There, the tales say, the turbulent seas beneath Golarion's
    permanent hurricane hide groups of gargiyas whipped into a frenzy by the
    tempest that followed Aroden's death a century ago. According to legend,
    these gargiyas roam the entire area of the Eye as predators, ambushing ships
    and boiling their crews in the ocean's salty waters. It is said that they
    decorate their volcanic lairs with their victims' bones, hinting that
    gargiyas possess an intelligence beyond that of mere animals.
  - >-
    Unlike many reptilian creatures, gargiyas birth their young live. Scholars
    agree that, typically, male and female gargiyas come together to breed every
    decade or so. Afterward, the beasts abandon each other. When the female
    returns to her lair, she is thought to consume large amounts of magma while
    her single snakeling gestates, usually for a period of about 10 years. When
    giving birth, the gargiya expels her offspring into a magma-spewing fissure,
    where it grows and gathers strength until it leaves to find its own home.
    Although there is some debate about gargiyas' longevity, scholars believe
    they typically live around 300 years. Rumors, however, speak of gargiyas
    that have lived much longer-perhaps even predating modern civilization-but
    if any have encountered such an ancient terror and survived, they have never
    surfaced to tell the tale.
