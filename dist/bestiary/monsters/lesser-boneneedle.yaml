Description:
  - >-
    Boneneedles are eyeless, bone white creatures that resemble a blob of
    semi-translucent flesh with eight spindly, spider-like legs. These creatures
    feed on bone marrow and their lairs are always scattered with leg bones, arm
    bones, spinal columns and the like from once living creatures; both humanoid
    and animal. They make their lairs deep underground and avoid natural
    daylight, though some brave the surface world and venture from their lairs
    at night. These creatures rarely foray into the outside world, so such
    encounters are rare, and will always be with more than one boneneedle.
    Boneneedles tend to congregate in clusters or packs and a typical lair can
    contain many of these creatures. They have no social structure and simply
    rely on one another for hunting and feeding. Any young boneneedles present
    are generally nonthreatening as they lack the deadly mandibles that adults
    possess. Boneneedles are bloated, yellowish-white blobs of rubbery flesh
    with spidery legs of black or gold. The mandibles are glossy-black and
    hollow, and aid the boneneedle in piercing its prey's flesh and bone and
    siphoning off its meal. When feeding, the boneneedle's fleshy form pulsates
    and expands. After feeding, its form becomes less translucent and takes on a
    sickly yellow color. Boneneedles are highly aggressive and opportunistic
    hunters. Using their coloration, they hide among the piles of bones in their
    lair and wait for living creatures to wander close by. When prey comes
    within range, the boneneedle darts from its hiding place and bites. If
    subjected to natural daylight, boneneedles flee from the source of the light
    in the most direct route possible. A greater boneneedle is a larger version
    of the standard boneneedle. It is often found acting as the queen or king
    within a nest. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
