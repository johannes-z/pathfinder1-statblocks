Description:
  - >-
    Euparkeria is a nocturnal carnivore, feeding on insects and small game. When
    moving, it usually moves on all fours; however, when running or in combat,
    it stands and fights on its back legs.
  - >-
    A euparkeria can reach lengths of 3 feet or more. Skin coloration is gray or
    grayish-green.
  - >-
    When attacking prey, the euparkeria stands on its hind legs and attacks with
    a vicious bite. Its front legs feature a small thumb-like claw that it uses
    to slash its opponents. Much like other small dinosaurs, by itself the
    euparkeria doesn't pose much of a threat. In large numbers however, they can
    easily catch and kill prey much larger than themselves.
