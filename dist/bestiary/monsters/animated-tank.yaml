  Like a deranged caterpillar of grinding metal and protruding turrets, this
  massive armored vehicle dominates the battlefield, spitting hot lead and
  artillery-seemingly without a crew.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Inexhaustible Ammo (Su)
    description: >-
      An animated tank loads and fires its weapons as a normal tank, but it
      telekinetically reloads from a supernaturally endless supply of
      ammunition.
  - name: Integrated Weaponry (Ex)
    description: >-
      An animated tank is equipped with three Maxim M1910 machine guns (see page
      65) and two Hotchkiss 6 pounders (see page 66) built into its body. It
      treats these weapons as natural attacks and not manufactured weapons. It
      cannot make iterative attacks with these weapons. An animated tank has its
      weapons arranged on all sides of its body and can make three machine gun
      attacks and one Hotchkiss 6 pounder attack each round. An animated tank's
      weapons can still be targeted by effects that target manufactured weapons
      (such as magic weapon spells or sunder attempts), but cannot easily be
      harvested for use once the animated tank is destroyed. An animated tank is
      always proficient with its weapons, and its ranged weapons do not provoke
      attacks of opportunity when fired in melee combat.
  - name: Telekinesis (Su)
    description: >-
      The pickled brain that animates the tank possesses a supernatural ability
      to manipulate its surroundings and reload its armament. The animated tank
      can use telekinesis as a standard action every 1d4 rounds (caster level
      16th).
  - name: Vicious Trample (Ex)
    description: >-
      An animated tank's powerful metal treads deal 6d6+18 points of damage on a
      successful trample.
Description:
  - >-
    The brains of great military commanders and tacticians need not go to waste
    simply because their mortal bodies have been slain. Preserved in glass
    vessels, bathed in nutrient fluids, and wired to strange energies and
    bizarre technologies, these organs are given new life, as their mental
    talents are preserved and tapped to independently control monstrous war
    machines. Though the methods, magic, and technology used differ between
    creators of these hulking engines, incarnations of these creatures typically
    take the form of captured siege engines and vehicles retrofitted to allow
    independent control by the pickled brains inside.
  - >-
    Animated tanks are perhaps the most dangerous of such animate siege engines.
    Thought haunted by some, and simply assumed by others to be well-commanded
    vehicles crewed by crack soldiers, these animated monstrosities are feared
    and loathed on battlefields across the front. Blessed with incredible armor
    and the ability to never tire or deplete their stocks of ammunition, these
    creatures run roughshod over trenches and barricades alike, grinding troops
    unfortunate enough to fall beneath their tracks to splinters of meat and
    bone. The tremendous range afforded by their armaments only makes matters
    worse for those forced to confront the lumbering monstrosities, and finding
    a weakness within their steel carcasses is nigh impossible.
  - >-
    Animated tanks are found in the company of one or more rifle or flamethrower
    troops; these soldiers are usually either keenly aware of the tank's unique
    magical animation, or wholly ignorant of its mysterious and taciturn
    movements as they simply follow their commander's orders without regard to
    the tank's missing crew. Those hearing the tanks' orders in their own heads,
    however, instantly realize that something is not quite normal. As animated
    tanks are built with the armored frames of British Mark IV tanks-a common
    war wagon on First World War battlefields-few soldiers question the orders
    of their superiors when tasked with accompanying one of the beasts. Though
    Mark IV tanks could normally hold a crew of eight, the cabin of an animated
    tank is filled with strange technological and alchemical devices, allowing
    only four Medium creatures space to ride inside-that is, if the animated
    tank agrees to carry passengers.
  - >-
    Animated tanks were designed by Viktor Miloslav for use by the Russian
    Imperial Army, and it is thought that this mad experimentation and
    blasphemous use of the deceased is what triggered his exile to the cold
    wastes of Siberia and his imprisonment in the Akuvskaya prison camp. It is
    ultimately unknown how effective the creations of Viktor Miloslav proved on
    the battlefields of the Great War, or whether any of the monstrosities
    survived the war, as their shelled-out carcasses look little different from
    normal tanks, with the exception of a faint smell of formaldehyde and
    remnants of broken glass not usually found with tanks of this model. Whether
    some slumbering beast waits patiently in some forgotten barn or warehouse
    remains to be seen, or whether brave soldiers have laid this dangerous and
    blasphemous technology to rest is unknown, but hopefully Viktor Miloslav's
    mad designs have all been destroyed or lost forever.
  - Variants
  - >-
    Viktor Miloslav is rumored to have created variations on the normal Mark V
    tank during his brief explorations into self-animated war machines during
    World War I.
  - >-
    "Female" Animated Tank (CR 11): So named because it lacked the heavier
    Hotchkiss 6 pounder guns of its more robust counterpart, this variant makes
    up for its lack of explosive firepower with a bristling barrage of machine
    gun fire, being able to make up to five attacks per round with its Maxim
    M1910 machine guns. The tanks are otherwise identical in most respects, and
    few find a female animated tank's lack of Hotchkiss 6 pounder guns a relief
    when faced with its withering machine gun attacks.
  - >-
    The "Moving Fortress" (CR 13): Once word of Viktor Miloslav's inventions
    spread to Germany, the engineers there tried to replicate the effects he'd
    achieved, though it's unknown to what degree they succeeded. Should one of
    these specimens have survived, it would have been much more highly armored,
    built on the base of the German A7V tank-designed literally like a tracked,
    armored land ship. A moving fortress has 2 additional Hit Dice, and its
    natural armor bonus is increased by 5. Its single main gun, more robust than
    the Hotchkiss 6 pounder, deals an additional 4d6 points of damage, and the
    moving fortress is equipped with six Maxim M1910 machine guns.
  - Construction
  - >-
    An animated tank is built by retrofitting a preexisting tank and hard-wiring
    its pickled brain to the controls through strange technology, rather than
    crafting the construct's tank body from scratch. The secrets to preserving
    brains and connecting them to metal war wagons is lost, as is the nonmagical
    technological process by which Viktor Miloslav constructed the monstrosities
    found on Earth during the First World War. However, those able to inspect a
    destroyed specimen may be able to reconstruct the process. In addition to an
    animated tank's creation requirements-beyond the body of an intact tank-an
    animating brain must be harvested soon after its body is deceased, preserved
    with gentle repose, and subjected to a special nutrient bath before being
    revived and ultimately hooked into the tank. Only time and experimentation
    will reveal whether other secrets to this mysterious process were lost in
    the chaos of war on Earth.
