Description:
  - >-
    When a living creature is slain by russet mold (see that entry), it rises as
    a vegepygmy commoner. Vegepygmies are low-intelligence plants that make
    their home deep in the forests or underground away from most settled areas.
    They are hunters and scavengers, and carnivorous, preying on living
    creatures weaker than themselves. A vegepygmy ranges from two feet to four
    and a half feet tall. Though they do not seem to have ears, it is well known
    that vegepygmies can hear. Vegepygmies do not speak, but communicate with
    others of their kind by thumping their chest or rapping their spears on
    rocks, earth, or some other solid surface. It is not known if or how they
    communicate with other creatures. Vegepygmies attack with claws or weapons,
    usually either a longspear or club. They prefer to ambush opponents, using
    their coloration to blend with their natural surroundings. Credit The
