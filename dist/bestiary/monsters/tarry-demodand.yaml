Description_Visual: >-
  This lithe, toothy creature's jet-black skin looks like living tar, and ooze
  drips from the claws that cap its long arms.
Group: Demodand
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 3
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adhesion (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature striking a tarry demodand with a manufactured weapon must make
      a DC 23 Reflex save; failure means the weapon sticks to the demodand and
      cannot be used to make attacks until freed. Freeing a stuck weapon
      requires a successful grapple check. This adhesion grants a +4 racial
      bonus to CMD against disarm attempts.
Description:
  - >-
    Tarry demodands are lithe and lean compared to other demodands. Despite this
    difference, all tarry demodands are strong and agile. Although their batlike
    wings appear tattered and useless, they can still fly. A tarry demodand
    stands 7 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.
  - >-
    The tarry demodand is the grunt of the demodand army-bred for battle, these
    swift and deadly demodands make up the bulk of any demodand legion. That
    they themselves are more powerful than most outsiders is as much a testament
    to their race as anything else-a single tarry demodand is a formidable
    opponent, to say nothing of a group of the creatures. Although tarry
    demodands are quite strong, they prefer using light weapons-one in each
    hand. Tarry demodands only rarely use larger weaponry, and then only when
    directly ordered by a superior. They lack the terrific claws of the greater
    demodands, and a tarry demodand with no weapons tends to flee combat as soon
    as possible, only to return when it is properly armed.
