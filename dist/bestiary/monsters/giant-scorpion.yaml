    Giant scorpions are monstrous versions of the more common desert scorpion.
    They are likely to attack any creature that approaches. Giant scorpions
    usually charge when attacking, grabbing prey in their pincers, then lashing
    their segmented tails forward to kill their victim with injected venom.
    Giant scorpions are just over 8 feet long from head to the base of the tail;
    the tail adds an additional 8 feet or so, although it is usually curled up
    over the scorpion's back. Giant scorpions weigh between 2,000 and 6,000
    pounds. Giant scorpions normally feed on other giant vermin, as well as
    large mammals that they paralyze with their venom, but they will attack and
    eat any living creature that ventures too close. In turn, giant scorpions
    are preyed upon by purple worms and other large predators. Giant scorpions
    engage in complex courtship rituals when they mate, grasping each other's
    pincers, arching their tails, and performing a circular "dance." Soon after
    mating, the male usually retreats to avoid being cannibalized by the female.
    Female scorpions do not lay eggs; they give birth to live young in broods of
    a dozen or so. The mother carries her brood on her back until the young are
    old enough to fend for themselves and hunt their own prey. Giant scorpions
    live in underground burrows, either as solitary hunters or in small
    colonies, and will sometimes take up residence in man-made ruins or dungeons
    if food is plentiful. Giant scorpion colonies are usually made up of
    scorpions from the same brood that have yet to strike out on their own.
    Other species of scorpions exist as well, some smaller but most quite a bit
    larger and favoring different terrains, such as forests, plains, or even
    underground. You can adjust the stats for the giant scorpion by changing Hit
    Dice and size (adjusting Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution as
    appropriate) to represent a wide range of species. The following table lists
