Description:
  - >-
    A nymph water strider is an immature specimen of the giant water
    strider-more mature than a caterpillar but not yet an adult. Over the next
    several months it eats and molts, increasing in size with each molt until it
    becomes Large and is fully adult. These creatures are shy and more skittish
    than adults. Lizardfolk hunt wild nymph water striders, and consider them a
    wonderful delicacy. Boggards and gripplis raise them as food animals, but
    something about the domestication process makes such nymphs unappealing to
    lizardfolk. In the wild they frantically flee other creatures that approach
    them, making them difficult to hunt or corral. Many boggard, lizardfolk, and
    grippli tribes consider capturing a live nymph a rite of passage to
    adulthood. A nymph water strider isn't suitable as a mount for any Large or
    smaller creature.
