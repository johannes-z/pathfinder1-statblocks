Description:
  - >-
    Drowners of sailors and sinkers of ships, a fuath (FOO-ah) is a wicked
    gremlin found in the sea. It climbs aboard ships in the dead of night to
    sever ropes, bore holes in barrels, soil provisions, and murder any hapless
    crew it puts to sleep or catches alone. It delights in drowning creatures by
    surrounding them with magically thickened water, cackling with wicked glee
    as its victims claw desperately for the air only inches from their mouths.
  - >-
    A fuath wears seaweed, shells, and coral like other creatures wear armor,
    clothes, and jewelry. Its body is protected by a hard, hunchbacked carapace.
    It stands less than 2 feet tall and weighs 12 to 15 pounds.
  - >-
    Fuaths don't share a common language with other types of gremlins, though
    they can pantomime to each other fairly effectively. They have a surprising
    rapport with other sea creatures, even foul-tempered beasts like reefclaws
    (Bestiary 2 234). Small groups of fuaths lair in sea caves or rocky
    crevices. Larger groups frequently lay claim to whole sections of ruined
    ships. Their lairs usually include several trained guard animals. Fuaths
    prefer the taste of "land-meat" to anything from the sea, and often raid
    shore and ships to slake their hunger. They adore sea hags to the point of
    worship.
