Description:
  - >-
    Medusas are human-like creatures with snakes instead of hair. At distances
    of 30 feet or more, a medusa can easily pass for a beautiful woman if she
    wears something to cover her serpentine locks-when wearing clothing that
    conceals her head and face, she can be mistaken for a human at even closer
    distances. Medusas use lies and disguises that conceal their faces to get
    close enough to opponents to use their petrifying gaze, though they like
    playing with their prey and may fire arrows from a distance to lead enemies
    into traps. Some enjoy creating intricate decorations out of their victims,
    using their petrified remains as accents to their swampy lairs, but most
    medusas take care to hide the evidence of their previous conf licts so that
    new foes won't have advance warning of their presence.

    Used to concealing themselves, medusas in cities are usually rogues, while
    those in the wilderness often pass themselves off as rangers or trackers.
    The most notorious and legendary medusas, though, are those who take levels
    as bards or clerics. Charismatic and intelligent, urban medusas are often
    involved with thieves' guilds or other aspects of the criminal underworld.
    Medusas may form alliances with blind creatures or intelligent undead, both
    of which are immune to their stony gaze. Spellcasting medusas often serve as
    oracles or prophets, usually dwelling in remote locations of legendary power
    or infamous history. Such oracle medusas take great delight in their roles,
    and if presented with the proper gifts and flattery, the secrets they offer
    can be quite helpful. Of course, the lairs of such potent creatures are
    liberally decorated with statues of those who have offended them, so the
    seeker of knowledge is well advised to tred carefully during such meetings.
  - >-
    All known medusas are female. Rarely, a medusa may decide to keep a male
    humanoid as a mate, usually with the help of elixirs of love or similar
    magic, and is always careful to not petrify her prisoner-at least until she
    grows tired of his company.
