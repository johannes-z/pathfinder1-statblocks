SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aging Strike (Su)
    description: >-
      If a bythos strikes a living target with two slam attacks in a single
      round, the bythos ages the creature, causing it to advance to the next age
      category (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169) if it fails a DC 24 Fortitude
      save. The victim gains all of the penalties from this aging and none of
      the bonuses. A venerable victim targeted by this ability dies if it fails
      a DC 24 Fortitude save. This process is reversible with greater
      restoration, limited wish, miracle, or wish. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Confusion Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Confusion for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 24 negates. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Temporal Strike (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a bythos can touch a creature or object to displace
      it from time. If the target fails a DC 24 Fortitude save, it disappears
      from the present moment and reappears in the same location 1d4 rounds
      later as if no time had passed. If an object occupies that space, the
      creature appears in the closest available space to its original
      location-this displacement does not cause the creature any additional
      harm. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The bythos are guardians of time and planar travel-indeed, to bythos, the
    act of aging is nothing more than a highly specialized method of travel.
    Although bythos themselves have no additional method of traveling through
    time, they scour the multiverse, hunting for creatures that do have the
    ability to time-travel and may have abused this ability.
  - >-
    Far more often, though, bythos seek out abuses of planar travel, such as
    tears in reality, regions where planes overlap, or creatures that abuse the
    use of planar travel. In some cases, such distortions are ignored, but in
    others, a bythos or even a full tribunal comes to assess and repair the
    damage. In most cases, "repair" is analogous to the death of the creature
    responsible for the distortions, but placing such creatures in temporal
    stasis can also solve the problem.
  - >-
    While a bythos's body may seem to be made of smoke and vapor, it is
    strangely solid to the touch, feeling not dissimilar to dry stone. A bythos
    is 13 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds.
