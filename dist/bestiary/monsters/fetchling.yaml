  - name: Shadow Blending (Su)
    description: >-
      Attacks against a fetchling in dim light have a 50% miss chance instead of
      the normal 20% miss chance. This ability does not grant total concealment;
      it just increases the miss chance.
Description:
  - >-
    Fetchlings are descended from generations of humans trapped on the Plane of
    Shadow. Infused with the essence of that plane, they are more and less than
    human, and often serve as middlemen in planar trade and politics. Other than
    their yellow eyes, their flesh has no color-it is either stark white,
    midnight black, or a shade of gray. On the Material Plane, they conceal
    themselves with heavy clothing or dim light so they can work without
    prejudice. The name "fetchling" is a human word; their own name for their
    race is kayal, meaning "shadow people."
  - >-
    A fetchling stands 6 feet tall, but is generally lithe and wiry of frame,
    weighing only 150 pounds. Fetchlings live as long as half-elves.
  - FETCHLING CHARACTERS

    They have the following racial traits.
  - >-
    +2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, -2 Wisdom: Fetchlings are quick and forceful, but
    often strange and easily distracted by errant thoughts.
  - 'Darkvision: Fetchlings see in the dark up to 60 feet.'
  - >-
    Low-Light Vision: Fetchlings can see twice as far as humans in conditions of
    dim light.

    resistance 5.
  - >-
    Spell-Like Abilities (Sp): A fetchling can use disguise self once per day as
    a spell-like ability. It can assume the form of any humanoid creature using
    this spell-like ability. When a fetchling reaches 9th level in any
    combination of classes, it gains shadow walk (self only) as a spell-like
    ability usable once per day, and at 13th level, it gains plane shift (self
    only, to the Plane of Shadow or the Material Plane only) usable once per
    day. A fetchling's caster level is equal to its total Hit Dice.
  - >-
    Languages Fetchlings begin play speaking Common. A fetchling with a high
    Intelligence score can choose any of the following languages: Aklo, Aquan,
    Auran, Draconic, D'ziriak (understanding only, cannot speak), Ignan, Terran,
    and any regional human tongue.
