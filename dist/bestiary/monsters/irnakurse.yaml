SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mind Lash (Su)
    description: >-
      Those struck by an irnakurse are overwhelmed with dark emotions and
      corrupted images of a ruined life. Any non-evil creature hit by an
      irnakurse's tentacle must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be stunned for 1
      round. A creature that successfully saves can't be affected by the same
      irnakurse's mind lash for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Soul Scream (Su)
    description: >-
      Capable of channeling all of its rage and terror into a single, unnatural
      noise, an irnakurse can unleash a sound of alien horror as a standard
      action. Any non-evil creature within 30 feet of a screaming irnakurse must
      succeed at a DC 19 Will save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain. Once it
      begins screaming, an irnakurse can continue as a free action for 6 rounds,
      but can't scream again for 5 minutes afterward. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Irnakurse, meaning "perfect ones" in the Elven language, represent the sum
    outpouring of drow hatred for their surface-world brethren. These
    brainwashed, rage-filled abominations are the result of elves subjected to
    fleshwarping-and were the drow to have their way, embodiments of the elven
    race's future. Each irnakurse suffers long under the knife of the dark
    elves' most practiced fleshwarpers until its body and mind lie in total
    ruin. When the weeks of torture and transformation are complete, what was
    once an elf emerges as a shrieking mockery of its lost grace, a horror of
    reworked flesh and broken bones, a "perfect" elf to the drow and a sin
    against life to elvenkind. Through the blasphemous tortures that create
    them, irnakurse are made completely mad and become unable to harm drow. All
    non-drow, however, they view as targets to vent their terror and rage upon.
    Elves especially provoke irnakurses' ire. No two irnakurse look exactly the
    same-drow torturers take profane pride in sculpting their elven victims into
    unique masterpieces of agony-most stand between 8 and 9 feet tall and weigh
    upward of 300 pounds.
