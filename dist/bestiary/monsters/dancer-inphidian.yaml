  A shapely feminine humanoid with pale bluish green scales sways in lithe and
  elegant rhythm. As she moves, her forked tongue flickers and her eyes burn
  crimson. Where her hands should be, a viper head sprouts from each wrist.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Entrancing Dance (Su)
    description: >-
      a dancer inphidian can sway its body in a rhythmic motion that charms all
      those within 30 feet viewing the dance. The charmer makes a Perform
      (dance) check. Those viewing the dance must make a successful Will save
      (DC equal to the charmer's Perform check) or be fascinated for 1d4+2
      rounds. A creature that makes a successful save is immune to the
      entrancing dance of that charmer for one day.
Description:
  - >-
    Sometimes referred to derogatorily as snake charmers, dancer inphidians are
    found throughout the inphidian communities and act as entertainers, often
    using their dancing ability to soothe onlookers. Dancers also function as
    spies, using their ability to fascinate to extract information from a
    target. They are sometimes used by more powerful inphidians to seduce
    enemies, and rumors speak of a great city where a single inphidian ruler
    keeps a personal harem of dancer in his palace.
  - >-
    The dancer inphidian prefers to avoid combat if possible, relying on her
    entrancing ability to fascinate her opponents. Fascinated opponents are then
    left to the dancer's retinue (usually consisting of 2-4 common inphidians).
    If forced into melee, the dancer, like her brethren, relies on her
    snake-hands and poison to slay her opponents. If overwhelmed, a dancer
    attempts to flee by any means possible.
