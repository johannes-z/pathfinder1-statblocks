      Once per day as an immediate action, a wayang can choose to be affected by

    Originating from the Shadow Plane, wayangs are pixie-like in stature with
    extremely gangly limbs and skin the color of deep shadow. They follow a
    philosophy known as "The Dissolution," which teaches that in passing they
    again merge into shadow.
