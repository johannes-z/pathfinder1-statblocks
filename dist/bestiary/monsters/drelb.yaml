SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Illusory Retreat (Sp)
    description: >-
      A drelb can rapidly diminish its form while it advances forward. To the
      onlooker, it appears as if the drelb is retreating. Creatures succeeding
      on a DC 20 Will save see through this illusion; otherwise, the drelb
      advances into melee range and its opponent is considered flat-footed for
      the drelb's next attack following the use of this ability. A creature that
      has seen a drelb use this ability before gains a +2 circumstance bonus on
      its Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +5 racial
      bonus.
  - name: Nether Chill (Su)
    description: >-
      A living creature touched by a drelb must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or
      immediately drops anything it is holding and fall prone, shivering for 1
      round. It is not helpless but is unable to make any actions during this
      round. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 bonus for the
      drelb's Ability Focus feat.
  - name: Psionic Adaptation (Su)
    description: >-
      A drelb can imitate any psionic power or psi-like ability used within 30
      feet of it as a standard action. A drelb has a manifester level of 5th.
      The save DC (if any) to resist an imitated psionic power or psi-like
      ability is 12 + the level of the power. The save DC is Charisma-based.
      Further, any psionic power or psi-like ability that directly targets a
      drelb is reflected back on the attacker with full effect (manifester level
      and save DC equal to that of the original manifester).
Description:
  - >-
    Drelbs are energy creatures that make their home on the Negative Energy
    Plane. They are summoned to the Material Plane by evil spellcasters who task
    them with the duty of guarding treasure or secret places to be left alone.
    Hence, they are sometimes referred to as haunting custodians. A drelb
    resembles and is nearly indistinguishable from a wraith (DC 25 Perception
    check to notice the difference from a distance of 10 feet or more). Drelbs
    are not undead and cannot be turned, though they sometimes feign being
    affected, using their illusory retreat ability to trick their opponents.
  - >-
    A drelb attacks by touching an opponent with its incorporeal touch. It uses
    its illusory retreat ability at the first chance, attempting to catch an
    opponent unaware.
