Description_Visual: >-

  emerge from beneath a fang-lined maw in its bulbous head and drip with some
  sort of venom.

Description:
  - >-
    Slime crawlers reach maturity at twenty weeks. By this time, their legs have
    fully developed and their tentacles have become pseudopodlike lashes. They
    have lost their slime coating but have replaced it with a paralytic venom
    exuded from the tips of their tentacles. They are even more voracious than
    in their larval form and activity hunt for ready sources of carrion at the
    outskirts of settlements, upon old battlefields, or even sewer tunnels
    beneath large population centers. They become viciously territorial in this
    stage of their development and, while they may allow other slime crawlers in
    their midst, other types of creatures had best beware, as they are perfectly
    happy to feed upon fresher faire.

    A typical mature slime crawler is about 12 feet long and weighs about 800
    pounds.
  - >-
    A mature slime crawler attacks with its tentacles, trying to paralyze as
    many opponents as possible but if particularly hungry may stop in the midst
    of battle to feed on anyone it has disabled.
