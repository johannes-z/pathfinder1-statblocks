SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Filth fever: Stakes-injury; save Fort DC 28; onset 1d3 days; frequency
      1/day; effect 1d3 Dex damage and 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Disgorge Vermin (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a mire brute can vomit forth a spray of
      fetid water to a range of 30 feet. The spray contains small biting insects
      and worms. Treat these vermin as a centipede swarm (Pathfinder Roleplaying
      Game Bestiary). A mire brute disgorges 1d3 centipede swarms when it uses
      this ability. A swarm moves to engage the closest living creature.
  - name: Drench (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mire brute can extinguish torches, campfires, exposed lanterns and other
      open flames of a nonmagical origin if they are of Large size or smaller. A
      mire brute can dispel magical fire as dispel magic (CL 21).
  - name: Impale (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mire brute can try to impale a grabbed opponent of one size smaller than
      itself by making a successful grapple check that does not provoke an
      attack of opportunity. If successful, the opponent immediately takes 4d6
      points of damage and is impaled on the stakes jutting from the mire
      brute's body. An impaled opponent is considered pinned and thereafter
      takes 3d6 points of damage each round until it breaks free. An impaled
      opponent must succeed on a grapple check against the mire brute's CMD to
      break free. A mire brute is not considered grappled while it has an
      opponent impaled. A Huge mire brute can impale 1 Large, 2 Medium, 8 Small,
      or 32 Tiny or smaller opponents at one time.
Description:
  - >-
    Mire brutes, when dormant, appear as large stretches of mud bristling with
    wooden stakes. It lies in wait for lone or distracted targets, at which time
    it rises and attacks, assuming a vaguely humanoid form, its surface
    glistening with slime and detritus. Lacking any discernible sensory organs,
    it shambles about, looking to kill anything it detects nearby.
  - >-
    Towering over 12 feet tall, and of an instable structure, it lurches about,
    on thick featureless legs, dripping muck over the battlefield. Stupid and
    destructive, it fights blindly, targeting whatever comes within its reach.
    The most repellant attack form available to the mire brute is its ability to
    unleash a slough of putrid fluid, squirming insects and worms.
  - >-
    Conceivably more of these foul creatures exist, but none have been spotted
    before and it is believed that this monster is unique.
