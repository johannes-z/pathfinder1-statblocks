Description_Visual: >-
  This creature is made of hundreds of metal masks, welded together to form a
  roughly humanoid body. The masks are mostly iron, but some-such as the hands,
  knees, and feet- are made of silver lined with gold. The mask that makes up
  its head is made of porcelain with gold trim and has a large sapphire set into
  its brow. At the creature moves, the masks seem to shift and stare.

    description: >-
      A mask golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. • A shatter spell deals
      4d6 points of damage (no save). • A grease spell prevents the mask golem
      from using its masks of control ability for the duration of the spell (no
      save). Masks that are already in place are unaffected. • A make whole
      spell heals the golem as normal and automatically restores one of its
      masks of control if any have been destroyed. • Any magical attack against
      a mask golem that deals sonic damage affects the mask golem normally.
Description:
  - >-
    Made up of hundreds of masks, a mask golem is a construct forged by the
    faithful of Razmir to honor the Living God. These constructs are often
    placed in their temples or other locations that they wish to protect, such
    as treasure vaults or private sanctuaries for powerful priests. They spend
    much of their time completely immobile, only coming to life when their
    instructions force them to take action. Many acolytes are unaware of their
    true nature, having spent years viewing them as simple statues.
  - >-
    Mask golems can understand Common, but they cannot speak. While they possess
    intelligence, they are bound by the orders of their creators and are seldom
    given free reign when assigned to a task. Rarely, these golems are employed
    as assassins, sent out to punish or kill those that threaten the church.
  - >-
    While all of the masks that make up the golem's body are copies of the holy
    symbol of Razmir, they are made of different materials. Most are simple
    iron, but the masks around the joints are made of silver with gold trim, and
    the head is made from a specially crafted porcelain mask, set with a
    sapphire. When a mask golem is destroyed, these valuable masks remain, and
    are worth 1,000 gp in total. The sapphire is worth 500 gp. A mask golem
    stands 5 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds.

    Construction A mask golem's body is made from hundreds of iron masks, as
    well as a few that are plated in silver and trimmed with gold, worth a total
    of 2,000 gp. In addition, the crafter must place a sapphire worth 500 gp
    into the golem's forehead to complete its creation.

DuringCombat: >-
  A mask golem attempts to control any powerful melee combatant that moves to
  threaten it using its mask of obedience ability. Against ranged opponents, it
  uses its mask of solitude. If these do not work, it relies on its slam attacks
  instead.
Morale: >-
  A mask golem fights to defend the area it has been built to protect, even if
  this results in its destruction.
