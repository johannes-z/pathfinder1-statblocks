SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Swarming (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ratfolk are used to living and fighting communally, and are adept at
      swarming foes for their own gain and their foes' detriment. Up to two
      ratfolk can share the same square at the same time. If two ratfolk in the
      same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that
      foe as if they were in two opposite squares.
Description:
  - >-
    Ratfolk are small, rodentlike humanoids often found traveling in nomadic
    trading caravans or perhaps dwelling in colonies in slums, sewers, and other
    normally undesirable urban sectors. Tinkerers and hoarders by nature, many
    ratfolk are shrewd merchants, carefully navigating the shifting alliances of
    black markets and bazaars. They love their stockpiles of interesting items
    far more
  - >-
    than money, and would rather trade for more baubles to add to their hoards
    than for mere coins.
  - >-
    Ratfolk are extremely communal, and live in large warrens with plenty of
    hidden crannies in which to stash their hoards or flee in times of danger,
    gravitating toward subterranean tunnels or tightly packed tenements in city
    ghettos. They feel an intense bond with their large families and kin
    networks, as well as with ordinary rodents of all sorts, living in chaotic
    harmony and fighting fiercely to defend each other when threatened.
  - >-
    Ratfolk are generally 4 feet tall and weigh 80 pounds. They often wear robes
    to conceal their forms in cities, as they know other humanoids find their
    rodent features distasteful.
