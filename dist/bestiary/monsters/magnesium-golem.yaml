SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Sickness (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a magnesium golem can generate an aura in a 10-foot
      radius spread that sickens all living creatures entering the area for 1d4
      minutes if that creature fails a DC 16 Fortitude save. A creature that
      successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same magnesium golem's
      aura of sickness for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell
      removes the effect from a sickened creature. This is a poison effect. The
      save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
  - name: Dexterity Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      A magnesium golem's slam attack deals 1d4 points of Dexterity damage to a
      living foe if it fails a DC 14 Fortitude save. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A magnesium golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature as noted below. A magic attack that deals
      water damage or creates water slows a magnesium golem (as the slow spell)
      for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical effect that deals fire
      damage breaks any slow effect and heals 1 point of damage for each 3
      points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing
      would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any
      excess as temporary hit points. A magnesium golem gets no saving throw
      against fire effects.
  - name: Rust Vulnerability (Ex)
    description: >-
      A magnesium golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as that of a
      rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.
Description:
  - >-
    Magnesium golems are silvery-white humanoids created by arcane spellcasters.
    As with other golems, they are incapable of thinking on their own, and are
    thus under control of the one that created them. They are created as
    guardians and keepers and can be given specific orders to guard a specific
    locale, item, or object or to attack a specific creature or type of
    creature. The magnesium golem is a silvery-white humanoid formed of
    magnesium. The average magnesium golem stands about 6-7 feet tall and weighs
    600 pounds. The magnesium golem's features are smooth and perfect, though it
    has no discernable ears, nose, or mouth. Its eyes appear to be nothing more
    than indentations in its body. Magnesium golems wear no clothing and never
    carry weapons, and it cannot speak or make any vocal noise. Unlike many
    other golems, the magnesium golem can move at the same speed as a human of
    its size. Construction A magnesium golem's body is sculpted from 1,000
    pounds of pure magnesium. The magnesium is mixed with rare chemicals
    totaling 4,000 gp. Assembling the body requires a successful DC 14 Craft
    (armor or weapons) check. MAGNESIUM GOLEM CL 9th; Price 27,000 gp
    Requirements Craft Construct, geas/quest, hold monster, limited wish,
    polymorph any object, stinking cloud, creator must be caster level 9th;
    Skill Craft (armor) or Craft (weapons) DC 14; Cost 15,500 gp Anodized
    (Improved) Magnesium Golem The golem is anodized during the creation process
    by submerging it in a solution of acid. During this time, the creator must
    cast lightning bolt or some other electricity-based effect into the
    solution. This deals no damage to the golem. After four hours, the magnesium
    golem is removed from the solution. An anodized magnesium golem is identical
    to a normal magnesium golem detailed above but it does not have the rust
    vulnerability trait of the normal magnesium golem. This increases the
    golem's price by 2,000 gp. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
