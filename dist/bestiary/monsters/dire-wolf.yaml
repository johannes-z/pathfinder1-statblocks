  - >-
    An enormous version of a normal wolf, dire wolves represent the wolf in its
    most primal form. These creatures follow the same basic behaviors of regular
    wolves, but are much more aggressive. Dire wolves often serve giants as
    hunting companions and vicious guard animals. Some ferocious humanoids and
    woodsmen use trained dire wolves as mounts. Darker than normal wolves, dire
    wolves' coats tend toward blacks and deep mottled grays. An adult dire wolf
    is typically about 9 feet long and weighs roughly 800 pounds.
