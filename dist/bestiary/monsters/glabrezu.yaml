Description:
  - >-
    Whereas the succubus is a demon that works her wiles by exploiting the
    physical lusts and needs of her prey, the glabrezu is a tempter of a
    different sort. Ferocious and bestial in form, the glabrezu is in fact a
    master of trickery and lies. With its ability to cloak its true form in
    pleasant illusions, the glabrezu uses its magic to grant wishes to mortal
    humanoids as a method of rewarding those who succumb to its guile and
    deceit. A wish granted by a glabrezu always fulfills the wisher's need in
    the most destructive way possible-although such methods might not be
    immediately apparent. A struggling weaponsmith might wish for fame and skill
    at his craft, only to find that his best patron is a cruel and sadistic
    murderer who uses the weapons to further his destructive desires. A lonely
    man who wishes for a companion might have his wish granted in the form of a
    lost love returned to "life" as a vampire, and so on-the glabrezu is nothing
    if not creative in addressing a mortal's desires. A glabrezu stands 18 feet
    tall and weighs just over 6,000 pounds. These treacherous demons form from
    the souls of the treasonous, the false, and the subversive-souls of mortals
    who, in life, bore false witness or used treachery and deceit to ruin the
    lives of others.
