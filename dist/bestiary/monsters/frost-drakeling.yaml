SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cold Generation (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a frost drakeling can decrease its body temperature to
      extreme levels. Creatures attacking the frost drakeling with natural
      weapons or touching the frost drakeling take 1d4 points of cold damage
      each round of contact.
  - name: Icewalking (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability works like spider climb, but the surfaces the frost drakeling
      climbs must be icy. It can move across icy surfaces without penalty and
      does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.
  - name: Icy Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      A frost drakeling can, as a standard action, spit a line of freezing ice
      to a range of 20 feet. A creature struck takes 3d6 points of cold damage
      (DC 13 Reflex half). Further, a creature that fails its save is slowed (as
      the slow spell) for 1d4 rounds. Once a frost drakeling uses its icy
      breath, it cannot use it again for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Frost drakelings are, like their counterparts the flame drakelings, believed
    to be related to or an offshoot of dragons or drakes (in this case white
    dragons or frost drakes). As with the flame drakelings however, scholars
    find nothing linking the races together.
  - >-
    Frost drakelings are diurnal hunters and feed upon small game found in their
    artic territories. Frost drakelings hunts are known to span several miles
    from their lair, especially if tracking game. Prey is killed and dragged
    back to their lair (usually a frigid cave complex set into the side of a
    mountain out of reach of other predators).
  - >-
    Frost drakelings are about 18 inches long and weigh 50 pounds. Their scales
    are dull blue with some frost drakelings having white blotches on their
    bodies. Wings are long and thin and usually icy blue in color. Eyes are
    deep, rich blue in color. Frost drakelings mate for life and when
    reproducing, the female lays a small clutch of one to three eggs. Eggs are
    small, frail, and sapphire blue in color, resembling large gemstones. The
    eggs hatch within 6 months, and young reach maturity within 2 years. Frost
    drakelings live up to 120 years on average.
  - >-
    Frost drakelings, unlike other drakelings, do not shy away from combat. When
    confronted, the creature unleashes its frigid breath weapon and swoops in to
    attack with its bite.
