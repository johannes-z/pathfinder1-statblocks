SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When a dark stalker is slain, its body combusts in a flash of white-hot
      flame. This acts like a fireball that deals 3d6 points of fire damage to
      all creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst. A DC 15 Reflex save halves
      this damage. A dark stalker's gear and treasure are unaffected by this
      explosion. This save is Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison use (Ex)
    description: >-
      Dark stalkers are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally
      poisoning themselves. Like their diminutive kin, the dark creepers, dark
      stalkers use black poison on their weapons and generally carry six doses
      on them. Black Smear-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 6
      rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save. The poison DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: See in Darkness (Su)
    description: >-
      A dark stalker can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including that
      created by deeper darkness.
Description:
  - >-
    The strange and mysterious dark stalkers are the undisputed leaders of dark
    folk society. Deep underground, these creatures dwell in strange villages
    (some rumors suggest entire cities) built of stone and fungus in remote
    caverns where they are served and worshiped by their coarser, diminutive
    kin, the dark creepers. Dark stalkers come to the surface rarely, but when
    they do it is on a mission, and with a force of creatures such that it never
    ends well for those they seek to rob or torment. Dark stalkers are tall,
    frail humanoids with incredibly pale skin. They constantly wear multiple
    layers of dark cloth and black leather armor, yet unlike their lesser kin, a
    dark stalker's garb is always clean and spotless. Each dark stalker carries
    a pair of short swords-they prefer these weapons to all others. Dark
    stalkers are 6 feet tall and weigh 100 pounds. In a fight, dark stalkers are
    not above sacrificing lesser creatures, including dark creepers, to win the
    day or cover their retreat if things go poorly. They hate well-lit areas and
    always prefer to fight under the cover of deeper darkness. Dark stalkers
    rarely fight to the death if it can be avoided, preferring to slip away if
    things begin to look grim. The origins of the dark stalkers and the dark
    creepers are shrouded in mystery, made more difficult to decipher by the
    fact that the dark stalkers do not keep records of their history. Many
    scholars believe that, just as the drow descended from elves, so too must
    the dark folk have descended from humanity, their eerie powers and
    spell-like abilities the result of generation upon generation of devotion to
    profane and sinister magic. Alas, the truth of the race's history may never
    be known. Dark Stalker Society Wherever a dark creeper city is located, dark
    stalkers can be found. They are the leaders of the dark creepers and rule
    with a strong fist. They are ruthless masters, dominating those lesser than
    themselves (which includes most dark creepers). In times of labor or war,
    dark stalkers can be seen standing over their dark creeper forces, directing
    them with a bellowing voice and threats of death to those that fail in their
    tasks. Some dark creepers have been observed sacrificing items to a dark
    stalker as if through worship. Whether the lesser creepers view the dark
    stalkers as deities, however, is a matter of conjecture. Dark Stalker
