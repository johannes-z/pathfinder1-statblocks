Description:
  - >-
    Assassin bugs are predatory insects that feed on the blood and tissue of
    living creatures. Actively hunting or passively waiting for its prey, an
    assassin bug is a formidable killing machine that has few enemies.
  - >-
    Assassin bugs are communal creatures and nests of up to 20 or so are not
    unheard of. Most nests contain at least one female of mating age and during
    mating season the female deposits a sticky clutch of eggs (2d4) in cracks or
    crevices in the forest floor. The eggs hatch within two weeks and newborn
    assassin bugs look exactly like their adult counterparts (other than being
    smaller). An assassin bug goes through several growth stages before finally
    reaching adult stage within one year.
  - >-
    An assassin bug stands 5 feet tall. Its body is segmented and almost always
    dull brownish black (though red and black or even yellowish-brown assassin
    bugs have been reported). Its front curved legs (called jackknife legs) are
    black and covered in tiny hairs that aid it in climbing as well as capturing
    its prey. An assassin bug has two pairs of wings that it keeps folded
    against its back when not using them to fly.
  - >-
    Depending on the disposition of the assassin bug, it is either an
    opportunistic ambush hunter that lies in wait for its prey to come close, or
    it actively seeks out its food. Regardless, when a victim is within range,
    the assassin bug leaps to the attack, attempting to grapple and pins its
    prey so it can inject it with its organ-dissolving saliva. A victim that
    dies is kept in the assassin bug's lair for several weeks and feasted upon
    by it and any others in the nest, each taking a turn drinking the liquefied
    internals of the victim.
