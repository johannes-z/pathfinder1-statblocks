Description_Visual: >-
  Perhaps no creature of the water is feared more than the piranha. Lightning
  speed, coupled with vicious teeth and a pack-slaughter mentality place this
  predator firmly at the top of the food chain. Whether swarming together to
  take down larger prey, or developing wings to attack land creatures, the
  ravenous piranha cannot be stopped.

Description:
  - >-
    Larger cousins to the standard piranha, the giant flying piranha is vicious
    fish between 2-3 feet in length, with a silver-gray coloration along the
    dorsal spine; brighter colors in red, orange, and yellow decorate the
    underbelly. Rows of tightly packed teeth give the piranha is distinctive
    underbite, with the individual teeth being 1 inch in length, and broadly
    arrowhead-shaped. Some humanoid tribes prize the giant teeth for use in
    weapons and tools.

    Giant piranha usually attack intruders while in the water, but may attempt
    to strike an unwary victim walking near the water's edge. The giant
    piranha's goal is to get prey in or very near water. While they can fly for
    short periods, the giant piranha do cannot leave the water for long before
    they being to suffocate (see suffocation rules in the Pathfinder Roleplaying
    Games Core Rulebook).
