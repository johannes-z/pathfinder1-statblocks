  This nauseating maggot-like creature has a long tail covered with frightening
  hooked suckers.
Source: The Worldwound
IsTemplate: 0
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Marrow Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      A grimslake's tail is covered with suckers that extend long, thin,
      razor-sharp tendrils to drill into its victim's bones, draining them of
      marrow. The grimslake can drain marrow from any creature it is grappling
      or from any helpless creature as a swift action. The victim can resist
      this painful attack with a successful DC 18 Fortitude save; otherwise, he
      becomes staggered from the horrific agony for 1 round and takes 1 point of
      Constitution drain. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Penetrating Jaws (Su)
    description: >-
      A grimslake's bite attack penetrates cold iron and silver damage
      reduction.
  - name: Slashing Scales (Ex)
    description: >-
      The scales running in a line down a grimslake's back have razor-sharp
      ridges and spines, and the creature is adept at lashing at attackers with
      these scales. Any creature that attacks a grimslake with a natural weapon,
      unarmed strike, or light weapon must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save to
      avoid taking 1d4 points of slashing damage. The save DC is
      Dexterity-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The grimslake is a nauseating creature commonly found amid Abyssal
    battlefields, where it crawls among the bodies, sucking away marrow and
    other vital tissues found within the dead. Of course, when fresh carcasses
    aren't available, grimslakes eagerly to turn to living victims-they take
    particular delight in the sound of screams as they feed. While on the Abyss,
    they often hunt lesser demons, but these semi-intelligent scavengers find
    mortal humanoids a particular delicacy.
  - >-
    The hermaphroditic grimslakes use the remnants of their meals as incubators
    for their eggs. After eating, they fill the drained bodies with their eggs
    and fertilize them. Then they abandon the eggs to search for new feeding
    grounds, leaving behind a hideous legacy. Other scavengers instinctively
    avoid the egg-filled bodies, and 10 to 12 days later, the corpses burst
    open, releasing a mass of grimslakes the length of a human arm. These
    creatures fall upon each other in a ravenous orgy of cannibalism, growing
    quickly as they consume their kin until, a few days later, the few
    surviving, fully grown grimslakes go off in search of new food and
    incubators.
  - >-
    On the Abyss, some demon lords use grimslakes to dispose of bodies. Others
    use them as implements of torture. The worst keep them as food sources-not
    to eat the grown specimens, of course, but to dine on corpses pregnant with
    the grimslakes' seething young.
