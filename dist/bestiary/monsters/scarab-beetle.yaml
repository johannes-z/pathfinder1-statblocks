    description: >-
      A scarab beetle deals 1 point of Strength damage on a successful bite.
      This damage is doubled against creatures with no armor or natural armor
      bonus to AC, but creatures in heavy armor or with a natural armor bonus of
      +10 or greater are immune, as are creatures immune to critical hits or
      without flesh.
Description:
  - >-
    In Osirion, these massive beetles are a threat to ancient tombs as they chew
    their way through the interred. Some say scarab beetles' connection with the
    dead gives them powers greater than those of normal beetles, but any
    evidence of this has yet to been proven true. Merchants claim powdered
    scarab is an essential element in magic that protects against death effects.
