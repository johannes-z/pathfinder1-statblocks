Description:
  - >-
    Mammoth fleas are fierce predators. They require vast amounts of blood to
    survive, though once full, they can survive for months before needing to
    feed again. For this reason, they seek larger prey like cows and horses, and
    plague agrarian communities that raise herd animals. A mammoth flea's bite
    is excruciatingly painful, and leaves behind a raised, ring-shaped scar.
