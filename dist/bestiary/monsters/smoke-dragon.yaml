  This creature is a small, 3-foot long, dragon with a grayish underbelly and
  black scales. Its feet are tipped with smoke-gray talons and it has red-tinged
  wings and blue-gray eyes. Small under-curved horns protrude from its head and
  its serpentine tail writhes like a plume of smoke.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A smoke dragon's breath weapon is a 20 ft. cone of thick, black smoke.
      Creatures caught in the smoke must succeed on a Fortitude save or be
      nauseated as they choke and cough. A creature that chokes for 3 or more
      consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per 2 HD of the
      smoke dragon.
  - name: Smoke Form (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a smoke dragon can assume a smoky form as a move action. It
      can spend up to 1 minute per day per HD in smoke form. This time does not
      have to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. A
      smoke form dragon can fly at a speed of 60 feet (good maneuverability).
      The ability is otherwise similar to a gaseous form spell.
Description:
  - >-
    Smoke dragons lair in marshes, dense forests, or just about any area where
    thick fog is present (or can be present). They venture from their lair when
    the fog is the thickest, so most encounters occur in the morning.
  - >-
    Lairs take the form of natural caves or caverns and are usually near a
    natural source of water. They eat just about anything but prefer a diet of
    fruits, plants, and berries. They also eat small animals such as mice and
    other rodents found slinking about near their lair. A smoke dragon's feeding
    grounds is generally small and most cover an area of less than 1 square
    mile.
  - >-
    Smoke dragons live in small groups and such a group always includes at least
    one mated pair. Hatchlings can assume smoke form for 1 minute per day but
    cannot fly. If eggs are present, the female guards them closely and will
    fight to the death protecting them. Eggs are round, mottled gray and black.
  - >-
    Smoke dragons are generally inoffensive creatures and keep to themselves.
    Only when threatened or if their lair is threatened do they attack. In such
    cases, a smoke dragon unleashes its breath weapon and then swoops in to
    attack with its claws and bite. If the smoke dragon is outnumbered or
    overwhelmed, it uses its smoke form to avoid its opponents and flee.
    Multiple smoke dragons gang up against foes, alternating their breath weapon
    and natural attacks with the other smoke dragons in the gang; i.e., one
    smoke dragon belches forth its breath weapon while the others swoop in and
    attack with their claws and bite.
