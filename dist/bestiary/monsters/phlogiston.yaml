SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fire Bolt (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a phlogiston bush can release
      a tiny bolt of fire in a line to a maximum range of 40 feet that deals 2d6
      points of fire damage to any creature struck. A successful DC 14 Reflex
      save reduces damage by 1/2. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Death Throes (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a phlogiston bush is reduced to 0 or less hit points, it explodes in a
      concussive blast of fire that deals 4d6 points of fire damage to all
      creatures in a 10-foot radius. A successful DC 14 Reflex save reduces
      damage by 1/2. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The phlogiston bush (known as a fire shrub by some sages) is an immobile
    plant found only in temperate regions. Phlogiston bushes gain nourishment
    from the body fluids and organs of living creatures, particularly the bones
    and muscle tissue of such creatures. Being plants, they do gain sustenance
    from sunlight and the soil, so they can go long periods of time (reportedly
    up to two weeks or so) without eating, but given the chance, a phlogiston
    flower catches and kills any living creature that wanders too close to it.
    These plants generate a pleasing odor noticeable to a range of about 30
    feet. It uses this odor to lure semiintelligent creatures (such as ordinary
    animals) into range where it can use its tendrils and fire bolt attack.
  - >-
    These plants rely on living creatures to spread, so on occasion, when not
    looking for a meal, a phlogiston flower releases a small blast of seedlings
    in a 5-foot cone directly in front of it. A creature in the area that fails
    a DC 20 Wisdom check fails to observe that tiny seeds of silvery-green hue
    are clinging to its body. After 1d4 hours, the seedlings drop off and take
    root in the immediate area, blooming into a new phlogiston flower in just
    under 2 months.
  - >-
    A phlogiston bush lies dormant until unsuspecting prey comes with range. It
    then slashes with its tendrils or releases a single fire bolt at its
    opponent. In combat, the phlogiston flower attempts to grab its prey with a
    tendril. Grabbed prey is held until it escapes, dies, or the plant is
    killed. Creatures slain by a phlogiston flower are entwined in its tendrils
    and slowly digested over the next 6 to 8 hours until there is nothing left
    (digestive acids secreted from the plant break down the bones of the
    victim). Being mindless, a phlogiston flower fights until either it or its
    prey is slain.
