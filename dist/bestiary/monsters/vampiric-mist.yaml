SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Siphon (Ex)
    description: >-
      A vampiric mist drains blood with each melee touch attack dealing 1d3
      points of Constitution damage. Every time a vampiric mist damages a
      creature in this way, it heals 1d8 hit points. Hit points healed in excess
      of its maximum are gained as temporary hit points, to a maximum amount
      equal to its Constitution score. These temporary hit points last for 1
      hour.
  - name: Blood Overdose (Su)
    description: >-
      When a vampiric mist gorges on blood to an extent that it gains temporary
      hit points, it moves much more quickly. It gains a +2 bonus to its Armor
      Class and on Reflex saves, and can take one additional move action each
      round.
  - name: Misty Form (Ex)
    description: >-
      A vampiric mist's body is composed of a semisolid red mist similar in
      consistency to thick foam. The vampiric mist does not have a Strength
      score, and it cannot manipulate or wear solid objects. This form grants it
      the amorphous defensive ability, and allows it to move through areas as
      small as 1 inch in diameter with no reduction to its speed. The creature
      can speak in a hissing voice. A vampiric mist cannot enter water or other
      fluids, and is treated as a creature two size categories smaller than its
      actual size (Tiny for most vampiric mists) for the purposes of how wind
      affects it.
  - name: Sense Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      A vampiric mist can immediately sense the presence of warm-blooded
      creatures in a 60-foot radius as if by scent. It can detect exposed blood
      within a mile.
Description:
  - >-
    Often mistaken for a vampire in gaseous form or an unusual type of air
    elemental, the vampiric mist is in fact a strange form of aberrant life.
    With an amorphous body that consists as much of fluid as it does of air,
    this creature dwells in swamps or moist underground regions where its
    vulnerability to heat isn't as much of a concern.
  - >-
    Although somewhat intelligent, vampiric mists do not form societies. They
    sometimes form into small gangs, but even then they show little interest in
    working together. Much of a vampiric mist's time is spent seeking prey-a
    pursuit that the monster often shows great creativity in accomplishing. The
    creatures' propensity for taking on vague, skeletal forms of the creatures
    whose blood they drink only further adds to their mystique and fuels rumors
    that they have connections to the undead. Indeed, many vampiric mists enjoy
    using this common misconception to their advantage, causing foes to use
    foolish tactics-such as tricking spellcasters into using positive energy
    against them as if they were undead monsters.
