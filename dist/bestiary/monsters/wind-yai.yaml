SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Roaring Gale (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action three times per day, a wind yai can select a point
      within sight on which to conjure a violent updraft, violently flinging its
      opponents into the air. When it uses this ability, the wind yai must make
      a single bull rush combat maneuver check (CMB equal to the wind yai's
      caster level + its Cha bonus; +21 for most wind yai) against all creatures
      in a 10-foot-radius burst. Any creature with a CMD score lower than the
      result of this check is hurled 1d6 x 10 feet straight up, and lands prone
      in a spot 1d4 x 5 feet from its original position. The wind yai selects
      the direction it wishes to throw its victims, and may select a different
      direction for each victim, though each must be thrown in a straight line.
      Creatures take falling damage for any impacts while traveling up or down
      in this way; if a creature collides with an object during its sideways
      movement, both the creature and the object take 1d6 points of damage and
      the creature is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle.
  - name: Shocking Missile (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a wind yai can fire a bolt of electricity from its
      third eye as a ranged touch attack. This attack has a range of 180 feet
      with no range increment, and deals 4d6 points of damage. If the creature
      struck is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, it instead takes 4d8
      points of damage. Upon being struck by this attack, the victim must make a
      DC 25 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Wind yai may take after the graceful cloud giants in general appearance, but
    given their hard, icy stares and the brooding manner in which they carry
    themselves, observers may not immediately relate the two races. Whereas
    cloud giants wear their finely made robes and ornate jewelry with an air of
    regality and serenity, their oni imitators manage to make even the humblest
    garments and adornments seem ostentatious, and are always shrouded in an air
    of darkness that many liken to an ill omen. Though wind yai look as though
    they have one foot in the light of day and the other in the darkness of
    night, the shadow that perpetually swirls about the otherworldly beings is
    not the result of any natural source; in actuality, the supernatural night
    that constantly follows wind yai is a raw magical manifestation of their
    foul intentions and evil nature.
  - >-
    Wind yai do not shape the winds-they force their will upon them, commanding
    the powers of the sky to commit acts of domineering brutality with none of
    the natural grace normally associated with the element. Whereas a cloud
    giant is always accompanied by a gentle breeze, the malicious wind yai
    brings with it only furious storms, the chaotic winds tossing its hair about
    and blowing dust into its unblinking triad of eyes.
  - A wind yai is 20 feet tall and weighs over 5,000 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    A wind yai does not appear to walk upon the ground so much as glide across
    it-but even then, its exaggerated movements and overbearing demeanor make
    every footstep a thunderous stomp. An unexpected wayward breeze is enough to
    throw a stony-faced wind yai into a fit of rage, the delicate motions of
    nature an ever-present reminder of the wind yai's own blustering presence
    and lack of grace. Thus are wind yai desperate to gain some semblance of
    control over the capricious winds, and they use their sheer might and
    monstrous resolve to bend that untamable force to their will, taking
    pleasure in not only controlling nature, but also using it for unnatural
    acts of destruction.
  - >-
    Wind yai tend to wear thick, showy robes and heavy jewelry, though their
    great strength still allows them to move swiftly and with ease. Like all
    yai, wind yai each possess a third eye through which they can emit rays of
    destructive energy. In the case of wind yai, this powerful beam takes the
    form of a lightning bolt, as the oni channel the very essence of the storm
    into their attacks, simultaneously electrocuting their opponents while
    rendering them deaf with the cacophonous boom of thunder that follows the
    attack. They also possess the unique ability to send their foes flying into
    the air, commanding bursts of wind to carry their enemies aloft and bring
    them crashing back to the earth.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Cloud giants possess one other thing wind yai yearn to claim mastery
    over-their instruments. But rather than use such delicate tools to create
    melodious works of art, wind yai are interested in their more destructive
    properties, and have a particular respect for bards, especially those who
    bend others to their will with their music. Thus do they tend to seek out
    such rhythmically inclined individuals, and when faced with a foe who
    possesses musical skill, wind yai will invariably seek to keep that
    individual alive, so they can force it to serve as the wind yai's enslaved
    jester and musician. An ensnared performer is usually forced to entertain
    its master until its fingers are cracked and raw and it inevitably falters
    while playing. Wind yai are hardly patient creatures, but nothing sets them
    off in quite the same way as a weak or inept musician, and even the most
    innocent mistake can mean the fatal end for an indentured bard. When wind
    yai are not presented with a suitable performer to capture and dominate,
    they seek out magical instruments, having a particular affection for rare,
    magical instruments, especially those with strings. A wind yai takes great
    pride in its musical possessions, and also finds a unique pleasure in
    assembling masses of enslaved musicians to perform thunderous symphonies.
  - >-
    Wind yai also take great pleasure in dominating cloud giants, perhaps even
    more so than bards, as they revere cloud giants' heavenly melodies above all
    others. Rather than apprehend these giants one by one, however, wind yai
    seek to dominate entire tribes of such beings, using their powers over the
    skies to trick particularly superstitious groups into thinking the oni are
    earthbound demigods or celestial messengers sent from on high. Groups of
    wind yai can be an even fiercer force, gathering entire legions of cloud
    giants under their command and leading them in aerial campaigns against
    helpless creatures on land. Evil cloud giants tend to make the best soldiers
    for wind yai leaders, though if the oni can manage to sway good-aligned
    cloud giants under their banner, the subsequent wars they wage are all the
    more satisfying.
