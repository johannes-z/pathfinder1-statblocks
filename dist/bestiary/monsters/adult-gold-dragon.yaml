  - name: Fire Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      An old or older gold dragon is surrounded by an aura of fire. All
      creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at
      the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient gold dragon's aura extends
      to 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. The dragon can
      activate or suppress this aura as a free action.
  - name: Luck (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can touch a gem, usually one
      embedded in the dragon's hide, and enspell it to bring good luck. As long
      as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature within a given
      radius of it (10 ft. per age category) receives a +1 luck bonus on all
      saving throws. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature,
      only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours
      per age category of the dragon. This ability is the equivalent of a
      2nd-level spell. Spell-Like

    gold cousins as the agents of divine forces and the paragons of dragonkind,
    and often seek them for advice or aid.
