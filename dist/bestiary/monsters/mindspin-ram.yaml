Description:
  - >-
    The hardy Mindspin rams are found only in the high peaks of the Mindspin
    Mountains, where their stark white fur helps them blend into snowbanks to
    escape the giants and trolls that are prevalent in the area. They take
    another of their names, "rosethorn rams," from their dangerous horns, which
    are covered in sharp growths resembling short thorns, and can cause deep,
    bleeding wounds that slow foes down until the rams can flee or finish
    would-be hunters with their sharp hooves. The rams' thorny horns also enable
    them to strip bark from trees for sustenance during difficult winters.
  - >-
    Rigidly adapted to the snowy peaks of their mountain range, the rams are
    fiercely territorial and protective of the caves in which they make their
    dens. During breeding season, they become especially aggressive, venturing
    out to chase off predators and using their deadly horns to drive away
    competition. Even mountain trolls avoid direct confrontation with the rams
    at these times, preferring instead to cave in the creatures' dens, then pick
    through the rubble to gobble up the whole family. Mindspin rams are 4 feet
    tall and 6 feet long, and weigh up to 500 pounds.
