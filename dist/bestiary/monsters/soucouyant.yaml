SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Detonate (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a soucouyant in her fiery form can choose to explode
      in a 30-foot-radius burst of fire that deals 8d6 points of damage (DC 19
      Reflex save for half damage) to all creatures in the area. Using this
      ability returns a soucouyant to her humanoid form.
  - name: Fiery Form (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a soucouyant who has removed her skin can assume the
      form of a flying ball of fire similar to that created by a flaming sphere
      spell (CL 8th) for up to 8 rounds. Upon returning to humanoid form, a
      soucouyant must wait 1d4 rounds before she can assume fiery form again. A
      soucouyant who enters the same space as a creature stops moving for that
      round and deals 3d6 points of fire damage to the creature unless it
      succeeds at a DC 18 Reflex save. A soucouyant in fiery form retains her
      usual AC, but is immune to nonmagical attacks and effects. A successful
      targeted dispel magic spell or dealing 20 points of cold damage to a
      soucouyant in fiery form forces her to return to her humanoid form. A
      soucouyant can assume fiery form a number of times per day equal to her
      Charisma modifier (6 for most soucouyants). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Mask Evil (Su)
    description: >-
      During the day, a soucouyant has the appearance of an old woman, an
      illusion created by an effect like alter self; at night the illusion
      fades, revealing her monstrous nature. While she is "wearing" her skin, a
      soucouyant's evil nature is masked as though by a constant undetectable
      alignment spell.
Description:
  - >-
    Soucouyants are insidious monsters also known as blood crones. They prefer
    to live near small humanoid societies, assuming the appearance of a wizened
    old woman. It is only at night that she assumes her true form, when her
    wrinkled skin peels back and reveals the monstrosity that lurks within,
    which seeks the blood of those sleeping, unsuspecting neighbors who know her
    merely as the eccentric widow living at the edge of town. Soucouyants prefer
    to capture victims for their cruel experiments when possible, and drain such
    unfortunates of their blood over a course of days or even weeks to sate
    their sanguinary appetites.
  - >-
    A typical soucouyant is 6 feet tall and weighs 120 pounds. The most powerful
    soucouyants take it upon themselves to further their spellcasting abilities,
    and usually possess levels as witches.
