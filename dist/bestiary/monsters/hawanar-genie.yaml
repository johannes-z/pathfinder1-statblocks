SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Air Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against a
      hawanar.
  - name: Heat (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hawanar's fists are swathed in white-hot fire that deals 1d8 points of
      extra fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it maintains
      a hold when grappling. The hawanar's metallic weapons conduct this heat.
      The hawanar can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.
  - name: Holocone (Su)
    description: >-
      A hawanar can transform into a vortex of embers and white-hot fire once
      every 10 minutes. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind
      ability. In this form, it can move through the air or along a surface at
      its fly speed. The save DC includes a +3 racial adjustment.
Description:
  - Hawanar are the unlikely union of an efreeti noble and a djinni noble.
  - >-
    Neither of the parent races truly accepts the hawanar but the djinn are more
    tolerant while the efreet usually execute or enslave hawanar offspring on
    sight, viewing them as something unnatural. A typical hawanar stands 12 feet
    tall and weighs about 1,100 pounds.
  - >-
    Hawanar society is ruled by a Rajah who is served by a multitude of beys,
    sheiks, sahibs, and sirdars The hawanar race has no true home and can be
    found spread throughout the planes (most dwell on the Plane of Air or a
    pocket plane of air and fire). Those that dwell on the Plane of Fire
    generally avoid the City of Brass and efreeti patrols due to the disdain the
    efreet have for them.
  - >-
    Hawanar wade into battle in a hail of fire and wind, relying on their
    spell-like abilities and holocone form to dissuade and vanquish its
    opponents. If combat goes against it, a hawanar assumes either gaseous form
    or holocone form and attempts to flee.
