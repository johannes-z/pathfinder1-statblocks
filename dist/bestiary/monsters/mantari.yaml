Description:
  - >-
    Mantari sustain themselves on a diet of rats, carrion, and subterranean
    plants, but prefer the taste of fresh meat - particularly humans and gnomes.
    Mantari appear as large manta rays, gray in color, with a long smooth tail
    that ends in a sharpened barb. The mantari flies silently through its
    underground world in search of prey, and when encountered, it is often
    hungry and immediately attacks.
  - >-
    The mantari attacks by slashing and stinging with its tail. Its preferred
    method of attack is to dive on its target from higher areas, gaining
    surprise with its sting.
