Description:
  - >-
    Stingrays are bottom feeders and are found in warm, shallow waters near
    coastlines and shores. They sustain themselves on a diet of plankton,
    aquatic plants, small crabs, and small fish. Larger stingrays, like smaller
    rays, are found in shallow, warm waters, though these creatures often swim
    into much deeper waters. Giant stingrays feed on creatures such as fish,
    giant crabs, octopus, and sharks. They are more aggressive than their
    smaller counterparts and often engage prey larger than themselves, relying
    on their poison to bring down a foe.
  - >-
    Female stingrays are usually larger than males. Young stingrays resemble
    adult rays, but are much smaller in size. During birth, the young's pectoral
    fins are folded against its body but open as soon as it is born.
  - >-
    Stingrays are completely flat with no discernible head. At one end is a
    long, whip-like tail that ends in a razor-sharp and serrated barb. Their
    eyes appear as small bumps on the end opposite the tail and their mouth is
    located on the underside of their body. The sides of a stingray are composed
    of large, wide pectoral fins (mistakenly referred to as wings sometimes).
    Stingrays are brown, black, or slate gray and their underbelly is white.
    Small stingrays are about three feet across, while the largest ray measures
    12 feet across.
  - >-
    Small stingrays are generally inoffensive creatures. Most "attacks" occur in
    shallow waters when a creature steps on a buried ray. If stepped on, the
    stingray lashes out with its stinger. If threatened by an opponent much
    larger than it, the stingray attempts to sting its opponent and then flees.
  - >-
    Larger stingrays are more aggressive than their smaller counterparts, and
    some are very active when searching for prey. They are nocturnal hunters and
    attack using a tail sting or wing buffet.
