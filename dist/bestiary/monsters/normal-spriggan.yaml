SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Size Alteration (Su)
    description: >-
      At will, a spriggan can grow from Small to Large size or back again.
      Weapons, armor, and other inanimate objects on its person grow
      proportionately with it when it changes size. This is similar to the
      enlarge person spell. An enlarged spriggan gains +12 Strength, -2
      Dexterity, +6 Constitution, and a -2 to AC. While enlarged, a spriggan
      cannot use its spell-like abilities or its innate sneak attack ability
      (though any other sneak attack it may have, such as from rogue class
      levels, is unaffected when it changes size).
Description:
  - >-
    Spriggans are among the ugliest and certainly the most foul tempered of all
    gnomes. At one moment a normal-sized gnome, a spriggan can grow to
    giant-sized in an instant, gaining immense strength and taking unsuspecting
    opponents by surprise. Spriggans are, by human standards, quite homely. They
    have stocky bodies and sickly ochre-colored skin and dark hair of brown of
    black. Male spriggans favor facial hair such as shaggy mustaches and ratty
    beards, but any head or facial hair they have is unkempt and filthy. Female
    spriggans do not have facial hair. Being unhygienic creatures, spriggans
    never bathe or clean their clothing or equipment. Thanks to their filthy
    lifestyle, spriggans reek with the foulness of dirt, body odor, and other
    unpleasantness. Despite being gnomes themselves, spriggans despise all of
    their gnomish kinfolk. A typical spriggan stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs
    50 to 55 pounds. An enlarged spriggan stands about 8-1/2 feet tall and
    weighs 500 to 550 pounds. Spriggans make the best use of their magical
    abilities in combat. When several spriggans are encountered, some will
    enlarge themselves at the first sign of melee, while the remainder will stay
    Small and take advantage of their innate abilities of stealth and sneak
    attacks. Owing to their chaotic nature, complex battle plans are generally
    beyond most spriggan mobs; it is likely that some, none, or all spriggans in
    a mob will change size at the start of melee. Spriggan Society Spriggan mobs
    are almost always comprised of males; female spriggans rarely venture out of
    their dismal lairs other than to gather food. Mobs of spriggan males are
    nomadic in nature, roving from place to place and never settling down for
    more than a few days unless there is promising a opportunity for rewarding
    raids on local communities. Female spriggan mobs are unusually stable for
    such chaotic creatures, often lairing in the same place for years before
    moving on. Spriggan Characters Spriggans have racial Hit Dice and can have
    class levels. Many spriggans with class levels choose rogue. Spriggan
    leaders are usually rogue/fighters or rogue/sorcerers. Spriggan characters
    possess the following racial traits: -2 Strength, +8 Dexterity, +2
    Constitution, -2 Charisma. Spriggans are extremely quick and elusive in
    their normal form but hardy as well. Small size: Spriggans are Small and
    have the following adjustments +1 bonus to Armor Class, +1 bonus on attack
    rolls, +4 bonus on Stealth checks, -1 penalty to CMB/CMD, lifting and
    carrying limits 3/4 those of Medium characters. Base speed: A spriggan's
    base land speed is 20 feet. Low-light vision: Spriggans can see twice as far
    as humans in conditions of dim light. Racial Hit Dice: A spriggan begins
    with five levels of fey, which provide 5d6 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of
    +2, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +1, Ref +4, and Will +4. Racial
    Skills: A spriggan's fey levels give it skill points equal to 5 x (6 + Int
    modifier, minimum 1). Spriggans have a +2 racial bonus on Climb, Disable
    Device, Perception, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks. Racial Feats: A
    spriggan's fey levels give it three feats. Special Attacks: Spell-like
    abilities, sneak attack +2d6. (See below) Special Qualities: Size alteration
    (see above). Languages: Spriggans begin play speaking Gnome. Spriggans with
    high Intelligence scores can choose from the following languages: Common,
    Giant, Goblin, Orc. Credit The Spriggan originally appeared in Dragon #59 (©
