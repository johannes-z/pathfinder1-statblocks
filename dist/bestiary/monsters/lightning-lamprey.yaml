  Lightning lampreys are floating, eel-like creatures about 3 ft. long that are
  covered in static electricity, with arcs and bolts of tiny lightning flying
  off in all directions.

Description:
  - >-
    These strange, flying leeches are very similar to their water-born kin; they
    are roughly 3 feet long, thin grayish-blue creatures with tiny arcs of
    electricity playing over their bodies. They constantly twitch and writhe, as
    if receiving electrical stimulation throughout their bodies.
  - >-
    Schools of lightning lampreys drift along in the wake of storm clouds,
    feeding upon powerful electrical currents and lightning. They are not
    normally encountered away from electrical storms (some may sniff their way
    down from higher altitudes if lightning is actually striking the ground).
    However, they might be found in unusual magical environments where
    electrical discharges or lightning is plentiful.
  - >-
    Their bodies are extremely good electrical conductors, and may have uses in
    magical experiments (value 200 gp to an interested alchemist or wizard).
