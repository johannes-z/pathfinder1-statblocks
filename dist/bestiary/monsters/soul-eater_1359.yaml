SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Caster Link (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a soul eater is summoned, it creates a mental link between itself and
      its conjurer. If the soul eater's assigned target (see find target
      ability) dies before the soul eater can drain its soul, or if the soul
      eater is defeated by its target (but not slain), it returns to its
      conjurer at full speed and attacks her. While the soul eater and the
      conjurer are on the same plane (regardless of plane-traveling
      interruptions), it can use its find target ability to locate its conjurer.
  - name: Find Target (Su)
    description: >-
      When a soul eater's conjurer orders it to find a creature, it can do so
      unerringly, as though guided by a locate creature spell that has no
      maximum range and is not blocked by running water. The conjurer must have
      seen the desired target and must speak the target's name.
  - name: Soul Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      If the Wisdom damage from a soul eater's claw attacks equals or exceeds an
      opponent's actual Wisdom score, rendering the victim helpless, the soul
      eater can devour that creature's soul as a standard action that provokes
      an attack of opportunity. This attack kills the victim. The dead victim
      can resist having her soul eaten by making a (DC 17) Fortitude save;
      success means she is still dead, but can be restored to life normally. If
      she fails this save, her soul is consumed by the soul eater. A victim
      slain in this manner cannot be returned to life with clone, raise dead, or
      reincarnation. She can be restored to life via resurrection, true
      resurrection, miracle, or wish, but only if the caster can succeed on a DC
      30 caster level check. If the soul eater is killed within 120 feet of its
      victim's corpse, and the victim has been dead for no longer than 1 minute,
      the victim's soul returns to her body and restores her to life, leaving
      her unconscious and at - 1 hit point. This is a death effect. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Wisdom Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by a soul eater's claw must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude
      save or take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Summoned forth from the inky swamps of Abaddon, a soul eater is an
    extraplanar entity devoid of emotion or reason and possessing a hunger that
    may only be sated by devouring the souls of the living. The very nature of a
    soul eater makes it an ideal and terrifyingly efficient tool of death, and
    it is for this reason they are often conjured by vile spellcasters pursuing
    morbid agendas. Even when not seeing to the heinous commands of a sinister
    magic user, the soul eater prowls and hunts, constantly seeking living souls
    upon which to gorge itself.
