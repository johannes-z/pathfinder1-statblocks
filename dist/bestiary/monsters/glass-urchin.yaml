SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Glass urchin venom causes the senses to become clouded and creates vivid
      hallucinations and confusion in the victim's mind. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Spines-contact or injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency
      1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Wis and confused for 1 round; cure 2
      consecutive saves.
  - name: Poison Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, once every 5 rounds, a spear urchin can spray poison
      from numerous smaller spines across its body. This poison fills a
      20-foot-radius spread around the urchin- all creatures within this area
      are exposed to the urchin's venom and must make Fortitude saves as
      detailed above to resist Wisdom damage and confusion. This attack is even
      more effective underwater, as the poison spray creates a cloud that
      lingers in the area around the urchin for 5 rounds-creatures must save
      each round they begin a turn in the area of the poison cloud in addition
      to when the urchin creates the effect.
  - name: Spines (Ex)
    description: >-
      A glass urchin's spines can swivel and rotate to face any approaching
      creature that attacks it. Any creature that attacks a glass urchin with an
      unarmed strike or a natural attack, or any Huge or smaller creature that
      attacks with a one-handed weapon or light weapon, is automatically
      attacked by the glass urchin's spines as an immediate action. If the
      spines hit, they can poison the target as well.
  - name: Transparency (Ex)
    description: >-
      A glass urchin's spines and body are transparent when underwater, granting
      the creature concealment and a constant 20% miss chance.
Description:
  - >-
    Much more dangerous than their smaller kin, giant sea urchins are dangerous
    predators of opportunity. With the exception of the hunter urchin, giant sea
    urchins lie in wait for food to come to them, typically carried within reach
    of their attacks via ocean currents or, more commonly, tides. Hunter
    Urchins: These urchins can adjust their spines to effect an awkward method
    of locomotion on land. They actively seek prey, and possess long, rasp-like
    tongues that can whip out and pull food to them. Spear Urchins: These
    brightly colored creatures can fire spines like javelins, relying upon
    poison to slow down prey or eventually immobilize it so they can crawl over
    to feed. Glass Urchins: So named for their transparency, these beautiful
    creatures shimmer like delicate crystals. Yet for all the damage their
    spines can inf lict, victims of glass urchins generally do more damage to
    themselves or their allies due to the potent hallucinatory effects of this
    urchin's venom. Sea Urchins as Difficult Terrain The giant sea urchins
    presented here are fantastic evolutions of their much more common, smaller,
    and less offensive kin. Yet even the smaller common urchins can pose a
    problem for unwary adventurers. Sea urchins live in vast colonies on tidal
    rocks, and moving across a field of urchins can be quite awkward and
    painful. Their thousands of spines are just as sharp as those possessed by
    their larger kin, and they function as caltrops to anyone that walks over
    them. Worse, these spines are venomous, and can poison those who take damage
    from them. Those who succumb to the poison suffer searing pain that can
    sicken them for several minutes. Though uncomfortable, fortunately this
    venom doesn't actually inf lict either ability damage or ability drain. Sea
    Urchin Venom: Spines-injury; save Fort 11; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes;
    effect victim is sickened for 1 minute; cure 1 save.
