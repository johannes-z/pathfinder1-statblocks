    description: >-
      A gelatinous golem can try to wrap an opponent up to one size smaller than
      itself in its body as a standard action. The gelatinous golem attempts a
      grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
      grapple the gelatinous golem establishes a hold. Attacks that hit an
      engulfing gelatinous golem deal half their damage to the golem and half to
      the engulfed victim. An engulfed opponent is subjected to the gelatinous
      golem's paralysis and acid each round it remains trapped. A trapped
      opponent can do nothing other than attempt to escape. Further, an engulfed
      foe must hold its breath or begin drowning (see the Core Rulebook for the
      drowning rules). While engulfing an opponent, a gelatinous golem is not
      considered grappled and can move and attack normally.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gelatinous golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that
      allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. A cone of cold spell
      slows it (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. An acid
      fog spell heals all of its lost hit points.
  - name: Transparent (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gelatinous golem is hard to see, even under ideal conditions, and it
      takes a DC 15 Perception check to notice one. Creatures who fail to notice
      a gelatinous golem and walk into it are automatically grappled (if the
      golem chooses to grapple the opponent).
Description:
  - >-
    Gelatinous golems are the creation of Jubilex the Faceless Lord or rather
    the invention of Jubilex and the creation of his priests. Formed of dead and
    preserved gelatinous cubes and infused with a spark of intelligence, these
    monsters are used by many of his priests as temple and tomb guardians. They
    share a link with ooze golems in that they co-exist in temples dedicated to
    The Faceless Lord. Like most golems, these automatons follow the orders of
    their creator, but being intelligent, they understand more complex
    instructions and can carry out more difficult tasks that ordinary constructs
    cannot. A gelatinous golem stands 8 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. A
    gelatinous golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise. It walks and moves
    with a slow and clumsy gait. A gelatinous golem attacks by smashing its
    opponents with its fists that exude an anesthetizing slime. Paralyzed
    opponents are ignored if other opponents continue attacking the golem. If
    all opponents are paralyzed, the golem carries out the commands of its
    creator (whether it is to kill such creatures, leave them alone, or some
    other such command). Construction A gelatinous golem's body is formed from a
    single dead gelatinous cube of Large or larger size and treated with a
    mixture of rare chemicals worth 1,000 gp. GELATINOUS GOLEM CL 12th; Price
