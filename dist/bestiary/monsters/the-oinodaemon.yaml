Treasure: triple standard
Description_Visual: >-
  This creature stands nearly twice as tall as a normal human. Its head
  resembles that of a diseased and rotting ram with downward, forwardcurving
  horns. The wool and flesh of its humanoid body seem to pull away or drop away
  in sickly clumps. Its body is covered in boils, blisters, sores, and scabs.
  Thick white foam oozes from its mouth and a thin yellow ichor squeezes from
  its bloodshot eyes.
Group: Daemon
Source: Tome of Horrors Complete
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Daemonic Plague: Slam-injury; save Fort DC 47, onset 1 day; frequency
      1/day; effect 2d6 Con damage; cure 3 consecutive saves. Each time the
      victim takes Con damage, it must succeed on a second Fort save or lose 2
      points of the Con damage permanently. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Transfixing Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      A living creature within 30 feet that meets the Oinodaemon's gaze must
      succeed on a DC 46 Will save, or be held (as the hold person spell, CL
      37th). An affected creature can attempt a new save each round to break the
      effects if it has 24 HD or more; otherwise, only the Oinodaemon can
      release it, or a wish or miracle can break the effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. If the Oinodaemon is slain or moves more than 30 feet away
      from a held creature, it is automatically released. The Oinodaemon only
      has to remain within range to maintain this ability; he does not have to
      concentrate.
Description:
  - >-
    Staff of the Lower Planes: This 12-foot long, black wooden staff can only be
    wielded by the current Oinodaemon or any daemon he allows to wield it. In
    anyone else's hands, the staff functions as a normal quarterstaff. Upon the
    current Oinodaemon's death, the staff can be wielded (and it functions as
    detailed below) by the new Oinodaemon. The staff has the powers listed
    below. All powers function as the spell of the same name (CL 25th or the
    wielder's caster level, whichever is higher). Save DCs are 20 + spell level.
    - Doom, fear (1 charge) - Dominate monster, geas/quest, mass charm monster,
    unholy aura (2 charges) - Once per day, wish (grant another's wish) (2
    charges) The staff has an unlimited number of charges, but no more than 50
    charges may be expended in a single day. The staff's powers automatically
    overcome any other daemon's spell resistance. Any non-daemon that touches
    the staff takes 10d8 points of electricity damage per round of contact (no
    save) and gains two negative levels each round it touches the staff. The
    Fortitude save to remove a negative level has a DC of 35 and can result in
    actual level loss on a failed save. The Oinodaemon claims rulership over all
    other daemons. There is no other single figure in the lower planes that
    commands more respect and fear than the Oinodaemon (excepting a few powerful
    arch-devils). His position is constantly threatened by those who would usurp
    the throne and take the position for their own. It is believed there are at
    least seven other extremely power daemons vying for the throne and title of
    Oinodaemon. Through subtle machinations, sheer power, and fear, the current
    Oinodaemon has held all challengers at bay. The Oinodaemon attacks using his
    spells, spell-like abilities, and staff in combat. He does not hesitate to
    gate in other daemons to assist him. Credit Anthraxus (The Oinodaemon)
