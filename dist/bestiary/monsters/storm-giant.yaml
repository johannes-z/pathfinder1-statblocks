Description:
  - >-
    Storm giants tend toward tanned complexions, though some rare specimens have
    violet skin, deep violet or blue-black hair, and silvery gray or purple
    eyes. Such violet coloration is considered to be good luck among storm
    giants, and those possessing it tend to become leaders among their kind.
    Adults are typically 21 feet tall and weigh 12,000 pounds. Storm giants can
    live to be 600 years old. When at rest, they prefer to wear short, loose
    tunics belted at the waist, sandals or bare feet, and headbands. They wear a
    few pieces of simple but finely crafted jewelry, with anklets (favored by
    barefoot giants), rings, or circlets being most common. Yet when they outfit
    themselves for battle, they don shimmering breastplates and wield enormous
    greatswords and bows.
  - >-
    Storm giants tend to be reclusive, prefering to dwell along remote
    coastlines or on tropical islands. Yet like their namesakes, they are prone
    to violent mood swings. Storm giants are quick to anger in the face of evil
    and can be brutal, dangerous foes when insulted. In battle, they prefer to
    send a hail of arrows to rain down on their foes, only drawing their
    greatswords after opponents get inside their bow range.
  - >-
    Storm giants live in well-constructed towers, castles, or walled
    settlements, and prefer to live off the land.
  - >-
    They maintain enormous, well-tended gardens and manage hundreds of acres of
    farmland per group. They often hire other humanoids, such as elves or
    humans, to help them run their massive farms. A storm giant enclave often
    takes responsibility for the safety of an entire island or stretch of
    coastline.
