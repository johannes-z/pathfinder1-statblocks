      An erlking counts as a 20th-level fighter for all abilities and effects
      requiring fighter levels.
Description:
  - >-
    Erlkings guard the wildest, most pristine reaches of nature, and lead other
    fey to reclaim defiled lands. Most forest creatures acknowledge an erlking
    as king of the forest and arbiter in disputes between the people of the
    wilds. In most forests, an erlking is the brother or consort of a hamadryad,
    and represents the aggressive, dangerous, and vengeful aspect of the wilds.
    An erlking is a blur of motion on or off the battlefield, using his powers
    to coordinate attacks against despoilers, manipulate terrain to his side's
    advantage, and call in reinforcements when his forces would be overwhelmed.
    When his services are not needed, an erlking retires to the realm of the
    fey.
