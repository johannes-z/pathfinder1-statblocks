Description:
  - >-
    Among the azatas, lillends are the tale-tellers and chroniclers, gathering
    lore and recording stories in the form of epic poems and songs. They are
    generally peaceful, though they are swift to act if they believe a piece of
    rare art or a talented artist is threatened. A lillend's lower section is
    about 20 feet long, and a typical lillend weighs 3,800 pounds. Although they
    have no need of mortal nourishment, it is said that lillends sup on the joy
    of music, art, and performance. They also love unspoiled wilderness and seek
    out places in the mortal realm that remind them of the beauty of their home
    plane. From the lore of numerous races come tales of these muses,
    particularly those that have taken a vested interest in the training of a
    single talented prodigy or the ongoing creation of some fantastic work of
    art. Such legends sometimes prove true, as all lillends have their favorite
    works, creations, and artists, and often visit the Material Plane to enjoy
    their splendor and make sure they remain safe. In the defense of such
    beauty, lillends prove passionate foes, calling upon the might of nearby
    allies or crushing philistines in their striking but deadly coils.
