Description:
  - >-
    The great mastodon is a distant relative of the common elephant and is
    linked to that creature through the woolly mammoth (see the Mammoth in this
    book). It is a herbivore and is found primarily in forested areas. Its teeth
    are rounded and pointed and make excellent "tools" for clipping leaves,
    branches, and twigs, though its diet also includes things such as grasses,
    fruits, berries, and nuts. A typical mastodon consumes 400 pounds of food
    and 50 gallons of water each day. Mastodons generally deplete an area of its
    food supply before moving on, traveling in large herds with the young in the
    center, surrounded by the adults of the herd. The mastodon does not have any
    particular season for reproducing, though most births seem to occur in the
    winter. Young are born with short thick fur and weigh around 240 pounds. A
    young mastodon reaches maturity at about age ten. The mastodon has three
    natural occurring predators; the dire wolf, the smilodon, and man. The
    latter often hunts the great mastodon for its meat, fur, and the ivory of
    its tusks. Young mastodons are often captured alive and taken into captivity
    and trained as mounts of beasts of burden. The mastodon is a distant
    relative to the elephant though it is slightly longer and lower to the
    ground, with shorter and thicker legs than the common elephant. Its head is
    slightly longer and taller than an elephant's and the mastodon's entire body
    is covered in thick fur of brown, gray, reddish-brown, yellowish-brown, or
    black. Its long, upward curving tusks are formed of ivory and are white or
    yellowish-white in color. Its eyes range from gray to brown to green. An
    average mastodon stands 20 feet tall. Mastodons are generally peaceful
    creatures and avoid combat. They have no natural fear of any creature, so do
    not flee. If threatened, or if their young are threatened, mastodons fight
    by goring with their tusks or trampling foes. Mastodons fight to the death
    to protect their young. Training a Mastodon A mastodon must be trained
    before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a mastodon must have a
    friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a
    successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly mastodon requires six weeks
    of work and a successful Handle Animal check (DC 25). Riding a mastodon
    requires an exotic saddle. A mastodon can fight while carrying a rider, but
    the rider cannot also attack unless he or she makes a successful Ride check.
    Mastodon young are worth 16,000 gp each on the open market. Professional
    trainers charge up to 2,500 gp to rear or train a mastodon. Carrying
    Capacity: A light load for a mammoth is up to 5,592 pounds; a medium load,
    5,593 to 11,184 pounds; and a heavy load, 11,185 to 16,800 pounds. A mammoth
    can drag 84,000 pounds. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
