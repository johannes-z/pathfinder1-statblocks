  Claws the size of daggers lash menacingly before its half-bestial,

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bestial Possession (Su)
    description: >-
      A vilkacis is a spirit of savagery and can take control of other beings,
      afflicting them with its savage nature. Once per round, the vilkacis can
      merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is
      similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th), except it does not
      require a receptacle and lasts for up to 3 hours (or a number of hours
      equal to the vilkacis's Charisma modifier, whichever is greater). To use
      this ability, the vilkacis must be adjacent to the target. The target can
      resist the attack with a successful DC 18 Will save. A creature that
      successfully saves is immune to that same vilkacis's bestial possession
      for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. Upon being possessed by a
      vilkacis, the target takes on a number of bestial features, most notably
      growing claws and vicious fangs, and flies into a savage rage. The victim
      gains two claws and a bite natural attack appropriate to its size (1d4 and
      1d6 for Medium creatures; see Table 3-1 on page 302 of the Pathfinder RPG
      Bestiary), and gains a barbarian's greater rage class ability (see page 31
      of the Core Rulebook). This rage lasts for as long as the victim is being
      possessed by the vilkacis. After the possession ends, the victim is
      fatigued for a period of time equal to double the duration of the
      possession. The victim also gains low-light vision and scent. The
      possessed creature loses all of these natural attacks and abilities
      immediately when the vilkacis leaves its body.
  - name: Curse of Lycanthropy (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoid who is bitten by a creature possessed by a vilkacis must make
      a DC 18 Fortitude save or be infected with lycanthropy as if bitten by a
      werewolf. If the victim's size is not within one size category of the
      possessed creature's, this ability has no effect. The save DC uses the
      vilkacis's ability scores and is Charisma-based.
  - name: Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      A vilkacis or creature possessed by a vilkacis can communicate and
      empathize with wolves and dire wolves. It can use its Diplomacy to alter
      such an animal's attitude, and when so doing gains a +4 racial bonus on
      the check.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      A vilkacis that is destroyed in combat restores itself after 2d4 days. The
      only way to permanently do away with a vilkacis is to locate its canopic
      stone, the occult artifact that binds it to the Material Plane, and then
      destroy the artifact in the presence of the vilkacis's mortal remains.
      Once the canopic stone is destroyed, the vilkacis can no longer rejuvenate
      and can be destroyed as normal.
  - name: Vulnerability to Silver (Su)
    description: >-
      Vilkacis are particularly susceptible to silver. A vilkacis struck with a
      silver weapon takes an additional 2d6 points of damage. If a creature
      under the effects of a vilkacis's bestial possession is damaged by a
      silver weapon, it also takes this extra damage and receives another saving
      throw to resist the bestial possession. If successful, the possession
      ends, and the vilkacis is driven into an adjacent square and cannot use
      its bestial possession ability again until the following day.
Description:
  - >-
    Beings of pure malevolence and destruction, vilkacis arise from the souls of
    the most desperate and brutal werewolves as spirits burning with the need
    for bloodshed and vengeance. Specters of savagery escaped from remains
    tainted by lycanthropy, vilkacis desire to wear mortal flesh and again revel
    in the vicious ecstasy of hunting and killing. Some see these beings as
    malign manifestations of the lycanthropic curse-the spirits of the infamous
    aff liction itself-while others know them as the deathly continuance of
    lives consumed by lycanthropy. In either case, these ravenous spirit-beasts
    seek only to garb themselves in the skins of deadly hunters and revel in
    bloodshed once more.
  - >-
    Vilkacis typically look like more savage versions of the werewolves they
    were in life, appearing in their hybrid forms with exaggerated fangs and
    claws.
  - >-
    Ecology Although a vilkacis exists only in a spectral form, its canopic
    stone permanently binds the spirit to the Material Plane. So long as the
    stone exists, the creature remains stuck between life and death, its spirit
    strangling on its own rage.
  - >-
    When a vilkacis seizes possession of a victim, the host takes on an altered
    appearance ref lective of the beast within its body. The victim undergoes
    severe physical dysmorphia.
  - >-
    Musculature enlarges, posture becomes stooped, and hands curl into gashing
    claws. The face takes on a bestial appearance. The victim's jaws extend and
    grow into jagged, wolfish fangs, while the brow thickens and the pupils
    widen to black pools that radiate a mad, feral stare. In this state, the
    vilkacis-possessed creature froths with the curse of lycanthropy and can
    pass the curse on as though it were a werewolf. Although such a possessed
    creature might pass on the infamous disease, its own transformation
    typically lasts only a matter of hours. A vilkacis is ever searching for
    stronger and more vicious hunters to use as tools in slaking its eternal
    bloodlust; if it finds a particularly promising host, it might visit and
    possess the favored body again and again for its rampages.
  - >-
    Habitat & Society Vilkacis most commonly appear in areas where human
    settlements border or stand within wildernesses. While they are commonly
    associated with werewolves, the folklore of many nomadic and
    nature-worshiping societies contains stories of creatures whose descriptions
    bear strong resemblance to vilkacis. Most haunt the territories where they
    were created, staying within range of their canopic stones, and hunting
    within the lands they prowled in life. However, those with the ability to
    summon vilkacis usually attempt to direct them toward specific prey. This
    often proves a dangerous or even fatal proposition, however, and few reports
    exist of anyone successfully mastering a vilkacis.
  - >-
    Creating a Vilkacis While many vilkacis spontaneously arise under the light
    of the full moon from the remains of the most savage werewolves, some foul
    spellcasters seek out the corpses of such bestial murderers, attempting to
    enslave their spirits and harness their capacity for brutality to fulfill
    the spellcasters' dark whims. To do this, a spellcaster must prepare a
    canopic stone, a talisman that typically takes the form of a ceramic totem
    or amulet bound in silver. Upon creating this object, the bearer can summon
    a vilkacis once per day. The stone grants no control over the vilkacis, but
    the creature will not attack or attempt to possess the stone's bearer. Upon
    being summoned, the vilkacis turns its attention to the nearest creature
    other than the summoner, attempting to possess the creature's body and go on
    a murderous rampage. Using a canopic stone to summon a vilkacis is
    considered an evil act.
  - >-
    Although many vilkacis are purposefully created and employed by evil
    spellcasters, some manifest spontaneously. These beings wander and rampage
    as they please, but still are bound to a talisman similar to a canopic
    stone. This spontaneously created artifact can be utilized by those who
    discover it and discern its importance in the same way as can a canopic
    stone created specifically to summon and control a vilkacis, and typically
    takes the form of the dead werewolf 's skull, the silver weapon that killed
    the werewolf, or a talisman it bore in life.
