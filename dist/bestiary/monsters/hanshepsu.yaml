    description: >-
      A hanshepsu is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell
      resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently
      against the creature. • Dominate animal causes a hanshepsu to become
      confused for 1d4 rounds. • Hold animal slows a hanshepsu (as the slow
      spell) for 1d6 rounds. While slowed, a hanshepsu can't change its animal
      head with its morphic head ability. • Soften earth and stone cast directly
      at a hanshepsu deals 5d10 points of damage (no save).
  - name: Morphic Head (Su)
    description: >-
      As a move action, a hanshepsu can transform its head from one animal form
      to another. Each animal head grants a hanshepsu different abilities. Cat:
      The hanshepsu gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC, a +8 racial bonus on
      Acrobatics checks, and it always counts as having a running start when
      attempting Acrobatics checks to jump. Cobra: The hanshepsu can spit a
      stream of venom up to 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch
      attack with no range increment. Any opponent hit by this attack succeed at
      a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage for 2
      rounds. This is a poison effect. Crocodile: The hanshepsu's mace grows
      teeth and deals an additional 1d6 points of piercing damage with each
      successful attack. Hawk: The hanshepsu gains a +8 racial bonus on
      Perception checks, and all penalties to Perception based on distance are
      halved. Hippopotamus: The hanshepsu's damage reduction increases to DR
      15/- and it gains a +4 bonus against combat maneuvers and effects that
      attempt to move it. Ibis: The hanshepsu can use feather fall at will as a
      spell-like ability and can fly for up to 5 minutes each day. Scarab: The
      hanshepsu's damage reduction is not subject to the effects of a golembane
      scarab or any abilities that allow a creature to ignore a construct's
      damage reduction. Scorpion: The hanshepsu gains a climb speed of 20 feet
      and its mace gains the speedUE weapon special ability for 1 minute each
      day. Set Beast: The hanshepsu's mace deals an additional 1d6 points of
      negative energy damage with each successful attack. Solar Disk: A
      hanshepsu can change its head into a single non-animal form: that of a
      solar disk. In this form, a hanshepsu becomes immobile and heals itself at
      a rate of 5 hit points per hour. Vulture: Each time a creature is struck
      by the hanshepsu's mace, it must succeed at a Fortitude save or contract
      bubonic plague (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 557). Soldier's

  - name: Mace (Su)
    description: >-
      A hanshepsu's mace is treated as a +1 weapon, and the hanshepsu can deal
      nonlethal damage with the mace without taking a penalty. The mace is
      permanently affixed to the hanshepsu's hand during creation so it can't be
      disarmed; it can, however, be sundered. If the mace is destroyed, a
      hanshepsu can make 1 slam attack per round that deals 1d8+7 points of
      damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Strangely intelligent constructs, the earliest hanshepsus were created
    during Osirion's First Age. Hanshepsus were originally built to serve as
    elite soldiers that never tired, didn't need to be fed, and were impervious
    to common attacks. Using secrets stolen from Jistkan golem crafters,
    Osirion's own artificers designed hanshepsus to equalize the battlef ield in
    their clashes against the Jistka Imperium as the two nations carved up
    northern Garund. Throughout the conf lict, hanshepsus fought in dozens of
    battles, each time turning the tide in favor of Osirion's forces as they
    marched ahead of regular, human soldiers through the hot sands of what is
    now Thuvia. Hanshepsus stand as tall as an adult human. While they appear
    lean and muscular, their clay bodies give them additional heft, causing them
    to weigh in at around 300 pounds.
  - >-
    sacrifice of a willing humanoid to provide not only the life force needed to
    animate the construct's body, but also the creature's intelligence. This
    allows the hanshepsu to make calculated decisions on the battlefield, and
    some even commanded humanoid units during battles, implementing clever
    tactics amid the fray.
  - >-
    Though a hanshepsu is intelligent, it lacks anything approaching a
    personality. Cold and stoic, hanshepsus don't hold conversations that
    involve anything more complicated than answering questions or issuing
    orders. Any attempt to engage a hanshepsu further results in utter silence
    and an inexpressive face. Some hanshepsus even shut down in the middle of
    their limited interactions with others, crossing their arms and changing to
    their solar disk head.
  - >-
    Despite their lack of personality, some hanshepsus retain traces of their
    mortal memories, and shout out bizarre non sequiturs in the midst of battle.
    Crumbling texts from the First Age of Osirion contain reports that, after
    time, hanshepsus became unpredictable, sometimes turning on their commanders
    and the other soldiers. This suggested that the process of creating these
    near-impervious soldiers was flawed in some fashion.
  - >-
    Few hanshepsus have been found in the current age, and they are rarely
    discovered in large numbers. The process of creating hanshepsus was
    expensive and required a willing sacrif ice, so only the best and brightest
    warriors were transformed into these constructs. Because of this, modern
    scholars believe that fewer than 5,000 hanshepsus were created before the
    practice fell out of favor, and with the march of time, less than 10 percent
    of that estimation are believed to be still functional.
  - >-
    Hanshepsus work best when assembled in a unit with other hanshepsus. They
    work in concert, taking physical cues from one another and rarely needing to
    verbally communicate. When not charged with leading or when fighting
    alongside a unit containing humanoids, hanshepsus barely regard other
    creatures. When at rest, they simply wait for new commands. In fighting
    units, hanshepsus were often at the front lines of a battle, and they used
    their increased strength and superior defenses to drive a wedge into enemy
    units and scatter their ranks, allowing the humanoid soldiers behind them to
    easily pick off the dispersed soldiers.

    To create a hanshepsu, the crafter must sculpt and shape the body from a
    single block of clay harvested from the banks of the Asp, the Crook, or the
    Sphinx. The creature's head must be fired in a specially prepared kiln
    stoked with 1,500 gp worth of rare desert wood. As a final step, a living
    humanoid must be sacrificed in order to animate a hanshepsu in a
  - >-
    process that separates the victim's spirit from his body and infuses his
    essence (but not his personality) into the clay body.
