Description_Visual: >-
  This serpent is 12 to 15 feet long and 5 feet thick. Its body scales are
  thickened and hardened, which slows it somewhat in water but provides good
  protection. The serpent's most outstanding features, however, are the rows of
  long, sharp teeth that fill its mouth. It has large, lidless red eyes with
  white pupils.

Description:
  - >-
    The fanged sea serpent is a vicious predator of the seas feared for its
    tendency to travel in packs and swarm over creatures much larger than
    itself. Fanged sea serpents are nomadic, traveling with ocean currents.
  - >-
    They prefer to hunt in groups, which they can surround and attack from all
    sides. Fanged sea serpents have been known to attack their own kind, but
    only when starving.
  - >-
    Fanged sea serpents on their own usually live on large fish, and avoids
    confronting intelligent opposition unless they believe their victims to be
    helpless. However, when they are in groups, they become much more
    aggressive, and attack creatures much larger than themselves. They prefer to
    use swarm tactics, surrounding their target and attacking simultaneously
    from all directions; in the water, where they can also attack from above and
    below, few marine creatures can stand up to a prolonged assault.
