SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Roll (Ex)
    description: >-
      Upon making a successful grapple check against a foe of its size or
      smaller, a hetkoshu deals bite damage to the target and knocks it prone.
      This does not break the hetkoshu's grapple.
  - name: Hold Breath (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hetkoshu can hold its breath for 4 rounds per point of Constitution
      before having to make Constitution checks to continue holding its breath
      (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 445).
  - name: Savage Rush (Ex)
    description: >-
      For 1 round per minute, a hetkoshu may sprint with devastating speed,
      increasing its land speed to 40 feet and allowing it to treat nonmagical
      difficult terrain as if it were normal terrain. If it charges during this
      round, it may attack twice with its bite as its attack action, using the
      same attack modifier for both attacks.
Description:
  - >-
    Infamous along Osirion's major rivers as well as in the Golden Oasis near
    Shiman-Sekh, hetkoshus are among the most dangerous animals on Garund. They
    pose a constant threat to travelers and those who make their livelihoods
    along these waterways. Hetkoshus wait for prey to pass within 90 feet before
    rushing at them to gobble up one or two opponents in a single terrible
    motion, preferably before the prey even realizes any danger exists. They are
    known for their feared "death roll"-once one clings to its foe, it tucks in
    its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its victim.
  - Hetkoshus average 30 feet in length and weigh nearly 45,000 pounds.
