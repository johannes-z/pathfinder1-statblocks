SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Slashing Weapon Vulnerability (Ex)
    description: >-
      If an opponent rolls a natural 20 with a slashing weapon against an ice
      troll (and subsequently confirms the critical hit), the ice troll must
      succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage taken) or lose a limb (roll
      1d6: 1-3 arm, 4-6 leg; 50% chance of either right or left). An ice troll
      that loses a leg falls to the ground, but can continue moving at one-half
      speed. Severed limbs cannot attack but move at a speed of 30 feet toward
      the nearest source of water or ice.
  - name: Regeneration (Su)
    description: >-
      If an ice troll loses a limb or body part, the lost portion grows back in
      2d6 minutes so long as both the ice troll and lost body part are within 30
      feet of each other and are both in contact with ice or water. The creature
      can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump, but
      only if the severed member has been in contact with ice or water for at
      least 1 round.
Description:
  - >-
    Ice trolls are relatives of normal trolls, but are decidedly more cunning,
    ruthless, evil, and despicable. They make their homes in very cold climates,
    always near a pool of water (either natural or troll-made). The strongest
    (and sometimes most intelligent) member of a band is usually the leader.
    Unlike their trollish cousins, ice trolls do not rush headlong into battle.
    They prefer to attack the weakest opponents first if they can. If combat
    goes against an ice troll, it does not hesitate to flee. Ice trolls savor
    the taste of human flesh and construct their lairs near civilized areas
    where humans are plentiful. Ice trolls often set traps for humans and either
    devours them immediately or captures them and carries them back to their
    lair. Captured humans are caged and fattened up before they are eaten. An
    ice troll stands about 8 feet tall and weighs 450 pounds. Ice Troll

    barbarians or rangers, though ice troll clerics are also known to exist. +8
