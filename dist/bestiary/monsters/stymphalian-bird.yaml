SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Feathers (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stymphalian bird can loose a volley of four feathers as a standard
      action when flying (make an attack roll for each feather). This attack has
      a range of 60 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30
      feet of each other. The creature can launch only twelve feathers (3
      volleys) in a single day. The stymphalian bird may use this ability in
      conjunction with its Flyby Attack feat.
Description:
  - >-
    Stymphalian birds are crane-like predators found in dense forests and
    lowland hills. They are voracious creatures that sustain themselves on a
    diet of livestock, cattle, and the like. They are particularly fond of the
    flesh of humans and elves, so always attack them on sight. A stymphalian
    bird has an ibis-like body. Unlike an ibis, however, the stymphalian bird's
    beak is long and straight rather than curved. Its feathers, talons, and beak
    are made of bronze.
  - >-
    A stymphalian bird attacks from the air by releasing a volley of bronze
    feathers at its opponents. It then swoops down and attacks with its beak and
    wings, flying out of range before its opponents can react. On the ground, a
    stymphalian bird slashes with its wings and stabs with its beak.
  - A typical stymphalian bird stands 7 feet tall and weighs 450 pounds.
