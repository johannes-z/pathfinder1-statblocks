SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ethereal Ambush (Ex)
    description: >-
      A phase spider that attacks foes on the Material Plane in a surprise round
      can take a full round of actions if it begins the combat by phasing into
      the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane.
  - name: Ethereal Jaunt (Su)
    description: >-
      A phase spider can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as
      a free action, and shift back again as a move action (or as part of a move
      action). The ability is otherwise identical to ethereal jaunt (CL 15th).

      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 8 rounds; effect 1d2
      Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Phase spiders are voracious predators from the Ethereal Plane who hunt on
    the Material Plane. When prey is located, the spider shifts to the Ethereal
    Plane to prepare an ambush. Against a lone victim, the spider shifts to the
    Material Plane, bites the victim, then retreats back to the Ethereal Plane
    to wait for the poison to take effect. Against multiple foes, a phase spider
    follows these same tactics, and on each round a foe remains in reach at the
    start of its turn, it repeats this gambit. If no foes are in reach, it moves
    while ethereal to prepare an attack on an available target, but unless it
    feels safe in spending an entire round on the Material, it won't phase back
    to attack unless it can do so while saving a move action for an escape.
  - >-
    Phase spiders are the natural enemy of another denizen of the Ethereal
    Plane-the xill. The two races have long fought a bloody war with no real
    prospect of a resolution anytime soon. Were phase spiders less horrifying
    and alien in appearance, they might find the allies they need to defeat the
    sinister xill among other races, but their monstrous forms and often
    overwhelming hunger make diplomacy difficult.

    On the Ethereal Plane, phase spiders can manipulate the raw smoky ether in a
    manner similar to how a spider manipulates webs. Vast, complex nests of
    semisolid ether float idly through the eddies of the Ethereal Plane, each
    supporting numerous phase spiders. The creatures enjoy each other's company,
    but have no real concept of family-a newborn phase spider is fully capable
    of fending for itself and is treated no differently by its parents or
    siblings than any other.
  - The typical phase spider is 8 feet long and weighs about 700 pounds.
