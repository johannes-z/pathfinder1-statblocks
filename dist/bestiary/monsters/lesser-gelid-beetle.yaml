SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cold (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gelid beetle's body generates cold that deals an extra 1d4 points of
      cold damage every time it succeeds on a bite attack. Creatures attacking a
      gelid beetle unarmed or with natural weapons take this same cold damage
      each time one of their attacks hits.
  - name: Cold Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day a gelid beetle can release a spray in a 10-foot cone that
      deals 2d4 points of cold damage. Those within the cone who succeed a DC 13
      Fortitude save take only half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Gelid beetles inhabit icy forests and other such desolate places in arctic
    climates. They spend most of their time hunting, surfacing from their lairs
    at night to prey on giant or smaller insects. During the daylight hours,
    gelid beetles like to congregate with others of their kind in warm spots
    where the sunlight breaks through the trees.
  - >-
    Gelid beetles make their lairs in hollowed logs, dead trees, and other such
    hidden places. During the mating season, the female digs a small underground
    chamber in a well-secluded place and lays 1d4+1 silverywhite eggs. These
    eggs hatch in about 2 weeks producing olive-yellow larvae. The larvae spends
    its time feeding and growing (and occasionally molting) before passing into
    the pupa stage after nearly 3 weeks in its larval stage. The pupa sheds its
    skin for the last time after 8 to 10 days and emerges as an adult gelid
    beetle.
  - Most beetles are white with silvery-black legs and dull silver mandibles.
  - >-
    Some specimens have a mottled silver or black carapace and an even rarer
    species has dull crimson wing covers.
  - >-
    A lesser gelid beetle begins combat with its cold spray. It then charges
    into combat biting its opponents. Though not intelligent, these creatures
    often employ hit-and-run tactics, especially when attacking as a group.
