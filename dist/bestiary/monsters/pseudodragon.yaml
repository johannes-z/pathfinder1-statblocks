Description:
  - >-
    Pseudodragons are tiny cousins of true dragons, and are playful but shy.
    They often only vocalize in chirps, hisses, growls, and purrs, but can
    communicate telepathically with any intelligent creature. If approached
    peacefully and offered food, they are usually willing to share information
    about what they've seen in their territory, but threats or violence make
    them flee.

    Pseudodragons are carnivores, devouring insects, rodents, small birds, and
    snakes, though they sometimes eat eggs, and most also enjoy butter, cheese,
    and fish. They either hunt on the ground like lizards or look for prey on
    the wing like a raptor. As smart as a typical humanoid, they do not enjoy
    being treated as pets and prefer being treated as friends. They are wary of
    evil folk but can bond with sorcerers and wizards as familiars, and some
    have befriended druids and rangers or partnered with good dragons as scouts.
    Pseudodragons will serve as familiars if they approve of a spellcaster's
    personality (and if the spellcaster takes the Improved Familiar feat), but
    often also bond with those whose company they enjoy or who have proven
    themselves true friends. A pseudodragon might follow another character in
    this manner for days, weeks, years, or even a lifetime if the creature is
    treated well, provided with food, and generally well-loved.

    Upon reaching adulthood, a pseudodragon's body is about 1 foot long with a
    2-foot tail, and weighs about 7 pounds. A pseudodragon egg is the size of a
    chicken egg, but leathery and spotted brown, and a mating female lays 2-5
    eggs every spring. A clutch of pseudodragons (the collective noun-not to be
    confused with pseudodragons from the same brood of eggs) usually consists of
    a mated pair and several near-adult offspring.
