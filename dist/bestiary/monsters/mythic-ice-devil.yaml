Description_Visual: >-

Group: Devil
Source: Mythic Adventures
IsTemplate: 0
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cold Logic (Su)
    description: >-
      When a mythic ice devil's spell resistance protects it from a
      mind-affecting effect, it can expend one use of mythic power as an
      immediate action to turn that effect upon its source, as if using spell
      turning.
  - name: Favored Enemy (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mythic ice devil can expend one use of mythic power to gain a +6 favored
      enemy bonus against one type of creature for 1 hour, as if it were a
      14th-level ranger.
  - name: Ice Burrowing (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability works like the burrow ability, but only through ice and snow
      (including magical ice such as a wall of ice).
  - name: Ice Shards (Su)
    description: >-
      A mythic ice devil's ice-tipped spear embeds jagged shards of
      supernaturally cold ice in its target. This functions as bleed (1d6),
      except the damage is cold damage. Dealing 5 or more points of fire damage
      to the target removes all ice shards. Creatures with the fire subtype are
      immune to this ability.
  - name: Slow (Su)
    description: >-
      A hit from a mythic ice devil's tail or spear induces numbing cold. The
      opponent must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be affected as though
      by a slow spell for 1d6 rounds. This effect comes from the devil, not its
      weapon; it is not a quality possessed by the spear itself. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic ice devil is a master of strategy, able to adapt to the nature of
    its opponents and turn its enemy's attacks back at them. Its lean form and
    upright posture sets it apart from the stockier non-mythic ice devils.
