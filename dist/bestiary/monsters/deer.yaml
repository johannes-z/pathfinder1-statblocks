Description:
  - >-
    Shy and wary, deer range from the arctic to the tropics. They are very
    flexible creatures, adapting easily to their climate and able to survive in
    all but the harshest of temperatures. Deer are very flexible in their diets
    as well, able to exist on plants, insects, fish, and even dead birds. Deer
    are excellent swimmers and have been known to swim to a distance of five
    miles in the water. These statistics represent the typical white-tailed
    deer; they can also be used to represent other deer-like animals such as
    caribou and antelope. Deer attack with their hooves or antlers. Antelopes,
    when defending their herd, attack by charging an opponent and butting with
    their horns (gore). The gore attack only applies to bucks with antlers.
    Black-Tailed Deer The statistics above can be used to represent the average
    black-tailed deer as well, with a few minor changes. The black-tailed deer
    prefers plains, hills, and other open ground as its habitat. It has a +4
    racial bonus on Acrobatics checks when jumping. In combat, a black-tailed
    deer jumps about in an effort to confuse its attackers before stotting
    (hopping) away. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
