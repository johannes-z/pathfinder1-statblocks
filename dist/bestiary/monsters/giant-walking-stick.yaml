  What at first appears to be a spindly, dead tree suddenly crawls from its

  - name: Nauseating Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      A walking stick can spray a 15-foot cone of irritating, foul-smelling
      liquid once every 1d4 rounds. Creatures within this area must succeed at a
      DC 17 Reflex save or be sickened for 5 rounds. Alternatively, the walking
      stick can target a single creature within 30 feet with a stream of this
      fluid. To use this version of its nauseating spray, the walking stick must
      succeed at a ranged touch attack (+5 for most walking sticks). If the
      target is hit, it must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or become
      nauseated for 5 rounds; otherwise, it is sickened for 5 rounds. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    More common in rocky badlands than the great sandy dunes, stick bugs of all
    sizes are often mistaken for the fallen palm fronds or thorny leaf less
    trees found near oases and other spots in the desert where vegetation grows.
    Giant walking sticks often remain motionless for days at a time, waiting for
    the right prey to pass by before striking. When engaged with a foe too
    difficult to overtake, giant walking sticks flee from the fight. They
    usually expel their nauseating spray in these situations, but some can even
    break off their own limbs in order to escape, regrowing the missing arm or
    leg later once they're safe.

    A fully grown giant walking stick stretches from 6 to 10 feet long, but
    typically weighs only 120 pounds.
