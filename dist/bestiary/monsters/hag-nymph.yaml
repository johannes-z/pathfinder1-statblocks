SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Profane Beauty (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability affects all humanoids within 30 feet of a hag nymph. Those
      who look directly at a hag nymph must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or
      take 2d4 points of Strength damage. A hag nymph can suppress or resume
      this ability as a free action. A creature that saves or fails its save
      cannot be affected by the same hag nymph's profane beauty for one day. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Profane Grace (Su)
    description: >-
      A hag nymph adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on all her saving
      throws, and as a profane bonus to her Armor Class. Spells A hag nymph
      casts spells as a 10th-level sorcerer, and does not need any material
      components.
Description:
  - >-
    The true origins of the hag nymph are cloaked in secrecy. Tales speak of a
    band of nymphs that blasphemed their goddess and were punished for dare
    offending her. Other legends say the hag nymph is the resulting offspring of
    a demon and nymph. Regardless, these creatures are vile and evil and take
    great pleasure in tormenting others.
  - >-
    Hag nymphs live deep within dark forests in huts composed of mud and timber.
    These huts are well constructed and littered with the rotting remains of
    creatures they devour. Hag nymphs relish the taste of humanoid flesh, but
    sustain themselves on a diet of forest animals when humanoids are scarce.
    Forays under the cover of darkness into towns on the edge of the forest are
    not unheard of. In such raids, children are the most likely victims as they
    are easier to carry away.
  - >-
    Hag nymphs stand 6 feet tall and weigh 150 pounds. Their frames are somewhat
    emaciated, almost corpse-like in appearance. Their clothes usually carry the
    bloodstains of previous victims. Hag nymphs live for 150 years.
  - >-
    Hag nymphs attack from range bombarding their foes with an array of spells.
    Slain opponents are dragged to the hag nymph's lair and devoured at her
    leisure. Occasionally hag nymphs seek to capture rather than kill their
    opponents. Such opponents are taken prisoner and used as slaves by the hag
    nymphs, performing manual labor for them or being used as blood sacrifices
    in dark rituals.
