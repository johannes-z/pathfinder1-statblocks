SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Caustic Mucus (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a river drake can spit a ball of caustic mucus that
      explodes in a 5-foot-radius spread. This attack has a range of 50 feet,
      deals 2d8 points of acid damage, and entangles creatures in the area. A DC
      14 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the entangle effect. An
      entangled creature takes 1d4 points of acid damage each round on its turn,
      and may attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn every round to
      escape the entanglement and end the acid damage. Once a river drake spits
      mucus, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Speed Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a swift action, a river drake can draw on its
      draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that allows it to take
      an additional move action that round.
Description:
  - >-
    Preying upon fish and fishermen with equal ease, river drakes are scourges
    of freshwater expanses. They are thought to be related to black dragons, as
    evidenced by their acidic spit, water affinity, viciousness, and preference
    for rotten meat.
  - >-
    Like other drakes, river drakes are cruel hunters, using a play-and-prey
    hunting style. When not hungry, they amuse themselves by stalking and
    harassing other creatures and travelers. An offering of treasure thrown into
    the water can distract a river drake, but such a bribe is unlikely to stave
    off a particularly hungry individual. River drakes often slay more than they
    can immediately eat because they favor aged meat, keeping underwater larders
    stuffed with kills in various stages of decay.
  - >-
    A river drake is a crafty, careful hunter that uses its watery home to
    provide concealment from creatures on the shore. If caught unawares while on
    land, it retreats to the water, or takes to flight if its enemies are
    prepared for aquatic combat, making constant use of its caustic mucus and
    great speed.
  - >-
    River drakes are much more likely to hunt in groups than most other drakes,
    threatening river traffic or assaulting lakefront or riverside towns if
    their numbers are large enough. However, these disorganized raids are quick
    to retreat from any hint of significant resistance.
  - >-
    River drakes are 8 feet long and look much like small sea drakes. An adult
    river drake weighs about 700 pounds.
