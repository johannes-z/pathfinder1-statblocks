SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Morphic Body (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mezlan can assume the appearance of any Medium or Small creature (other
      than creatures with the elemental, incorporeal, or swarm subtypes-the body
      assumed must be solid). The mezlan's creature type doesn't change in this
      new form and it gains none of the mimicked creature's special abilities;
      the transformation is cosmetic only. In these other forms, the mezlan
      retains all of its normal statistics and abilities as depicted above.
      Though this ability only affects the mezlan's outward image, it is a
      transmutation effect.
  - name: Morphic Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mezlan can manipulate its body to mimic a wide array of potent weaponry
      wielded by its various forms. While the weapons may look different, they
      are considered natural weapons and they all do the same amount of damage;
      are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction; and
      deal bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Once per round, a mezlan
      can extend one of its limbs to strike at a distance up to 15 feet away
      with one of its slam attacks. Also, while mimicking a creature wielding a
      ranged weapon, a mezlan can fire a portion of its body as if the fragment
      were a projectile. This projectile is treated as a thrown weapon and has a
      range increment of 60 feet.
  - name: Skill Pool (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mezlan has a special knack for solving problems. Five times per day, it
      can apply a +4 competence bonus on any skill check, even checks for skills
      it has no ranks in or skills that can only be used untrained.
  - name: Spell Battery (Su)
    description: >-
      A mezlan can store up to 10 levels of spells that it can then cast freely.
      The spells imbued into a mezlan are each activated with the casting time
      for the relevant spell and are cast at the caster level of the spellcaster
      who provided the spells. A mezlan can store and use both divine and arcane
      spells, and can be imbued by any number of casters at a time. To fuel this
      ability, a caster must cast her spells into the mezlan; alternatively, the
      spellcaster can use a scroll to place a spell into the mezlan. A mezlan
      must voluntarily lower its spell resistance in order to be imbued with
      spells. In addition, a mezlan can choose to lower its spell resistance and
      absorb spells cast at it. The mezlan must be aware of the incoming spell
      and ready an action to absorb it. Only spells that have the mezlan as a
      target can be absorbed in this way; area spells are not absorbed. If a
      mezlan already possesses 10 levels of spells, it cannot absorb more. The
      mezlan can use these absorbed spells as its own.
  - name: Versatile Speech (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mezlan has a talent for parsing spoken languages. After spending 1
      minute listening to a speaker use a language it doesn't already know, a
      mezlan can understand that language. After listening for 1 additional
      minute, the mezlan can speak the language. This understanding lasts for 24
      hours before fading from the mezlan's mutable mind. To understand the same
      language again after this time, the mezlan must spend another minute
      listening to a creature speak that language. The mezlan doesn't have to be
      engaged in a conversation to use this ability.
Description:
  - >-
    Built by Azlanti arcanists and engineers to perform the duties of spies and
    elite troops, units of mezlans were deployed to engage in extractions,
    infiltrations, and quick strikes on well-protected locations. Scholars
    believe that at the height of Azlant, close to 1,500 mezlans were created to
    save the empire. The difficulty of destroying mezlans leads scholars to
    believe that at least half of them still exist to this day.
  - >-
    Mezlans blur the lines between constructs and oozes, a mixture made even
    more strange by their possession of unique, previously human personalities.
    Each mezlan was once an exemplary living Azlanti or Thassilonian soldier
    graced with superior skills and intelligence. Upon being chosen for this new
    duty, these soldiers were given a full explanation of the changes they would
    undergo and signed a contract to serve them empire as mezlans. Each was then
    subjected to numerous magical and technological procedures to extract her
    consciousness, preserve it, and inject it into her new form. Sometimes the
    process didn't take as well as others, and resulted in an incomplete and
    flawed mezlan. Evidence of these flawed specimens didn't always reveal
    itself before the creatures were deployed, and many these became rogue
    mezlans.
  - >-
    Most mezlans were recruited from the ranks of the military, and thus most of
    them possessed martial-related or skill-related class levels; however, a few
    of these creatures were once wizards who traded their magical talent for an
    amorphous form and near immortality.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Without the need to eat, sleep, or breathe, mezlans are practically
    immortal. When they are defeated in battle, they simply discorporate and
    begin seeping down into the soil or cracks in the ground. If the material
    making up a mezlan isn't contained in some way or destroyed by subjecting it
    to continued energy damage, the creature lies dormant for 10 years before
    reforming. When a mezlan reincorporates, it is treated as if it had 16
    negative levels. These negative levels are removed through time at a rate of
    1 per month.
  - >-
    Mezlans retain a portion of their previous memories and experiences, but the
    extent of those memories varies from individual to individual. Some mezlans
    slowly regain their memories, some immediately remember everything from
    their previous incorporation, and others never fully grasp their previous
    selves.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Mezlans seem to get along and work well with other mezlans, but to normal,
    living creatures, they appear strange and unnatural. They are very observant
    creatures who study everything they encounter, especially creatures-a
    frequent use of their skill pool ability. Some mezlans become accustomed to
    a particular form or body and use that persona as a default. Others enjoy
    keeping dozens of regular personas and cycle through them for particular
    duties they need to complete, meshing these personalities into a toolkit
    they use throughout their day-to-day activities. A few purists keep an
    amorphous, bloblike form unless they need to resemble something else.
    Strange mezlans who have gone mad over the years constantly shift their
    forms, flickering between hundreds of different ones.
  - Becoming a Mezlan
  - >-
    Though not constructs, mezlans are still created beings, the marriage of
    transformative magic and a living soul. Only the prohibitive cost of
    creating mezlans, not any shortage of volunteers, prevented their creators
    from manufacturing thousands of them. The sheer volume of djezet needed to
    create a mezlan forced their creators to grant the honor of the
    transformation to only the best of the best, greatly increasing their worth.
  - >-
    The method for creating a mezlan is lost to time, though it is rumored one
    of them retains the knowledge to produce more of its own kind. In any case,
    the price of the materials and special processes necessary to create an army
    of mezlans would likely bankrupt a nation.
