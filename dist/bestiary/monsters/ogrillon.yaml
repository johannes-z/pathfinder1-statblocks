SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ogre Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      For all special abilities and effects, an ogrillon is considered an orc or
      ogre. For example, ogrillons can use special ogre or orc weapons or magic
      items with racially specific ogre or orc powers as if they were ogres or
      orcs.
  - name: Reinforced Fists (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ogrillons are considered to be armed even when unarmed (i.e., they do not
      provoke attacks of opportunity from armed opponents when attacking them
      and can themselves still make an attack of opportunity against an opponent
      that attacks unarmed). Additionally, they always deal lethal damage rather
      than nonlethal damage when fighting unarmed.
Description:
  - >-
    Ogrillons are a fierce half-ogre race born of a union between a female orc
    and a male ogre. They tend to act like ogres, but they are far more violent
    and aggressive than their larger kin. Ogrillons are usually only slightly
    taller than orcs, with features that strongly favor their orc parent - so
    much so that most ogrillons are indiscernible from normal orcs. About 10% of
    ogrillons resemble their ogre parent, however. Ogrillons love nothing more
    than combat. They are a race so inborn to be warriors that they seem almost
    depressed and dejected when they are not involved in melee. They only time
    an ogrillon laughs is when it is the center of a whirlwind of melee and
    covered in its opponent's blood. Ogrillons do not care for armor or weapons
    and in fact carry very little gear at all. They do, however, like gold
    pieces and usually keep a few in a filthy pouch with other shiny trinkets as
    lucky charms. Ogrillons disdain the use of armor, relying solely on their
    natural armor to protect them. They also disdain the use of weapons,
    preferring to leap headlong into a fray with fists swinging madly. Ogrillon
    Society Ogrillons have no society to call their own. Since they are born of
    female orcs, ogrillon children are generally raised in orc clans. Their
    size, strength, and ferocity are welcomed by the orcs, and ogrillons usually
    occupy a place of reverence in an orc clan. Ogrillons, of course, think
    little of the admiration of their orc kin. Battle is the only thought that
    regularly enters the ogrillon mind. Ogrillon Characters Ogrillons have
    racial Hit Dice and can have class levels. Most ogrillon leaders are
    barbarians. Ogrillon clerics tend to worship "the Destroyer," and they can
    choose two of the following domains: Chaos, Evil, Strength, and War. Most
    ogrillon spellcasters are adepts. Ogrillon characters possess the following
    racial traits. +8 Strength, +4 Constitution, -4 Intelligence, -2 Wisdom, -2
    Charisma. Ogrillons are fierce warriors. Darkvision: Ogrillons can see in
    the dark up to 60 feet. Racial Hit Dice: An ogrillon begins with two levels
    of humanoid, which provide 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +1, and base
    saving throw bonuses of Fort +3, Ref +0, and Will +0. Racial Skills: An
    ogrillon's humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 2 x (2 + Int
    modifier). Racial Feats: An ogrillon's humanoid levels give it one feat. AC:
    +4 natural armor bonus. Natural Weapons: Ogrillons can fight with 2 unarmed
    strikes that deal lethal damage (1d4). Special Attacks: Reinforced fists
    (see above). Special Qualities: Orc/Ogre blood (see above). Languages:
    Ogrillons begin play speaking Giant, and can also speak Common if they have
    an Intelligence of at least 10. Ogrillons with high Intelligence scores can
    choose from the following languages: Dwarf, Gnoll, Goblin, Orc. Credit The
