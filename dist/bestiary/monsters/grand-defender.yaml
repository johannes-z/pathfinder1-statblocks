SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ablative Adaptation (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, the Grand Defender can cast off its outer layer of
      metal, revealing a slightly smaller version of itself underneath. This new
      form may be made of cold iron, mithral, or iron, and its appearance may
      change with each use of the ability, altering its apparent genders, hair
      style, and so on. In its cold iron form, the Grand Defender's DR changes
      to DR 15/cold iron and its attacks count as cold iron for the purpose of
      bypassing damage reduction. In its mithral form, its DR changes to DR
      15/silver and its attacks count as silver. In its iron form, its abilities
      revert to normal. If the herald is brought to 0 hit points, it becomes
      inert; 1d4 hours after it last took damage, it sheds its outer layer and
      reanimates at half its normal hit points. Regardless of how often it uses
      this ability, the herald never changes size categories, as if it slowly
      grows to its normal size between transformations. Once shed, the outer
      layer decays into worthless powder 1d4 minutes after the transformation,
      though before this occurs it can spend 1 full round consuming the
      discarded metal to recharge its hammer storm ability.
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds, an iron golem can exhale a
      10-foot cube of poisonous gas that persists for 1 round. Any creature
      within the area when it is exhaled (as well as any creature that passes
      through the cloud during the remainder of that round) is exposed to the
      cloud's poisonous effects. This poison is magically created each time the
      golem uses this power. Breath weapon-inhaled; save Fort DC 19; frequency
      1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution damage; cure 2 saves. The
      save DC is Constitution-based. Defender's
  - name: Shield (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Grand Defender's shield is a +3 heavy steel shield, though it becomes
      nonmagical if the herald is destroyed or is no longer holding or wearing
      it.
  - name: Dwarf Traits (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Grand Defender has the following dwarven racial traits: defensive
      training, hardy, hatred, stability, stonecunning, and weapon familiarity.
  - name: Hammer Storm (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a full-round action, the Grand Defender can expel a volley
      of warhammers from its mouth in a 30-foot cone that deals 15d6 points of
      bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 19 half). If the herald is in its cold iron
      or mithral form, these hammers count as cold iron or silver. The Grand
      Defender can exclude any number of squares in the cone's area, preventing
      the hammers from striking those squares. The attack also counts as an
      awesome blow, though the Defender makes a single combat maneuver check,
      applying that result to the CMD of all creatures in the area, and affected
      creatures can only be knocked directly away from the Defender. The hammer
      storm actually creates 24 physical warhammers that persist after the
      instantaneous attack and may be used by creatures (though they are normal
      warhammers, not masterwork, cold iron, or mithral). The Grand Defender can
      spend 1 minute eating 24 warhammers (or an equivalent amount of metal) to
      recharge this ability.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Grand Defender is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow
      spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against
      it, as noted below. • A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows
      the Grand Defender (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw.
      • A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the
      Grand Defender and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the
      attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the
      herald to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as
      temporary hit points. The Defender gets no saving throw against fire
      effects. • The Grand Defender is affected normally by rust attacks, such
      as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.
Description:
  - >-
    Created by Torag to serve as his herald, the Grand Defender is a powerful
    golem animated by the collective will of dozens of great dwarf heroes. The
    heroic souls within the golem consider it an honor to lend their knowledge
    and love of battle to this mighty shell so it can protect dwarves in the
    mortal world. These heroes control the golem for anything from a single
    manifestation to several consecutive months of tasks, and afterward return
    to their reward in the afterlife. These multiple identities contribute to
    its varying appearance in each incarnation, even changing its apparent
    gender. The above statistics describe a typical manifestation of the herald,
    though if it is summoned for a specific purpose, the individual spirits
    within might have greater knowledge pertaining to that purpose. In general,
    the herald is friendly toward followers of Torag and focused on defending
    individuals or communities.
  - >-
    Ecology The spirits within the Grand Defender retain all their mortal
    memories and knowledge, and when in the mortal world they have been known to
    recognize or call out through the herald to old friends, relatives, or
    offspring with an unexpected familiarity and affection. If visiting a place
    one of its spirits had been as a mortal, the golem might know secret exits
    or caches of materials long forgotten by the current inhabitants. Without
    the heroic spirits, the herald barely has a will of its own and acts in a
    programmed fashion like a common iron golem; however, Torag never sends it
    to the Material Plane that way, and existing knowledge of its "empty" state
    only comes from rare visitors to Torag's planar realm who encountered the
    herald. As a construct controlled by dead heroes, the Grand Defender has no
    need for rest or sustenance. However, the controlling spirits may enjoy the
    company of other creatures, and the golem can consume materials, though its
    sense of "taste" is certainly altered to suit its magical abilities. For
    example, most of the heroic souls report mild intoxication after eating
    metal in order to recharge the hammer storm ability.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Since followers of Torag respect the knowledge of crafting and defense, most
    are in awe of the herald for having multiple lifetimes of learning and
    experience. In idle times before or between battle, mortal dwarves have been
    known to ask it for lost secrets of forging and engineering, and the hero
    spirits have Torag's permission to pass on this lore as long as doing so
    doesn't hinder his herald's purpose for that visit. Other dwarves hope to
    speak with a dead ancestor in order to pay their respects, apologize for
    some old offense, or recount a descendant's achievement. In this capacity,
    the Grand Defender takes on a role similar to an oracle or spirit mediator
    for ancestor-worshiping cultures, acting as a bearer of messages to the
    afterlife and strengthening a community's connection to its past. Because of
    these connections, Torag prefers to include spirits with ties to the
    intended community or location rather than members of a rival clan or
    outspoken heroes whose opinions and prejudices have grown less quaint and
    more embarrassing over the centuries.
