SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Find Target (Sp)
    description: >-
      When ordered to find a creature, a soul eater does so unerringly, as
      though guided by discern location. The being giving the order must have
      seen the creature to be found and must know the target's name. This
      ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.
  - name: Link to Caster (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a soul eater is summoned to the Material Plane, it creates a mental
      link between itself and the caster who summoned it. If a soul eater's
      victim (i.e., the creature it is summoned to slay) is killed before the
      creature can devour its soul, the soul eater returns at full speed to the
      caster and attacks him. Likewise, if a soul eater is defeated in battle
      (but not slain) by its target, the creature returns to the caster and
      attacks him. So long as both the caster and soul eater are on the same
      plane of existence, the soul eater can successfully locate the caster
      (again as though guided by discern location). If the caster leaves the
      plane, the link is temporarily broken. Once the caster returns, or the
      soul eater enters a plane the caster is on, the link is immediately
      restored.
  - name: Soul Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      When a soul eater slays a foe, it devours the victim's soul. Such a
      creature cannot be returned to life by any means save a deity's
      intervention.
  - name: Wisdom Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by a soul eater's claw attack must succeed on a DC 17
      Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. A creature brought to Wisdom 0 dies.
Description:
  - >-
    A soul eater is an extraplanar creature of great power. Its plane of origin
    is unknown but is thought to be some sort of void plane. Soul eaters are
    summoned to the Material Plane for one purpose-to slay living creatures.
    When given a target, a soul eater can track it unerringly. Soul eaters
    sustain themselves on the life energies of living creatures and derive this
    sustenance by draining the souls of living targets. A soul eater strikes
    with two ghostly claws in each round. It attacks until either it or its
    target is defeated or slain. A soul eater's natural weapons are treated as
    magic weapons for the purpose of over coming damage reduction. Credit The
    Soul Eater originally appeared in the First Edition module X4 Master of the
    Desert Nomads (Â© TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.
