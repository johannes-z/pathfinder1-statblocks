Treasure: standard
Description_Visual: >-
  This enormous humanoid possesses vibrant green skin and equally loud hair, and
  is surrounded by a ring of huge drums and storm clouds.
Group: Kami
Source: AP 52
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cacophonous Blow (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a kaminari deals damage with a slam or trample attack, it also
      deals 11d6 points of sonic damage. In addition, a creature struck with
      this ability is rendered permanently deaf. A creature that makes a
      successful DC 27 Reflex save takes half damage and avoids the deafening
      effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Storm Ward (Su)
    description: >-
      A kaminari treats a specific mass of transient storm clouds as its ward.
      This storm is about 1 mile in diameter, and a kaminari can observe the
      world from any point within its storm ward, whether merged with it or in
      its physical form. A kaminari can only control the movement of its ward to
      a minimal extent, willing it to remain in one place or move in a cardinal
      direction for up to 2d4 hours every day. After this time, the ward
      continues on its natural course for 24 hours, after which the kaminari may
      will it to remain stationary again. When a kaminari is in its physical
      form and within its ward or within 120 feet of its ward's boundaries, it
      gains the power to call down bolts of lightning. The kaminari can call up
      to a total of 15 bolts of lightning each day, each of which deals 5d10
      points of electricity damage. This ability is otherwise identical to call
      lightning storm.
  - name: Vulnerable to Silence (Su)
    description: >-
      A kaminari constantly surrounds itself with sound and music, and can't
      stand any form of silence. Whenever a kaminari is affected by a silence
      spell or effect or is rendered deaf by any means, it loses its cacophonous
      blow ability and its fast healing for the duration of the effect. But
      because a kaminari possesses incredible resilience to such effects, any
      silence or deafening effect lasts only 2d4 rounds or as long as the
      effect's duration states, whichever is shorter.
Description:
  - >-
    Kaminaris are robust spirits of enormous size that watch over the balance of
    weather, taking the form of violent storms wherever they go. More
    monstrous-looking and boisterous than most kami, kaminaris are often
    mistaken for oni upon first glance, their unpredictable natures furthering
    the confusion. Kaminaris care little for most mortals, primarily concerning
    themselves with the maintenance and protection of their wards- enormous
    storm clouds that represent the awesome power of thunder and lightning. In
    addition to their duties guarding their storm wards and the balance of
    weather, kaminaris are endlessly fascinated with musical instruments,
    particularly drums.
  - >-
    Kaminaris have vibrant skin and equally colorful features; the specific hues
    vary from kaminari to kaminari. A kaminari stands roughly 25 feet tall and
    weighs about 10 tons.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Though a kaminari commands the awe-inspiring powers of lightning and thunder
    as though they were simply extensions of itself, the kami of storms have
    limited power over their wards. As dictated by the obscure and convoluted
    Laws of Golden Perfection, a kaminari has only limited ability to will its
    ward to travel in any particular direction or halt its movement for a modest
    amount of time per day. Thus it is often merely a passenger upon the clouds
    of a storm.
  - >-
    Though most storms collect and dissipate with some frequency, a
    kami-inhabited storm is more permanent than most weather patterns, and as
    long as both the kami and its ward are neither destroyed nor corrupted, the
    storm could exist for a potentially infinite amount of time.
  - >-
    Kaminaris despise the use of magic to alter weather patterns, and attempts
    to disrupt their storm clouds often result in the enormous kami's unabashed
    and wrathful ire. A kaminari is as volatile as the storm it protects, and
    the powerful spirit is quick to exterminate any creature-mortal or
    otherwise-it deems a threat to the natural balance of weather. Whether an
    evil sorcerer is trying to bring devastation to a seaside town by calling
    forth powerful hurricanes or a benevolent wizard is summoning rain to save a
    desert city in the midst of a natural drought, if such manipulation comes to
    the attention of the watchful and wandering kaminaris, they find little
    forgiveness. This is not to suggest that the kami of storms are evil-their
    threshold for nuisances is simply lower than most kami, and their
    punishments more destructive.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Floating thousands of feet above most civilizations, kaminaris are usually
    isolated from other creatures, and this suits the reclusive kami just fine.
    A kaminari does not interfere with the matters of mortals beyond the natural
    destruction caused by its storm clouds, and only aides such diminutive
    creatures when the task would be required of it because of some stricture of
    the Laws of Golden Perfection. Once a kaminari has fulfilled its required
    duty, it is only too happy to continue on its way, where it can remain
    uninterrupted as it creates its music and fills the air around it with
    thunder and lightning.
  - >-
    A kaminari is as devoted to its ward as it is to the practice of music, and
    the intensity of the storm it sits upon usually corresponds to the amount of
    aggression with which it plays its instrument. While it rarely cares to
    interact with mortals, tending first and foremost to its ward, a kaminari
    may entertain the idea of interacting with a fellow virtuoso. Kaminaris thus
    have a great affection for bards who practice an instrument, and will
    occasionally interrupt their diligent guardianship of their storm if doing
    so allows them the opportunity to play with a skillful accompanist. Amateurs
    need not apply, as the immortal kaminaris are often among the best players
    of their instruments, commanding powers of music so stirring that even the
    most talented bard might have trouble keeping up.
  - >-
    A kaminari goes to great lengths to surround itself with booming noise, and
    is rarely seen without its instrument of choice. While most kaminaris prefer
    to use drums and other percussion instruments to fill the air around them
    with sound, rare individuals also adhere to the use of keyboard, string, and
    wind instruments. The powers of these kaminaris do not greatly differ, but
    their choice of instrument is usually a fair indicator of their temperament
    as well as the kind of storm they travel upon-those who play keyboards are
    usually found amid desert-quenching storms that wander arid environments,
    bringing with them the power of tornadoes and dust storms; players of string
    instruments tend toward oceanic environs, residing within the hearts of
    devastating hurricanes of incredible magnitude far out at sea; and kaminaris
    who use wind instruments occupy blizzards, commanding the powers of the ice
    and snow that constantly whip about them.
