SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Agent of Fate (Sp)
    description: >-
      A mothman may recreate the effects of any spell of 5th level or lower once
      per day as a spell-like ability, but only if doing so steers the flow of
      fate in its proper course. What the proper flow of fate entails is
      determined by the GM. Typical uses of this ability include casting major
      image to coax someone to a portentous location, casting raise dead to
      return someone with an important fate to life, or using rusting grasp to
      weaken a structure and cause some necessary calamity. Mind-Warping
  - name: Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Fear, 30 feet, Will DC 18 negates. A creature that fails a save against
      this attack becomes shaken for 1d6 rounds. A creature currently suffering
      from a fear effect that fails this save instead takes 1d4 points of Wisdom
      damage. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Little is known of these strange creatures, save that when they appear,
    calamity follows. Mothmen see themselves as agents of fate, exhibiting
    extraordinary powers to guide the hands of destiny. More often than not,
    citizens encounter a mothman and never recall the meeting, yet fall right
    into the creature's obscure plans.
  - Mothmen stand almost 7 feet tall and weigh 100 pounds.
