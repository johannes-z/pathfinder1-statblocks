SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Condemn (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, as a melee touch attack, a proscriber can sever the
      connection between a divine caster and his or her deity. The target can
      attempt a DC 22 Will save (to negate the effects. If the save fails, the
      divine caster loses the ability to cast divine spells, turn or rebuke
      undead, smite good or evil, and loses the use of other divine-based spell,
      spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. Even if the save
      succeeds, the divine caster touched takes 10d6 points of damage. The save
      DC is Constitution-based. Additionally, one that fails its save resists
      all beneficial divine spells (such as heal, or any cure spell) and effects
      cast on him or her. A creature attempting to cast a beneficial divine
      spell on a condemned creature must make a successful DC 20 caster level
      check or the spell has no effect on the condemned creature. The effects of
      this ability are permanent but can be removed by the casting of a remove
      curse spell followed by an atonement spell. The one casting the remove
      curse and atonement spells must be a divine caster who worships the same
      god as the condemned and who is of a class level equal to or higher than
      the condemned.
Description:
  - >-
    When a divine caster severely angers his or her god by deviating from the
    deity's spoken word, the god often sends one of its agents to redeem the
    blasphemer-the proscriber. They are the "messengers" of the gods and are
    sent to punish a divine caster that has offended his or her deity.
    Proscribers are found in the employ of all deities, from the kindest to the
    vilest-they cover all nine alignments. (A proscriber of a good or evil
    alignment gains the appropriate subtype.) Redemption as dictated by the
    deity and carried out by the proscriber can vary from mild punishment to
    extremely harsh. Harsh punishment meted out by evil-aligned proscribers
    often takes the form of death. Proscribers are usually sent to deal with
    divine casters that have strayed from their alignment. Minor transgressions
    are not the realm of the proscriber and are usually left up to the divine
    caster's superiors or church to deal with. Proscribers can be encountered on
    any of the inner or outer planes, so long as a deity maintains its home
    there. Proscribers never leave the confines of the deity's home except as
    commanded by the god. If encountered outside a deity's home, the proscriber
    is on a mission for the deity it serves. When traveling other planes, the
    proscriber often uses its polymorph to assume a shape that allows it to move
    undetected without drawing attention to itself. However, when it confronts
    its target, it always assumes its true form When a proscriber is sent to
    deal with a creature, it uses its discern location ability to pinpoint the
    target's precise location before plane shifting to the target's location.
    Upon arrival and before confronting the target, the proscriber casts align
    weapon (if it has the spell prepared) on its longsword. It then casts death
    ward, divine power, and sanctuary on itself. The proscriber then confronts
    the target and charges it with its sins before doling out its punishment.
    This punishment can be anything from the proscriber casting blindness or
    bestow curse, or in the case of evil proscribers, perhaps casting slay
    living or some other vile spell. If attacked, the proscriber fights back
    using its weapons, spells, and spell-like abilities. Non-evil proscribers
    generally do not attempt to kill the target or its allies, but will not pull
    its punches (that is, they won't always deal nonlethal damage) against its
    aggressors. If combat goes against the proscriber, it tries to casts word of
    recall and escape. The power of a deity infuses the proscriber's armor and
    shield and thus do not hamper is movement speed. It still suffers the normal
    armor check penalties to skills, however. Upon its death, the proscriber and
    its armor, shield, and weapon vanish in a flash of light (white if
    good-aligned, gray if neutral-aligned, or black if evil-aligned). Copyright
