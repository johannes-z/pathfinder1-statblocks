SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Most humanoids slain by a ragewight rise as cairn wights (though with
      chaotic evil alignments) in 1d4 rounds. However, humanoids with 6 or more
      Hit Dice and the rage class feature instead become ragewights, retaining
      the rage powers they had in life. Such spawn are under the command of
      their creator until its death, at which point they become free-willed
      undead.
  - name: Savage Fury (Ex)
    description: >-
      A ragewight can trigger a savage fury as a free action. It can use this
      fury for 24 rounds each day. These rounds don't need to be consecutive.
      The ragewight gains a +6 profane bonus to its Strength and Charisma and a
      +3 profane bonus on Will saves when using this fury. When a ragewight ends
      its fury, it is staggered for 1d4 rounds and can't resume its fury during
      this time. This ability otherwise functions as the greater rage barbarian
      class feature, treating the ragewight's racial Hit Dice as its barbarian
      level for the purposes of rage and any rage powers.
Description:
  - >-
    Ragewights are the spirits of savage warriors who died in a rage and have
    since had their burial places disturbed or robbed. They are most common near
    the necropolis of Nogortha, a vast graveyard that includes many barrows of
    barbarians slain in 1707 ar by the expansionist forces of Taldor. Grave
    robbers plundering such barrows occasionally unleash a ragewight, which
    immediately sets out to build an undead army of spawn and wage war against
    those who slew it centuries ago.
