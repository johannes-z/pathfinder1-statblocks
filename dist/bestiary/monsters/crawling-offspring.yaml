Description:
  - >-
    Crawling offspring are mindless creatures spawned from a living monolith.
    There is great variety in the form and appearance of the crawling offspring;
    such as bulging eyes, flapping wings, writhing tentacles, slime-covered
    pseudopods, and so on.
  - >-
    Most crawling offspring are destroyed and re-absorbed by the living monolith
    they were spawned from, but those few that escape wander or crawl about
    seeking prey. A crawling offspring attempts to devour the nearest living
    creature it detects.
  - >-
    Each crawling offspring is unique; roll on the Crawling Offspring Features
    table to determine the special attack of each.
