Description_Visual: >-
  This creature looks like a tattered and desiccated humanoid about 8 feet
  covered in fresh blood which seems to ooze and weep from its body. Its clothes
  hang in rags and are soaked in blood as well. Its hands end in sharpened claws
  and its eyes display no signs of life.

Description:
  - >-
    When a living creature bleeds to death on unholy ground, its corpse
    sometimes returns to life as a blood wight. Evil priests of Orcus, Jubilex,
    Lucifer and various other demon princes and devil lords often hold dark
    rituals where they bleed a living creature to death in order to create a
    blood wight. Blood wights generally detest living creatures, but if created
    by a clerical or necromantic ritual, the created blood wight will not harm
    its creator (unless attacked first). Blood wights are solitary creatures
    though occasionally more than one of these creatures is encountered
    (particularly when they have been created by an evil cleric or necromancer).
  - A blood wight stands 8 to 10 feet tall and weighs 400 to 550 pounds.
  - >-
    It appears much as it did in life but its body constantly weeps and oozes
    blood, even leaving footprints as it moves across the ground. Blood wights
    that could speak in life retain the knowledge of all languages they knew,
    but for the most part blood wights do not communicate either with others of
    their kind or with living creatures (including their creator).
  - >-
    A blood wight enters combat slashing with its claws. Given a chance, it
    grabs the closest opponent and engulfs it, holding it inside its body until
    it drowns. Drowned foes are ejected from the blood wight's body into a heap
    on the ground (the blood wight later devours any creature it kills).
  - >-
    A blood wight's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose
    of overcoming damage reduction.
