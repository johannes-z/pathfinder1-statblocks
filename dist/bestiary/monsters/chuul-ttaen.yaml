SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Darkvision Camouflage (Ex)
    description: >-
      A chuul-ttaen is virtually impossible to detect solely using darkvision. A
      chuul-ttaen is considered invisible (+40 Stealth or +20 Stealth when
      moving) when encountered in the dark by a creature using darkvision. In
      lit areas, a chuul-ttaen appears as a ghostly white surface-dwelling
      chuul.
  - name: Larvae Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per week as a free action, a female chuul-ttaen can release a spray
      (15-foot cone) of minute barbed larvae. The initial blast deals 1d8 points
      of damage and injects larvae into the opponent's body. The affected
      creature must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save to avoid implantation. The
      save DC is Constitution based. If a chuul-ttaen implants larvae into a
      paralyzed or otherwise helpless creature, it gets no saving throw. The
      larvae pupate over the course of 10 days. The host becomes increasing ill
      suffering a -1 to Strength, Constitution and Dexterity each day of the
      pupation (-10 maximum) as the pupae absorb nutrients. At the end of the 10
      day gestation, 2d4 Diminutive chuul-ttaen burst from the host, killing it
      in the process. A remove disease or heal spell rids a victim of the
      larvae/ pupae as does a DC 25 Heal check. If the check fails, the healer
      can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of
      damage to the patient. The ability score damage heals normally after the
      larvae/pupae have been removed.
  - name: Paralytic Tentacles (Ex)
    description: >-
      A chuul-ttaen can transfer a grappled victim from a claw to its tentacles
      as a move action. The tentacles grapple with the same strength as the claw
      but deal no damage, instead exuding a paralytic secretion. Anyone held in
      the tentacles must succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save each round on the
      chuul-ttaen‘s turn or be paralyzed for 6 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. While held in the tentacles, paralyzed or not, a
      victim automatically takes1d8+7 points of damage each round from the
      creature's mandibles.
Description:
  - >-
    Chuul-ttaens are similar to their normal chuul cousins, possessing many of
    the same skills, attacks and defenses.
  - >-
    The ttaen versions are said to swim in the cold depths of the world and only
    find their way to the surface when summoned by particularly vile wizards.
    Others claim they are simply underground albino versions of a normal chuul -
    albeit a more intelligent and deadly monstrosity. The heavily armored
    chuul-ttaens are excellent swimmers, and often rise up from the depths to
    grab land-bound creatures in their claws and tentacles.
  - >-
    Some scholars say the ttaen addition to their names is a designation of
    royalty or a higher ranking in chuul society, although this has not been
    confirmed.
  - >-
    The ttaens are able to communicate more easily with other races via a raspy
    Common speech. Chuul-ttaens have little interest in conversation, however,
    and are much more likely to attack before asking questions. Only extremely
    powerful foes give them pause and might warrant words before weapons.
  - >-
    Underground races fear the chuul-ttaens, claiming the hideous creatures were
    bred to wipe out all life in the tunnels under the land. They are perfect
    assassins and even the deadly drow fear these versions that can hide from
    darkvision.
