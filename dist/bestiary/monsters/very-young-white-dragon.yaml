SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Icewalking (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the
      dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without
      penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on
      ice.
  - name: Snow Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy
      conditions. A white dragon does not suffer any penalties to Perception
      checks while in snow.
Description:
  - >-
    Although most consider it to be the weakest and most feral of the chromatic
    dragons, the white dragon makes up for its lack of cunning with sheer
    ferocity. White dragons dwell on remote, frozen mountaintops and in arctic
    lowlands, making their home in glittering caves full of ice and snow. They
    prefer their meals completely frozen.
