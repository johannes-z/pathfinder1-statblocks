Description_Visual: >-
  At various places in the planes, rifts of special tears appear and allow the
  mundane creatures of one plane to intermix with the creatures of other planes.
  On these occasions, it is most often not the terrible beasts such as demons or
  angels that pour through, but much less powerful (but not harmless) creatures
  mirroring the beasts of the natural realm.

Description:
  - >-
    Significantly larger than their cousins, the medium fire crab is a
    monstrosity slightly larger than a dog. The pincers, if they could extend
    fully (the joints of a fire crab almost turn in on themselves), would reach
    some 10 ft. or more.
  - >-
    The coloration of a medium fire crab varies from a bright red to nearly
    maroon in older specimens.
  - >-
    Fire crabs are omnivorous; they feed on other animals and any plant life
    that survives the fire crabs native environment. The fire crabs may survive
    temperatures lower than 100 degrees for 1 hour per point of Constitution, or
    run the risk of freezing.
