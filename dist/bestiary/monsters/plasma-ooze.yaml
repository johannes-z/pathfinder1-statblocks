SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Magnetic Pulse (Su)
    description: >-
      A plasma ooze is surrounded by an aura of magnetism that allows it to
      attract metallic objects and creatures. At the start of the ooze's turn as
      a free action, the ooze makes a combat maneuver check against all metallic
      creatures, all creatures wearing metal armor, and all creatures wielding
      metal weapons within 30 feet. If it beats the CMD of a metal or armored
      creature with this check, that creature is pulled 10 feet closer to the
      ooze and cannot move away from the ooze for 1 round. If this causes the
      creature to move into a square occupied by the plasma ooze, the ooze can
      attempt to engulf that creature as a free action. If it beats the CMD of a
      creature wielding a metal weapon, that weapon is disarmed and pulled 10
      feet closer to the ooze. Unattended metal objects of size Large or smaller
      are automatically pulled toward a plasma ooze. This magnetism is
      supernatural in nature and affects all metal objects.
  - name: Plasma Ray (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a plasma ooze can fire 1d4 plasma rays at up to 4
      separate targets within 60 feet (no more than one ray can attack a single
      creature). Each ray deals 4d6 points of electricity damage and 4d6 points
      of fire damage on a hit.
Description:
  - >-
    Massive and devastating, plasma oozes are mysterious, extraterrestrial
    beings made of superheated electromagnetic sludge. While their origin is not
    fully known, it is widely accepted that plasma oozes are not from this
    world. Some scholars believe they dwell in the sun, while others maintain
    they hail from the Plane of Fire. That plasma oozes have been encountered in
    both of these locations does little to help solve the debate.
  - >-
    A plasma ooze flies by somehow interacting with gravity and magnetic waves,
    drifting through the air in a manner similar to the way a jellyfish swims in
    water. This creature's only real purpose is to consume, and it prefers to do
    so by drawing prey into its fiery, electrified core. Scholars find it
    curious that while a plasma ooze can only attract metallic substances, the
    thing can only digest organic matter, and rather slowly at that.
  - >-
    Survivors of plasma ooze attacks are rare, but such victims describe the
    pain of being struck by one's rays as like being pulled apart piece by
    piece. Wounds left by a plasma ooze's touch resemble hideously melted burn
    scars.
  - A plasma ooze is 20 feet in diameter and weighs 6,000 pounds.
