SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Unholy Nimbus (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a free action a nalfeshnee can create a nimbus of
      unholy light, causing nauseating beams of writhing color to play around
      its body. One round later, the light bursts in a 60-foot radius. Any
      non-demon creature caught within this area must succeed on a DC 22 Will
      save or be dazed for 1d10 rounds as visions of madness hound it. The save
      DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Few demons understand the inner workings of the Abyss like the nalfeshnee,
    and it is not unusual to see a nalfeshnee seeming to serve the Abyss itself
    rather than a demon lord. Some claim stewardship over the fleshy realms that
    birth new demons, while others guard sites of particular significance deep
    in the plane's secret reaches. Often, a nalfeshnee's realm in the Abyss
    surpasses the strength and size of the largest of mortal kingdoms, for
    nalfeshnees display a singular gift for managing and ordering the chaos of
    the Abyss. Mortal summoners often seek them out for their unparalleled yet
    mad intellects, ever taking care to comb through bargains with such demons
    for hidden and unwanted consequences, for there is little a nalfeshnee will
    agree to do that does not, in some sinister way, advance the needs and
    desires of the Abyss. Nalfeshnees stand 20 feet tall and weigh 8,000 pounds.
    They form from the souls of greedy or avaricious evil mortals, particularly
    those who ruled over empires of slavery, theft, banditry, and more violent
    vices.
