  crackling fire.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fire Bolt (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round, as a standard action, an amber skeleton can discharge a
      line of fire from its spear. The bolt has a range of 40 feet and deals 6d6
      points of fire damage against a single target (Reflex save DC 14 for
      half). This is a function of the amber skeleton and not the spear itself.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Heated Body (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature striking an amber skeleton unarmed or with natural weapons
      takes 2d6 points of fire damage (no save). Weapons striking an amber
      skeleton take this same fire damage unless the attacker succeeds on a DC
      14 Fortitude save. Damage caused to weapons in this manner is not halved,
      but hardness does prevent some of the damage dealt. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      An amber skeleton is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow
      spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against
      it, as noted: A magical attack that deals fire damage heals 1 point of
      damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the
      amount of healing would cause the amber skeleton to exceed its full normal
      hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. An amber skeleton
      gets no saving throw against fire effects.
  - name: Vulnerability to Water (Ex)
    description: >-
      A significant amount of water, such as that created by a create water
      spell, the contents of a large bucket, or a blow from a water elemental,
      that strikes an amber skeleton forces the creature to make a DC 20
      Fortitude save to avoid being staggered for 2d4 rounds. An amber skeleton
      that is immersed in water must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round (the
      DC increases by +1 each subsequent round) or take 1d6 points of damage
      each round until the water is gone.
Description:
  - >-
    Amber skeletons are constructed and used by high level spellcasters, often
    acting as guardians to keep secret some unknown or lost knowledge.
  - >-
    An amber skeleton appears as an amber-colored skeleton, about 7 feet tall,
    with two large gemstones that function as eyes. It is often mistaken for an
    undead creature. The gemstones can be pried out of a destroyed amber
    skeleton with a DC 20 Strength check. Each gemstone is worth 1,000 gp if
    fully intact and not damaged when it is removed.
