Description:
  - >-
    The immense megalania is often mistaken for a dragon or dinosaur. Certainly
    the lizard's aggressive attitude and deep, rumbling roars only encourage
    such misidentifications. Large enough to catch and eat rhinos and elephants,
    a megalania prefers hunting much smaller prey that it can gulp down in one
    greedy swallow. Humanoids are among its favorite meals.
  - A megalania is 20 feet long and weighs 2,000 pounds.
