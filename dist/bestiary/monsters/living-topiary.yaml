Source: PFRPG Bestiary 4
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Assimilate (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a living topiary can consume undergrowth or bushy
      plant matter it's currently touching and incorporate that material into
      its form. It can do this at a rate of 5 cubic feet per round, healing 1d8
      points of damage each time. If the topiary is at maximum hit points, this
      ability has no effect.
  - name: Hedge Stride (Sp)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as tree stride, but rather than allowing for
      teleportation from tree to tree, it permits the living topiary to teleport
      from one area of brush or hedges to another area of similar vegetation
      within 1,500 feet.
  - name: Move through Hedges (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living topiary may move through any mass of brambles or other dense
      plant growth without penalty. It must begin and end its turn outside of
      the mass.
  - name: Sculpt Shape (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a living topiary can alter itself to take on the
      basic form of any creature. The change is purely cosmetic, and does not
      change its size, grant it any special powers, or alter its abilities.
Description:
  - >-
    Part plant and part beast, living topiaries are moving flora that look like
    decorative lawn ornaments used to adorn gardens and groves, though their
    bestial nature and aloof demeanor prove they are far from mere decorations.
    Some theorize that the living topiaries originally came from the primal land
    of fey, where odd phenomena such as animal-shaped flora are not unheard of.
    Living topiaries wander the lands to fulfill their single purpose: searching
    for more plants to consume, which enables them to grow ever larger. Though
    somewhat delicate, living topiaries can thrive for decades by constantly
    refreshing their bodies with new plant matter. Though living topiaries will
    not willingly go to such places on their own, sometimes one accidentally
    finds itself in an area void of adequate additional shrubbery or water, like
    a vast plain or desert. In such situations, an individual deprived of
    nutrients quickly dries out and shrivels over the course of several days.
    Living topiaries range in height from shrubs only a couple feet off the
    ground to towering hedges. The average specimen is about 4 feet tall and
    weighs 200 pounds.
