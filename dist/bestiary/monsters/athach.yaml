    An athach is a twisted kind of giant, cruel and thuggish. It lives to bring
    misery, ruin, and terror to weaker creatures. An individual may be nearly
    any human color, though its arms are often a darker color or even grayish.
    Its upper fangs are long, extending from its mouth like those of a ferocious
    beast, and it constantly drools a w Athachs thrive upon the fear of their
    victims, preferring to play with their prey for some time before indulging
    their vile and murderous natures. Tales tell of how athachs cut down
    orchards and ruin crops by night, leaving the ruins to be discovered by
    innocent villagers at the dawning of the following day. Further tales tell
    of how athachs desecrate graveyards by exhuming graves and scattering the
    bones of the dead about. The motivation behind these games seems to be sheer
    entertainment- some athachs are unusually creative in their antics,
    displaying ingenuity beyond their normal capacity, as if an athach in the
    throes of desecration and cruelty were prone to some form of divine
    inspiration.

    consisting of a group of siblings and full tribes consisting of parents and
    young.
