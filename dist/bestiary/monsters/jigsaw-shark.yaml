  uses its bite.

Description:
  - >-
    The fact that these sharks dwell in shallow coastal waters places them in
    direct contact with those making a living from the sea. It's not uncommon to
    hear stories of jigsaw sharks leaping from the water and taking out
    dockworkers or fishermen in small boats. Their patchwork coloration of
    browns and blue-grays partly inspires their name.
