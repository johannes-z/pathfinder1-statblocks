Description:
  - >-
    This cruel-eyed night terror is infamous for his love of trickery and
    spontaneous bursts of violence. Spring-Heeled Jack stands about 4 feet tall
    and weighs about 80 pounds. Spring-Heeled Jack keeps up a reputation for
    gruesome killing sprees and tends to flee the crime scene by leaping onto
    buildings. He subsists on raw animal meat, from deer to house rat to beetle.
    His knife is often his only company, and after years of self-inflicted
    solitude Spring-Heeled Jack considers it his best and only friend, and has
    taken to calling it "Love." The finely wrought knife has no special
    properties, but is clearly of otherworldly origin and leaves strange scars
    that are impossible to reproduce. Chaotic and spontaneous, Spring-Heeled
    Jack at times lets his prey live to spread his legend. Though he doesn't
    commit his heinous crimes for notoriety alone, he revels in the reputation
    he has earned and the fear that registers in people's eyes as he pounces
    upon them. It is widely thought that Spring-Heeled Jack was at one point
    human, but lost his humanity in exchange for fiendish powers. The truth is
    that "he" is a fey creature- the best known of a race of fey creatures
    related to quicklings (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 227). These fey are fond of
    traveling to the Material Plane, where their mayhem is more feared and
    appreciated. To add to the mystery, they all use the same name among mortals
    and pretend to be the same individual.
