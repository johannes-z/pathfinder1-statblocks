  - name: Quills (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature attacking a pilo with natural weapons or an unarmed strike
      takes 1d6 points of piercing damage. A creature that grapples a pilo takes
      2d6 points of piercing damage each round it is engaged in a grapple. A
      pilo can also use its quills to damage any opponent it successfully bull
      rushes. Any creature that takes damage from a pilo's quills risks being
      poisoned.
  - name: Roll Up (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a move action, a pilo can tuck itself into a ball. This grants the pilo
      a +4 bonus to its natural armor, but its speed is reduced to 10 feet.
Description:
  - >-
    These carnivorous marsupials, sometimes called tumblespikes, are irritable
    desert-dwelling creatures that even predators leave alone. They are
    aggressive and often attack creatures that are larger than themselves. Pilos
    plow toward their foes and attempt to gore these foes with their spikes,
    bellowing a wheezing series of grunts. When provoked by a creature much
    larger than themselves or a particularly dangerous predator, pilos roll up
    into a spiny ball to deter attacks. Their aggressive nature means that they
    often fight until they die or until their opponent perishes or flees. Though
    pilos are only 3 feet long, their muscular bodies and spikes-which
    constantly grow-contribute to their 80-pound weight. Like many marsupials,
    pilos carry their young in a pouch, which they protect by remaining rolled
    up except when hunting.
