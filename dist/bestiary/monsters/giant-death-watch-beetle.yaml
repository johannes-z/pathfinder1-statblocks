SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Rattle (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a death watch beetle can
      vibrate its carapace to produce a clicking noise that sets up vibrations
      in all creatures within 30 feet. Creatures that fail a DC 17 Fortitude
      save take 3d6 damage. Since the effect stems from the vibrations set up in
      a victim's body and not from the clicking noise itself, silence offers no
      protection against this attack. Likewise, a creature that cannot hear can
      still be affected. A successful save renders the target immune to that
      death watch beetle's death rattle for 24 hours. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Immunity to Death Effects (Ex)
    description: >-
      Death watch beetles are immune to any effect that instantly slays it, such
      as finger of death, slay living, and so on.
Description:
  - >-
    The death watch beetle makes its lair in forests and uses a mixture of
    saliva and earth to stick rubbish (leaves and twigs, for instance) to itself
    in order to attack by surprise.
  - >-
    The death watch beetle begins combat using its death rattle ability. Any
    creatures that survive are bitten by the beetle's mandibles and devoured.
