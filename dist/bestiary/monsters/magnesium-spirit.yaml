SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A magnesium spirit possessing a host deals 1 negative level to it each
      round if the host fails a DC 16 Will save. A magnesium spirit gains 5
      temporary hit points for each negative level bestowed. The save DC is
      Constitutionbased. Negative levels remain for 24 hours, after which time
      the host can attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save to remove a negative level.
  - name: Soul Portal (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 8th), except
      that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the magnesium
      spirit must try move into the target's space; moving into the target's
      space to use this ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The
      target can resist the attack with a successful DC 17 Will save. If the
      save fails, the magnesium spirit vanishes into the target's body. The save
      DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the creature's Ability
      Focus feat. A magnesium spirit that has possessed an opponent's body deals
      a negative level to the host each round (see its energy drain attack
      above). When the host drops below 1st level, both it and the magnesium
      spirit vanish in a flash of white light as the spirit completes the ritual
      needed to return it to its plane of origin. Neither is ever seen again.
      Each round, as a standard action, while the magnesium spirit inhabits its
      body, the host can attempt to eject the creature by making an opposed
      Wisdom check against the magnesium spirit's Wisdom check. If successful,
      the magnesium spirit is ejected and cannot use its soul portal ability
      against that creature again for 1 hour. A magnesium spirit can be damaged
      by holy water even while merged with its host. Holy water deals 2d4 points
      of damage per vial to the creature. If it takes half or more of its
      current hit points in damage from holy water, it is ejected from the
      host's body. The host is stunned for 1d3 rounds.
  - name: Strength Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      A magnesium spirit's incorporeal tail slap deals 1d6 points of Strength
      damage to a living foe. When a foe has taken a total of Strength damage
      equal to one-half its original Strength total, the magnesium spirit can
      use its soul portal attack against that opponent.
  - name: Vulnerability to Holy Water (Ex)
    description: >-
      A magnesium spirit takes 2d4 points of damage from holy water (even while
      merged with a host).
Description:
  - >-
    The magnesium spirit is an evil creature from an unknown plane, though it is
    agreed among sages that its origin definitely does not lie on the Material
    Plane. Believed to have been summoned by wizards or sorcerers to do their
    bidding, the magnesium spirit desires nothing more than to return to its
    home plane. Its incorporeal form prevents this, however, and it requires a
    physical body to complete the spell ritual needed to return it home. A
    magnesium spirit attacks first by attempting to blind its opponents before
    attacking with its incorporeal tail slap. Once it has dealt the requisite
    Strength damage to a foe, it uses its soul portal ability against that
    target. A magnesium spirit's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it
    wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purposes of
    overcoming damage reduction. Credit The Magnesium Spirit originally appeared
