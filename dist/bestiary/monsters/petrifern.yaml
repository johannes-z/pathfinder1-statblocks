SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Petrify (Ex)
    description: >-
      A petrifern can petrify itself as a standard action in order to defend
      itself from predators. When it does so, the petrifern's natural armor
      bonus to AC increases by 5, it gains resistance 10 to cold and fire, and
      it can take 20 on Stealth checks to appear as a sprout or fallen tree
      branch. While petrified, the petrifern can't move or take any actions. A
      petrifern can remain petrified indefinitely, and can cease its
      petrification as a standard action.
  - name: Toxic Secretion (Ex)
    description: >-
      Petriferns secrete a bitter toxin meant to make them distasteful to
      predators. Once per day when a creature touches a petrifern, the plant can
      release its toxin, causing the attacker to become sickened for 1d4 rounds
      if it fails a DC 11 Fortitude saving throw. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The petrifern is an unusual plant creature that resembles a small
    humanoid-shaped fern, and is able to walk about on its roots. It has the
    unusual ability to petrify itself at will, hardening its branches and leaves
    to resemble those of a plant that has been fossilized by natural means. A
    petrifern's chemical makeup not only allows it to petrify itself, but also
    doubles as a toxin that the plant can emit from its foliage when it senses
    danger.
  - >-
    Like all plants, petriferns subsist on sunlight, oxygen, and water. But
    unlike most flora, they can relocate themselves to ensure they always
    receive an abundance of nutrients. Once rooted, a petrifern typically
    petrifies itself until either the nearby soil is depleted of nutrients or
    external factors cause it to seek sustenance elsewhere.
  - Petriferns reach a maximum height of 1 foot and weigh up to 3 pounds.
