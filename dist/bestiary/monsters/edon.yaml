SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Brachiate (Ex)
    description: >-
      An edon can move its climb speed through treetops by leaping from tree to
      tree so long as the trees are no more than 10 feet apart and the
      creature's hands are empty.
  - name: Deaf (Ex)
    description: >-
      An edon is deaf and automatically fails any Perception check based on
      sound. It is immune to any effect that requires the target be able to
      hear.
  - name: Stench Aura (Ex)
    description: >-
      An edon's stench aura affects only humans and halflings, and creatures
      with the scent special ability. All other creatures are immune to its
      effects. An edon can suppress its stench for 1d2 hours by rubbing juniper
      berries on its body. Doing so negates the aura for the duration.
Description:
  - >-
    Edons are forest-dwelling creatures with a great fondness for human and
    halfling flesh. At first glance they appear to be monkeys or small apes with
    powerful arms and sharp claws. They are territorial creatures that dine on
    mosses, leaves, small forest animals, and of course their favorite meal:
    humans and halflings. Edons are active during the day and rest in their
    treetop lairs at night.
  - >-
    An edon stands about 3 feet tall and weighs around 60 pounds. Its fur is
    brown or brownish-gray and its eyes are gray. An edon has a lifespan of
    roughly 50 years.
  - >-
    Edons are completely deaf and do not speak, though they do seem to
    understand the Sylvan tongue. They communicate with others of their kind
    through body motion and sign language.
  - >-
    Edons attack by hiding among the treetops and dropping on unsuspecting prey.
    They are relentless in their attacks, slashing and biting their foe until it
    is dead. Edons realize they are not the strongest or largest creatures, so
    they rely on their sheer numbers to gang up on their foes. Recent encounters
    with packs of edons have led to stories of pack leaders who appear to be
    smarter than the average edon and who employ traps such as tripwires and
    deadfalls to catch or disable their prey.
