    description: >-
      When a belier devil uses its magic jar spell-like ability, it can identify
      and pinpoint life forces accurately, allowing it to select its victims
      with ease. It does not require a receptacle to use magic jar. If it uses
      magic jar on a host while on the Material Plane, its own body becomes
      ethereal for the duration of the possession and the magic jar effect lasts
      until the effect is dispelled, the devil ends the effect, it is forced out
      of its host body, or it or its host body is slain.
Description:
  - >-
    Masterful possessors and foul manipulators, belier devils are among the most
    feared masterminds of Hell. Known as bdellavritras to devilkind, these
    worm-like fiends avoid physical confrontation. Instead, they target inf
    luential individuals for possession, using them to manipulate events by
    proxy. If their schemes are uncovered, the devils retaliate with all the
    power at their host bodies' disposal.
  - >-
    A bdellavritra's voice can emanate from its worm-like maw, from any of its
    human-like mouths, or from all four at once, as it desires. Each mouth has
    its own distinct voice, often pleasing to the human ear. Bdellavritras
    typically reach lengths of 16 feet from worm-mouth to human heads, and weigh
    3,000 pounds.
