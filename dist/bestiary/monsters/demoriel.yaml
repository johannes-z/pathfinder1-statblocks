SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Enrapture (Su)
    description: >-
      Those viewing Demoriel must succeed on a DC 30 Will save or stand
      enthralled for 1 minute. This functions as a hold person spell (caster
      level 20th). An affected creature can attempt a new Will save each round
      to break the effects. The save DC is Charisma-based. A creature that
      successfully saves cannot be affected by Demoriel's enrapture for one day.
      Reaver: Reaver is Demoriel's finely crafted +3 unholy short sword.
Description:
  - >-
    Demoriel was once a powerful angel that made her home in the heavens among
    the other angels. In the Celestial Hierarchy she was a member of the
    Cherubim and served alongside Gabriel, Raphael, and Ophaniel. During the
    Unholy Schism, she sided with Lucifer and aided him by seducing another
    Cherub wherein Lucifer caught the angel unaware and murdered him on the
    spot. When Lucifer was thrown down from the good-aligned planes, Demoriel
    was beside him; cast out for the sin of slaying another angel and spilling
    the blood of an angel in the outer planes. When Lucifer envisioned Hell,
    Demoriel envisioned herself on the throne next to him, serving as Hell's
    Queen. Unfortunately for her, she became one of his many concubines but
    never his bride, for the Great Uprising occurred in Hell and the other
    arch-devils moved to destroy Lucifer and his court. When Lucifer was removed
    from Hell's Throne and took up residence in a pocket plane called Infernus,
    Demoriel followed. Once again, she was denied her place on the throne next
    to Lucifer as he took a devil named Shabiri as his consort. Though Demoriel
    remains ever loyal to Lucifer, she does not trust nor like Shabiri. For now
    she waits until her time comes when she can discredit or destroy Shabiri and
    replace her as Lucifer's consort. Though Lucifer no longer rules Hell,
    Demoriel still serves him unswervingly. She follows no other, though she is
    more than willing to lead other creatures to their demise by feigning
    loyalty to them. She has a particularly vile hatred for celestials (more
    than other devils do it seems) and enjoys corrupting and destroying them.
    Demoriel attacks with her spell-like abilities, attempting to charm the
    strongest opponents she faces. If forced into melee, she attacks with her
    spell-like abilities and short sword or summons other devils to fight for
    her while she maintains a position away from the immediate fight. Copyright
