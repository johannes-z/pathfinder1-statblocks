Description:
  - >-
    A killmoulis is thought to be distantly related to brownies and other small,
    helpful fey, though it bears little physical likeness to its kin.
  - >-
    Standing about 1 foot tall, they do not speak except through a limited form
    of telepathy. The race appears to be sexless. A killmoulis gang always tries
    to take up residence in places of human habitation where foodstuffs are
    prepared or handled, dwelling beneath floorboards or in garrets or behind
    pantry shelves. The killmoulis has the same loyalty to its host family and
    eagerness to perform chores as the brownie, but unlike the brownie they are
    more prone to pointless but harmless mischief.
  - >-
    Killmoulises are inoffensive creatures, lacking any real combat capability.
    They do carry dagger-like needles, however, and use these to stab and pierce
    their opponents. Occasionally, these needles are poisoned (with whatever
    poison is readily available).
