SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a bhuta can suck blood from an adjacent opponent
      that is taking bleed damage. The target takes 1d6 points of Constitution
      damage (Fort DC 23 half). The bhuta heals 5 hit points when it drains
      blood.
  - name: Cold Iron Weakness (Su)
    description: >-
      A cold iron weapon is considered to be magical when used against a bhuta.
      A magic cold iron weapon always functions as a ghost touch weapon when
      used against a bhuta.
Description:
  - >-
    A bhuta is a ghostlike undead creature born of horrible death or murder in a
    natural setting. It is a manifestation of rage at the injustice of a death
    that interrupted important business or unsated desires. Doomed to haunt the
    wilderness within several miles of the site of its demise, a bhuta turns to
    the local fauna as tools for its vengeance.
  - >-
    A bhuta can appear in a variety of animalistic forms by using its veil
    ability, but its natural appearance is that of a bestial humanoid phantom
    that floats a foot above the ground as it moves. While bhutas are
    incorporeal, the touch of their claws creates horrific, bleeding wounds. A
    bhuta's feet point backward. To disguise its nature, a bhuta can appear
    solid, manifesting in long robes that help disguise the fact that it floats
    and has strange feet. By means of its magic jar spell-like ability, a bhuta
    can also possess living animals to use as its minions; an animal possessed
    by a bhuta casts no shadow, and therefore prefers to lurk in heavily
    canopied or thicketed areas, waiting for the right time to strike out and
    attack intruders.
  - >-
    Animals find themselves attracted to bhutas, which use their spell-like
    abilities to manipulate such victims toward evil and deceptive ends. Bhutas
    generally avoid inf luencing animal companions or domesticated animals, for
    changes in behavior among such creatures can easily arouse suspicion and
    reveal a bhuta's presence and inf luence.
  - >-
    A bhuta might have tasks it wishes to complete from its previous existence
    as a living creature, or it might work against those who slew its living
    form. This link to its past life is vague and compulsive rather than clear,
    unlike that of a ghost.
  - >-
    Bhutas who have no specific target for retribution still seek to trouble
    those living in or near their domains, coaxing passersby into accepting them
    as traveling companions and using their inf luence over animals as a
    testament to their benevolence. When invited to join a group, a bhuta can
    journey outside its normal territory. However, a bhuta's hunger for living
    blood usually drives it to attack its companions before it wanders far.
