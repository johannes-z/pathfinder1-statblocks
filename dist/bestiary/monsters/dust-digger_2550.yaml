SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Earth Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dust digger can glide through sand, loose soil, or other loosely packed
      earth as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind
      no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or signs of its presence.
      A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing dust digger
      flings the creature back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 round unless it
      succeeds on a Fortitude save.
  - name: Sinkhole (Ex)
    description: >-
      A buried dust digger can deflate its body as a free action, causing the
      sand above it to slide toward its maw. A creature standing on a space
      occupied by a buried dust digger when it deflates is immediately subjected
      to the dust digger's tentacle attacks.
Description:
  - Dust diggers are nocturnal desert carnivores about 10 feet in diameter.
  - >-
    The creature spends most of its life buried under sand and dirt, waiting for
    potential prey to wander too close or actually wander over the area where a
    dust digger is buried.
  - >-
    A dust digger inflates its body with air, buries itself under a thin lair of
    sand or dirt, and waits for its prey to pass nearby. When a living creature
    walks over a dust digger, the creature deflates its body and folds its arms
    around the victim, attempting to shove the prey into its mouth.
