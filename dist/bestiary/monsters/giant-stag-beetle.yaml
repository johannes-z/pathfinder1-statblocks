  - >-
    Nearly 10 feet long, giant stag beetles become serious dangers when they
    wander into logging camps due to their appetite for decaying wood. Called
    stag beetles because of their large, antler-like mandibles, they use these
    appendages to wrestle competing suitors and quickly put down enemy threats.
    Variant species of these giant beetles exist as well. The two detailed below
    are the ones most commonly encountered. Bombardier Beetle (CR 2): This giant
    stag beetle has only 2 Hit Dice and is Medium sized, but can spray acid once

    Goliath Beetle (CR 8): The immense goliath beetle is a Huge stag beetle with
    12 HD and the trample special ability.
