Description_Visual: >-
  Clad in ragged black robes and tarnished armor, this grim, headless rider is
  surrounded by an aura of menace.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Chilling Blade (Su)
    description: >-
      A dullahan is proficient with all simple and martial slashing weapons.
      When it wields a slashing weapon, the blade inflicts +1d6 cold damage and
      gains the keen weapon property. Death's
  - name: Calling (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a dullahan may place death's calling on
      a target within 60 feet (DC 22 Fortitude negates). If the dullahan knows
      and speaks the target's name, the target takes a -2 penalty on the save.
      If the victim fails the save, he becomes staggered for 1d6 rounds. For the
      next 24 hours (or until the dullahan is slain), all critical hits against
      the victim automatically confirm. Finally, the victim automatically fails
      all Constitution checks to stabilize while dying. This is a mind-affecting
      curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Summon Mount (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a dullahan can summon a war-trained heavy horse with
      the fiendish creature simple template. This horse remains until it is
      slain or the dullahan dismisses it. He can only have one such horse in his
      service at a time.
Description:
  - >-
    Terrifying reapers of souls, dullahans are created by powerful fiends from
    the souls of particularly cruel generals, watch-captains, or other military
    commanders.
  - >-
    Sent back from the pits of Hell to sow terror and harvest new souls,
    dullahans return to the towns or villages they lived in as mortals. While
    their favored victims are evil men and women (or their living descendants)
    whose souls are destined for Hell, the dullahans have no qualms about adding
    innocents to their lists of victims.
  - >-
    Legends tell of powerful dullahans who can summon not just a single fiendish
    mount, but an entire carriage pulled by six powerful ebony horses. Known as
    a "Coach of the Silent," these powerful undead are CR 14 with 20 Hit Dice,
    the advanced creature simple template, and the ability to cast trap the soul
    on those who fail to resist their death's calling. These souls take seats in
    the coach, where they languish forever-or at least until the dullahan
    himself is slain.
