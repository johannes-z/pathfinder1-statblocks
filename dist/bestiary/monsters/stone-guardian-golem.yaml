Description:
  - >-
    Stone guardians are sometimes referred to as lesser stone golems. They are
    in fact very similar to the stone golem, but are instead constructed of mud
    and stone. They are often used as guardians by their creators. When the
    stone guardian is first constructed, the creator often crafts a magical ring
    that offers himself (or anyone to whom he gives the ring) protection from
    that stone guardian. A stone guardian is 6 feet tall and weighs 1,000
    pounds. It resembles a stocky humanoid formed of mud and stone. Where its
    heart should be (were it a living creature) is a fist-sized rounded stone.
    Stone guardians are fierce combatants and attack with their powerful fists.
    Construction A stone guardian's body is constructed from mud mixed with rare
    herbs and powders worth at least 500 gp. A large chunk of stone inserted
    into the chest cavity functions as its "heart." The magical ring that links
    a stone guardian is constructed at the same time and costs 300 gp to create.
    All costs and requirements for both the guardian and ring are included
    below. STONE GUARDIAN CL 10th; Price 13,300 gp Requirements Craft Construct,
    geas/quest, limited wish, see invisibility, shield of faith (for the magical
    ring), transmute rock to mud, creator must be caster level 10th; Skill Craft
