Description_Visual: >-
  This six-armed creature appears to be made of stone. Its lower torso is a
  collection of whirring rings of metal.
Group: Inevitable
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 2
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cunning Reflexes (Ex)
    description: >-
      A lhaksharut uses its Wisdom modifier, rather than its Dexterity modifier,
      to determine how many additional attacks of opportunity it gains with the
      Combat Reflexes feat. For most lhaksharut inevitables, this benefit
      equates to 5 additional attacks of opportunity per round.
  - name: Energy Bolt (Su)
    description: >-
      A lhaksharut can fire bolts of elemental energy from two of its six
      arms-it never wields weapons in these hands. These attacks have a range
      increment of 100 feet and deal 10d6 energy damage of the inevitable's
      choice (acid, cold, electricity, or fire, chosen for each bolt as it is
      thrown). It can throw two bolts of energy as a standard action, and cannot
      attack with these hands when it makes weapon or slam attacks with its
      other limbs.
  - name: Immunity to Energy Spells (Ex)
    description: >-
      A lhaksharut is immune to any spell or spell-like ability with the acid,
      cold, electricity, fire, or sonic descriptor that allows spell resistance.
  - name: Multiweapon Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A lhaksharut never takes penalties on its attack rolls when fighting with
      multiple weapons.
  - name: Perfect Prediction (Su)
    description: A lhaksharut gains an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus.
  - name: Wounding Weapons (Su)
    description: >-
      Any weapon wielded by a lhaksharut gains the wounding weapon quality as
      long as it remains in the creature's grasp.
Description:
  - >-
    A typical lhaksharut is a six-armed construct that appears to be made of a
    mix of metals and stone. Where a human would have legs, it instead possesses
    a complex orb of spinning rings similar in shape to an orrery-it is this
    whirling machine that grants the lhaksharut the ability to fly. Though a
    lhaksharut has huge, metal wings, they serve as little more than stabilizers
    when it's in flight. Four of the construct's arms end in functional hands
    that it normally uses to carry a mix of weapons. The lhaksharut's lower two
    arms hold large, flaming metal spheres in their hands-it uses these spheres
    to generate elemental bolts of energy that it can hurl great distances to
    damage foes.
  - >-
    Lhaksharuts are tasked with maintaining the separation between different
    planes of reality, especially the elemental planes. They do not concern
    themselves with petty trespasses by visitors from one plane to another, nor
    even the occasional creation of a pocket plane or hijacking of a chunk of
    one reality to serve as a base within another. What does trouble a
    lhaksharut is anything that represents a permanent link between planes, or
    an effort by the denizens of one plane to invade and conquer another. They
    often find themselves in conf lict with the machinations of powerful
    outsiders who seek to create beachheads on other planes to serve as
    launching pads for massive incursions.
