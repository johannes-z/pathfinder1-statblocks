SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Stampede (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stampede occurs if three or more storm aurochs make a trample attack
      while remaining adjacent to each other. While stampeding, storm aurochs
      can trample foes of their size or smaller, and the trample's save DC
      increases by 2.
  - name: Storming Charge (Su)
    description: >-
      A storm aurochs steps grow thunderous as it charges toward its enemies. A
      storm aurochs' powerful charge deals an additional 3d6 points of
      electricity damage, and its trample deals an additional 3d6 points of
      sonic damage, which are already included in the above statistics. If the
      storm aurochs is outdoors and in a stormy area-one featuring a rain
      shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado
      (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental of at least
      Large size)-its powerful charge and trample instead deal 3d10 points of
      electricity or sonic damage respectively, rather than 3d6 points of
      damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Stampeding across the sky in booming herds, storm aurochs resemble nothing
    so much as vast and powerful thunderstorms bearing down across Golarion.
    Storm and cloud giants value these magnificent beasts not only for their
    meat and hides, but also as symbols of mystic power and divine strength.
    Though ostensibly domesticated centuries ago by storm giants, storm aurochs
    remain among the most fearsome and dangerous of the creatures that pass
    through Golarion's skies.
  - >-
    A storm aurochs is roughly twice the size of a normal aurochs, growing up to
    20 feet long and standing 15 feet tall at the shoulder. Storm aurochs weigh
    on average anywhere from 5 to 7 tons, with females being noticeably smaller
    and slimmer than males. Both males and females bear prodigious horns atop
    their heads that crackle with electrical energy, though the female's horns
    are slightly smaller.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Storm aurochs behave much as their more mundane cousins do. They are
    gregarious, herbivorous creatures that travel in herds of up to several
    dozen extended family members. These untamed herds are nomadic, and their
    migratory patterns mirror Golarion's natural weather patterns. Herds are
    fiercely territorial, with weather fronts forming the natural boundary
    between two herds' territories. Territorial disputes are common, though
    rarely lethal, and are often accompanied by terrific natural and magical
    storms.
  - >-
    In addition to more traditional fodder, storm aurochs also graze on clouds.
    It is unclear whether or not this provides them any real nourishment, and it
    may be that they do so purely out of enjoyment. This can be a blessing and a
    curse for areas frequented by herds of storm aurochs; these areas soon
    become cloudless and sunny. Overgrazing can prevent much needed rain from
    reaching the ground, eventually leading to periods of drought and famine for
    those living nearby. For this reason, farmers often see herds of storm
    aurochs as pests. Aside from the dangers inherent in facing a storm aurochs,
    slaying one often comes with the added danger of drawing the ire of its
    storm giant owner, and so most communities prefer to relocate an aurochs
    herd as gently as possible, or perhaps even negotiate with the owner, rather
    than trying to slay the aurochs.
  - >-
    Domesticated storm aurochs tolerate the presence and activities of storm or
    cloud giants with little hostility. This doesn't always hold for other
    races, and how a storm aurochs reacts to the presence of an adventuring
    party often depends on the temperament of the individual aurochs and the
    circumstances of the meeting. Storm aurochs are canny enough to recognize
    weapons, however, and usually respond to the approach of armed individuals
    of any species with extreme aggression.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Storm aurochs are most commonly found in the possession of storm giants,
    where the animals spend their days grazing on the giants' expansive coastal
    estates. Storm giants keep aurochs for their meat, their hides, and their
    ability to inf luence the weather. The giants rarely use the creatures as
    beasts of burden, as unlike normal domesticated cattle or oxen, storm
    aurochs do not tolerate being placed in a yoke. A storm giant can use this
    fact to test the strength or patience of members of lesser races who come
    seeking the giant's aid. The giant first requires the petitioner to harness
    the giant's bull and plow his field. If the appellant accomplishes this
    task, either through cunning or brute strength, the giant is willing to hear
    her request. Those who give up the task or harm the aurochs in the effort,
    are banished from the giant's presence or slain outright.
  - >-
    Cloud giants also keep herds of storm aurochs, though less commonly than
    storm giants. Cloud giants particularly favor the taste of storm aurochs
    meat, which they serve at feasts and gatherings of great importance, or to
    honor particularly noteworthy guests. Cloud giants also make use of storm
    aurochs in one of their more idiosyncratic pastimes; bull-leaping. Young
    cloud giants, newly come of age, take turns leaping over a charging storm
    aurochs, sometimes even boosting themselves off the auroch's horns to gain
    extra height and momentum. Leapers perform feats of acrobatics as they pass
    over the bull, each seeking to impress her fellows with her daring and
    prowess. Bull-leaping has fallen out of favor among younger cloud giants,
    who increasingly turn their attentions toward more philosophical pursuits,
    but it's still commonly practiced by more traditional, rural cloud giant
    families.
  - >-
    Storm aurochs hold a deep spiritual significance for both storm and cloud
    giants. Cloud giants believe that the aurochs are gifts from Ioz'om, their
    version of Gozreh in his sky-father aspect, as a reward for their dutiful
    worship and piety. Storm giants also connect storm aurochs to Gozreh,
    through their sky-father incarnation, Hyjarth. Though most believe much as
    the cloud giants do, a few take their worship of the storm aurochs further.
    They claim that Hyjarth sacrificed the first storm aurochs to create the
    world itself, building the land from its bones and filling the seas with its
    blood. These storm giants gather in mystery cults across Golarion to reenact
    this ritual sacrifice, slaying a captive storm aurochs in order to honor
    Hyjarth and ensure that their lands and seas remain fruitful.
  - Skyshaping Stampede
  - >-
    When storm aurochs gather in one place, they can have a profound impact on
    the weather. Such a gathering is known as a skyshaping stampede.
  - >-
    Whenever three storm aurochs are within 10 feet of one another, all three of
    them can work together to use any of the following spell-like abilities:
    control weather, control winds (DC 16), fog cloud, siroccoAPG (DC 17), or
    sleet storm.
  - >-
    To take part in a skyshaping stampede, all three storm aurochs must take a
    full-round action to move through the area to be affected, usually by
    circling the spell's point of origin or tracing the path they desire winds
    to take. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. These
    spell-like abilities function at CL 12th (or at a caster level equal to the
    Hit Dice of the most powerful aurochs involved). The save DCs are
    Charisma-based, and function as if the herd has a Charisma score of 12,
    unless one of the aurochs has a higher Charisma score, in which case the
    spell-like ability DCs are adjusted by that aurochs's Charisma modifier.
