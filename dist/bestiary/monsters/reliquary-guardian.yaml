SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alignment Subtype (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because a reliquary is infused with a spark from their creator's deity,
      the creature gains the appropriate subtype(s) based on its alignment.
      Thus, a lawful good reliquary guardian has both the Good and Lawful
      subtypes. In addition, a reliquary guardian's weapons and natural attacks
      can overcome this type of damage reduction as if its weapons and natural
      attacks had an alignment (or alignments) that match the reliquary
      guardian's subtype(s). Further, its damage reduction is based on its
      alignment subtype(s). Thus a chaotic evil reliquary guardian has damage
      reduction 10/lawful and good while a lawful good reliquary guardian has
      damage reduction 10/chaotic and evil.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A reliquary guardian is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that
      allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against a reliquary guardian, as noted below. A dispel
      (chaos/evil/good/law) spell targeted against an appropriately aligned
      reliquary guardian deals 4d6 points of damage to it. A blasphemy spell
      heals an evil-aligned reliquary guardian of all its lost hit points.
      Likewise, a dictum spell heals a lawaligned reliquary guardian; a holy
      word spell heals a goodaligned reliquary guardian; and a word of chaos
      spell heals a chaos-aligned reliquary guardian.
  - name: Magic Weapon (Ex)
    description: >-
      A reliquary guardian carries a +1 greatsword with an alignment special
      quality that matches its alignment on the good-evil axis or the law-chaos
      axis. Thus, a chaotic evil reliquary guardian might carry a +1 anarchic
      greatsword or a +1 unholy greatsword while a lawful good reliquary
      guardian would carry either a +1 axiomatic greatsword or a +1 holy
      greatsword.
  - name: Pronouncement (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a reliquary guardian can make a pronouncement that affects
      all creatures within 60 feet that hear it. This pronouncement otherwise
      functions as a blasphemy, dictum, holy word, or word of chaos spell. Note:
      a reliquary guardian only has one type of pronouncement. It is set during
      the construction process based on the creator's alignment and the
      reliquary guardian's alignment and cannot be changed. The Will save, where
      applicable, has a DC of 21. The save DC is Wisdom-based. Blasphemy: CE,
      LE, or NE reliquary guardians. Dictum: LG, LE, or LN reliquary guardians.
      Holy Word: CG, LG, or NG reliquary guardians. Word of Chaos: CE, CG, or CN
      reliquary guardians. Spell-Like
  - name: Abilities (Sp)
    description: >-
      A reliquary guardian has a total of five spell-like abilities (one each of
      spell levels 1st thru 5th), each usable once per day. Its spell-like
      abilities are based on its alignment and are drawn from one of the
      following cleric domains: Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law. A reliquary guardian
      whose alignment is CE, CG, LG, or LE must be assigned a single domain (one
      that matches one of its alignment axes) during construction. This domain
      can never be changed. Regardless of the reliquary guardian's alignment,
      its spell-like abilities function at caster level 16th. The save DCs are
      Wisdom-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Reliquary guardians are constructs found guarding the bones of saints or
    protecting religious icons and relics against would be thieves or
    plunderers. They stand unmoving unless activated by intrusion into their
    protected sanctuary by unbelievers. At this time they activate and reap
    great ruin upon foes with divine magic and deadly blows from their weapon or
    fists.
  - >-
    Reliquary guardians are aligned to the faith of their creator. All weapons
    and spells used are thus aligned accordingly whether on the law-chaos axis,
    the good-evil axis, or both. There are no true neutralaligned reliquary
    guardians known to exist.
  - >-
    Imbued with a spark of intellect by the deity involved in their creation,
    reliquary guardians may travel great distances and even seek to cross into
    other planes of existence in order to retrieve the icons placed in their
    protection. They may possibly enlist the aid of heroes in their quest to
    return certain relics to their rightful sanctuary.
  - >-
    A reliquary guardian stands 12 feet tall and weighs 5,000 pounds. It speaks
    Common, and at least one other language (Abyssal or Infernal if evil-aligned
    or Celestial if good-aligned).
  - >-
    A reliquary guardian begins combat by making a pronouncement against its
    foes. Those that survive or manage to escape it relatively unharmed are
    assaulted by a barrage of spell-like abilities and repeated blows by the
    reliquary guardian's mighty greatsword.
  - >-
    Construction Reliquary guardians are created for a specific purpose, be it
    the guarding of a saint's tomb or protection of a detailed item or place of
    religious significance to its creator and the creator's deity. A reliquary
    guardian is crafted from 3,000 pounds of purest marble which is sprinkled
    with various exotic powders. The total cost is at least 5,000 gp for its
    body. The color of the marble it is crafted from denotes the predominant
    alignment of the deity and creator: white marble (good-aligned), green
    marble (chaos-aligned), red marble (law-aligned), black marble
    (evil-aligned).
