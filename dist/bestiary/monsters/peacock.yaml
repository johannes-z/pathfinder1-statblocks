      A peacock flies in short bursts, and can't use its fly speed to hover.
      When it flies, a peacock must end its move action by landing or perching
      on a solid surface.
Description:
  - >-
    Peacocks are the male variety of a family of pheasants collectively called
    peafowls. Their female counterparts, peahens, don't possess the brightly
    colored iridescent plumage typically associated with peacocks, and instead
    sport gray or brown feathers. Some cultures also breed peafowls with white
    plumage that may or may not have coloration on the rest of their bodies.
  - >-
    A peacock displays its brightly colored feathers to impress and court
    peahens as well as to scare off potential predators. The colorful "eye"
    patterns in the feathers also make them popular symbols and decorations
    among fortune-tellers and royalty.
  - >-
    While the male variety is more commonly recognized, all peafowl have
    identical statistics. A peacock is 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 10
    pounds.
