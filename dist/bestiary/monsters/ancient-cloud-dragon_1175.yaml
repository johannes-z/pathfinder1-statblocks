SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cloud Form (Su)
    description: >-
      An adult or older cloud dragon can change itself into a cloudy vapor as a

  - name: Cloud Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      A great wyrm cloud dragon's breath weapon creates a cloud that persists in
      its cone shape for 1d4 rounds. Treat this cloud as a fog cloud that deals
      electricity damage equal to half the dragon's breath weapon damage to any

      damage-DC equals the dragon's breath weapon save DC).

      A cloud dragon can see through fog, clouds, and similar obscuring effects
      with perfect clarity. Spell-Like

  - name: Thundering Bite (Su)
    description: >-
      An ancient or older cloud dragon's bite makes a thundering crash whenever
      it attacks, dealing an additional 2d6 points of sonic damage. A great
      wyrm's thundering bite deals an additional 4d6 sonic damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Cloud dragons stay out of the complicated political schemes and obsessions
    of other dragons (especially the chromatic dragons), preferring to live
    their lives freely and as the whim to travel strikes them. Exploration and
    viewing new lands from far above are the cloud dragon's greatest joy,
    rivaled only by speaking with new creatures and gaining exotic treasures
    from them. They keep lairs on high mountain peaks, but are often away on
    journeys of discovery, returning home only when they've claimed a new
    treasure that needs to be placed in safekeeping back home.
