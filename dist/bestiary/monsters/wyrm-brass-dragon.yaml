SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Desert Wind (Su)
    description: >-
      A juvenile or older brass dragon can call up the desert wind to serve him.
      This functions as gust of wind, but any creature in its path must make a
      Fortitude save (DC 29) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds by the sand.
  - name: Fire Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      An old or older brass dragon is surrounded by an aura of intense heat. All
      creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at
      the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient brass dragon's aura extends
      to 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. A brass dragon can
      suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action.
  - name: Move Sand (Su)
    description: >-
      A young or older brass dragon can move sand to excavate ruins or hide
      treasures. This functions as move earth, but it only affects sand. The
      dragon uses his HD in place of his caster level for this effect. This is
      equivalent to a 5th-level spell.
  - name: Sandstorm (Su)
    description: >-
      An ancient or older brass dragon can create a powerful sandstorm once per
      day as a full-round action. This storm has a radius of 1 mile and lasts
      for 1 minute per age category of the dragon. This functions as a sandstorm
      (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 431), except that it is also accompanied by
      windstorm-level winds.
  - name: Sleep Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Instead of a line of fire, a brass dragon can breathe a 50 ft. cone of
      sleep gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Will save or fall
      asleep for 1d6+11 rounds.
Description:
  - >-
    Consummate conversationalists, brass dragons prefer to talk instead of
    fight. Brass dragons lair near humanoid settlements, where they can hear the
    most recent news and gossip.
