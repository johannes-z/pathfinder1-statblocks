      below. • Chaotic Neutral: rage • Lawful Neutral: suggestion (DC 12) •
      Neutral: deep slumber (DC 12) • Neutral Evil: inflict serious wounds (DC
      12) • Neutral Good: heroism Susceptible to Mind-Affecting
  - name: Effects (Ex)
    description: >-
      The weakened conviction of a soulbound doll's soul makes it susceptible to
      mind-affecting effects, despite the fact that it is a construct.
  - name: Soul Focus (Su)
    description: >-
      The soul bound to the doll lives within a focus integrated into the doll
      or its apparel, typically one of the doll's eyes or a gem embedded into
      its neck or chest. As long as this soul focus remains intact, it can be
      used to animate another doll, using the same cost as creating a new
      construct. Once bound into the soul focus, the soul continues to learn,
      and so if later it is put into a new doll body, the soul retains its
      personality and memories from its previous body or bodies. A soul focus
      has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break DC of 20.
Description:
  - >-
    These small, sentient dolls contain a fragment of another creature's soul.
    The binding process strips most of the individuality from the soul, making a
    new soulbound doll an almost blank slate. Despite this process, fragments of
    the original creature's personality remain.
  - >-
    Soulbound dolls can serve as companions, surrogate children, servants,
    guards, and sentries, as desired by their creators. Creators of soulbound
    dolls typically take care to take soul fragments from people whose
    personality traits the crafters wish to see in their dolls.
  - Construction
  - >-
    A soulbound doll's body is made from wood, stone, or porcelain, with one
    exquisite item worth at least 300 gp to serve as the soul focus. Creation
    requires a soul fragment from a deceased creature that must die at some
    point during the creation of the doll- as a result, most soulbound dolls are
    created by evil spellcasters. Other spellcasters can create soulbound dolls,
    but if the donor soul is unwilling, they may have alignment repercussions.
    An unwilling soul can resist the procedure with a DC 20 Will save. Stripping
    a soul fragment from the dead does not prevent the rest of the soul from
    continuing on to the afterlife, nor does it prevent the body from later
    being resurrected or raised from the dead.
