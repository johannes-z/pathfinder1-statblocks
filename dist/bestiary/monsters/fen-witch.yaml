SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Speak (Su)
    description: >-
      A fen witch who knows an individual's true name can speak that name as a
      swift action. If the individual hears the fen witch speak its name, that
      creature must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or perish. If the save
      succeeds, that creature cannot be affected again by the same fen witch's
      death speak for 24 hours. Note that the fen witch does not need to speak a
      language the creature understands in order to affect it; she only needs to
      speak its true name. Other fen witches or creatures who hear the target's
      true name cannot use this ability; it only functions for the fen witch
      after she has used her mind probe ability on the target. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. Whether the fen witch's Death Speak ability is successful
      or not, the target's name remains fresh in her mind for 24 hours. After
      that, she must use her mind probe ability again to retrieve a creature's
      true name.
  - name: Hag (Ex)
    description: A fen witch counts as a hag for the purpose of joining a hag's coven.
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    description: >-
      The sight of a fen witch is so revolting that anyone within 60 feet (other
      than another fen witch or hag) who sets eyes upon one must succeed on a DC
      15 Fortitude save or instantly be weakened, taking 1d8 points of Strength
      damage. Creatures that are affected by this power or that successfully
      save against it cannot be affected again by the same fen witch's horrific
      appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Mind Probe (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a fen witch can peer into the mind of a living
      creature within 60 feet in an attempt to extract the creature's true name.
      The target can resist the mental trespassing by succeeding on a DC 15 Will
      save. If the save fails, the fen witch has learned the creature's true
      name and can use her death speak ability. Creatures with an Intelligence
      score of 2 or less and creatures with no Intelligence score are immune to
      this ability. Psionic creatures can use defense modes or other psionic
      abilities to counter this probe. A creature that successfully saves cannot
      be affected again by the same fen witch's mind probe for one day. The save
      DC is Wisdom-based.
  - name: Swamp Stride (Ex)
    description: >-
      A fen witch can move through any sort of natural difficult terrain at its
      normal speed while within a swamp. Magically altered terrain affects a fen
      witch normally.
Description:
  - >-
    The fen witch is a creature of legend, found only in the most remote of
    places. It is a solitary creature and disdains all that invade its realm. A
    fen witch is thoroughly evil and malign, speaking to those she encounters
    only to learn the true name of one of the trespassers in her realm so she
    may utilize her power to slay that individual. Fen witches who take class
    levels usually advance as clerics, druids, sorcerers, or witches.
  - >-
    Fen witches rarely engage in combat, relying on their death speak ability to
    slay a creature almost instantaneously (and hopefully drive off the victim's
    comrades by instilling fear in any remaining creatures).
  - >-
    Failing this, the fen witch prefers direct combat to subterfuge and attacks
    relentlessly.
