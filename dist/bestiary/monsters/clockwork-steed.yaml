      As a standard action, the clockwork steed can make two hoof attacks with
      its rear hooves; if both hit, it can perform an awesome blow combat
      maneuver as the Awesome Blow feat. A clockwork steed gains a +4 racial
      bonus on this combat maneuver check.
Description:
  - >-
    These tireless constructs were designed by engineers as a replacement for
    normal horses. They can gallop ceaselessly for hours or even days if
    required. In addition to their endurance, clockwork steeds pack a powerful
    physical punch-blows from their hooves can send smaller creatures flying.
    Though many riders enjoy the unquestioning way that clockwork steeds accept
    commands from their riders, others find these steeds' lack of personality
    frustrating. Unlike normal horses, a clockwork steed lacks the ability to
    create a bond with its rider.
  - CLOCKWORK CHARGER
  - >-
    Clockwork chargers are constructed to wreak greater mechanized terror on the
    battlefield. A clockwork charger has the advanced simple template and is
    specially equipped for enhancing mounted charges or making such charges even
    without a rider by way of its pivoted lance. A clockwork charger has a
    pivoted latch large enough to support a lance and allows even those who are
    not proficient with a lance to use it as if they were. Furthermore, the
    clockwork charger is proficient with any lance equipped in the pivot and
    gains the undersized weapon special ability.
  - Construction
  - >-
    The creator of a clockwork steed must start with crafted clockwork pieces
    worth 3,000 gp. When building a clockwork charger, the pivot can be built
    for any size lance, typically Medium.
