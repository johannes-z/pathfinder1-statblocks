SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Control Vermin (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tyrant jelly's spell-like abilities work on mindless vermin that have
      exoskeletons (bees, centipedes, crabs, flies, wasps, and so on), but not
      soft-bodied creatures such as leeches, slugs, or worms.
  - name: Create Spawn (Ex)
    description: >-
      Slashing weapons, piercing weapons, and electricity attacks deal no damage
      to a tyrant jelly. Instead, part of the creature splits off into an ochre
      jelly. This new jelly has 30 hit points and fast healing 5; the tyrant
      jelly loses 30 hit points when it splits off. The new jelly is under the
      control of the tyrant jelly. A tyrant jelly with 30 hit points or fewer
      can't split again, and dies if reduced to 0 hit points. A tyrant jelly can
      reabsorb an adjacent spawn as a full-round action, destroying the spawn
      and adding the spawn's current hit points to its own.

      Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Vermin Empathy (Su)
    description: >-
      A tyrant jelly can improve the attitude of vermin as a druid can with
      animals. Vermin have a starting attitude of unfriendly.
Description:
  - >-
    When an ochre jelly infiltrates a colony of giant bees or wasps and consumes
    a queen egg, a strange reaction sometimes occurs between the jelly's fluids
    and the egg, resulting in a tyrant jelly-an intelligent ooze using an
    immature insect as a primitive brain. The tyrant jelly has unusual powers
    over vermin, and quickly takes control of the colony, sending its drones to
    gather food to sate its unnatural hunger. Other vermin are attracted to the
    scent of these creatures, and then fall under the tyrant's sway-a colony
    often has giant bees, centipedes, spiders, and wasps working together. A
    tyrant jelly's primary interests are food and survival. Magic or telepathy
    might allow a creature to bargain with it, exchanging food for its
    cooperation. Some insect cults hunt tyrant jellies, believing their strange
    substance has properties similar to a giant bee's royal jelly (Pathfinder
    RPG Bestiary 2 43) or can increase the intelligence of other vermin.
