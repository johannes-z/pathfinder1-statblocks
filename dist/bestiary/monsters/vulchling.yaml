Description:
  - Vulchlings are a malevolent race of avian creatures akin to the vulture.
  - >-
    Their faces, though bird-like, seem to have an almost human quality to them.
    Vulchlings are not only scavengers but also predators, feeding on living
    prey as well as carrion. Vulchlings can occasionally be found in the company
    of harpies or vrocks, but most of their time is spent in their lairs-usually
    large nests found deep within the earth.
  - >-
    Vulchlings prefer to attack from secret or ambush by lying in wait for their
    prey and then swooping in to attack with their razor-sharp talons and beak.
    Slain opponents are carried back to the vulchlings' lair and fed to the
    young vulchlings.
