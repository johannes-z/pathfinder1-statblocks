    description: >-
      When a dwiergeth swallows a creature whole (being able to swallow Small
      creatures or smaller), the act of swallowing shunts the victim through
      extradimensional orifices within the creature's body and into a seemingly
      endless maze of tooth-lined entrails that exist outside of reality,
      similar to the labyrinth created by a maze spell but horribly organic and
      hungry. If a swallowed creature successfully cuts its way out of a
      dwiergeth, it must attempt a DC 21 Fortitude save as it crawls out of the
      hole. If the victim is successful, it escapes the creature, but on a
      failure, the victim merely crawls from one extradimensional intestine to
      another and must endure another round of being swallowed whole. A
      dwiergeth can continue to use swallow whole even after a creature cuts its
      way out. A creature casting any teleport-based spell or spell-like ability
      while within 5 feet of a dwiergeth must make a successful DC 21 Will save
      or the teleportation effect instead sends the target into the dwiergeth's
      forever gullet. When a dwiergeth is under the effects of dimensional
      anchor or in an area that prohibits extradimensional travel, it loses the
      abilities of its forever gullet, but its swallow whole ability functions
      normally. The save DC is Charisma-based, and it has a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Dwiergeths hunt the Worldwound's deadly rift valleys, feasting on demon
    flesh as readily as any other meat, digesting prey in a gnawing process of
    transdimensional rumination. Sure-footed dwiergeths leap and sprint along
    vertical surfaces with disturbing ease, and often cling to a cliffside for
    hours or even days, waiting for prey to approach from either above or below.
    They have a supernatural mastery over the wind as well, and make use of
    their spell-like abilities to cause climbers to fall from cliffs or flying
    creatures to be dashed against rocky walls-it's easier to eat bleeding,
    broken meat, after all.

    A dwiergeth's anatomy is quite unusual. Trembling bristles protruding from
    the creature's flesh act as eyes, allowing it to see in all directions at
    once, but the monster's strangest feature lies within. Although dissection
    of a slain dwiergeth reveals a single coiling digestive tract filled with
    sharp teeth winding from one of its mouths through its bulbous body to the
    other mouth, the entrails of a living dwiergeth actually extend into other
    strange dimensions generated by the monster's Abyssal heritage.
