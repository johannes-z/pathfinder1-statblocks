      Water orms are rarely discovered except by their own choice. As a
      full-round action while in water, a water orm can move up to its run speed
      (200 ft.) without leaving any trace of its passage (identical in effect to
      pass without trace). An elusive water orm gains a +40 circumstance bonus
      to its Stealth check. In addition, when not in combat, a water orm is
      considered to be under the effects of a nondetection spell. These effects
      function at caster level 20th and cannot be dispelled.

    description: >-
      As a full-round action once per day, a water orm can dissolve into water,
      appearing only as a long, dark, serpentine stretch of water that looks
      similar to the passage of a school of fish when viewed from above the
      water. While in this form, the water orm swims at a speed of 600 feet per
      round (60 mph) and gains a +40 bonus on all Swim checks. It cannot attack
      or take any action other than swimming in this form, and can remain in
      this form for up to 8 hours at a time. A water orm can revert to its solid
      form from this state as a free action. Water orms are unable to pass into
      or through salt water when using this ability.
Description:
  - >-
    Just as sailors tell stories of sea serpents, so do denizens on the shores
    of remote lakes whisper of strange, secretive monsters lurking in the depths
    of these large bodies of water. Like sea serpents, proof of their existence
    is as elusive as the beasts themselves. Known as water orms and believed by
    some to be a strange link between linnorms and sea serpents, most locals
    refer to any such local monster (real or imagined) by a pet name or the name
    of the lake it calls home. Water orms are craftier than sea serpents, and
    generally inclined toward curiosity rather than violence.
  - >-
    Nevertheless, a water orm does not hesitate to attack any creature it views
    as a threat to itself or its lake.
  - >-
    Water orms are extremely long-lived. Several different variants have been
    reported. With sightings rare and unverifiable, it is unclear whether these
    are variations within a single species, or several unrelated creatures.
  - >-
    Some are described as long-necked aquatic reptiles, some as fresh-water sea
    serpents, others as bizarrely elongated seals or whales, and still others as
    impossibly large sea horses. Most are 40 to 45 feet in length, and weigh
    2,000 to 3,000 pounds.
