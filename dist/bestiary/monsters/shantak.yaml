SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Share Defenses (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a shantak can extend its no breath ability and cold
      immunity to a single creature touching it. It can withdraw this protection
      as a free action.
  - name: Slippery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shantak's scales seep slippery slime. This grants the creature a +8
      bonus on all Escape Artist checks and to its CMD against grapples, and
      imparts a -5 penalty on all Ride checks made by creatures attempting to
      ride a shantak.
  - name: Starflight (Su)
    description: >-
      A shantak can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through space
      at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a
      single solar system should take 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond should
      take 3d20 days (or more, at the GM's discretion)- provided the shantak
      knows the way to its destination.
Description:
  - >-
    Shantaks speak in a shrill voice that sounds like glass grinding against
    stone. They are intelligent creatures and cannot be trained as mounts-a
    would-be shantak rider must use diplomacy or magic to secure a shantak's
    cooperation as a mount, and even then, shantaks have a tendency to
    deliberately strand riders in dangerous areas.
  - >-
    Many shantaks have a strange and irrational fear of certain creatures, such
    as the faceless nightgaunts said to dwell in certain remote mountains, or
    specific types of harpies or gargoyles in more civilized regions. A shantak
    avoids confrontations with these types of creatures if possible.
  - >-
    A shantak's ability to travel the gulfs of space ensures that these scaly,
    bird-like creatures can be found on numerous worlds. Yet despite this unique
    ability, shantaks are generally quite reluctant to seek out new worlds
    unless faced with no other option, for a shantak knows well that an attempt
    to fly to an unknown world could easily result in being lost forever in the
    gulfs of space.
