    The froghemoth is a weird aberration that swells in marshes and swamps. Its
    tongue is 10 feet long and it uses it to capture its prey. The froghemoth is
    a carnivore and feeds on various swamp-dwellers.
  - The froghemoth attacks using its tentacles and tongue to grab opponents.
  - Grabbed opponents are shoved into the froghemoth's mouth.
