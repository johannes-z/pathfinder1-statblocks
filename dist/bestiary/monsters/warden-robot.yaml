SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Combined Arms (Ex)
    description: >-
      As part of a full-attack action, a warden robot can attack with both melee
      and ranged integrated weapons.
  - name: Dazzler (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a warden robot can target a single creature with a
      beam of strobing light that functions as a gaze attack with a range of 60
      feet. A creature subject to this attack must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude
      save or be blinded for 2d4 rounds. Creatures that successfully save are
      dazzled for 1d4 rounds. Creatures with light blindness or light
      sensitivity take a -4 penalty on the saving throw. This is a light effect,
      and the save DC is Intelligence-based.
  - name: Infrasonic Field (Ex)
    description: >-
      Warden robots constantly emit powerful sound waves at a frequency below
      normal hearing. These vibrations can debilitate living beings within 30
      feet. Such creatures must succeed at DC 17 Fortitude save or fall prone
      and be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. A warden robot can suppress or resume
      this ability as a free action. This is a sonic effect, and the save DC is
      Intelligence-based.
  - name: Integrated Sonic Disruptor (Ex)
    description: >-
      A warden robot's arms contain built-in ranged weapons that emit focused
      sound waves in 100-foot rays that deal 2d8 points of sonic damage.
  - name: Reactive Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      A warden robot is covered in a special shell that reacts explosively to
      powerful strikes. Due to this covering, a warden robot gains light
      fortification (25% chance to negate critical hits and sneak attacks). When
      the armor negates a critical hit from a melee weapon, the attacker takes
      an amount of fire damage equal to half of the damage dealt to the robot.
      Attackers using reach or ranged weapons avoid this damage.

Description:
  - >-
    Wardens are dangerous guardian robots often found protecting sealed vaults
    or patrolling ancient, buried corridors. They carry out their orders with
    ruthlessness and zeal, usually offering no warning before attacking a
    perceived threat. The Technic League has had moderate success in controlling
    a few of these robots, and occasionally assigns them as guards for valuable
    treasures or important prisoners, roles for which they're well suited.
  - >-
    Although the mere sight of these massive machines is imposing enough to ward
    off most intruders, those who are undeterred by a warden's appearance soon
    find the robot to be quite capable of destroying those who enter its
    territory without proper clearance. Unlike golems or similarly mindless
    constructs, wardens possess an intelligence that allows them to employ
    tactics, either on their own or as part of a unit. When acting in groups,
    the robots are smart enough to suppress and reactivate their nausea-inducing
    sound waves in concert, maximizing the length of time their opponents are
    incapacitated.
  - >-
    Most wardens are in Silver Mount, but some can be found in many other parts
    of Numeria. Nearly all share the same characteristics: a squat upper body
    with a domed shape and two arms ending in six surprisingly dexterous
    "fingers" surrounding emitters that serve as its primary ranged weapons. Two
    stout, multi-jointed legs provide the construct with great mobility, even on
    hilly or rough terrain.

    Wardens were obviously designed and programmed to guard objects, people, or
    locations. Although they have no life cycle to speak of, these robots do
    seem to possess certain behavioral characteristics that make them
    fascinating to Numerian scholars.
  - >-
    The warden's reactive armor is a matter of particular interest to the
    Technic League. Although the robots are still vulnerable to critical hits,
    their armor reduces the risk posed by this weakness. A few of the League's
    most talented members have devoted themselves to determining how the
    reactive armor works and how to replicate it. The secret appears to be in
    the material that comprises the robot's exoskeleton-which behaves like metal
    in all respects until struck by a powerful force, when it responds with a
    violent, fiery explosion. Amazingly, the explosive material restores itself
    over time, as long as the robot continues to function.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Wardens, like many robots found in Numeria, follow strict internal
    programming that guides their actions. Their special programming, however,
    is somewhat more flexible than that of other robots. Wardens learn and
    adapt, especially when it comes to facing specialized types of foes.
  - >-
    As constructs built by ancient masters whose goals and intentions are almost
    unknowable, wardens have no
  - >-
    society in the traditional sense of the word. They exist only to follow
    their programming to the best of their ability. Still, their ability to
    adapt and work together in small groups makes them formidable opponents for
    those who would seek treasures in the ancient caches scattered throughout
    Numeria.
  - >-
    Although capable of speech, wardens communicate with each other by some
    other means. They coordinate efforts silently, and skillfully arrange
    patrols to maximize coverage of their assigned areas. As long as a warden is
    guarding something (whether by itself or as part of a group of wardens), it
    nearly always follows the orders of the creature that owns the object or
    location. Wardens demonstrate a clear understanding of their duties, and can
    apply their alien intelligence toward problem solving when the situation
    requires it. This makes them effective jailers as well, since they can use
    their incapacitating sound field against prisoners who attempt to escape-as
    well as on those who might try to break the prisoners out.

    Wardensof Note Wardens appear to have been an apex design, for the same
    model has been found guarding many of the chambers in Silver Mount, as well
    as other scattered remnants of the massive vessel that fell from the sky so
    long ago. However, a few have been known to display different
    characteristics. Some of these alterations are intentional modifications
    made by people with great knowledge and skill. Other models may have even
    stranger origins.

    Red Terror (N warden robot ranger 7): The robot known as Red Terror guards a
    section of tunnels within the Red Redoubt of Karamoss. Red Terror appears to
    have been crafted using an alloy of djezet and steel (known as djezeteel).
    It's unclear whether the mad wizard Karamoss created the specialized warden
    robot using deciphered schematics or merely modified an existing construct.
    Either way, Red Terror is a skilled and ruthless hunter that relentlessly
    pursues intruders in its domain. Those adventurers who have encountered Red
    Terror claim that the robot actually seems to take pleasure in the gruesome
    deaths of its prey. The robot also seems to have some way to empower
    spellcasters it allies with and enhance the power of their spells.

    Silent Sentinel (CR 9): Explorers investigating ruins in the Felldales of
    western Numeria have reported encountering a unique version of the warden
    robot that can generate fields that cancel sound rather than induce nausea,
    earning it the name "Silent Sentinel." This aura has the effect of a silence
    spell with a 30-foot radius centered on the warden, but the effect can't be
    dispelled or countered by magic. Instead of sonic disruptors, Silent
    Sentinel is equipped with integrated lasers that deal 2d8 points of fire
    damage. Based on recent reports from near the First Blade's Path, this
    specialized warden doesn't keep to just the Felldales.
