SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Water Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A marid gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its
      opponent are touching water. If the opponent or the marid is touching the
      ground, the marid takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Water's
  - name: Fury (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a marid can release a jet of water in a 60-foot line
      that deals 1d6 points of damage and blinds the target struck for 1d6
      rounds. A DC 20 Reflex save reduces the damage by half and negates the
      blinding effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Vortex (Su)
    description: >-
      A marid can transform into a vortex of swirling, churning water once every
      10 minutes. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind ability,
      save that it can only be used while the marid is underwater; a marid
      cannot leave a body of water while in vortex form.
Description:
  - >-
    Of the common genies, the marid is the strongest and most powerful and least
    numerous. They hail from the Plane of Water and rarely leave that plane
    unless called by a spellcaster or at the request of the marid potentate.
    They are generally friendly toward most other genie races, except
    efreeti-whom they hate and attack on sight. A marid stands about 16 feet
    tall nearly 2,500 pounds. Marid society centers on a great Caliph whose
    citadel sits at the very center of the Plane of Water (a neat trick
    considering the infinite dimensions of the plane). The Great Caliph rules
    all marids and often sends them on missions into the other Elemental Planes
    or material planes on his behalf. Marids generally avoid combat, preferring
    not to waste their time with such trivial things. If cornered or forced into
    battle, a marid uses his spell-like abilities as well as his water fury
    attack to disperse its foes. In melee, a marid wields a masterwork trident
    or pummels his foes with his powerful fists. Noble Marid Noble marids are
    the princes and pashas of the marid homeland. Noble marids have at least 15
    HD and gain the following spell-like abilities in addition to the ones
    listed above: 3/day-cone of cold, ice storm; 1/ day-elemental swarm (water
    elementals only), permanent image. A noble marid's caster level for its
    spell-like abilities is 20th. Noble marid are CR 11. Credit The Marid
