Description:
  - >-
    Dire lions, known locally as spotted lions or cave lions, are immense
    predators that can grow up to 15 feet long and weigh up to 3,500 pounds.
    Although they are merely animals, these large creatures seem to take an
    almost sadistic glee in playing with and tormenting their prey before
    eventually devouring it. As a result, many tribes view dire lions as the
    spawn of evil gods, and hunt them down as soon as their presence in a region
    becomes obvious.
