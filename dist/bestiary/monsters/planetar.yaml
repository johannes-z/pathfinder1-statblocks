Description:
  - >-
    Planetars are the generals of celestial armies. A typical planetar stands 9
    feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. They focus on combat and the destruction of
    evil; though they understand diplomacy, a planetar would rather lead the
    charge against an army of fiends than negotiate peace.
