SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ensnare (Ex)
    description: >-
      The seeds and slam attack of a gourd leshy entangle the target in vines
      for 2d4 rounds unless the target makes a DC 12 Reflex save. The target can
      attempt to burst these entangling vines before the duration expires with a
      DC 12 Strength check as a full-round action. The save and burst DCs are
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Keepsake (Su)
    description: >-
      Gourd leshys can pop off the top of their heads and store a single
      Fine-sized object such as a dagger or potion inside While within the
      leshy's head, the item is warded by nondetection. In addition, after 24
      hours, the item within is cleaned and polished, and, if damaged, repaired
      as if by a mending spell. Both spell effects have a caster level equal to
      twice the leshy's Hit Dice (CL 2nd for most gourd leshys).
  - name: Seed (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gourd leshy can hurl its seeds as a ranged attack. If it hits, this
      attack deals 1 point of damage (this damage is not modified by Strength)
      and affects the target with the gourd leshy's ensnare ability. This attack
      has a 10-foot range increment.
Description:
  - >-
    With tangles of leafy vines for limbs and a carved gourd for a head, gourd
    leshys present a rather comical appearance. Intimately connected with the
    harvest season, gourd leshys see to the health and sustainable harvest of
    crops, especially vegetables and grains.
  - >-
    Superstition and love of rituals run deep in gourd leshys. They do their
    best to exactly reproduce what worked before with every trivial activity,
    and change seemingly random details when attempting tasks they previously
    failed. Gourd leshys collect random odds and ends as good luck charms,
    ranging from polished stones to bird feathers to tarnished coins. Credulous
    to a fault, gourd leshys believe nearly anything they hear from those they
    trust. However, their admittedly hollow heads still hold memories, and a
    gourd leshy betrayed rarely forgets.
  - >-
    As gourd leshys aren't particularly strong, they often fight dirty. One
    favorite trick is to wait for an enemy to come within striking distance
    while in gourd form so that they can assume their true form and make a sneak
    attack in the same round.
  - GROWING A GOURD LESHY
  - >-
    Gourd leshys grow best in small vegetable patches or in sunny meadows.
    Carving eyes and a mouth into a growing gourd leshy's "face" is an important
    part of the growth ritual, for neglecting to do this robs the gourd leshy of
    its ability to see or speak. The exact nature and appearance of a gourd
    leshy's features can vary wildly between individuals.
