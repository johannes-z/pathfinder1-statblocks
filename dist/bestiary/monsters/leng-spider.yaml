SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Su)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4
      Con plus confusion for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. A Leng spider's
      venom causes flesh to blister and rot away and the mind to experience
      vivid and horrific hallucinations-these visions cause the poisoned
      creature to react in an unpredictable manner, as if confused. The
      hallucination element of this poison is mind-affecting. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Web Weaponry (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Leng spider is talented at using its webs to construct masterwork
      weapons. This technique of weapon creation allows the spider to
      effectively create a flail or bolas by attaching a heavy object such as a
      rock or chunk of metal to a cord of webbing. The spider attaches one end
      of this webbing to a leg and can then wield the weighted cord as a
      masterwork flail or a masterwork bolas. It can only wield one such weapon
      at a time-it must use its other legs to walk. If a Leng spider drops or
      loses a web weapon, it can create a new one as a full-round action,
      provided it has access to heavy-weight objects of the correct size (such
      as loose rocks or skulls).
Description:
  - >-
    The spiders of Leng have long warred with that realm's more humanoid
    denizens, yet this does not make the spiders allies of sane life. These
    spiders see themselves as deserving of true positions of power, and the only
    creatures they suffer to live apart from their kin are their magically
    controlled slaves. Fortunately, the spiders have no intrinsic way to travel
    to the Material Plane, and must use portals or other methods to visit this
    world. Artistic trap builders, Leng spiders construct lairs of dangerous and
    haunting beauty made of webs and other materials found nearby.
  - >-
    A Leng spider's body is 18 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds. Most leng
    spiders possess only 7 legs, but some possess 9, 11, or only 5-they never
    possess an even number.
