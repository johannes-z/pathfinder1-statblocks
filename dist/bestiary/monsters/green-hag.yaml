SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Weakness (Su)
    description: >-
      A green hag's claws sap strength from those she strikes. Each time a green
      hag hits a foe with her claw attack, the victim takes 2 points of Strength
      damage unless he resists the weakness with a DC 16 Fortitude save.
      Alternatively, a green hag can attempt to inflict even greater weakness on
      a foe by making a touch attack-this variant requires a standard action,
      and cannot be attempted in the same round the hag makes claw attacks. The
      opponent touched must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 2d4 points
      of Strength damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.

      A green hag can imitate the sounds of almost any animal found near its
      lair.
Description:
  - >-
    Terrifying crones known to haunt foul swamps and tangled forests, green hags
    harbor an intense hatred for all beauty and purity. Making use of their
    varied deceptive abilities, these crones delight in murdering innocents,
    unhinging noble minds, and debasing the pure of heart. They are particularly
    fond of using disguise self to assume the forms of alluring young maidens
    and then seducing young men away from their lovers or families. In this
    form, they can infect such noble and upstanding citizens with all manner of
    debauchery and scandal. Some green hags prefer to reveal their true natures
    to their lovers at a moment precisely engineered to drive the man mad with
    horror and shame. Others drag out their dalliances and do what they can to
    utterly ruin the lives of the men they seduce before showing the broken
    shell that remains the truth. In the end, the luckiest of these unfortunate
    lovers end up being eaten by their green hag companions-for the unlucky,
    their final doom can be much worse, for the cruel imagination of the green
    hag is vast. A typical green hag stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs
    just under 160 pounds. Hag Covens When three hags of any type gather, they
    can form a coven to gain increased magical ability. Any combination of hags
    can form a coven, but green hags are the most common members of such foul
    gatherings. Whenever all three hags of a particular coven are within 10 feet
    of one another, all three of them can work together to use any of the
    following spell-like abilities: animate dead, baleful polymorph (DC 18),
    blight (DC 17), bestow curse (DC 17), clairaudience/clairvoyance, charm
    monster (DC 17), commune, control weather, dream, forcecage, mind blank,
    mirage arcana (DC 18), reincarnate, speak with dead, veil (DC 19), vision.
    All three hags must take a fullround action to take part in this form of
    cooperative magic. All coven spell-like abilities function at CL 9th (or at
    the highest CL available to the most powerful hag in the coven). The save
    DCs are Charisma-based, and function as if with a Charisma score of 16
    unless one of the hags has a higher Charisma score, in which case the
    spell-like ability DCs are adjusted by that hag's Charisma modif ier. At the
    GM's discretion, certain more powerful hag covens might have additional
    spell-like abilities.
