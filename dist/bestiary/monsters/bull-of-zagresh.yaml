Description:
  - >-
    These enormous bovines are 15 feet tall, measure nearly 30 feet from horns
    to tail, and weigh approximately 16 tons. Bred for war and violence by the
    Murdered Child orc tribe, they are used in ravine fights-bloodsports in
    blocked-off gorges or gullies that pit the might and ferocity of orcs
    against various wild beasts. Aggressive and trained for combat, bulls of
    Zagresh respond to most threats by charging anything that stands and goring
    whatever is left. Skilled Murdered Child beast drovers oversee bulls of
    Zagresh in warfare, driving the mighty cattle into enemy formations to break
    the front line or crush foot archers and other lightly armored targets.
