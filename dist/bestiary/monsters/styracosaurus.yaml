    description: >-
      A styracosaurus can make three additional attacks of opportunity each
      round-combined with its bonus Combat Reflexes feat, this allows the
      dinosaur to make up to five of these attacks of opportunity per round. The
      dinosaur makes these attacks with its horned crest, but they are treated
      as normal gore attacks.
Description:
  - >-
    The styracosaurus is a bulky dinosaur with a solid frame and a very
    distinctive skull-a horned frill extends back from its head, protecting its
    neck and serving as a highly effective natural weapon that allows it to make
    attacks of opportunity. It is notorious for its ill temper, savagely
    attacking any creature that it perceives as a threat or even as an irritant.
    A styracosaurus is 18 feet long and weighs nearly 3 tons.
