  - >-
    Dire corbies are humanoid, bipedal birdmen that dwell deep beneath the
    surface world. They make their homes in large, open caverns, hollowing out
    individual shelters in the walls themselves. These creatures do not possess
    wings now, but did in some remote part of their past. Why their wings
    disappeared and were replaced by claws is unknown. Dire corbies are
    omnivores but prefer a diet of fresh meat, enjoying the flesh of
    subterranean rodents, animals, and even other races. They are particularly
    fond of the flesh of bats, savoring the leathery grit of their flesh. Dire
    corbies hunt in flocks. They enjoy the thrill of the hunt and enjoy running
    their prey down, toying with it before swooping in and tearing it to shreds
    with their claws. Dire corbies always fight to the death and never flee,
    even when faced with overwhelming odds. Dire Corbies as Characters Dire
