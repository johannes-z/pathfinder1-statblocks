Description_Visual: >-
  Brutish, warty, hairy, and stinking of oil and iron, this creature has a
  jutting lower jaws and tusk like teeth, not unlike an orc or hobgoblin of huge
  size wrapped in chains of iron. It wears belts of skulls and rotting heads
  about its throat and waist.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Daze (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature hit by a jack-in-iron's melee attack must succeed on a DC 36
      Fortitude save or be dazed 1d2 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based and
      is a function of the jack-in-irons not its weapon(s).
  - name: Pound (Ex)
    description: >-
      A jack-in-irons that makes a successful grapple check against a foe two or
      more sizes smaller than itself can smash the opponent into the ground,
      walls, nearby trees, or other solid objects as a standard action. This
      deals 2d6+19 points of bludgeoning damage to the victim. In addition, the
      opponent must succeed on a DC 36 Fortitude save or be stunned for one
      round. A jack-in-irons can perform this action once per round as long as
      it maintains the grapple. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Shake the Earth (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a jack-in-irons can stomp its foot on the ground
      causing powerful vibrations to radiate out around the giant. Any creature
      within 5 feet of the jack-in-irons must succeed on a DC 36 Reflex save or
      fall prone. The save DC is Strength-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The jacks-in irons enjoy fastening gate chains and portcullis chains around
    their wrists, fore-arms and shins and tie chains about their throats,
    shoulders and waists which hang with the heads of their many victims.
  - >-
    Jacks-in-irons frequently operate as highwaymen, making their dwellings in
    ruined towers along abandoned roads. From this base they roam out along old
    country trails ambushing unwary travelers, trade caravans and the knights
    assigned to protect them. They are known to take prisoners and hold them for
    high ransom.
  - >-
    Orcs and goblins often follow a jack-in-irons as their king or leader due to
    its massive size, brute strength, and penchant for wickedness-all of which
    are things that such evil creatures admire.
  - >-
    A jack-in-irons stands 20 to 25 feet tall and weighs 13,000 to 15,000
    pounds. It prefers to dress in dark colors such as black or brown and always
    wears a multitude of chains about its body (as bracelets, necklaces, or
    slung about its shoulders). Its hair is dark and matted and many male
    jack-in-irons sport thick, bushy beards. Its eyes are purplish-black with
    light green irises.
  - Jack-in-irons speak Giant.
  - >-
    Bull rush, Awesome blow, bash, bash, bash, cleave, rinse and repeat if
    necessary until they are out of attacks or out of enemies. Jacks-in-irons
    think of themselves as invincible and fight to the death.
