  - >-
    While many cetaceans are docile, the crimson whale is an aggressive hunter
    that evolved to quickly kill even the largest and most powerful of prey. It
    sports a full set of deadly teeth that average between 1 and 2 feet in
    length, and its powerful bite can tear through flesh and crush bone. A
    typical adult crimson whale is 45 feet long and weighs 30 tons.
