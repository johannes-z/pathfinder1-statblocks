Description_Visual: >-
  This floating creature is mostly pulsating brain-sac, with the body beneath it
  somewhere between that of an insect and a human fetus.

Description:
  - >-
    Once, the entities that would become known as Contemplatives were relatively
    normal humanoids, notable only for their extreme intelligence. At some point
    in the distant past, however, their race discovered a great secret within
    itself, unlocking the mind's potential for such sought-after mental powers
    as telekinesis. Evolution-whether natural or forced by the Contemplatives
    themselves-made their incredible brains the sole focus of their advancement,
    and as the Contemplatives grew to rely more and more on their psychic
    abilities, their limbs withered and shrank.
  - >-
    Today, a Contemplative's massive brain makes up roughly 80 percent of its
    bodyweight. Below the pulsating and partially translucent sac that protects
    the vital organ, the rest of its body hangs almost vestigially, used for
    little more than breathing and processing food. Movement, speech, and the
    manipulation of objects are handled by the creatures' psychic abilities,
    resulting in a collection of eerily quiet figures that float slowly and
    precisely along the halls of their fortresses, mulling over ideas that only
    their advanced brains are capable of understanding. Though alien in
    appearance and demeanor, Contemplatives are rarely malicious; instead, when
    their unexplainable goals bring them into conf lict with other races, it can
    generally be assumed that they have good reasons for their actions, though
    this may be of little comfort to those inconvenienced by the far-seeing
    brain-people's schemes. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about the
    Contemplatives, however, is the chance that their abhorrent, brain-centric
    form may in fact be the ultimate destination of all humanoid evolution.
  - >-
    A typical Contemplative of Ashok weighs roughly 100 pounds and measures 3
    feet in diameter, though it prefers to float at the eye level of whomever
    it's talking to. Most become sages or arcanists, taking levels of wizard,
    sorcerer, bard, or other arcane spell-wielding classes; though divine
    casters are not unknown, most Contemplatives have little interest in the
    gods (or perhaps the gods take affront at the creatures' probing and
    presumptuous questions regarding the nature of reality). When they speak
    inside another creature's head, their voices are monotone and seeming to
    come from everywhere at once, and when multiple Contemplatives are
    encountered, they almost always speak as "we" rather than the individual
    "I."
