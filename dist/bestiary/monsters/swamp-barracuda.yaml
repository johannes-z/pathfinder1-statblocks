Description:
  - >-
    These carnivorous fish have long, writhing bodies and pointed heads. Their
    overdeveloped pectoral fins and widely separated dorsal fins make them swift
    swimmers, and their powerful jaws promise a quick and brutal death for any
    prey they might catch. Their tails serve as potent secondary weapons, which
    they use to bludgeon particularly hardy opponents before tearing them limb
    from limb.

    Swamp barracuda thrive in the tropical waters surrounding the continent of
    Garund, and are particularly prominent throughout the Sodden Lands and
    Mwangi Expanse. To the north, they can occasionally be found in the Mushfens
    and the Varisian Gulf in the warmer months, heading south when winter cools
    the waters. While they normally hunt alone or in small groups, during their
    migratory season, massive schools of swamp barracuda can be spotted
    traveling down the western Avistani coastline, where they feed on small
    whales as well as terrestrial creatures that wander too close to their
    waters.

    While swamp barracuda are most often found in the wild, particularly daring
    hunters sometimes capture them to serve either as food or pets. Swamp
    barracuda can survive for a long time outside their preferred climates, but
    often grow lax and weak if their owners fail to feed them properly or don't
    take care of their holding tank. Magnimar's infamous Sczarni gang, the
    Gallowed, uses swamp barracuda as a coercion technique against wealthy
    patsies as well as borrowers who fail to make a payment on time (an act made
    difficult by the exorbitant interest rate the Gallowed put on any loans they
    give out). Called the Fish Tank by those who know of it, the saltwater
    aquarium that houses Jaster Frallino's precious barracuda is stored in a
    dilapidated blue caravan wagon owned by the Gallowed, and more than one
    failed business partner has lost an eye, toe, or hand to "the Boss's Fish."
    It is also known that the Sczarni boss keeps a collection of rusty keys at
    the bottom of the Fish Tank, though the purpose of these mysterious items is
    a secret held by Frallino alone.

    An average swamp barracuda is about 6 feet long and weighs over 60 pounds,
    though specimens up to 12 feet long have been spotted in particularly remote
    locations.
