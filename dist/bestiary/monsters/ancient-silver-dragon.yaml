SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A silver dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form three times per day
      as if using polymorph.
  - name: Cloudwalking (Su)
    description: >-
      A very young or older silver dragon can tread on clouds or fog as though
      on solid ground.
  - name: Cold Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      An old or older silver dragon is surrounded by an aura of cold. All
      creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of cold damage at
      the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient dragon's aura extends to 10
      feet. A great wyrm's aura damage increases to 2d6. A silver dragon can
      suppress or activate this aura at will as a free action.
  - name: Fog Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A juvenile or older silver dragon can see perfectly well in fog and
      clouds.
  - name: Graceful Flight (Ex)
    description: >-
      A young or older silver dragon's aerial maneuverability is one step better
      than normal.
  - name: Paralyzing Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Instead of a cone of cold, a silver dragon can breathe a cone of
      paralyzing gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save
      or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category of the
      dragon.
  - name: Reflective Scales (Su)
    description: >-
      Any spell that targets an ancient or older silver dragon but fails to
      penetrate the silver dragon's spell resistance might be reflected. If the
      caster level check to penetrate the dragon's spell resistance is failed by
      5 or more, the spell is reflected. If the check fails by 4 or less, the
      spell is merely wasted. This otherwise functions as spell turning.
