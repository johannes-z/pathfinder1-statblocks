SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a jade colossus can spray a blast of green energy
      in either a 60-foot cone or a 120-foot line. A creature in the affected
      area takes 15d6 points of damage, Reflex half DC 26. A creature slain as
      the result of this breath weapon transforms into jade. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. A creature turned to jade has Hardness 6, hp 40. This
      effect can be reversed by casting stone to flesh, wish, or miracle. The
      victim remains dead, but can then be raised or resurrected normally.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A jade colossus is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. A disintegrate spell
      slows a jade colossus (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds, with no saving
      throw. A shatter spell deals 3d12 points of damage to a jade colossus,
      with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any
      slow effect on the jade colossus and heals 1 point of damage for each 3
      points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing
      would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any
      excess as temporary hit points. A jade colossus gets no saving throw
      against fire effects.
  - name: Light Reflection (Ex)
    description: >-
      The angles and makeup of the jade colossus allows it to reflect any
      light-based attacks or effects (it cannot reflect natural sunlight
      however). Reflected light acts as an emanation (lasting 1 round) that
      blinds all creatures within 40 feet. A creature can attempt a Reflex save
      DC 26 to avoid being blinded If the save fails, the creature is blinded
      for 2d4 rounds (as the blindness spell); creatures that successfully save
      are instead dazzled for a like amount of time. Undead and similar
      creatures to whom sunlight is harmful to take 6d6 points of damage (a
      successful Reflex save DC 26 halves the damage).
Description:
  - >-
    The jade colossus was first seen dominating the skyline over the City of
    Brass, its massive form reflecting the light from the ever-burning fires of
    the City. Since that time, rumors of these creatures moving across the
    Material Plane have been heard in taverns and inns. Jade colossi are massive
    constructs built by powerful spellcasters to do their bidding; typically for
    protection or to wage war against an archrival. A jade colossus pummels a
    foe with its hardened fists; dealing massive amounts of damage with every
    successful strike. It almost always opens combat with its breath weapon. A
    typical jade colossus stands 35 feet tall and weighs about 60,000 pounds.
    (The jade colossus spotted in the City of Brass is thought to be over 50
    feet tall and weigh in excess of 100,000 pounds.) Ruby Star of Law Sages
    speak of a jade colossus located in the City of Brass that has the ruby star
    of law (a gem of inestimable value) embedded in its forehead. The Jade
    Guardian (as it is known in the City) is a CR 18 advanced jade colossus with
    the following additional ability. Energy Ray (Su): Once per round as a swift
    action, the Jade Guardian can fire a ray to a range of 200 feet (requires a
    successful ranged touch attack to hit). Genies hit by this ray must make a
    successful Fortitude save (DC 26) or take 6d4 points of Constitution damage.
    On a successful save, the genie takes onehalf damage. Other creatures are
    affected as follows: Lawful creatures are slowed (as by the slow spell) for
    1d4 rounds (no save). Non-lawful creatures take 6d6 points of force damage
    (no save) and are stunned for 1d4 rounds (DC 26 Fortitude save negates).
    Should the ruby star of law ever be claimed as a magic item, treat it as a
    minor artifact that allows use of the energy ray ability indicated above,
    save that it requires a standard action to activate. Construction A jade
    colossus's body is constructed from 80,000 pounds of pure jade, and a
    mixture of rare stones, herbs, and chemicals totaling 8,000 gp. JADE
