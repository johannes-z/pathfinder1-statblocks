SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Insolence (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature adjacent to a thoxel demon must succeed at a DC 15 Will save
      or become insolent and uncooperative with its allies. Creatures affected
      by this aura stop functioning as allies to other creatures. An affected
      creature can't provide flanking, can't serve as an ally for teamwork feats
      or aid another actions, and doesn't allow its allies to move through its
      space. Any spell or effect that requires a willing target fails if it is
      used on an affected creature, and even harmless effects require an attack
      roll (if applicable) and require the insolent creature to attempt a saving
      throw against them. An affected creature remains insolent as long as it is
      adjacent to a thoxel demon and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. A creature that
      successfully saves is not subject to the same thoxel's aura for 24 hours.
      Thoxel demons are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
      Betrayer's
  - name: Blade (Su)
    description: >-
      If a thoxel demon hits a creature with both ends of its two-bladed sword
      in the same round, the target is compelled to attack its leader. The
      target can negate this effect with a successful DC 15 Will save. A
      creature affected by this effect turns on its leader or commander and
      attacks as if it were dominated for 1d6 rounds. An animal companion,
      cohort, or familiar must attack its master, and a called, charmed,
      dominated, or summoned creature must attack the creature controlling it.
      If a creature has no leader, it instead attacks a random ally. This is a
      mind-affecting compulsion effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Disrupt Coordination (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a creature threatened by a thoxel demon uses the aid another
      action, the thoxel can, as an immediate action, attempt to interrupt and
      negate that action. The thoxel demon must make an attack roll. The attack
      roll of the creature performing the aid another action must equal or
      exceed the thoxel demon's attack roll; otherwise, the aid another action
      is negated.
Description:
  - >-
    Able to take the shape of rank-and-file soldiers and infect military ranks
    like a cancer, thoxels-also known as insubordination demons-spend every drop
    of their malice to break down the cooperative spirit of those who fight
    together. Among mortal soldiers, thoxels whisper disparaging words about
    commanders, talk in hushed tones about the danger of upcoming battles, or
    belittle other soldiers' accomplishments. Many great battles are said to
    have been lost because of the presence of these subtle but murderous demons
    within an army's ranks. They represent a passion to kill as they please
    without caring about order, control, or their allies. Despite their skill at
    martial exploits, thoxels are lazy and untrustworthy creatures. Thoxel
    demons are 6 feet tall and weigh 200 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Thoxel demons form from the souls of deserters and traitors, those who
    abandoned their posts and their erstwhile allies to their fates while they
    sought glory elsewhere on the battlefield, or safety far from it. These
    cowardly demons delight in breaking the spirits of those they hide among,
    disguised as typical soldiers. Their defining sin is the ruin, pain, and
    death they brought to others by failing to follow orders, keep discipline,
    and stand firm in face of adversity. It is not just that they failed private
    tests of character, but also that their moral disintegration led to great
    suffering in others who trusted them and depended on them. Those betrayers
    who sought to expiate their guilt through reconciliation and reparations to
    those they abandoned still earned their shame but preserved their eternal
    souls, but the unrepentant souls who callously disregarded the tragedies
    left in their wake, hewing to their own path again and again despite the
    havoc they left behind, often find their way to the Abyss.
  - >-
    Thoxel demons are lazy in the extreme, prone to shirking labor and sleeping
    whenever they have the chance-despite not needing to do so. Thoxels usually
    have to be herded into work details and closely supervised by more powerful
    demons. When closely directed, they can perform impressively in battlefield
    maneuvers and move with tight precision, coordinating their attacks between
    one another in order to bring down lone prey too strong for a single thoxel
    to defeat on its own. Once their prey is taken or the enemy's resolve is
    broken, their temporary alliances fracture quickly and they resort to
    squabbling and fighting among themselves over the spoils, with the strongest
    taking the lion's share and the rest settling for scraps.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Thoxel demons are instruments of spiritual torture, in that they represent
    the advent of hope followed by its shattering destruction. They appear to be
    strong and steadfast warriors who march in precise formation and keep their
    armaments perpetually polished to a parade ground shine, yet at precisely
    the wrong moment they break and run, or disrupt careful formations with
    sudden and unexpected maneuvers aimed at self-aggrandizement or
    self-preservation. They corrode discipline and morale, turning troops
    against commanders and allies against friends. Thoxels are agents of
    dissension and disruption, whether working alone or using magical or mundane
    disguises to infiltrate existing units.
  - >-
    Thoxels are reborn into bodies very much like the ones they possessed in
    life, though they are scarred and physically tormented for their cowardice
    and treachery in life before being reborn into an eternity of spreading
    their sin to others. They are formed up into squads and platoons and set to
    patrol the endless realms of the Abyss when not sent to break armies on the
    Material Plane. These groups of thoxels form fluid ranks, gathering together
    for short periods of time interspersed with long periods of lazy rest.
  - >-
    Though thoxels willingly fight for any demons more powerful than themselves,
    they are common within the Abyssal realm of Charnelhome, where the psychic
    implements of Shax dissect and dismember soul and spirit as surely as they
    do flesh and bone. There, thoxels spar continuously with the babaus and
    chokers who lurk in every shadowy corner of Charnelhome, fighting a
    guerrilla war to show who are the fittest servants of the Blood Marquis.
  - >-
    Thoxel demons are skilled artisans, able to forge and maintain weapons and
    armor of excellent quality, and they take a certain pride in ensuring their
    personal armaments are always sharp and in good repair. When closely
    supervised, thoxel demons can be tasked with forge duty, turning out weapons
    for demonic legions in great numbers. However, their selfishness and
    laziness impairs their usefulness as foundry smiths for demon armies, as
    they frequently take shortcuts to get through their quotas and care little
    for the fate of demonic soldiers whose weapons shatter in battle or whose
    armor is ill-fitting or missing key fasteners. Anyone who relies on an
    insubordination demon's craftsmanship takes a great risk, for thoxels rarely
    put much care and attention to detail into the armor or weapons that are
    intended for anyone but themselves.
