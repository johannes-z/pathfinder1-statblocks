Description_Visual: >-
  The slug-like thing has a cylindrical body and a mass of dripping, writhing
  tentacles at its head. It is brownish gray, with patches of green and black
  blotches scattered unevenly over its body. Its underside is pasty off-white in
  color and ripples with the muscular contractions that move the creature along.

  - name: Alien Thoughts (Su)
    description: >-
      The alien brainwaves of a t'shann have a bizarre effect on intelligent
      creatures. Within 30 feet of a t'shann, all opponents with an Intelligence
      score greater than 5 must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be affected as
      if by a confusion spell (caster level equal to the t'shann's HD). If the
      opponent approaches to within 10 feet he must succeed on another DC 13
      Will save or take 1d4 points of Intelligence damage for as long as he
      remains within 10 feet of the t'shann. Once the opponent moves more than
      10 feet from this effect, his Intelligence score immediately returns to
      normal, although any confusion effects remain until he moves more than 30
      feet away. Psionic monsters and creatures, being attuned to the brainwaves
      of others, suffer these effects at double the normal range. The save DCs
      are Charisma-based.
  - name: Burrow (Ex)
    description: >-
      A t'shann rarely appears in the open air, preferring the closeness and
      coolness of being deep in the earth. In order to attack a t'shann
      physically, an opponent must first find it and lure it out of its burrow.
      Finding a t'shann burrow requires a successful DC 15 Perception check.
      Once the burrow is located, the t'shann can be lured out by placing small
      pile of gems at the entrance. The t'shann must succeed on a DC 10 Will
      save or shuffle out of its lair to consume the treats.
  - name: Spew (Ex)
    description: >-
      If attacked, a t'shann emits a spray of powerful acids from nearly every
      pore on its body, affecting any creature within 10 feet of it. This acidic
      spray deals 1d4 points of acid damage, plus 1 point of damage per round
      for 1d4 rounds. A DC 13 Reflex save reduces the acid damage by half. The
      save DC is Constitution based.
Description:
  - >-
    T'shanns are slug-like creatures that burrow through earth and stone to
    consume the minerals trapped in the rock. They range anywhere from 2 to 4
    feet long. A t'shann burrows through stone by extruding powerful digestive
    enzymes through its mouth and skin, that let it dissolve the stone, and then
    slurping it up for consumption. It can use this ability to attack creatures
    that threaten it.
  - >-
    The most unusual aspect of a t'shann is its ability to cause confusion by
    its mere presence. The simple but alien brain of a t'shann emits waves in
    such a frequency that more advanced creatures suffer from severe
    disorientation if they come too close. T'shanns rarely attack. They are
    content to burrow through rock and dirt, blissfully unaware of the rest of
    the world. If attacked, however, a t'shann defends itself with all the
    natural weapons available to it.
