  one eye in the center of each ugly head.

      A biclops fights with a longsword or spear in each hand. Because each of
      its two heads controls an arm, the biclops does not take a penalty on
      attack or damage rolls for attacking with two weapons.
Description:
  - >-
    Despite their appearance biclops are generally peaceable creatures who live
    by hunting and herding giant longhorn sheep, which they keep for milk and
    wool. They are feared by less intelligent giants such as hill giants and
    trolls whom they beat to death on sight. Biclops have good relations with
    stone giants whom they trade finished metal weapons and goat cheese in
    exchange for raw ore and gold.
  - >-
    Adult male biclops stand about 16 feet tall and weigh about 4,500 pounds.
    Females are slightly shorter and lighter. Both male and female dress in
    clothes made of dark or dull colors (browns, greens, and dark reds usually).
    Biclops skin ranges from ruddy brown to cinnamon and eye color is usually
    blue. Hair color is almost universally dark though occasionally a
    fair-haired biclops is born (such a biclops is viewed as someone special
    among his or her own kind). Warriors and protectors often wear hide armor
    (and sometimes metal armor) and always carry weapons.
  - A biclops can live to be 350 years old.
  - >-
    Biclops fight with twin longswords, hacking foes to pieces with mighty
    cleaving chops. If given advanced warning they tend to chase off intruders
    with well aimed rocks hurled from great heights or crushing them beneath
    controlled avalanches.
  - >-
    Biclops live in tribe-like communities deep within hills and mountains
    constructing their homes from the stones and lumber of their environment.
  - >-
    A typical biclops home has three rooms: a communal area where the family
    meets, a sleeping room, and a kitchen. Biclops families rely on each other
    for protection, food, and trade. External trade is often set up between
    biclops and other races, particularly stone giants and dwarves.
  - >-
    Some of the less "reputable" tribes take prisoners or cannibalize humanoids
    and monstrous humanoids. In such a case, there is a 20% chance that a
    biclops lair contains 1d4 captive humanoids or monstrous humanoids.
  - >-
    Biclops leaders are usually fighters or barbarians. Most groups of biclops
    include clerics (sometimes called shamans among the biclops race). A biclops
    cleric has access to two of the following domains: Earth, Strength,
    Trickery, or War. Sorcerers and wizards are extremely rare among the biclops
    race.
