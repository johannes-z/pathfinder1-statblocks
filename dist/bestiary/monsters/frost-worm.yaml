SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cold (Su)
    description: >-
      A frost worm's body generates intense cold, allowing it to deal an
      additional 4d6 cold damage with its bite attack. Any creature that attacks
      a frost worm with an unarmed strike or a natural weapon takes 1d6 points
      of cold damage per successful hit. A creature that grapples or is grappled
      by a frost worm takes 4d6 points of cold damage per round the grapple is
      maintained.
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When killed, a frost worm explodes in a 100-foot-radius burst that deals
      12d6 cold damage and 8d6 piercing damage (DC 23 Reflex half ). The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Trill (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a frost worm can emit a strange trilling sound
      that affects all creatures within a 100-foot radius. Creatures must
      succeed on a DC 18 Will save or be fascinated for as long as the worm
      continues to trill (the frost worm can maintain this trill by
      concentrating). Once a creature has resisted or broken the effect, it
      cannot be affected again by that same frost worm's trill for 24 hours.
      This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    With armor-crushing jaws, flesh that radiates cold, and a terrible keening
    cry capable of holding creatures fascinated, frost worms are apex predators
    of the frozen tundra and glaciers. In the frost worms' far-reaching hunting
    grounds, they fear only the remorhaz, for the heat generated by an enraged
    remorhaz causes intense pain to a frost worm.
  - >-
    This extreme aversion to heat, as well as its freezing touch and devastating
    breath weapon, stems from an unusual facet of frost worm physiology-veins
    that run with magically cold blood. This creature's ichor is clear, but
    infused with such sub-freezing temperatures that the monster's flesh can
    freeze water in the skin of creatures that touch it. When a frost worm dies,
    this magical energy dissipates, and both blood and muscle immediately freeze
    solid and then explode into a catastrophic barrage of icy shrapnel. As a
    result, even those predators that might legitimately prey upon the burrowing
    monstrosities tend to leave frost worms well enough alone.
  - An adult frost worm measures 35 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.
