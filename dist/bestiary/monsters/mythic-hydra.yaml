Description:
  - >-
    A mythic hydra is a deadly combination of bites, lunges, speed, and
    durability. Descended from the very first of its kind, it may run wild. Or
    created whole by some divine agent, it could be placed as a guardian of a
    sacred site or a portal to the underworld. Some mythic hydras are reputed to
    have poisonous breath and blood, or to be so toxic that they corrupt the
    ground they crawl upon.
