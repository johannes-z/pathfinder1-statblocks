SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Water Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A coral giant gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and
      its opponent are touching water. If the opponent or the coral giant is
      touching the ground, the coral giant takes a -4 penalty on attack and
      damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers,
      whether the coral giant is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.
  - name: Water Stride (Ex)
    description: >-
      A coral giant suffers no penalties for fighting in or under water (as if
      affected by a freedom of movement spell).
Description:
  - >-
    Coral giants are 12-foot tall humanoids that dwell beneath the waves. They
    make their homes in great undersea castles constructed of stone. They are
    generally peaceful creatures and spend their days fishing and tending to
    their coral farms. Their diet typically consists of undersea plants, fish,
    and the like, with occasional forays onto land to hunt large game. Trade
    with other intelligent races is common, with coral giant jewelry being
    prized by many races. These creatures are on generally good terms with
    merfolk, tritons, storm giants, and humans. Wars are waged against the
    sahuagin, krakens, and aboleths, the latter being a particularly hated foe.

    Coral giant homes are most always constructed of smooth stone and contain
    large, open expanses and rooms. Their homes usually contain a few rooms
    constructed for air-breathers so land-based visitors can move about somewhat
    freely. Homes are deep under the waters, but no so deep as to be
    inaccessible to other races looking to trade and bargain. Though coral
    giants can survive in any waters, they prefer temperate or warm environments
    to cold temperatures. They can also freely breathe air, but prefer life
    underwater to land.
  - >-
    Coral giants are, on average, 12 feet tall and weigh 1,500 pounds. Females
    tend to be slightly smaller and lighter than males. Skin tones vary in color
    but are always some shade of coral. Hair color varies from deep blacks to
    light reds. On very rare occasions, a coral giant is encountered that has
    white hair. Coral giant's eyes are usually dark blue or green. They can live
    to be 400 years old. Coral giant leaders are typically fighters or
    barbarians, though a few are rangers. Druids and clerics are common among
    coral giants; other spellcasting classes are not.
  - >-
    Coral giants fight with massive tridents in combat, fiercely protecting
    their territory and young. Creatures not driven off are slaughtered and left
    for scavenging fish to feed upon.
