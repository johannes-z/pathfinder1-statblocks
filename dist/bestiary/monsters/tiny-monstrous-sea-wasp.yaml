SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Entangle (Ex)
    description: >-
      A sea wasp can entangle a creature up to two sizes smaller than itself
      with its tentacles with a successful CMB check. An entangled opponent
      suffers tentacle damage and the effect of its poison each round the hold
      is maintained. An entangled creature still receives a save to avoid the
      effects of its poison. While a foe is entangled, the sea wasp cannot
      attack any other creature.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sting-injury; the effects of the poison are determined by the creature's
      size (see table below). The DC of the save is Constitution-based. Size

    description: >-
      A monstrous sea wasp can jet backward once per round as a full-round
      action at a speed equal to four times its swim speed. It must move in a
      straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.
  - name: Transparent (Ex)
    description: >-
      A monstrous sea wasp is nearly invisible floating in the water. An
      observer must make a successful DC 20 Perception check to notice the sea
      wasp.

    description: >-
      Monstrous sea wasps can automatically sense the location of anything
      within 60 feet that is in contact with water.
Description:
  - >-
    Monstrous sea wasps are deadly aquatic creatures with long, writhing and
    highly poisonous tentacles that extend for several yards. They inhabit warm
    waters and tend to congregate near coastal regions or river mouths where
    they wait for prey to wash downstream to them. Monstrous sea wasps are also
    called box jellyfish or marine stingers. Almost invisible in the water, the
    sea wasp has four eyes, one on each side of the bell, connected to a nerve
    ring inside the main body. They have no brain, but are able to process
    visual information. These eyes are invisible to all but the keenest
    observers. Monstrous sea wasps feed on a variety of marine life including
    fish, manta rays and stingrays, and crustaceans. The larger monstrous sea
    wasps also feed on sharks, whales, giant fish, giant squids, octopi, and
    swimmers. Prey that becomes entangled in its mass of tentacles is quickly
    stung by the sea wasp and then coiled into its mouth and devoured. Monstrous
    sea wasps are non-aggressive and do not actively hunt for food. They simply
    float along in the water waiting for a living creature to swim into its mass
    of tentacles. When it detects prey in its tentacles, it folds them around
    the prey, and stings it. A monstrous sea wasp's poison (particularly the
    larger ones) is meant to instantly kill its prey so it does not struggle and
    damage the sea wasp's delicate form. Sages catalogue the sea wasp's sting as
    being one of the deadliest and most painful one can experience. A creature
    stung by a sea wasp that lives to tell about, never forgets its brush with
    this monstrosity. Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene.
