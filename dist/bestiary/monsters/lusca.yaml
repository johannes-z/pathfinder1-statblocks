SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poisonous Suckers (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature constricted by a lusca's tentacles is exposed to its deadly
      venom. Lusca Venom: Constrict-injury; save Fort DC 28; frequency 1/round
      for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Rend Ship (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a lusca can attempt to use four of its tentacles
      to grapple a ship of its size or smaller by making a combat maneuver check
      opposed by the ship's captain's Profession (sailor) check; the lusca
      receives a cumulative +4 bonus on the check for each size category smaller
      than Gargantuan the ship is. If the lusca grapples the ship, it holds the
      ship motionless; it can attack targets anywhere on or within the ship with
      its tentacles, but can't attack foes at all with its shark heads. Each
      round it maintains its hold on the ship, it automatically deals bite
      damage to the ship's hull.
  - name: Tenacious Grapple (Ex)
    description: >-
      A lusca does not gain the grappled condition if it grapples a foe with its
      tentacles.
Description:
  - >-
    Luscas are among the most feared predators in the open ocean, their snapping
    shark heads and writhing tentacles spelling the end for many crews. A
    lusca's presence can first be felt in the air, as its body naturally
    conducts electricity, and sailors who have encountered the being claim that
    thunderclouds seem to roll in alongside the creature. Ravenous and
    unpredictable, a lusca claims wide swaths of territory in order to maximize
    the number of ships it can sink and crews it can feast upon. While luscas
    prefer to make quick meals of the sailors onboard a ship, they will eat just
    about any aquatic creature, and even giant octopuses and whales know to
    steer clear of a hungry lusca.
  - The average lusca is 90 feet from tentacle to snout and weighs 3,800 pounds.
