    Bulbous and robust in comparison to others of the same species, giant queen
    bees are immense, fertile females, easily identified by their larger size
    and lighter stripes. They grow to 12 feet in length and weigh 140 pounds.
    Royal Jelly When a hive of bees needs a new queen to replace one that has
    died, they feed specially selected larvae royal jelly to trigger the
    larvae's transformation into new queens. The first queen to hatch then kills
    any other new queens. Royal jelly has remarkable effects on other creatures
    if eaten. A pound of royal jelly provides enough nourishment for a full day,
    and grants a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws against disease for
    the next 24 hours. If a creature sleeps enough to heal damage within 24
    hours of eating at least a pound of royal jelly, it heals twice the hit
    points and ability damage as it otherwise would. A typical bee hive contains
    2d6 pounds of royal jelly-a single pound sells for 100 gp.
