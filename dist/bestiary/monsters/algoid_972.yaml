SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animate Trees (Su)
    description: >-
      An algoid can animate trees within 90 feet at will, controlling up to two
      trees at a time. It takes 1 full round for a normal tree to uproot itself.
      Thereafter, it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights using the stats
      below. Animated trees lose their ability to move if the algoid that
      animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. This ability is
      otherwise similar to liveoak (caster level 10th).
  - name: Mind Blast (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day, an algoid can use a mind blast in a 60-foot cone. Any
      creature caught in the cone must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be
      stunned for 3d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2
      racial bonus.
  - name: Stun (Ex)
    description: >-
      If an algoid scores a critical hit with a slam attack, the opponent struck
      must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d2 rounds. The
      save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Vulnerability to Water (Ex)
    description: >-
      A control water spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum
      10d6) to an algoid (no save).
Description:
  - >-
    The algoid is a living colony of algae that has developed some semblance of
    intelligence and mobility. It is roughly humanoid in shape and resembles a
    green humanoid. Algoids make their lairs in marshes and swamps. They are
    often encountered with other marsh-dwelling sentient plants; though never
    with shambling mounds (they hate them and usually attack them on sight). The
    algoid is 7 feet tall and weighs about 300 pounds. In its natural
    surroundings, it is nearly invisible until it attacks and uses this to its
    advantage when prey is nearby. The "skin" of an algoid is coarse and rough
    with a leafy texture. It is thought that the algoid understands Common. It
    does not, however, seem to speak it.
