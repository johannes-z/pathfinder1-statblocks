SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures that succumb to a gongorinan's horrific appearance become
      confused for 1d4 rounds.
  - name: Oviposition (Su)
    description: >-
      A gongorinan can implant a stony egg the size of a human heart in the body
      of any Small or larger pinned, helpless, or willing creature as a
      full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. This action
      deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage to the victim. If the victim
      survives this damage, the egg takes root deep in the victim's body, links
      to his mind, and begins gestating. The egg grows rapidly, dealing 1 point
      of Intelligence drain every day to a minimum score of 1. Once this
      Intelligence drain affects a creature that already has an effective
      Intelligence score of 1, the egg "hatches" inside of the victim. This
      causes the victim to immediately transform into a horrid animal,
      aberration, magical beast, or vermin (the exact choice is made by the
      gongorinan according to its strange goals and unknowable desires),
      whereupon it begins living out its new life via pure instinct-this effect
      otherwise functions as if it were baleful polymorph to which the creature
      had failed its secondary Will save to retain its personality. A gongorinan
      can command the actions of a creature that has undergone this
      transformation as if the victim had been affected by dominate monster
      (this works even on creatures that are normally immune to such effects as
      a result of being mindless) as long as the gongorinan is within 120 feet
      of the creature. The effect can be reversed by break enchantment (DC
      22-treat the gongorinan's Hit Dice as it caster level), but cannot be
      dispelled.

Description:
  - >-
    The gongorinans are the spawn of the nascent qlippoth lord Yamasoth,
    although one could be forgiven for thinking them of them less as offspring
    and more as parasites. A gongorinan's basic shape resembles that of an
    immense, stocky crab, save that they lack all of the features crabs have
    adapted for an aquatic life-gongorinans are terrestrial creatures. A typical
    gongorinan possesses no fewer than a dozen stalked eyes, and is capable of
    extending these eyes from the upper edges of its body just above its mouth
    to a length of nearly 3 feet, giving it extraordinary vision in all
    directions. A gongorinan's mouth is a complex tangle of sliding plates and
    toothy ridges that rasp and shriek against each other as it speaks and
    chews, but despite their frightening shapes, these mouthparts are ill-suited
    for making physical attacks; the gongorinan relies upon its arms for that.
    Each gongorinan has four of these, and each arm is a different, highly
    specialized appendage. The humanoid arm is used for fine manipulation or the
    wielding of weaponry, while the mantislike claw is used to shred flesh and
    create deep, bleeding wounds. The needle-covered tentacle is used to sting
    and inject a painful poison to stagger foes, while the pincer is used to
    snatch and hold victims close for oviposition.
  - >-
    A typical gongorinan stands about 6 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds. When at
    rest, a gongorinan retracts its limbs into its rock-encrusted body, allowing
    it to appear remarkably like nothing more than a large, misshapen boulder.
    Larger specimens known as elder gongorinans exist (and often possess
    additional and even more dangerous arms), but these are quite rare on the
    Material Plane save for in the depths of Hollow Mountain.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    All gongorinans carry within their bodies a brood of horrific egg masses,
    yet these eggs are not used for the propagation of their kind (that process
    is governed by a more traditional and yet more nightmarish method best left
    unspoken). Instead, these eggs carry within their stony shells a raw
    quintessence of the Abyss, infused with the ichor-seed of the gongorinans'
    lord, Yamasoth. Whereas most creatures are driven to breed and multiply, the
    gongorinans are instead driven to seek out humanoid hosts for their eggs.
    The implantation happens via the gongorinan's mouth and a hideous ovipositor
    that's not quite tongue and not quite toothed prolapsing throat, but
    something worse. Fortunately for most who might encounter a gongorinan, the
    process of oviposition leaves the horrid creature open to attack and cannot
    be performed quickly, yet to the lone adventurer caught and overwhelmed by a
    gongorinan, this is small comfort indeed.
  - >-
    Once an egg has been implanted, it takes many days to grow, and the
    gongorinan prefers to carry the unfortunate host off to restrain it in a
    hidden location. Victims are often cocooned in webs or left stranded in high
    cavern ledges far above the ground so that the egg can gestate. As it grows,
    the egg feeds on the victim's mind, absorbing the victim's intellect until
    it has reduced the host to a drooling wreck. At this point, the egg doesn't
    hatch so much as it merely merges with the host, effecting a horrific and
    permanent transformation into a monstrous form. The gongorinan can inf
    luence this ultimate form as it lays its egg. It typically chooses powerful
    creatures that are already found in the region, for these "young" are loyal
    to their parent and serve as loyal guardians or playthings. Victims retain
    no true portion of their previous personality, but those who have been
    rescued from this horrific fate via powerful magic do retain memories of
    their time as a transformed monstrosity. Many never quite recover from these
    ordeals, and often develop a peculiar form of madness in which they regard
    their monstrous life as having been their true life, and their true life as
    the curse. The most despondent of these victims eventually seek the promise
    of peace through suicide rather than endure the dreams of their life as a
    monster-dreams that carry within them a most horrible longing.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Gongorinans are an industrious and intelligent breed of qlippoth, and where
    they find themselves, they invariably form hive-like complexes to live in.
    These gongorinan "cities" are labyrinthine affairs with plenty of chambers
    for their transformed children to live in. In the Abyss, gongorinan hives
    can grow truly immense, with populations in the thousands, but even the
    Material Plane is no stranger to gongorinan hive cities. The largest of
    these hives are thought to be located deep beneath Hollow Mountain, where
    Runelord Alaznist lured the Polymorph Plague himself, Yamasoth, into
    dwelling for a time. While Yamasoth has long vacated the Darklands caverns
    under Hollow Mountain, they bear the name of his spawn- Gongorina-and his
    spawn dwell there still.
