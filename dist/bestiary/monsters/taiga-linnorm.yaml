SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a taiga linnorm can expel a
      60-foot cone of electrified vapor, dealing 21d8 points of electricity
      damage to all creatures struck (Reflex DC 30 for half). The vapor itself
      persists for 1d4 rounds, filling its cone-shaped area with electrified
      mist that deals 4d6 points of electricity damage (no save) to any creature
      that ends its turn in the mist. The mist does not hinder vision. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Death Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      Curse of Electrocution: save Will DC 29; effect the creature gains
      vulnerability to electricity.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 30; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 4d6
      electricity damage and 1d8 Dex drain; cure 3 consecutive saves.
  - name: Spines (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature that makes a melee attack against a taiga linnorm takes 1d6
      points of piercing damage per attack from the linnorm's spines. A melee
      weapon with reach provides protection from these spines.
Description:
  - >-
    A beast covered with hundreds of spines, the taiga linnorm is a terror to
    all those who venture through the arctic forests of the north. Taiga
    linnorms take down foes and prey first with their electrifying breath and
    finish their victims off with their devastating bite.
  - >-
    In winter, when light is sparse and the nights are long, it is easy for a
    taiga linnorm to blend in with the coniferous forests it dwells in, hiding
    among the trees and ambushing imprudent travelers or unwary adventurers
    setting up camp. A taiga linnorm often lies in wait for days- sometimes
    weeks-just for the opportunity to maim and devour unsuspecting victims. When
    this subtler tactic does not work, a taiga linnorm simply rampages through
    the woods in order to find nearby settlements to pillage, taking twisted
    delight in shocking the inhabitants before shredding them with its massive
    jaws or destructive forelimbs. In any event, taiga linnorms rarely venture
    far from their woodland territories save for short flights to attack
    outlying villages.
  - A taiga linnorm is 50 feet long and weighs just over 13,000 pounds.
