SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Jinxed (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a jynx can place a curse on a single creature within
      30 feet. A DC 14 Will save negates the effect. On a failed save, the
      target is permanently cursed. The victim of the curse takes a -2 penalty
      on all attack rolls, saving throws, and checks until the curse is removed.
      A creature can only be affected by a single jynx at one time. This is a
      curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Jynx are small whimsical, fun-loving forest fey thought to be an offshoot of
    the elven race. They live in small moss-covered caves within their forests,
    with such caves often being located near well-travelled roads and paths, but
    still well hidden from prying eyes. This location makes it much easier for
    the jynx to partake in one of their favorite pastimes-leading travelers
    astray. Jynx rarely try to harm the target of their pranks; they simply
    delight in sewing confusion and watching the target's reactions to such
    events. Those that despoil the forests on the other hand, are led astray and
    often led into jynx-placed traps that seek to maim or even kill such
    creatures.
  - >-
    Jynx have good relations with other forest-dwelling humanoids and creatures
    (elves, sprites, pixies, etc.) and can often be found in their midst. They
    are on good terms with neutral and good-aligned druids and rangers as well.
  - >-
    A typical jynx stands around 3 feet tall and weighs about 40 pounds. Skin
    color is usually tan and hair color varies wildly from the deepest blacks to
    the brightest blondes. Eyes are most often deep blue or dark green. A jynx's
    lifespan is about 300 years.
  - >-
    Jynx tend to avoid melee combat, preferring to assault their enemies with
    their spell-like abilities and shortbows.
