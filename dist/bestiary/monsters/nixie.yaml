SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Wild Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability works like the druid ability of the same name. The nixie's
      total includes a +8 racial bonus on wild empathy checks.
Description:
  - >-
    Nixies are guardians of ponds, rivers, lakes, and springs. They prefer
    dwelling in idyllic places, which they protect from the depredations of
    predators and careless humanoids. While this often involves confusing
    enemies and driving foes away, nixies are not afraid of spilling blood to
    protect their homes-though they prefer not to resort to such means unless
    completely necessary. Nixies are 4 feet tall and rarely weigh more than 45
    pounds.
  - >-
    Nixies avoid combat if possible, using charm person to lead humanoids away
    from their lairs. They sometimes use this ability
  - >-
    to enslave people to act as protectors or help with a task that is simply
    too big for them to deal with. They cast water breathing on charmed
    creatures helping with tasks below the surface. Nixies are reclusive and
    prefer to keep their presence hidden. They make lairs underwater, forming
    small communities if their numbers are great enough. Legends speak of a
    secret nixie kingdom at the bottom of a great lake, but no one has yet
    confirmed its location.
  - BOG NIXIES
  - >-
    In some lands, nixies are evil creatures who lead folk to drown in their
    waters, either by captivating their targets with song or by assuming the
    form of an animal or humanoid and tricking a hunter or explorer into
    dangerous waters. These evil nixies prefer dwelling in festering swamps or
    blighted fens, and are typically known as bog nixies. The fact that a bog
    nixie can grant minor wishes, ironically, only increases their opportunities
    for evil, as brave or foolish explorers deliberately seek them out.
  - >-
    A bog nixie is a neutral evil nixie with the advanced creature template who
    has the following additional powers. A bog nixie's CR is +2 higher than a
    normal nixie's.
  - >-
    Captivating Song (Su): This works like the harpy ability of the same name.
    The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - >-
    Change Shape (Su): This works as polymorph, and allows the bog nixie to
    assume the form of any Small or Medium aquatic animal or humanoid.
  - >-
    Minor Wish (Sp): Once per day, a bog nixie can create a magical effect in
    exchange for a gift or service from a humanoid. The power of this "wish" is
    no greater than what can be done with a 3rd-level spell.
