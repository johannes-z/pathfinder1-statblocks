Description_Visual: >-
  This frighteningly majestic creature spreads wide her rune-adorned wings.
  Molten iron weeps from her hooves, and her three tails are studded with barbs.
Group: Demon Lord

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cruel Shot (Ex)
    description: >-
      Nocticula is adept at making ranged attacks to strike cruel shots that
      deal significant and humiliating damage. She adds her Charisma bonus to
      all damage dealt by ranged weapons.
  - name: Domination (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Nocticula can crush a foe's will. The target must be
      visible to Nocticula and within 120 feet. It must succeed at a DC 43 Will
      save or fall instantly under Nocticula's influence as dominate monster (CL
      30th). If she uses domination against a humanoid creature, she may instead
      choose to use the ability as a swift action, and it functions as dominate
      person. As long as the target is under this effect, it gains a +4 profane
      bonus on all saving throws against targets other than Nocticula.
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      Nocticula's energy drain functions identically to that of a succubus
      (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 68), except that she drains 2 levels when she
      uses this ability against mythic creatures, or 1d6+4 levels against
      non-mythic creatures.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sting or hand crossbow-injury; save Fort DC 44; frequency 1/round for 6
      rounds; effect 1d4 Wisdom drain plus paralysis for 1 round. Anyone who
      fails two consecutive saves against this poison is permanently blinded.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Profane Ascension (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action while in an act of passion with a willing mortal,
      Nocticula may grant a profane ascension. The target's name appears in
      glowing Abyssal runes on Nocticula's wings, and a crimson mark manifests
      somewhere on the target's body. The target immediately gains a +6 profane
      bonus to any one ability score of its choice, a +4 profane bonus to any
      other ability score of its choice, and the see in darkness ability. A
      single creature may have only one profane ascension in effect at any one
      time. As long as the effect persists, Nocticula can communicate
      telepathically with the target across any distance and may use any of her
      spell-like abilities through the target, manifesting them as if the target
      were using them. A profane ascension may be removed by a miracle or wish.
      Nocticula can remove it as a free action, dealing 4d6 points of Charisma
      drain and imparting 1d10+10 permanent negative levels to the victim.
  - name: Seductive Presence (Su)
    description: >-
      Unlike most demon lords, Nocticula does not possess a frightful presence
      ability. Rather, she has a seductive presence that she can activate as a
      free action whenever she speaks or uses a spell-like ability. Anyone
      within 180 feet who fails a DC 43 Fortitude save loses any immunity to
      mind-affecting effects, charm effects, and compulsion effects, and becomes
      fascinated by Nocticula for 5d4 rounds. A creature affected by a
      mind-affecting effect while within this aura remains affected even after
      leaving Nocticula's seductive presence. Creatures that succeed at this
      saving throw are immune to this ability for 24 hours. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. Shadowkiss Nocticula's favored weapon is Shadowkiss, a +5
      unholy hand crossbow that magically creates ammunition as it fires. Once a
      target is damaged by a bolt fired from Shadowkiss, the hand crossbow gains
      the bane weapon special ability against that target's creature type on all
      further attacks. Shadowkiss may only have one bane effect in place at one
      time. Bolts fired from Shadowkiss gain the ghost touch ability (an effect
      not normally available to ranged weapons).
  - name: Swift Transformation (Ex)
    description: Nocticula can use her change shape ability as a free action.
Description:
  - >-
    Nocticula is the demon lord of assassins, darkness, and lust, and rules the
    Abyssal realm of the Midnight Isles, a vast archipelago formed around the
    murdered remnants of dozens of demon lords and other powerful foes. Having
    been the first succubus and then having ascended to become a demigoddess,
    Nocticula now sets her eyes at a greater prize-full divinity. Lamashtu is
    the only demon lord who has accomplished this task so far, but Nocticula
    aims to be the second. What kind of deity she might become is anyone's
    guess-some believe that Nocticula is secretly seeking redemption from her
    demonic nature. Others say these rumors were seeded by Nocticula herself as
    a grand lie to distract her enemies from her true goal of becoming an
    assassin and seducer of gods.
  - >-
    Nocticula is certainly mercurial in her personality and attitude. She may
    simply murder or enslave visitors to her realm, or she may welcome them with
    open arms-even those who one would think were her enemies. Only a fool
    accepts her invitation without suspicion, for what the queen of succubi
    wants may change dramatically from one moment to the next.
  - Nocticula's Cult
  - >-
    Nocticula is worshiped by assassins, the lustful, whores, shadow-using
    creatures, and of course succubi. These worshipers form relatively small
    cults, often akin to secret societies, that use brothels, nobility, or
    academies as a cover for their true purposes. A small number of heretics
    venerate her as well, not as a demigoddess of murder and lust but as one of
    outcasts, artists, and the glories of midnight. The fact that such heretical
    clerics are granted spells as surely as the rest of her worshipers has
    caused not a small amount of discontent among her faithful, which Nocticula
    seems to enjoy.
  - >-
    Nocticula's symbol is a multi-pointed crown wrapped with thorny vines. Her
    favored weapon is the hand crossbow. She grants access to the domains of
    Chaos, Charm, Darkness, and Evil, and to the subdomains of Demon, Loss,
    Lust, and Night.
