    description: >-
      A ghul's claws count as both cold iron and magic for the purpose of
      bypassing damage reduction. Genie-kin (Ex) For all race-related effects
      (such as a ranger's favored enemy), a ghul is considered a genie even
      though its type is undead.
Description:
  - >-
    Ghuls are undead jann whose eternal existence was twisted by fate and
    wrought through the displeasure of Ahriman, Lord of the Divs. As if the
    curse of undeath and ravenous hunger were not enough, these once-majestic
    creatures now bear donkey hooves as feet. Despite their horrific undead
    appearance, this feature shames them the most, and they hide their feet from
    view.
  - >-
    Ghuls, like ghouls and ghasts, haunt cemeteries and other places of the dead
    hoping to feed on corpses. They also hunt mourners and grave tenders, as
    they enjoy the taste of living prey as well as that of the dead. Selective
    in their diets, ghuls choose their victims by personality, believing
    innocence and youth taste more delicious than the barely palatable flesh of
    the bitter and old. Sometimes a ghul follows a funeral procession in hyena
    form, keeping a safe distance until the ceremony, whereupon it changes into
    its true form to attack and feast. Sorrow and despair taste as delicious as
    innocence to a ghul.
  - >-
    While not directly affected by sunlight, ghuls despise its presence and only
    move about during the day if forced to by necessity. They primarily hunt at
    night, sometimes straying far from their graveyard lairs and burial caves in
    search of fresh prey to sate their hunger.
  - >-
    The longer a ghul goes without feeding, the more ferocious and primal the
    creature becomes. A well-sated ghul organizes with others of its kind and
    lesser undead, tormenting nearby towns and settlements. A ghul involved with
    this level of organization often has a scattered set of lairs throughout the
    desert. These allow the ghul to strike far from its home lair and hide again
    without having to travel during the blistering daylight sun. When a ghul
    goes for too long without feeding, it becomes increasingly feral and
    violent-its statistics don't change, but it grows less concerned with
    fleeing combat, even when it is obviously outmatched.
  - Ghuls stand 6 feet tall and weigh 90 pounds.
