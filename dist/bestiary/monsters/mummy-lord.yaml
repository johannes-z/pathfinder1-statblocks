Description:
  - >-
    Mummification is a practice common to many cultures, although the use of
    magical techniques to imbue the departed with potent, undead vitality is
    less widespread. On rare occasions, if the deceased was a person of great
    rank and exceeding malice, he may undergo even more elaborate and expensive
    rituals granting him greater power in undeath, and he eventually rises from
    his tomb as a mummy lord. Retaining the powers and abilities he had in life,
    he becomes a creature consumed by the desire to dominate others and a
    seething envy for the living that drives him to acts of surpassing cruelty.
  - Creating a Mummy Lord
  - >-
    "Mummy Lord" is an acquired template that can be added to any living
    corporeal creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature) with at
    least 8 HD. The process of creating a mummy lord requires 50,000 gp worth of
    rare herbs, oils, and other mummification materials. The mummy lord retains
    all of the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as listed
    below.
  - 'CR: Same as the base creature +2.'
  - 'Alignment: Any evil.'
  - >-
    Type: The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate BAB, saves,
    or skill ranks.
  - 'Senses: A mummy lord gains darkvision 60 ft.'
  - >-
    Armor Class: A mummy lord has either a +1 natural armor bonus for every 2
    Hit Dice it possesses or the base creature's natural armor bonus, whichever
    is higher.
  - >-
    Hit Dice: Change the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived
    from class levels remain unchanged. As undead, mummy lords use their
    Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points.
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: A mummy lord gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/-,
    immunity to cold and electricity (in addition to those granted by its undead
    traits), and the following defensive ability.
  - >-
    Rejuvenation (Su): One day after a mummy lord is destroyed, the necromantic
    energies that created the abomination begin to rebuild its body. This
    process takes 1d10 days, and if the body is destroyed before that time
    passes, the process starts anew. After this time, the mummy lord awakens
    fully healed in its tomb. To prevent the mummy lord from returning, its
    remains must be targeted by consecrate, hallow, and then dispel evil, cast
    in consecutive rounds and in that order, before it can be permanently
    destroyed.
  - >-
    Attacks: The mummification process hardens the mummy lord's bones to a
    stone-like density, granting it a powerful slam attack if the base creature
    has no other natural attacks. This slam attack deals damage based on the
    mummy lord's size (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 302), treating the creature as if
    it were one size category larger. Those hit by a mummy lord's slam attack
    also run the risk of succumbing to insidious mummy rot (see Special
    Attacks).
  - >-
    Special Attacks: A mummy lord gains the following special attacks. Save DCs
    are equal to 10 + 1/2 the mummy lord's HD + the mummy lord's Charisma
    modifier unless otherwise noted.
  - >-
    Channel Rot (Su): A mummy lord can deliver its insidious mummy rot through
    melee weapons as well as through its slam attack and any natural attacks it
    possesses.
  - >-
    Great Despair Aura (Su): All creatures within a 30-foot radius that see a
    mummy lord must make a successful Will save or be paralyzed with fear for
    1d4 rounds, then shaken for the following 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the
    save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same
    mummy's great despair aura ability for 24 hours. This is a paralysis and
    mind-affecting fear affect.
  - >-
    Insidious Mummy Rot (Su): Curse and disease-slam; save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 HD +
    Cha modifier; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 2d4 Con and 2d4 Cha
    damage; cure -. Insidious mummy rot is both a curse and disease, and can be
    cured only by first removing the curse and then curing the disease. Even
    after the curse element of mummy rot is lifted, a creature suffering from it
    cannot recover naturally over time. Anyone casting a conjuration (healing)
    spell on the aff licted creature must succeed at a DC 20 caster level check,
    or the spell is wasted and the healing has no effect. Anyone who dies from
    insidious mummy rot turns to dust and cannot be raised by means other than
    resurrection or greater magic.
  - >-
    Sandstorm Wrath (Su): Three times per day as a standard action, a mummy lord
    can exhale a blast of superheated sand in a 40-foot cone. The blast deals
    2d8 points of fire and slashing damage for every 3 Hit Dice a mummy lord
    possesses. A successful Reflex save halves this damage, and creatures that
    fail this save are blinded for 2d4 rounds.
  - >-
    Undead Mastery (Su): As a standard action, a mummy lord can attempt to bend
    any undead creature within 50 feet to its will. The targeted undead must
    succeed at a Will save or fall under the mummy lord's control. An undead
    with an Intelligence score is allowed an additional save every day to break
    free of the mummy lord's control; for undead without an Intelligence score,
    the control is permanent. A creature that succeeds at its Will save cannot
    be affected again by the same mummy lord's undead mastery for 24 hours. A
    mummy lord can control 6 Hit Dice of undead creatures for every Hit Die it
    has. If the mummy lord exceeds this limit, the excess undead from earlier
    uses of the ability become uncontrolled, as animate dead.
  - >-
    Ability Scores: Str +8, Cha +6. As an undead creature, a mummy lord has no
    Constitution score.
  - >-
    Skills: A mummy lord gains a +8 racial bonus to Intimidate, Sense Motive,
    and Stealth checks. A mummy lord always treats Climb, Disguise, Fly,
    Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense
    Motive, Spellcraft, and Stealth as class skills. Otherwise, its skills are
    the same as the base creature.
