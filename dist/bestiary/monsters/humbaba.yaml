SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Prismatic Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action once per day, a humbaba can activate its prismatic aura.
      Doing so causes brilliant light to radiate from the humbaba to a radius of
      30 feet. Each round at the start of the humbaba's turn, roll 1d8 and
      consult the table of prismatic spray effects on page 325 of the Core
      Rulebook to determine the color and effect of the light (reroll results of
      8). If a creature begins its turn in the prismatic aura's area, it must
      make the appropriate saving throw (DC 26) against that effect. Once
      activated, a humbaba's prismatic aura lasts for 7 rounds. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Humbabas are monstrous humanoids of tremendous size and power that prowl the
    forgotten places of the world. Although a humbaba has the body of a
    powerful, muscular human, its face is a twisted mockery that seems more
    leonine than human. They often braid portions of their manes or otherwise
    decorate them with skulls and weapons, and prefer to wear half-plate armor
    and fight with longswords.
  - >-
    The first humbabas were once the favored minions of the demon lord Pazuzu.
    In those days, humbabas had magnificent birdlike wings. But when the
    mightiest of the humbabas dared to attack Pazuzu in an ill-conceived attempt
    to claim the demon lord's throne, Pazuzu punished the entire humbaba race by
    stripping them of their wings and casting them into the Material Plane.
    There they now dwell, forever denied the skies and cursed to live lonely
    lives, incapable of forming even the barest of friendships or alliances with
    others of their kind.
