Source: Hell Unleashed
IsTemplate: 0
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      Unlike a standard imp, Benabak's change shape ability allows him to take
      the form of a bat instead of a boar or giant spider.
  - name: Infernal Jinx (Su)
    description: >-
      Benabak has developed the ability to curse other creatures with ill luck.
      As a standard action, he can jinx a creature within 30 feet who fails a DC
      13 Will save. A jinxed creature takes a -2 penalty on its next d20 roll.
      The effects of the jinx wear off after 1 minute. A creature that succeeds
      on the saving throw is immune to Benabak's infernal jinx for 24 hours. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sting-injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2
      Dex; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based, and includes a +2
      racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Over the decades since his emancipation, more than a few thugs have
    attempted to divest Benabak of his hard-earned winnings. The imp's
    elusiveness, arcane defenses, and mobility often best those who attempt to
    seize his hoard by force. To protect his tower home, Benabak hung a trio of
    zombie soldiers upside down from a pair of beams on the third floor. He used
    a wand of command undead that he won from a down-on-her-luck arcanist to
    procure the zombies, who were the unfortunate victims of an ill-fated
    training exercise against a devil. The zombies gnash their teeth, and lash
    out at any living creatures in reach, serving as warnings to potential
    pilferers, as well as last-ditch security. Whenever would-be thieves
    attempts to steal the imp's treasures, Benabak kills them and strings their
    bodies up with the zombies. Two such corpses currently hang among the
    undead. Benabak hopes to one day gain the resources to raise these corpses
    as zombies as well.
  - >-
    Those who wish to end Benabak's tiny reign of corruption may do best to
    outwit him by beating the imp at his own game.
Gear: >-
  wand of command undead (7 charges); Other Gear dagger, darts (20) with imp
  poison
