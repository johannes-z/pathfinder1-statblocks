Description_Visual: >-
  This lumbering giant has a strange, vacant expression, as well as a large
  glowing rune carved into its flesh.
Source: The Moonscar
IsTemplate: '1'
Description:
  - >-
    The ageless monuments and awesome cities of Thassilon rose upon the backs of
    countless slaves, but none bore the sin-poisoned civilization's burden more
    than the giants. Able to perform the work of dozens of human slaves,
    Thassilon's titanic servants-hill giants, stone giants, taiga giants, and
    others-crafted marvels nigh unparalleled in any era before or since, and
    shaped the face of what is now modern Varisia. Yet as viciously as the
    runelords worked their slaves and for all they demanded, the giant-crafted
    marvels were not enough. And thus, working the corrupt rune magic that was
    theirs alone, the runelords manufactured a damning curse and laid it over
    their most tireless and effective workers, and in so doing created a new
    breed of servant: the runeslave.
  - >-
    Numerous severe-looking runes spark and flicker upon a runeslave's body,
    seemingly seared into the creature's flesh. One of the runes is larger and
    more prominent than the others-this is always one of the runes of
    Thassilonian magic. Although a runeslave's mind is dulled, its muscles bulge
    grotesquely, as if barely contained beneath a thin layer of skin, and such
    behemoths move with unnatural agility for creatures of their ponderous size.
  - >-
    Note that while the runeslave template does make a giant more powerful (and
    thus increases its CR), few, if any giants would seek to gain a runeslave's
    powers. Despite the advantages the runeslave gains, what it loses in free
    will and longevity typically vastly outweigh the benefits. In combat, a
    runeslave is deadly and terrifying, but in life, the condition is rightly
    feared among giants as a devastating and debilitating curse.
  - Creating a Runeslave
  - >-
    "Runeslave" is an acquired template that can be added to any giant (referred
    to hereafter as the base creature). A runeslave uses all the base creature's
    statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
  - 'CR: Same as the base creature +1.'
  - >-
    DEFENSIVE ABILITIES: A runeslave becomes immune to fear effects, exhaustion,
    and fatigue. In addition, all runeslaves gain the following additional
    defensive ability.
  - >-
    Resist Pain (Ex): Runeslaves can continue to function even after taking
    great punishment. They are immune to nonlethal damage. Against effects that
    inf lict pain (such as a symbol of pain spell), a runeslave gains a +4 bonus
    on all saving throws.
  - 'WEAKNESSES: Runeslaves gain the following weakness.'
  - >-
    Arcane Decay (Su): The symbols etched upon a runeslave's body put great
    stress on its physical form, choking its mind and ultimately killing the
    giant in time. Each runeslave has a predominant Thassilonian rune associated
    with one school of magic inscribed on its body. Traditionally, this rune is
    of a school of magic directly opposed to the runelord the runeslave serves-
    all of the runeslaves encountered in this adventure bear the sign of wrath
    upon their bodies as a sort of brand of shame. The slow decay of a
    runeslave's mental faculties manifests as a gradual loss of life and sanity,
    represented by the accumulation of rune-shaped scars all over the body. The
    disease has no additional physical or mental effect until these magical
    runescars completely overwhelm their host, at which point the accumulated
    pain the giant has endured since becoming a runeslave is released in a fatal
    surge of unleashed suffering. All runeslaves are "infected" with this
    disease. Only limited wish, miracle, or wish can prevent or cure arcane
    decay, but in so doing removes the entire template, reverting the runeslave
    back to the base creature. Multiple successful Fortitude saves only delay
    the decay and do not cure the creature of the disease.
  - >-
    Arcane Decay: Inherited-non-contagious; save Fortitude DC 15; frequency
    1/week; effect gain one runescar; cure none (but see above). When a
    runeslave's number of runescars equals its Hit Dice, it dies.
  - >-
    SPEED: A runeslave's base land speed is 20 feet faster than the base
    creature's. Other forms of movement, such as flying or swim speeds, are
    unaffected.
  - 'SPECIAL ATTACKS: A runeslave gains the following special attack.'
  - >-
    Arcane Surge (Su): Once per day as a swift action, a runeslave can gain the
    benefits of the spell haste for 6 rounds. Using this ability forces the
    giant to make an additional Fortitude save against arcane decay, even if it
    has already made its weekly save to resist the disease.
  - >-
    ABILITIES: Change from the base creature as follows: Str +4, Dex +2, Int -2,
    Wis -2, Cha -2.
  - 'FEATS: Runeslaves gain Diehard and Toughness as bonus feats.'
  - The Runeslave Curse
  - >-
    As the act of turning their giant servants into runeslaves swept across
    Thassilon, each of the seven runelords came to employ the corruptive magic
    in various ways. While in most of the runelords' holdings the giants merely
    continued to serve as expendable labor, in Bakrakhan, Runelord Alaznist
    incorporated runeslaves into her vast armies, using them as living siege
    engines. In Cyrusian, the domain of Pride, Runelord Xanderghul used the
    magic as a punishment upon any slave who garnered his fickle ire.
  - >-
    While the magic used to create runeslaves resided almost exclusively in the
    hands of the runelords, the number of giant slaves they deemed would benefit
    from this ultimately fatal "improvement" far exceeded the rulers' ability to
    transform. Thus, a number of different methods of creating runeslaves were
    created, each originating in a separate domain but eventually spreading
    throughout the empire.
  - >-
    ANCIENT RITE: In the Grand Sybaritum of Xin- Haruka, Runelord Krune grew
    weary of cursing filthy giant after filthy giant, and so devised a method to
    transform hundreds of his slaves at a time. Summoning whole legions of his
    giants before him, Krune called down the might of the rune goddess Lissala
    and cursed his slaves en masse, sending countless faithful slaves to their
    doom.
  - >-
    MINDERHAL'S CURSE: Minderhal's worship was never more prevalent than during
    the height of the Thassilonian empire, and as such, fear of his displeasure
    was a motivating force among the giants of that era. Legend held that
    Minderhal himself was involved in the creation of the first runeslaves, and
    that in a fit of anger at his giant worshipers, he granted humans the
    secrets of creating runeslaves. Regardless of this legend's veracity, there
    have been several cases of particularly blasphemous giants spontaneously
    transforming into runeslaves, supposedly as punishment from their god.
  - >-
    POISONING: In Edasseril, the domain of envy, the alchemists of Runelord
    Belimarius's vile and sprawling laboratories discovered a way to turn arcane
    decay into a toxin, allowing the disease to be delivered via poison. The
    poisoners never did find a way to cure the crippling madness caused by the
    poison-the toxin's high cost and the frustrating requirement of having to
    cure the giant's Wisdom drain before it could be put to work kept this
    poison from seeing greater use.
  - >-
    Runeslave Poison: Poison-ingested; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 6
    rounds; effect confusion for 1 round and 1d4 Wisdom drain (if this results
    in the giant's Wisdom being drained to 0, the giant immediately transforms
    into a runeslave); cure 3 consecutive saves; cost 10,000 gp.
  - >-
    RUNESLAVE CAULDRON: Brought forth from Gastash, the domain of gluttony,
    these massive cauldrons were large enough to fit an adult stone giant and
    infused with necromantic energies. Any giant placed in a cauldron and then
    slain is immediately resurrected as a runeslave-see page 424 for further
    details on these sadistic magic items.
