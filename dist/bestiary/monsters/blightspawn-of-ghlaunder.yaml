      Sting-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4
      Wisdom damage and confusion for 1 round; cure 2 saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Stagnation Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A blightspawn's stagnation aura causes lethargy and torpor in those who
      approach it, sapping energy and speed. When a creature comes within 20
      feet of a blightspawn, it must make a DC 16 Will save to avoid being
      affected as per the spell slow, for as long as the creature remains within
      the blightspawn's aura and for an additional 1d3 rounds after leaving it.
      Once a creature successfully saves against the aura, it is immune to that
      particular blightspawn's aura for 24 hours; otherwise, re-entering the
      aura forces a creature to save again. In addition, this aura fouls liquids
      of all types within the area. A creature that drinks anything in a
      blightspawn's aura (including potions and alchemical elixirs) must make a
      DC 14 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d3 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The blightspawn of Ghlaunder are found most often in places where the
    Gossamer King's cult is strong, for these creatures must gestate in the body
    of one of the parasite god's true believers. To the faithful of Ghlaunder,
    being host to an immature blightspawn is a great honor, for when the monster
    bursts from the body of its host, the host's consciousness lives on in some
    way in the blightspawn's mind, almost as if the host had reincarnated into
    the monster. That cultists who die giving hideous birth to a blightspawn
    cannot be resurrected lends a bit of weight to this notion, even if the
    blightspawn themselves have nothing to say on the topic. A cultist carrying
    an immature blightspawn functions normally in all ways until the creature
    emerges (typically upon the cultist's death, or at the culmination of
    certain vile rituals)-except that until then, the cultist can pass on new
    blightspawn to his or her children. A blightspawn's gestation can last for
    decades, and in cases in which a child is separated from infected parents,
    the child might live her entire life without knowing the truth of what
    awaits her upon death. When a blightspawn emerges from its host, it is
    immediately fully grown, although its gore-wet wings cannot be used for
    flight for 1d4 rounds after emerging.
