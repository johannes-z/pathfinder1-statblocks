Description_Visual: >-
  Dressed in graveyard rags, this pitiful creature cries out like a sick child.
  An oversized, bestial head perches atop its spindly, child-sized body, and its
  eyes are nothing but sunken pools of shadow with no trace of life in them. A
  cloying mist wreathes its frail form, accompanied by the stench of death and
  disease.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      A child slain by a drekavac's disease has a 1-in- 6 chance of rising as
      another drekavac 3 days after death. The new drekavac is not in any way
      controlled by its maker, and is immediately capable of exercising its full
      powers, including creating spawn of its own. It does not possess any of
      the abilities it had in life.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Drekavacs are spirits of disease and contagion. While most drekavacs carry
      bubonic plague, drekavacs who died from other afflictions may carry those
      diseases instead. Any illness caused by a drekavac must be potentially
      fatal. Other diseases commonly carried include demon fever, filth fever,
      and slimy doom. If a drekavac is reduced to 0 hit points (from weapons or
      other sources, including channeled energy), all of the diseases it caused
      are cured, although the victims must recover from any effects normally,
      and slain victims are not restored. Bubonic plague: Touch-injury; save
      Fort DC 15; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage, 1 Cha
      damage, victim is fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Diseased Shadow (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature touched by a drekavac's shadow is also affected by the
      creature's disease ability. If there is a question about which way the
      drekavac's shadow falls, roll 1d8 to determine a random square around the
      creature. A character with a light source cannot be touched by the
      drekavac's shadow, but the light causes the shadow to fall directly
      opposite the character (unless there is another light source there as
      well). A drekavac can deliberately touch a creature with its shadow as a
      standard action by making a successful touch attack. A target missed by
      the drekavac's chilling grasp attack must make a DC 15 Reflex save to
      avoid being touched by the creature's shadow as well. This save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Sunlight Aversion (Ex)
    description: >-
      Drekavacs hate natural sunlight and immediately flee from it. A drekavac
      caught in natural sunlight is staggered.
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Animals, wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of a
      drekavac at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer
      than that and panic if forced to do so unless a master succeeds at a DC 25
      Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. Panicked animals remain so as
      long as they are within 30 feet of the drekavac.
  - name: Vulnerability to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A remove curse or remove disease spell cast directly upon a drekavac (DC
      equal to the drekavac's disease ability) immediately destroys the
      creature, allowing the afflicted soul to move on. Destroying a drekavac
      with remove curse or remove disease does not cure any of the creature's
      diseases.
  - name: Vulnerability to Salt (Ex)
    description: >-
      Drekavacs are vulnerable to salt that has been consecrated in the same
      fashion as holy water, and cannot cross an unbroken line of blessed salt.
      A handful of blessed salt thrown at a drekavac inflicts the same damage as
      a flask of holy water (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 160).
Description:
  - >-
    Drekavacs are the undead remains of children who perished from disease,
    particularly in plague-ridden areas where many such deaths occurred in a
    short period of time. Able to become as insubstantial as the mist rising
    from a graveyard on a cold, dark night, drekavacs are carriers of disease,
    seeking to infect the living with the afflictions that slew them. According
    to some stories, drekavacs only result from young plague victims who remain
    unburied or died bereft of the proper funeral rites; performing those rites
    may allow their spirits to rest and no longer haunt the world of the living.
  - >-
    Ecology Drekavacs typically haunt desolate places, from windswept plains and
    mountains to dark forests and abandoned homes or villages. They may move
    among inhabited areas in gaseous form, but are typically warded off by
    bright lights and the sounds and sights of life. They are always encountered
    indoors or at night, preferring dark, cloudy or foggy nights, ideally during
    the waning moon. Drekavacs are usually encountered during the gloomy, cold
    winter months rather than in the spring or summer.
  - >-
    Rural clerics and adepts must sometimes deal with one or more drekavacs
    seeking to spread disease in their communities. Their favored targets are
    children, some of whom can also become drekavacs 3 days after death unless
    their bodies are burned and the ashes scattered.
  - >-
    The work of drekavacs in a community can sometimes lead to hysterical
    accusations by grief-stricken parents and families, stirring up resentment
    and violence toward outsiders or anyone suspected of involvement with
    unnatural forces.
  - >-
    It is customary in some rural areas to surround a child's crib with a ring
    of blessed salt to keep evil influences at bay, including drekavacs, who
    cannot cross an unbroken line of salt. However, drekavacs can convince
    others to break the line of salt for them.
  - >-
    Habitat & Society Drekavacs are lonesome, bitter, and pitiful creatures,
    often crying when they appear, mourning their lost lives. Some folk mistake
    them for living children, lost or starving, although the creatures are not
    very effective liars. Still, a dim night and a half-seen form huddled and
    sobbing pitifully are often enough to trick someone into approaching close
    enough to become victim of the drekavac's chilling grasp.
  - >-
    Once they have inflicted their plagues upon victims, drekavacs quickly lose
    interest and move on, although they may follow a victim, begging for aid and
    attention, behaving as if they were still living victims of disease rather
    than its agents. They rarely kill victims outright, preferring instead to
    inflict long and lingering deaths through disease. Drekavacs threatened with
    salt, magic, or silver weapons become vicious, attacking opponents like
    snarling dogs until they are dead or the creatures are driven off.
  - >-
    Drekavacs sometimes band together in small packs, particularly in places
    where epidemics or plagues have swept through a population, either recently
    or long ago, but they have no real organization beyond seeking out new
    victims to infect. Drekavacs are intelligent and aware, able to converse in
    Common, or whatever languages they knew in life. This means some drekavacs
    are only able to communicate in largely dead or forgotten languages. They
    are childlike in their understanding and largely incapable of being reasoned
    with, but deft use of Bluff or Diplomacy and a playful or parental tone may
    keep a drekavac at bay, at least temporarily.
