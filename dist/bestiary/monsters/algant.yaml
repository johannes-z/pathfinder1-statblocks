SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Engulf (Ex)
    description: >-
      An algant can simply engulf Huge or smaller creatures in its path as a
      standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during the round in which it
      engulfs. The algant merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as
      many as it can cover. Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against
      the creature, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw.
      Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a DC 22 Reflex
      save to avoid being engulfed-in a success, they are pushed back or aside
      (opponent's choice) as the creature moves forward. Engulfed creatures are
      subject to an automatic slam attack each round, gain the pinned condition,
      are in danger of drowning, and are trapped within the algant's body until
      they are no longer pinned. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Animate Plants (Sp)
    description: >-
      A plant guardian can animate any plants of the same type within 180 feet
      at will, controlling up to two such plants at a time. It takes 1 full
      round for the plant to uproot itself, after which it moves at a speed of
      10 feet and fights as a plant of the same type as the one animating it
      (exceptions are noted in each entry below), gaining the plant guardian's
      vulnerability to fire. If the plant guardian that animated it terminates
      the animation, moves out of range, or is incapacitated, the plant
      immediately takes root wherever it is and returns to its normal state.
  - name: Double Damage against Objects (Ex)
    description: >-
      A plant guardian or animated tree that makes a full attack against an
      object or structure deals double damage.
  - name: Plantspeech (Ex)
    description: >-
      A plant guardian has the ability to converse with plants as if subject to
      a continual speak with plants spell, and most plants greet them with an
      attitude of friendly or helpful.
Description:
  - >-
    The algants are the plant guardians of the water. An algant resembles a
    large mass of algae and dwells in freshwater.
