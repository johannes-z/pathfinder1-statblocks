Description:
  - >-
    The interrogators and inquisitors of devilkind, bone devils delight in
    torturing those weaker than themselves-mortals, souls, and other devils
    alike. Born of ancient heresies mired amid the Styx-fed swamps of Stygia,
    Hell's fifth layer, bone devils-also known as osyluths-enforce infernal
    order and the will of the archdevils.
  - >-
    Powerful fiends favor these terrifying sadists for their unwavering devotion
    to Hell's laws and the commands of their masters, as osyluths eagerly report
    the disobedience of other devils-regardless of standing-and take to the
    craft of torture like morbid artists. Diabolists risk much to bargain with
    them, as bone devils glean many infernal secrets amid their nightmarish
    calcified torture hives.
  - >-
    These devils especially delight in journeying to the mortal plane, as their
    cruel talents and service to evil spellcasters often mean gaining much
    valuable information, which they might hold in their perfect memories for
    centuries before reporting back to their diabolical masters.
  - >-
    In battle, an osyluth uses quickened invisibility after each attack to
    confuse foes. Many osyluths carry twisted and eerie bone weapons, but these
    tools are more for torture and intimidation than actual combat.
  - >-
    Osyluths tower over lesser devils at 9 feet tall-though their tails and
    fearsome but useless wings make them appear much larger-and weigh upward of
    400 pounds.
