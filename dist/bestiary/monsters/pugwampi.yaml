Description:
  - >-
    Mean, dog-faced, and cowardly, pugwampis are loved by no one-not even other
    gremlins. These gremlins take disproportionate amounts of enjoyment from the
    accidents and missteps of other creatures, often going to great lengths to
    manufacture the perfect deadfalls or stumbling blocks. They then wait
    nearby, both to laugh at the inevitable mishaps and to make sure their
    personal unluckiness is passed off on their victims.
  - >-
    Pugwampis live in caves or ruined buildings, occasionally venturing forth to
    find victims upon which to inf lict their sick senses of humor. Their
    "jokes" tend to involve spikes and excrement, or sometimes pits full of
    spiders or campsites that flood with swamp water.
  - Certainly only the pugwampis consider their jokes funny.
  - >-
    As all pugwampis are somewhat deaf, when not trying to be stealthy, they
    tend to scream and yell loudly so they can hear themselves and each other.
  - >-
    At some point in the distant past, pugwampis became enamored of gnolls,
    seeing in the beast-men a kindred form and thus aspiring to the height and
    deadly prowess of the savage warriors, whom they honor as gods. Gnolls, for
    their part, hate pugwampis even more than other creatures, mostly because of
    the gremlins' weakness and sickening fawning, though they sometimes keep the
    gremlins around just to torment them.
