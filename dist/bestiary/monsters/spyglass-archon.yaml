  The movements of this black-skinned humanoid are unnaturally quiet, clearly
  belonging to one used to slinking unseen and unheard through dark places. Ebon
  wings and a matching mask complete this figure's stealthy appearance.

      Three times per day, a spyglass archon can concentrate its attention as a
      swift action. For a number of rounds equal to its Hit Dice (4 for most
      spyglass archons), the range of the spyglass archon's darkvision is
      doubled, it gains a +6 bonus on Perception checks, and it gains blindsense
      out to a range of 15 feet.
Description:
  - >-
    Spyglass archons act as spies in the interests of Heaven. Though as lawful
    as any of their kin, spyglass archons use guile and stealth to uncover
    evil's plans and bring reports back to Heaven. Unlike hound archons, who act
    more as military scouts and sentinels, spyglass archons infiltrate enemy
    strongholds and observe agents of evil from scarcely an arm's-breadth away.
  - >-
    Spyglass archons believe in law as strongly as they do in good, and are
    careful to act lawfully in their search for information. In places where law
    forbids a spyglass archon from entering a building and eavesdropping, it may
    hide in the shadows of public areas or conceal itself near windows to watch
    for evidence of evildoing. Once an archon has sufficient information to
    report, it returns to Heaven, where it shares its findings with its
    superiors.
  - >-
    Since their tasks require discretion, spyglass archons train in multiple
    discreet fighting styles, and are as capable as any rogue of laying a foe
    low before she even notices the archon's presence. Specialized spell-like
    abilities aid the sleuths in this endeavor, and they are not above shrouding
    an enemy in magical darkness before descending upon her.
  - >-
    Souls that become spyglass archons are solitary by nature, so they have few
    qualms about the isolation entailed by work. Most of their missions require
    intense concentration and skill, and are most easily undertaken by a single
    individual, but 2 spyglass archons might work together on extremely
    difficult, multipart missions.
  - Spyglass archons are just over 5 feet tall and weigh almost 120 pounds.
