SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Crushing Blow (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a nephilim makes a successful critical hit with a melee attack, the
      target must make a DC 22 Fortitude save or take an additional 3d6 points
      of nonlethal damage and be staggered for 1 round. The save DC is
      Strength-based.
  - name: Mortal Challenge (Su)
    description: >-
      When a nephilim spends a standard action to roar a battle challenge, all
      humanoids and monstrous humanoids within 100 feet of the nephilim must
      make a DC 18 Will save to avoid becoming frightened for 5d6 rounds. On a
      successful save, the creatures only become shaken for that time. Creatures
      with more HD than the nephilim become shaken if they fail their save, and
      suffer no effect if they succeed. A creature that succeeds at the save is
      immune to that nephilim's mortal challenge for 24 hours. This is a
      mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Soul of Sorrow (Ex)
    description: >-
      A nephilim gains a +2 bonus on Will saves against fear effects and any
      effect that causes sorrow.
Description:
  - >-
    The nephilim are the offspring of demigods who bred with humans. This
    joining resulted in a race of giant-sized beings possessed of a shard of
    divine power and the mortal consciousness of humans. A nephilim stands 11
    feet tall and weighs 1,100 pounds. Its divine heritage grants it a lifespan
    of almost 600 years.
  - >-
    Nephilim are a nomadic, secretive race. This isolationism has only
    heightened the wild tales surrounding them, making it even harder for other
    races to trust them. While the ancient animosity humans once had against
    them has been largely forgotten, zealots occasionally try to mount pogroms
    and crusades to wipe the nephilim out forever. The nephilim have proven
    strikingly resistant to these efforts.
