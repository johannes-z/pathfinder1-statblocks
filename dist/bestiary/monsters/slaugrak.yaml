SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Corrupting Bite (Su)
    description: >-
      A slaugrak's caustic saliva is infused with the corrupting power of the
      Abyss. Any living creature that takes acid damage from a slaugrak's bite
      must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 2 points of Constitution
      bleed damage as its blood boils and its internal organs liquefy. Creatures
      without a discernible anatomy (blood and internal organs) are immune to
      the Constitution bleed. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Vicious Jaws (Ex)
    description: A slaugrak's bite attack threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.
Description:
  - >-
    The taint of demonkind has long corrupted the troglodyte bloodline. Each
    generation a few mutant creatures marked with the taint of the Abyss are
    born, and fiendish deformities and stillbirths reeking of brimstone are all
    too common. The rapacious slaugrak is one of these fiendish mutants.
  - >-
    A slaugrak is born with an unnatural and incessant hunger for living flesh.
    Young slaugraks grow at an unnatural rate, reaching full and awful maturity
    in just 2 weeks. From birth, a slaugrak is little more than a walking
    collection of fangs and claws with no thought other than to slay and eat.
  - >-
    Slaugraks are sterile and solitary, holding no special love for troglodytes.
    A well-fed captive slaugrak might form an affectionate bond with its
    troglodyte keeper, but this affection merely makes the slaugrak more likely
    to eat its keeper last.
  - A typical slaugrak stands 12 to 14 feet tall and weighs 6,000 pounds.
