SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Devastating Blow (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Xoveron can bring all four of his claws to bear upon
      a single target. It this attack hits, he deals 8d8+68 points of
      bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a successful
      DC 43 Fortitude save or be knocked prone and staggered for 1d4 rounds. If
      the target is an object, the attack ignores all hardness possessed by the
      object. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Feed (Su)
    description: >-
      Xoveron can consume the corpse of a Large or smaller creature that has
      been dead no longer than a day as a full-round action. Doing so destroys
      the creature's body and leaves its gear scattered on the ground. All armor
      and gear worn in the body slot must make a successful DC 43 Fortitude save
      to avoid becoming broken by this swift and violent consumption. When
      Xoveron feeds on a creature, he immediately learns all of that creature's
      memories and knowledge. In addition, he gains the effects of a heal spell
      and a haste spell (both at CL 27th). The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sting-injury; save Fort DC 40; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6
      Dexterity drain; cure 3 consecutive saves. If a creature's Dexterity is
      drained to 0, the creature is immediately petrified. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Roar (Su)
    description: >-
      Xoveron can unleash a devastating roar as a standard action once per hour.
      When he roars, all creatures and unattended objects within 60 feet take
      30d10 points of sonic damage and become stunned for 1d6 rounds. Xoveron
      does not take this damage, and he can exclude any number of creatures or
      objects from this effect as he wills. A successful DC 40 Reflex save
      halves the damage and negates the stun effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Shatter Petrification (Su)
    description: >-
      Xoveron can strike a petrified creature with any one of his natural weapon
      attacks to cause it to shatter. The petrified creature can resist this
      with a successful DC 43 Fortitude save. If the creature fails to resist,
      the blow smashes it apart into an explosion of razor sharp stone
      fragments. Any creature within 10 feet of a shattering petrified creature
      takes 10d6 points of piercing and slashing damage from these flying
      fragments of once-living flesh (Reflex DC 43 half). Xoveron is never
      damaged by these flying shards of stone. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Shockwave (Su)
    description: >-
      When Xoveron makes a charge attack while flying and lands at the end of
      the charge, the force of his landing creates a powerful shockwave. All
      creatures standing on the ground within 30 feet of Xoveron when he lands
      at the end of a charge attack must make a successful DC 40 Reflex save to
      avoid being knocked prone by the force of the impact. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Xoveron, the Horned Prince, is the demon lord of gargoyles, gluttony, and
    ruins. It is said that he can look out through the eyes of all stone
    gargoyles perched on roofs throughout the world, watching and waiting for
    cities to fall, that he might visit and feed on those left behind. Xoveron
    himself towers at a height of 25 feet, with a wingspan of just over 50 feet.
    When the Horned Prince moves, the sound of stone grinding on stone can be
    heard, as if the demon lord himself were composed not of flesh but of some
    unholy stone come to demonic life.
  - >-
    Xoveron is often accompanied by numerous vrolikai and ulkreth demons (see
    page 82). Gargoyles of tremendous size often serve at the Horned Prince's
    whim, as do monsters with a reputation for hunger and gluttony, such as
    purple worms or man-eating animals. His realm on the Abyss is an immense,
    ruined city called Ghahazi, said to have been constructed over the eons by
    the Horned Prince, who plucked decaying districts and crumbling structures
    from dead cities across countless worlds.
  - Xoveron's Cult
  - >-
    Xoveron is traditionally worshiped by gargoyles, although as the Age of Lost
    Omens has drawn on, his worship among humanoids has been increasing
    steadily, particularly among bandits, brigands, gluttons, and those who
    dwell in blasted, apocalyptic regions such as the Worldwound and the Sodden
    Lands. In such regions, the landscapes of ruined cities and devastated
    skylines appeal to those who worship the Horned Prince; his cultists raise
    temples to their demonic patron there in caverns, on ruined rooftops, or
    within the skeletal frames of partially collapsed cathedrals to gods whose
    faith and worship alike have moved on. Defenestration is far and away the
    favored method of sacrifice for his cult.
  - >-
    In addition to gargoyles, the cult is particularly fond of and even
    subservient to the nabasu demons. Often, a cult of Xoveron seeks out a newly
    "born" nabasu and offers itself to the demon. Usually this means the demon
    takes a few of the cultists to feed on and demands the survivors seek out
    more victims on a regular basis, but in some cases the ravenous newborn
    nabasu simply consumes the entire cult. To the fanatic of Xoveron, though,
    such a fate is worth dying for.
  - >-
    Xoveron's unholy symbol is a five-horned gray gargoyle skull that's missing
    its lower jaw. His favored weapon is the ranseur. He grants access to the
    domains of Chaos, Earth, Evil, and Strength, and to the subdomains of Caves,
    Demon, Entropy, and Ferocity. Entropy is a subdomain of Chaos, and is
    detailed on page 15 of Pathfinder Player Companion: Blood of Fiends.
