Description_Visual: >-
  This nightmare shambles along the ground on eight muscular tentacles that
  leave behind a clear viscous residue stinking of putrefaction. Its amphibian
  skin is moist, green-black, and covered in warts and protuberances. On its
  back, dozens of fist-sized pustules shift and pulsate with nauseating
  vitality, like sentient oily bubbles threatening to burst.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bogwid Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 16, onset 1 day, frequency 1/day,
      effect 1d2 Str damage and shaken, cure 2 consecutive saves. The DC save is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Nauseating Touch (Ex)
    description: >-
      The bogwid's touch is disgusting. Creatures hit by its slam attack must
      succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Ravenous Young (Ex)
    description: >-
      Each round, a bogwid can launch one of the offspring clinging to its back
      at a target within 10 feet as a ranged touch attack. On a successful hit,
      the offspring attaches itself to the target and begins draining blood,
      automatically dealing 1d2 points of bleed damage each round (and possibly
      infecting the target with bogwid fever). As a full-round action, a
      creature can attempt to remove one of these offspring, either by
      bludgeoning it with a fist or pulling it off. Either way, removing an
      offspring kills the larval creature. Someone other than the target the
      offspring is attached to can also perform this action. Anyone using a
      weapon to kill or remove an attached offspring deals half of the damage to
      the creature to which the offspring is attached. A bogwid can launch up to
      10 offspring per day before it must rest and gestate more larval young.
  - name: Revolting Aura (Ex)
    description: >-
      The bogwid is both visually and odoriferously revolting. Any creature
      within 10 feet of a bogwid must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be
      sickened. This effect persists as long as the creature is within the aura
      and for 2 rounds thereafter. A creature that successfully saves is not
      subject to the same bogwid's revolting aura for 24 hours. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Aberrant beasts of ancient origin, bogwids are loathsome, skulking predators
    that inhabit the gloomy swamps and damp subterranean places of the world.
    Looking like a bloated, eight-limbed, greenish-black mix of frog and
    tentacled beast, this asexual creature is most notorious for the larvae it
    carries on its back.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Some scholars suggest the large, muscular body of the bogwid serves as
    little more than transport for its ravenous young-30 to 40 fist-sized,
    pustule-like protuberances that cling to its back, inf lating and def
    lating, shifting and quivering with disturbing vitality. The bogwid attacks
    with two of its undulating tentacles, the bottoms of which are lined with
    ragged, bony ridges that can tear hungrily into exposed flesh. However, the
    more disturbing danger is those pulsating orbs of flesh on its back: larvae
    that are capable of launching themselves as far as 10 feet and attaching to
    creatures with their fanged sucker mouths. Once one of these disgusting
    things sinks its jagged teeth into flesh, it begins sucking blood and does
    not release its grip until it or the target is dead. When a bogwid makes a
    kill, several of its young jump upon the warm carcass and feed greedily. If
    the victim is a Medium or larger creature, these rapacious larvae fight for
    the opportunity to burrow into the corpse. Over the course of 2 weeks, the
    burrowed creatures gestate, and the cadaver bloats until an adolescent
    bogwid (a bogwid with the young template) gruesomely bursts forth. The
    larger the kill, the more of the bogwid's young can burrow in and hatch out
    as adolescents; a Large victim can accommodate two larvae, a Huge victim
    four larvae, a Gargantuan victim eight larvae, and a Colossal victim 16
    larvae. A creature smaller than Medium doesn't possess sufficient nutrition
    for bogwid larvae to gestate properly. As a result, adult bogwids tend to
    completely consume smaller kills instead of leaving them for the larvae.
    Bogwids that inhabit seaside haunts are not averse to eating carrion.
    Indeed, a sizable sea creature whose carcass washes ashore (a whale, for
    instance) is usually set upon by a nearby bogwid, whose ravenous larvae
    tunnel their way into the rotting flesh, and several days later erupt like a
    crawling, monstrous plague. In this way, large clutches of these foul beasts
    can come to infest coastal areas. The bogwid is generally nocturnal, though
    it is not unusual for one to hunt during the day if it has gone a long time
    without feeding. A bogwid hunts patiently, concealing itself well in its
    natural habitat by heaping sand, seaweed, vegetation, and other detritus
    onto its body. Though a bogwid possesses limited intelligence, its animal
    cunning allows it to employ natural hazards to its advantage, setting up
    ambushes that cleverly integrate drop-offs, natural pits, and quicksand. As
    these creatures are also able to climb, it is not uncommon for bogwids to
    roost on rocky overhangs or in large trees, dropping down on unsuspecting
    victims from above. Alchemists pay a significant price for the glands in
    bogwid tentacles that produce the foul, viscous liquid the creatures
    excrete. However, these glands are difficult to extract fully intact (DC 25
    Heal check) and must be properly stored in water after removal.
    Appropriately dissected and transported, the glands fetch 25 gp apiece on
    the right market. Alchemists employ this putrid substance in various
    formulae to augment their effectiveness.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Though great numbers of bogwids take up residence in temperate, swampy,
    coastal regions and the damp caves that are sometimes found in such places,
    plenty of the creatures inhabit inland marshes as well. They have been known
    to adapt to warmer climes, but tropical bogwids are much rarer. The fetid
    creatures tend not to flourish near major settlements, even if those
    settlements are in close proximity to the bogwids' natural habitat. The
    reason is that the presence of a beast like this near a town strikes such
    revulsion and fear into a population that they quickly post sizable rewards
    for the destruction of the beast. Rangers who traverse marshes and wet caves
    eagerly seek out such lucrative bounties. Indeed, the fact that these
    monsters have not been hunted to extinction is a testimony to their
    revolting fecundity. As these creatures are asexual, bogwids also tend to be
    solitary, driving off gestated offspring soon after they reach maturity.
    Recently matured bogwids seek out their own territory. On the few occasions
    bogwid clutches form, they most often include a single adult accompanied by
    two to eight adolescents. These abhorrent creatures have a life expectancy
    of about 10 years. An older bogwid can be identified by its flesh, which
    becomes gray-green and increasingly dry as the creature ages. The larvae an
    older bogwid carries about eventually lead to its own downfall. In the end,
    the strongest of its young fight off weaker kin and burrow into the dying
    parent, exploding forth from the corpse in the usual manner 2 weeks later. A
    bogwid does not tolerate other major predators in its territory, hounding
    them relentlessly until such competitors are killed or find alternate homes
    for themselves. The bogwid is especially aggressive against crocodiles,
    which tend to be its chief rivals for prey in swampy regions. In fact, a
    telltale sign of a bogwid having laid a claim to territory is the discovery
    of a crocodile corpse lying on its back, the stomach bloated with gestating
    larvae or torn out as though something exploded from within, suggesting an
    adolescent bogwid is not far away.
