      A ravager beetle that is grappling a foe and chooses to damage the foe
      with an additional grapple check deals twice its normal bite damage (2d8+8
      points of damage for most ravager beetles), in addition to injecting an
      additional dose of poison with each successful check.

      Bite-injury; save DC 14 Fort; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2
      Constitution damage and excruciating pain (-2 penalty on attack rolls,
      checks, and saves); cure 1 save. Multiple bites do not result in
      cumulative penalties to attack rolls, checks, and saves. Apply the
      penalties only once for the duration of the poison. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Ravager beetles are omnivorous beetles found in temperate or warm forests,
    hills, and swamps. While generally sustaining themselves on a diet of
    foliage and grasses, they sometimes scavenge the remains of creatures killed
    by other predators.

    Like most beetles, a ravager has a thick plated carapace and two large
    mandibles it uses to crush and chew its food. Its carapace is black in color
    with several white streaks crisscrossing it. Its mandibles are dark
    bluish-black. Its wing covers are black with hints of gold. A typical
    ravager beetle is about 4 feet long.
  - >-
    Ravagers have a single life cycle that spans an entire year. Females
    generally lay 4-8 eggs in soft earth or soil and within two weeks the larva
    emerges. Young are almost always born in the warmer spring and early summer
    months. Young are noncombatants and rely solely on their mother for
    protection and food, feeding generally for 10 days before entering the pupa
    stage. After about 20 days, the pupae become adults.
  - >-
    Ravager beetles are generally scavengers by nature, and rarely attack,
    except in times when food is scarce. Even then, they usually limit their
    attacks to weakened, sleeping, wounded, or otherwise incapacitated prey.
    When attacking, ravager beetles lock onto an opponent with their mandibles
    and continue biting and crushing the target until it is dead.
