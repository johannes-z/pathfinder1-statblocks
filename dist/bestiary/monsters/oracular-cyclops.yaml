SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Greater Flash of Insight (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as an immediate action, a cyclops can peer into an occluded
      visual spectrum of possible futures, gaining insight that allows it to
      select the exact result of one die roll before the roll is made. This
      effect can alter an action taken by the cyclops, and once per week the
      oracular cyclops can apply this ability to one creature of her choosing.
      The target of this boon must be within 30 feet of the oracular cyclops and
      be able to be seen.
  - name: Protective Foresight (Su)
    description: >-
      An oracular cyclops can peer into the future to protect itself. This
      ability grants the cyclops a +4 insight bonus to AC.
Description:
  - >-
    A cyclops oracle retains more of the powers of foresight than most of its
    kin. In addition to a cyclops's typical flash of insight ability, an
    oracular cyclops can share its gift with others, granting them a boon on a
    future challenge. While often smaller than others of its kind, an oracular
    cyclops gains the ability to foresee danger coming its way. The statistics
    above depict a cyclops who is served by a cult of worshippers, and is
    therefore in good health. Other oracular cyclopes are sometimes kept as
    chained prisoners, at the mercy of their captors.
