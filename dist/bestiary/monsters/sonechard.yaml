Description_Visual: >-
  This ram-headed humanoid appears to be at least as twice as tall as a human
  and has leathery gray skin. Large, curved horns,-the left one broken off
  midway from its starting point-jut from its head. Two large bat-like wings
  spread from his shoulders. The creature's body is covered in thick, dark hair.
  Portions of the hair are torn away in areas revealing masses of battle-born
  scars and damage.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Control Undead (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as the spell of the same name (CL 20th), except
      that Sonechard maintains control for 200 minutes. Sonechard can take
      control of undead creatures controlled by another creature whose caster
      level is 19 or less by making a successful opposed Charisma check against
      the opponent's Charisma check.
  - name: Undead Master (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability allows Sonechard to create a maximum of 50 HD of undead with
      a single use of animate dead. If used in conjunction with desecrate, he
      can create 100 HD of undead with a single use. Fool's Errand: Sonechard's
      unique weapon is a +4 unholy wounding heavy pick.
Description:
  - >-
    Sonechard is a General in the infernal armies of Orcus and serves him- at
    least to all onlookers-with unswerving loyalty. He has countless numbers of
    demons and undead at his command. Though his true loyalty lies only to
    himself, he would never openly refuse a request by Orcus nor challenge his
    position as Prince of the Undead. Should the day come when Orcus weakens,
    Sonechard plans to be there to claim what he believes is rightfully his.
  - >-
    Sonechard makes his home in a large castle called Chillhall that sits atop a
    plateau of scorched earth surrounded by a moat of blood. The walls are
    constructed of bone and sinew, and it is said that the souls of those who
    cross him are entombed within.
  - Sonechard stands 14 feet tall and weighs about 3,500 pounds.
  - >-
    Sonechard is almost always encountered with a large number of demons or
    undead at his side. When he enters battle, he usually unleashes a fireball
    at his foes immediately, and then follows it up with a circle of death
    effect or a suggestion. Dying creatures are subjected to his death knell
    spell-like ability and then raised via animate dead.
  - >-
    Should Sonechard find himself on the losing end of a battle, he does not
    hesitate to retreat, covering his escape with summoned or created undead and
    demons. A defeat is not forgotten-or forgiven. He remembers his opponents,
    and sends his troops to exterminate them at first chance, bringing their
    carcasses to his keep where he grinds their remains into a fine powder and
    gives it to his servants to be used to spice up the keep's foodstuffs.
  - >-
    Sonechard's natural weapons, as well as any weapons he wields, are treated
    as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
    reduction.
