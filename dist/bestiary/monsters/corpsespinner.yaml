Description_Visual: >-
  A massive, bone-white tarantula is the only way to describe this monster.
  Bands of gray and silver ring its abdomen and legs, and its body is covered in
  short, bristly hairs of white and silver. A large skull-like marking appears
  on the creature's thorax. Its eight eyes are stark white.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Astral Jaunt (Su)
    description: >-
      A corpsespinner can shift from the Astral Plane to the Material Plane as a
      free action, and shift back again as a move action (or as part of a move
      action). The ability is otherwise identical to ethereal jaunt (CL 15th)
      except it accesses the Astral Plane.
  - name: Astralsense (Su)
    description: >-
      A corpsespinner can automatically detect the location of anything within
      200 feet of it on the Astral Plane.
  - name: Create Corpsespun (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures slain by a corpsespinner but not devoured rise in 1 hour as a
      corpsespun creature (see Templates appendix).
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 22; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 2d6
      Intelligence damage, death at 0 Intelligence and rise as a corpsespun
      after 1 hour; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Web (Ex)
    description: >-
      As the standard ability but with range 80 ft. In addition the checks
      include both a +4 bonus because the webs are constructed of astral
      material and a +4 racial bonus. The corpsespinner cannot produce the
      magical astral webs during combat.
Description:
  - >-
    Corpsespinners are highly aggressive extraplanar spiders originating on the
    Astral Plane. Only rarely do they enter the Material Plane in search of
    prey, choosing to hunt on the Astral Plane searching and devouring astral
    sharks and other native creatures. On the Material Plane, they often hunt
    other giant spiders or humanoids. On the Astral Plane, corpsespinners spend
    their time constructing elaborate webs. The webs use many different things
    as anchor points such as rare natural occurring materials on the Astral
    Plane, corpses of deceased astral travelers, and just about anything else
    the corpsespinner can incorporate into its webbing. When not constructing
    its webs, the corpsespinner is usually hunting. And this sometimes leads it
    to the Material Plane. If encountered on the Material Plane, there is a good
    chance the corpsespinner has a group of corpsespun with it, the victim's of
    its most recent kills. Corpsespinners are primarily solitary creatures in
    regards to associating with others of their kind. Their Ecology and
    reproduction cycles are unknown at this point, though intrepid interplanar
    adventurers have talked of huge webbed lairs on the Astral Plane containing
    young corpsespinners. Corpsespinners hunt their prey on the Astral Plane,
    only occasionally entering the Material Plane to look for food. Once prey is
    sighted, the corpsespinner moves quickly to encase it in its sticky webbing
    before attacking repeatedly with its poisonous bite. On the Material Plane
    it attacks a foe, shifts to the Astral Plane, and shifts back again to
    finish the opponent off. If forced to retreat, the corpsespinner shifts to
    the Astral Plane and returns to its lair. A corpsespinner usually has a gang
    of corpsespun with it (see the Corpsespun template in this book for
    details). In such a case, the corpsespinner attempts to web its foes and let
    the corpsespun move in to soften them up. The corpsespinner then charges in
    and bites its targets to finish them off. Copyright Notice Author Scott
