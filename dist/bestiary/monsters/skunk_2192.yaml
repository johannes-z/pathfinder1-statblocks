  - name: Musk (Ex)
    description: >-
      Up to twice per day, a skunk can spray a stream of noxious musk at a
      single target within 10 feet as a standard action. With a successful
      ranged touch attack, the creature struck by this spray must make a DC 11
      Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds and then sickened for 1d4
      minutes by the horrific stench. A successful save reduces the effect to
      only 1d4 rounds of being sickened. A creature cannot use the scent ability
      as long as it is affected by this musk. The save DC is Constitution-based,
      and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    These small mammals are well known to humanoids and forest creatures alike,
    with their distinctive black-and-white-striped markings and infamous scent
    glands. Creatures like big cats or wolves that normally would make a meal of
    such a small creature give skunks plenty of space, for they have learned
    well that the combination of black and white on a skunk's back equates to a
    hideously overpowering stench.
