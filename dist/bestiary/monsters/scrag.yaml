Description:
  - >-
    Dwelling in both fresh and salt water, these cousins of the troll have the
    aquatic subtype and the amphibious special quality. Scrags have a base land
    speed of 20 feet and a swim speed of 40 feet. A scrag's regeneration ability
    only works if it is in contact with water. Scrags dwell in any body of water
    in any climate, though they are most common in cold northern rivers and
    lakes, and are less bestial in appearance than their terrestrial cousins,
    though no less violent.
