  Eldritch energy burns within the eyes of this humanoid figure. Strangely

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dissonance (Su)
    description: >-
      Every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a dawn piper can use a musical
      instrument to unleash a deadly torrent of sonic vibrations that tears at
      the very physicality of its enemies. This is similar to a breath weapon
      that deals 6d6 points of sonic damage in a 15-ft. cone (Reflex DC 16 half
      ). A dawn piper must be in possession of a musical instrument in order to
      use this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Elemental Font (Su)
    description: >-
      A dawn piper can infuse a 40-foot-radius area with the primal qualities of
      the First World. The creation of an elemental font requires a musical
      instrument and a musical ritual lasting 8 hours. As long as the piper
      returns to it every 24 hours, a font can persist forever, but it is
      destroyed immediately upon the creator's death. A dawn piper can also
      destroy its own font as a full-round action. The dawn piper gains
      additional spell-like abilities based on a single element while within
      range of its elemental font. Dimensional anchor and dimensional lock stop
      the flow of power, preventing the piper from using the additional
      spell-like abilities. The save DCs are Charisma-based, and the spell-like
      abilities are cast at caster level 7th. Air: 2/day-fly, gust of wind (DC
      15), shocking grasp Earth: 2/day-grease (DC 14), spiked pitAPG (DC 16),

  - name: slipstreamAPG  Terrible Beauty (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a dawn piper can surround itself in an intense aura
      of magnificence that is too potent for non-fey to withstand. Non-fey
      creatures within a 30-foot radius of the dawn piper must succeed at a DC
      16 Will save or be blinded or deafened for 1d4 rounds (the piper's choice,
      but the effect is consistent for all affected creatures), and take 1 point
      of bleed damage from their eyes or ears (depending on the specific
      effect). This aura lasts 1 full round, and a creature that succeeds at its
      saving throw cannot be affected again for 24 hours. This is a visual or
      auditory, mind-affecting effect. A dawn piper requires a musical
      instrument in order to create this aura. The save DC for this ability is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Strange and enigmatic creatures from the First World, dawn pipers are
    unmistakably humanoid and share some of the same delicate features of
    half-elves. But dawn pipers' otherworldly nature becomes evident when one
    looks at the creatures' eyes, which burn with a strange light. Their skin is
    smooth, free of blemish or body hair, and radiant. Their hair moves
    constantly, like the flickering flames of a torch in the breeze, and seems
    to express a seasonal theme in coloration. Their faces are portraits of
    every emotion that passes through their consciousness; joy, loss, and murder
    may all dance across their expressions in a matter of moments. Only when a
    dawn piper is asleep or plays a soothing melody on its pipes does its
    expression become static and human-and through such songs, dawn pipers'
    heartbreaking beauty becomes truly evident.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Early on in their primordial realm, dawn pipers toyed with emotion and its
    effects on the mutable nature of the First World. They marveled at how their
    plane could be transformed by an expression of strong will and passion.
    Their name allegedly stems from being the "musicians at the dawn of
    Creation." Yet, coming from the First World, they are soulless creatures and
    immortal on their home plane. Dawn pipers cannot hold on to their feelings,
    and with the passage of time their emotions slip away from them like sand
    through their fingers. Through study and experimentation, dawn pipers
    devised a means to cheat their own ephemeral nature through music. The
    pipers associate emotion with melody, and when their passions leave them,
    they recreate them from memory through their music. While music is an
    exercise in creativity, it also has elements of structure and pattern, and
    that is what the pipers retain long after other fleeting experiences fade.
    This is no small advantage in the highly morphic environment of the First
    World, allowing them to knead and shape portions of their home through the
    use of music and emotion. Though the dawn pipers have no strict elemental
    association, they may also use their music to create an elemental font
    through which they can channel and shape the energies of the Inner Planes.
  - >-
    Dawn pipers are not wholly flesh and bone, as a raw creative power also
    infuses them-the source of the burning light that shines out of their eyes.
    Despite their transitory emotions, there is enough definition imposed upon
    their existence that they remain subject to physical laws. If killed in the
    First World, dawn pipers do not truly die but are reborn. The same cannot be
    said when they expire on other worlds.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Dawn pipers have no formal, overarching society of their own, but they
    sometimes form small partnerships called choirs, which always have a prime
    number of members. They act as entertainers, advisors, and shapers among the
    fey of the First World. Outsiders find them easy to dismiss as slaves to the
    very emotions they conjure, but nothing could be less true. Dawn pipers are
    usually shrewd and manipulative, and merely play at the role of a manic
    social gadf ly. It is said that azatas can sometimes reason with them when
    they meet; otherwise, dawn pipers jockey for power and inf luence with fey
    beings greater than themselves. Dawn pipers are great proponents of
    subsuming parts of the Material Plane into the First World, yet few such
    incursions ever happen because they are reluctant to travel to the Material
    Plane, where they are mortal, unless on a matter of great importance. They
    rarely take mortal lovers as such dalliances seldom end happily-though when
    they do partake in them, there are always new melodies waiting to be
    improvised by which to remember the forsaken relationships.
  - Dawn Piper Choirs
  - >-
    A choir of dawn pipers can use their elemental fonts to absorb a part of the
    Material Plane into the First World by creating a reality siphon. To open a
    reality siphon, at least three dawn pipers must perform a musical ritual
    lasting 8 hours. Each piper must have its own elemental font prior to the
    start of the ritual, and no font can be more than 400 feet from another. At
    the conclusion of the ritual, the reality siphon appears, creating a
    10-foot-radius hemispherical area of twisted reality that functions as an
    antilife shell (CL 9th). After the ritual is complete, the pipers are free
    to take other actions until the reality siphon fully manifests. Over the
    course of 1 week, the reality siphon gradually expands until it encompasses
    a 400-foot-radius area, at which point everything in the area encompassed by
    the reality siphon is fully subsumed into the First World. Destroying the
    elemental fonts sustaining the reality siphon before it fully manifests
    causes it to implode upon itself, destroying the siphon and preventing it
    from drawing part of the Material Plane into the First World.
  - >-
    At the GM's discretion, certain more powerful choirs may have additional
    spell-like abilities, similar to the abilities a hag's coven possesses. They
    may also have powers related to the alteration of their environment in the
    First World.
