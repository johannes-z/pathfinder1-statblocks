  - name: Dazzling Burst (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a d'ziriak can cause its body to flare with intense,
      colorful light as a swift action. Non-d'ziriaks within a 20-foot radius
      must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1 minute. After using
      this ability, the d'ziriak's brilliant glow is extinguished for 24 hours.
      This ability is a light effect, and creatures that cannot see are immune
      to it. The save DC is Constitution-based.

      The colorful runes that decorate a d'ziriak's body create dim light in a
      20- foot radius from its body.
Description:
  - >-
    Natives of the Plane of Shadow, d'ziriaks are a mysterious race of
    human-sized insectoids. From their partially buried hive cities rise spires
    and steeples adorned with alchemical fire and illusory flame, dim beacons of
    sanctuary in the foreboding twilight. The d'ziriaks remain staunchly neutral
    in most affairs, and are typically happy to converse with travelers via
    their eerie telepathy (their own language of buzzes and chitters is an
    obscure one known by few outside their race), but their unknown, obscure
    goals lead most others to regard this race with caution.
  - >-
    The average d'ziriak is 7 feet tall and has four arms, two legs, a
    termite-like abdomen, and a mandibled visage somewhere between that of
    insect and human. Two of its arms are large and possess sharp claws, while
    the other two are relatively small and used for fine manipulations, not
    combat.
  - >-
    Strangely for a race native to the realm of shadows, the d'ziriaks have a
    colorful collection of runic shapes, almost like glowing tattoos, upon their
    chitinous flesh. These runes help to denote what role in d'ziriak society
    each of these beings serves.
