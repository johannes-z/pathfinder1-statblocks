Description:
  - >-
    The woolly rhinoceros is an herbivore, though unlike its non-woolly cousin
    it grazes for food rather than browsing on larger plants. The woolly rhino
    is legendary for its foul temper, and its size and huge horn give it a
    ferocious bravery. Any threat (real or perceived) to the rhino or its herd
    is met with loud bellows and the stomping of feet. Often, those who
    unwittingly anger a woolly rhino have no time to amend the intrusion before
    the beast attacks.
