SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hold Breath (Ex)
    description: >-
      A zeuglodon can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times
      its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
  - name: Thrash (Ex)
    description: >-
      A zeuglodon grappling a foe can thrash its body back and forth rapidly,
      dealing extra damage due to the violent motion of its whipping head. This
      attack deals 4d8+19 points of damage, but allows the grappled creature a
      free attempt to escape the grapple. If a creature escapes, it is thrown 30
      feet in a random direction by the zeuglodon's erratic thrashing.
Description:
  - >-
    The primordial zeuglodon is often mistaken for a dinosaur or other large
    reptile, in part because of its almost crocodilian mouth as well as its
    snake-like elongation. Despite these features, it is more closely related to
    whales and other cetaceans than either aquatic reptiles or fish. A zeuglodon
    moves through the water with a vertical anguiliform (eel-like) motion that
    seems almost to be a primitive version of the efficient fluke-driven
    locomotion of its cetacean relatives. Zeuglodons breathe air through
    blowholes on the tops of their heads, though they lack the lung capacity to
    stay underwater for as long as their more evolved kin. The relative
    dimensions of their angular heads are too small to encase the enlarged
    brains or melons developed by other cetaceans for echolocation or
    communication with others of their kind, and as such zeuglodons are less
    social than whales and dolphins. What they lack in specialized anatomy,
    however, they make up for in sheer ferocity and speed. A hunting zeuglodon
    is a furious foe to contend with. An adult zeuglodon measures around 50 feet
    long and weighs upward of 50,000 pounds.
