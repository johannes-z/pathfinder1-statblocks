SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Destroy Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      A shinigami possesses six gems in which it encapsulates souls with its
      soul bind spell-like ability. These gems are only useful to the shinigami
      that owns them, and if the shinigami dies, the gems are destroyed as well.
      As a standard action once per day, a shinigami can hold up a gem that
      currently contains a soul and crush it, permanently destroying the soul
      within and releasing a 30-foot-radius burst of negative energy that
      inflicts 1d6 negative levels on all creatures in the area of effect. A
      successful DC 30 Fortitude save reduces this to 1 negative level. The soul
      destroyed in the process of using this ability can only be brought back to
      life by means of a miracle or wish spell. This is a death effect. The save
      DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Feared as truly impartial and merciless harbingers of death, shinigamis are
    relentless in their pursuit of dispensing quick and just deaths upon those
    who would seek to disrupt the delicate balance of life. Unlike other, more
    sinister bringers of doom, shinigamis do not take pleasure in their work and
    do not seek to impose suffering-although there are exceptions. Some
    individuals, aptly described by their kin as "rogue shinigamis," subscribe
    to either more merciful or more despicable forms of execution, and are
    either lawful good or lawful evil. Victims who have had their lives spared
    by kind shinigamis praise the angels of death for their clemency and
    willingness to listen to the victims' plight, while other dastardly
    survivors have successfully cheated or bribed their way out of death by
    manipulating credulous or less honorable shinigami. A shinigami is 9 feet
    tall and weighs 130 pounds.
