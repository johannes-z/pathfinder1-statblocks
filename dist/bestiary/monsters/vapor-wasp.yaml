Description:
  - >-
    Vapor wasps resemble giant wasps in all respects. In some rare species their
    coloration seems to vary slightly (a blue stripe on the abdomen is the
    giveaway). Vapor wasps construct their nests above ground and most often in
    forested areas. They rarely build their hives in mountains, deserts, or cold
    climates.
  - >-
    A vapor wasp hive is for the most part indistinguishable from an ordinary
    giant wasp hive.
  - >-
    Vapor wasps are not aggressive creatures and generally avoid combat unless
    threatened or unless the hive is threatened. Creatures wandering within 100
    feet of a vapor wasp hive are harassed but almost always left alone. If
    attacked, or if the hive itself is threatened, the vapor wasps attack
    relentlessly, using their poisonous sting to fell their opponents.
