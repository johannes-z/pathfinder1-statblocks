Description_Visual: >-
  The muscles beneath the spotted fur of this sleek feline tense, poised to
  pounce. Its long, sinuous neck stretches over twice the length of its body,
  ending in a snarling leopard's head.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dune Step (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as part of a move action, a serpopard can
      instantaneously leap from one dune to any other dune within 1 mile as if
      by dimension door. The serpopard must begin and end this movement in an
      area of dunes. Using this ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

  - name: Limber Neck (Ex)
    description: >-
      A serpopard can use its long neck to make bite attacks as part of a rake
      attack against grappled opponents. In addition, a serpopard doesn't take
      the usual -2 penalty on attack rolls when it makes a bite attack while
      grappling.
Description:
  - >-
    Avistani naturalists named this creature serpopard because they saw it as
    possessing features of both a leopard and a serpent, though this creature is
    also widely known by its Osiriani name sedja, meaning "one who travels from
    afar." Serpopards earn this appellation because of their supernatural
    ability to leap from one dune to another, an ability they call "stepping
    between the dunes."
  - >-
    Some scholars speculate that the pharaohs of old bred this ability into the
    serpopards in order to create scouts and messengers able to cross the harsh
    terrain of their vast empires quickly and efficiently, but this creature is
    not one that has been created or inf luenced by humankind. Though rare,
    serpopards are naturally occurring beasts native to the deserts of northern
    Garund. Superstitious folk who believe that the gods' hands touch everything
    beneath the blistering Osirian sun see the serpopard as a cursed creature,
    marked with snakelike features by Apep and forced to wander eternally
    through the desert, never to find rest or sanctuary. On the other hand,
    carvings on ceremonial plates, on uncovered artifacts, and in ruined temples
    make it clear that the god-kings of Ancient Osirion once kept serpopards as
    pets or servants, as depictions of these creatures in the oldest of
    Osirion's ruins often show them chained or collared, bowing obediently to
    human masters.

    Serpopards stand approximately 3 feet tall at the shoulder; when their necks
    are fully extended, they can measure up to 20 feet long from nose to tail.
    Serpopards weigh anywhere from 150 to 200 lbs.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Though serpopards are most common in the deserts of northern Garund,
    travelers in such far-off locales as the Meraz Desert in Qadira, the
    Cinderlands of Varisia, and the vast expanse of Shaguang in Tian Xia to the
    east have spotted creatures matching the serpopards' description. Some sages
    hypothesize that the most powerful or ancient serpopards can cross greater
    distances with their dune step ability, and thus travel through it to
    distant deserts across Golarion. Such experts say it's therefore likely that
    all deserts hold populations of serpopards, though they may be few in number
    or very isolated.
  - >-
    Serpopards are largely nocturnal, preferring to hunt at night when they can
    use the cover of darkness to approach prey undetected. When hunting, they
    rely on their speed and powerful claws to take down large quarry, and then
    use the additional reach provided by their unusually long necks to defend
    their kills from scavengers and competing hunters. Serpopards are not averse
    to eating intelligent beings, and hunt humanoids if the opportunity or need
    arises, but they aren't cruel- serpopards gain no pleasure from such acts
    beyond the satisfaction of a fresh meal.
  - >-
    On average, serpopards have a lifespan of about 50 years, but rumors exist
    of serpopards living much longer than this. One town along the northern
    coast of Rahadoum claims a single serpopard has visited its outskirts once
    every decade for the past 100 years.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Serpopards are mainly solitary creatures. Very rarely do they travel in
    pairs, and then only during mating season or in the case of littermates who
    chose not to separate at adulthood. When living as mated pairs, the father
    stays only until the cubs are able to run, but the mother stays with the
    cubs much longer, teaching them how to hunt and use their special ability to
    travel between the dunes. Mothers also pass on to the cubs their
    understanding of the land, instructing them as to which areas are good for
    hunting or exploring, what kinds of places to avoid, and how to find fresh
    water. Young serpopards separate from their mother individually, leaving as
    soon as they mature and feel confident navigating their way through the
    desert alone.
  - >-
    When traveling, serpopards range anywhere from 50 to 100 miles per day,
    stopping only to hunt, rest, or (more rarely) explore some aged ruin. No one
    knows what fascination these ancient works hold for the serpopards, but the
    creatures' interest in such locations is undeniable. An old poem involving
    serpopards claims that the creatures visit these ancient ruins because they
    are pining for the lost empire of Ancient Osirion.
  - >-
    Serpopards are clever liars and frustrating conversationalists, and hold a
    reputation among other races as skilled deceivers. In rural parts of
    Osirion, those with a gift for deception are often said to have "the tongue
    of a sedja," while young children caught in a lie are warned that their
    "necks are growing" with each lie they tell. Despite this potential
    untrustworthiness, many people still seek the aid of serpopards. Few
    creatures know the deserts of Osirion as well as serpopards, and for the
    right price many are willing to guide groups of people across the desert.
    It's usually best to ensure the serpopard is well fed before undertaking
    such a journey, however, for a hungry serpopard may turn on its traveling
    companions if it thinks it can make a quick meal out of them. Serpopards
    have little use for gold and rarely accept it as payment for their services,
    though some apparently take a liking to jewelry, as travelers report the
    creatures as frequently wearing necklaces and bracelets when encountered.
    Food and hospitality are always acceptable payments, for those two things
    are in short supply in the harsh expanse of the desert. For those wishing to
    earn a serpopard's true faith and loyalty, however, one form of compensation
    stands above all others-divination magic. Serpopards are unceasingly curious
    about what their futures hold, and put great stock in the words of those who
    can tell fortunes or predict events to come.
  - >-
    Serpopards attack most sphinxes on sight, often fighting at least long
    enough to get in a few solid blows before retreating between the dunes to
    safety. The only exception to this is androsphinxes, which most serpopards
    fear for some unknown reason. Only the bravest or most desperate serpopards
    face down such creatures in combat without aid; most flee immediately once
    they spot these mighty sphinxes. Sphinxes are aware of this antipathy and
    treat serpopards accordingly. Perhaps as a consequence of their antipathy
    toward sphinxes, serpopards also hate riddles and word games, and prefer to
    twist their words with lies and omissions rather than making a game out of
    conversation. Ignorant travelers who confuse the two creatures and try to
    engage the serpopard in a bout of riddling can find themselves in a
    dangerous predicament.
