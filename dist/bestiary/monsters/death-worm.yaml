Description:
  - >-
    The death worm is a reclusive, desert-dwelling creature content to spend its
    life burrowing beneath the ground and sustaining itself on a diet of sand
    and earth. On occasion, it surfaces to devour more substantial prey (animals
    such as moose, deer, bison, and humans).
  - Death worms lay their eggs far beneath the surface of the earth.
  - >-
    Newborn death worms live on a diet of sand and earth; only when they reach
    maturity (2-5 years after hatching) do they surface and devour their first
    living prey.
