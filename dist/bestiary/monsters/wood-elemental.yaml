Description_Visual: >-
  Wood elementals appear as twiggy, wooden beings, with long, elf-like ears and
  curious features. They are quite strong, although slow moving and deliberate.
  Wood elementals encountered are always huge beings, and it is not known if
  smaller versions exist.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Flesh to Wood (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds a wood elemental may attempt to turn flesh to wood
      with a successful touch attack. A DC 21 Fortitude save negates. The save
      is Constitution-based. This malady cannot be remedied short of a wish,
      miracle, or Dobrynya the druid's intervention.
  - name: Forest Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A wood elemental gains a +1 bonus to both attack and damage rolls if she
      and her opponent are both in a forested area. This ability has been added
      in to the above stat block.
Description:
  - >-
    Wood elementals serve as protectors of the forest, and each forest usually
    has one, while great primeval forests may boast several. Wood elementals
    spend most of their time in a euphoric slumber, waking only when their
    forest is in danger. At these times the wood elemental moves forth to seek
    and destroy that which threatens the forest. At times they are known to ally
    with factions that work to protect and save the forest, especially elves.
    Wood elementals attack with a slam attack, as their limbs are strong and
    powerful, much like those of a treants.
  - >-
    Huge wood elementals stand 16 to 24 feet tall, with a 3 foot to 7 foot
    trunk, weighing 1,500 to 4,000 pounds. Wood elementals typically replicate
    the look of the native trees of their forest; some wood elementals appear as
    mighty oaks, some as maples, birch, pine or majestic cedar trees. More
    exotic species are certainly possible (tiger wood, ipe, etc.).
