SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Protective Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability
      provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving
      throws to anyone within 20 feet of the leonal. Otherwise, it functions as
      a magic circle against evil effect and a lesser globe of invulnerability,
      both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals leonal's HD). The
      defensive benefits from the circle are not included in a leonal's stat
      block.
  - name: Roar (Su)
    description: >-
      Up to three times per day, a leonal can emit a powerful roar as a standard
      action. Each roar affects a 60- foot cone with the effects of a holy word
      spell and also deals 2d6 points of sonic damage to all creatures in the
      area (DC 21 Fortitude negates). This is a sonic effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A leonal is a lion-like agathion, noble and fierce. Though gentle with their
    families and patient with strangers on their home plane, in battle leonals
    are deadly foes of evil and cruelty. They hunt fiends and other evil
    monsters, silently tailing their prey until they find the right time to leap
    and slash. Leonals pride themselves on their hunting prowess, and few land
    creatures can match their speed. Although capable of using weapons, the
    majority of leonals prefer to battle evil with tooth and claw.
  - >-
    Leonals like their battles to be straightforward affairs. They begin with a
    roar to put their foes off balance, then follow up with claw and bite
    attacks. They closely coordinate with others in their pride, watching one
    another's flanks and setting up devastating attacks. They mainly use their
    magical abilities against large numbers of weaker foes and against those
    they need to capture or incapacitate without dealing harm to them.
  - >-
    Leonals stand 6 feet tall and weigh 270 pounds on average. Males usually
    have manes of either dark gold or black hair, which may only surround the
    head or may extend onto the shoulders and chest. Female leonals do not have
    manes, but may have longer hair on the back of the neck.
