Description:
  - >-
    Though created long ago, the very first owlbear still lives. Fecund, nomadic
    and cantankerous, the First Owlbear's offspring are always owlbears, whether
    the mother is a bear, a giant owl, or an owlbear. He brings his "harem" of
    mates with him when he hunts, driving them off when he tires of their
    company or food becomes scarce.
