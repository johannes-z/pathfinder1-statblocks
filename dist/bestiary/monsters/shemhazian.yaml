Description:
  - >-
    Although nearly all the horrors of the Abyss prey upon one another in an
    endless, eternal bloodbath, shemhazians are predators among predators. They
    are more intimidating and physically powerful than most demons, combining
    the features of numerous insectile and bestial hunters into one massive,
    deadly form. Although they don't require sustenance, shemhazians take
    perverse delight in mutilating and eating their victims.
  - >-
    A shemhazian stands 35 feet tall and weighs 12,000 pounds. They form from
    the sinful souls of torturers and those who enjoyed mutilating living
    victims to death.
