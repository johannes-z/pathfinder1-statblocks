SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Frenzy (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bunyip that detects blood in the water goes into a killing frenzy, as do
      all other bunyips within a 90-foot radius. Frenzied bunyips attack until
      either they or their opponents are dead. A frenzied bunyip can make one
      extra attack when making a full attack action. The attack is made using
      the creature's full base attack. Additionally, it gains a +1 bonus on
      attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves (none of which
      are included in the statistic block above). A frenzied bunyip's swim speed
      increases by 10 feet (to 60 feet). This frenzy lasts for 1 minute (10
      rounds) and can only be used once per encounter.
  - name: Keen Scent (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bunyips can notice creatures by scent in a 90-foot radius and detect blood
      in the water at ranges of up to one-half mile.
  - name: Roar (Su)
    description: >-
      When a bunyip roars, all creatures with 4 or less HD within a 100-foot
      spread must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or become panicked for 2d4
      rounds. This is a sonic, mindaffecting fear effect. Whether or not the
      save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the roar of that
      bunyip for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Vorpal Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a bunyip scores a natural 20 on its attack roll and confirms the
      critical hit, it severs one of the opponent's extremities (roll 1d6: 1-3
      arm, 4-6 leg; 50% chance of either right or left).
Description:
  - >-
    The bunyip is about 6 feet long, though specimens of up to 10 feet long have
    been encountered.
  - >-
    Bunyips do not attack creatures larger than themselves, except in
    self-defense or if they detect blood in the water. They begin combat using
    their powerful roar and then bite opponents who do not succumb to the
    fear-inducing effects of their roar.
