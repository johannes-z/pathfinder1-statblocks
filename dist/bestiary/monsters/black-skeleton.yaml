  hollowed eye sockets.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Strength Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      A black skeleton's attacks (either by a weapon or natural attack) deal 1d3
      points of Strength damage to a living creature. This is a negative energy
      effect. This is a function of the black skeleton itself, not its weapons.
      Superior Two-Weapon
  - name: Fighting (Ex)
    description: >-
      A black skeleton usually fights with a short sword in each hand. Because
      of its magical nature, its Two-Weapon Fighting feat allows it to attack
      with both weapons at no penalty.
Description:
  - >-
    Black skeletons were first encountered in Rappan Athuk (see the adventure,
    Rappan Athuk Reloaded from Necromancer Games). Much more powerful than
    standard skeletons, these minions of evil are often employed as guardians or
    protectors to keep sealed some ancient knowledge best left undiscovered.
    They are intelligent monsters and are not subject to the mindless commands
    that can be given to such undead as skeletons or zombies. They have a clear
    mind, and sometimes go against the commands and wishes of those they serve,
    if it benefits the black skeleton in question. Black skeletons are the
    remnants of living creatures slain in an area where the ground is soaked
    through with evil. The bodies of fallen heroes are contaminated and polluted
    by such evil and within days after their death, the slain creatures rise as
    black skeletons, leaving their former lives and bodies behind. Black
    skeletons are intelligent and do maintain some memories of their former
    lives. Black skeletons wear any clothes or armor they had in life, and some
    still carry their gear or weapons (most discard their weapons in favor of
    two short swords as soon as they can). Black skeletons attack with two short
    swords in battle with little more than the intention of cutting their foes
    to pieces. They are intelligent opponents and will use tactics during
    battle, often sending several of their number against a foe's front, while
    the others move into position to flank their adversaries. Black skeletons
    are smart enough to know when the battle is lost and withdraw from combat,
    though rarely. Most simply fight to the death, driven by some unseen hatred
    for the living. Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Bill Webb.
