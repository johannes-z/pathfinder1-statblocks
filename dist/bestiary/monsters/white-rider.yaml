SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blinding Light (Su)
    description: >-
      The White Rider can radiate a 30-foot-radius aura of blinding light as a
      free action. Creatures within the affected area must succeed at a DC 23
      Fortitude save or be permanently blinded. A creature that successfully

    description: >-
      The White Rider has a +2 seeking composite longbow and a quiver that
      produces a never-ending supply of arrows. Once per round, she can draw a
      +1 brilliant energy arrow from her quiver.
Description:
  - >-
    The White Rider is the most even-tempered and diplomatic of the Three
    Riders. This does not mean that she is sympathetic or merciful, just that
    there is less blood staining the crisp white garments she wears. When the
    White Rider comes calling, citizens of Irrisen often seek to curry favor by
    bringing her gifts of hot tea, pastries, and fresh baked bread. She rarely
    accepts these offerings, and when she does it is only from those she has
    already judged to be loyal to Baba Yaga and worthy of the Queen of Witches's
    rule. Those who too eagerly attempt to carry favor face added scrutiny from
    her.
