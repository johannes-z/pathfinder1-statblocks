Description_Visual: >-
  Polished stones form the soulless eyes of this small yet bizarrely crafted
  wooden effigy. Shaped into the form of some inscrutable deity or spirit, its
  exotically carved features contort in a primeval scowl.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Inanimate (Ex)
    description: >-
      An idol is effectively a statuette and does little to suggest otherwise.
      Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is
      indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. Unless noted in its
      description, an idol can make use of the majority of its special abilities
      without moving, though the round after it does so observers can make a DC
      25 Perception check to notice minute hints-magical glimmers, minute
      contortions, etc.-suggesting that the idol is actually animate. Overt
      actions, such as an idol moving or attacking, make its nature obvious to
      witnesses, and to others who make a Perception check (as previously noted)
      even 1 round after it moves.
  - name: Incombustible Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures within 30 feet of a wood idol gain fire resistance 10. This
      effect lasts as long as a creature remains within the wood idol's aura.
      Any time a being makes use of this resistance to any degree, the wood idol
      takes 1 point of normal damage, appearing more and more charred as it
      takes damage. This ability ceases to function should a wood idol have only
      1 hit point and does not reactivate until it regains hit points.
  - name: Primeval Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a wood idol can force a creature within 15 feet to make a DC
      12 Will save or be cursed. This curse functions similarly to the spell
      bestow curse, except that it can only either decrease an ability score by
      -4 or cause a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill
      checks. In addition, while affected, the skin of the target takes on a
      rough, wooden appearance. A wood idol's curse can only affect one creature
      at a time, and should it curse another creature, the first target is no
      longer affected. This effect can be removed by remove curse or by eating a
      goodberry. The save DC is Charisma based.
  - name: Regeneration (Ex)
    description: >-
      A wood idol's regeneration only functions while it is standing on wood,
      grass, or earth. Fire deals normal damage to a wood idol.
  - name: Share Abilities (Su)
    description: >-
      An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect
      itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or
      allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them
      specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are
      marked with an asterisk (*). Skills In addition to the challenge of
      detecting a stationary idol, these constructs gain a +4 racial bonus on
      Stealth checks made to hide amid the materials that comprise their bodies.
Description:
  - >-
    Among rare druidic circles, tribes of the deep jungle, and the mysterious
    people of the distant west, wood idols frequently serve as representations
    of powerful spirits of the wilds, who these nature devotees propitiate with
    sacrifices. The superstitions of strange shamans hold that spirits possess
    the idols when the sacrifices are made, consuming the offering before
    returning from whence they came. Yet those who would offend these forces
    must beware, as they manipulate eldritch powers of the world and might curse
    one's every effort. While many question the truths of such beliefs, few who
    impugn the might of such spirits survive the ire of their shaman-creators'
    devout congregations.
