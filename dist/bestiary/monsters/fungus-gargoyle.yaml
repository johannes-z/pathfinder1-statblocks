Description_Visual: >-

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a fungus gargoyle can breathe a line of deadly
      spores to a range of 10 feet. A living creature struck must succeed on a
      DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Strength damage. Thereafter,
      the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save each minute (10
      rounds) or take 1 point of Strength damage. This cycle continues until the
      creature dies or receives a remove disease spell. A successful DC 20 Heal
      check or a delay poison spell slows the continuing damage to 1 point per
      hour. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Sickening Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a fungus gargoyle can emanate an aura that smells like
      rotting vegetable matter in a 10-foot radius. Creatures within the area
      must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or be sickened for as long as they
      remain in the area and for 1d4 rounds afterwards. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Fungus gargoyles are thought to be gargoyles that have been transformed into
    their current state by an evil cult that pays reverence to various demons of
    slime, ooze, and fungus. These creatures are often found acting as guardians
    in temples dedicated to such demons.
  - >-
    Unlike normal plants, fungus gargoyles do not require food or air (they
    still require water however), but sometimes eat their fallen enemies simply
    for the sheer pleasure of doing so (usually only evil-aligned fungus
    gargoyles do this). A typical fungus gargoyle stands about 5 or 6 feet tall
    and weighs up to 200 pounds. Though its shape can vary, most resemble ugly
    winged humanoids.
  - >-
    Fungus gargoyles typically ambush their prey, standing motionless until
    their opponent moves close. The fungus gargoyles then leap to the attack,
    slashing with their claws. Most fungus gargoyles try to stay airborne during
    combat rather than fight on the ground.
