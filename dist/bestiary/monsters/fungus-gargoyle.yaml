  feet, and its mouth is lined with fangs carved from the same substances its
  body is.

Description:
  - >-
    Fungus gargoyles are thought to be gargoyles that have been transformed into
    their current state by an evil cult that pays reverence to various demons of
    slime, ooze, and fungus. These creatures are often found acting as guardians
    in temples dedicated to such demons.
  - >-
    Unlike normal plants, fungus gargoyles do not require food or air (they
    still require water however), but sometimes eat their fallen enemies simply
    for the sheer pleasure of doing so (usually only evil-aligned fungus
    gargoyles do this). A typical fungus gargoyle stands about 5 or 6 feet tall
    and weighs up to 200 pounds. Though its shape can vary, most resemble ugly
    winged humanoids.
  - >-
    Fungus gargoyles typically ambush their prey, standing motionless until
    their opponent moves close. The fungus gargoyles then leap to the attack,
    slashing with their claws. Most fungus gargoyles try to stay airborne during
    combat rather than fight on the ground.
