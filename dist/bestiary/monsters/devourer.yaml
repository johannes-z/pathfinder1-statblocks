SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Devour Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      By making a touch attack as a standard action, a devourer can deal 12d6+18
      points of damage as if using a slay living spell. A DC 22 Fortitude save
      reduces this damage to 3d6+18. The soul of a creature slain by this attack
      becomes trapped within the devourer's chest. The creature cannot be
      brought back to life until the devourer's destruction (or a spell
      deflection-see below) releases its soul. A devourer can hold only one soul
      at a time. The trapped essence provides a devourer with 5 essence points
      for each Hit Die possessed by the soul. A devourer must expend essence
      points when it uses a spell-like ability equal to the spell's level (for
      sake of ease, spell levels for its spell-like abilities are included in
      its stats to the left in superscript). At the start of an encounter, a
      devourer generally has 3d4+3 essence points available. The trapped essence
      gains one permanent negative level for every 5 points of essence
      drained-these negative levels remain if the creature is brought back to
      life (but they do not stack with any negative levels imparted by being
      brought back to life). A soul that is completely consumed may only be
      restored to life by a miracle or wish. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Spell Deflection (Su)
    description: >-
      If any of the following spells are cast at the devourer and overcome its
      spell resistance, they instead affect a devoured soul: banishment, chaos
      hammer, confusion, crushing despair, detect thoughts, dispel evil,
      dominate person, fear, geas/quest, holy word, hypnotism, imprisonment,
      magic jar, maze, suggestion, trap the soul, or any form of charm or
      compulsion. While none of these effects harms the soul, the caster makes a
      DC 25 caster level check when a spell is deflected-success indicates that
      the trapped soul is released from its prison and the creature whose body
      it belonged to can now be restored to life as normal.
Description:
  - >-
    Devourers are the undead remnants of fiends and evil spellcasters who became
    lost beyond the farthest reaches of the multiverse. Returning with warped
    bodies, alien sentience, and a hunger for life, devourers threaten all souls
    with a terrifying, tormented annihilation. These withered corpses stand 10
    feet tall but weigh a mere 200 pounds.
