  - name: Head Bowl (Su)
    description: >-
      The basin atop a kappa's head contains water from its home river or lake.
      The water is emptied only if the kappa willingly tips its head or a
      creature pinning the kappa forces it to do so (requiring a grapple check
      while pinned). If the water is emptied, the kappa becomes immobile and
      staggered. It can still take actions, but it cannot move from the spot on
      its own. If the emptied head bowl is refilled with water, the kappa
      recovers from this condition immediately. This replacement water doesn't
      have to be from the kappa's home, but the kappa refills its head bowl from
      there at its first opportunity.
Description:
  - >-
    A kappa is a strange amphibian resembling a humanoid turtle. It dwells in
    fresh water, preferring a stream or river to a lake or pond. It has a small
    shell on its back, a blunt face, and webbed hands and feet that end in short
    claws. A typical kappa is green in color, but kappa skin tones can vary
    toward blue or yellow hues. The creature has a shallow basin in the top of
    its head, in which the creature carries water from its home at all times.

    Kappas are puckish and like to play tricks on those who pass near or swim in
    their home. Kappa pranks are usually harmless and annoying, such as peeking
    under robes, stealing a bathers' clothing, or pretending to be an aquatic
    predator. A kappa might also challenge others to grappling matches, hoping
    potential foes underestimate its wrestling ability. An angry kappa can be
    dangerous, attempting to drown mounts, animal companions, or even people who
    enter its home waters. The most degenerate kappas have been known to drown
    bathers and eat them.

    Those wise to the ways of kappas know the creatures have a few weaknesses.
    First of all, kappas love cucumbers and horsef lesh. If plied with such
    treats, a kappa is likely to not bother intruders, and might even be
    convinced to offer aid. Further, despite a kappa's penchant for pranks, it
    is unfailingly polite to courteous visitors. A kappa confronted with a
    verbal rebuke rather than combat quickly and almost shamefully apologizes
    for its pranks, begging for forgiveness.
  - >-
    If its head bowl is emptied, a kappa usually remains stationary and pleads
    for help, continuing to fight only if forced to. An opponent who refills the
    kappa's head bowl after spilling it receives the kappa's deepest gratitude.
    Only the wisest and smartest of kappa carry flasks of water with them when
    they are forced to travel far from their home-most kappa don't think this
    far ahead.
