SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Light Pulse (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a moonflower can release a pulse of bright light.
      All creatures within a 50- foot burst that can see the moonflower must
      make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Moonflowers are
      immune to this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Pod Prison (Ex)
    description: >-
      This works like the swallow whole ability, except the moonflower can only
      use it once every 1d4 rounds, and the swallowed creature is immediately
      wrapped in a tight digestive cocoon and expelled into an adjacent square,
      where it takes damage every round (2d6 bludgeoning and 2d6 acid, AC 15, 25
      hp). The cocooned target cannot use Escape Artist to get out of the
      cocoon. Other creatures can aid the target by attacking the cocoon with
      piercing or slashing weapons, but the creature within takes half the
      damage from any attack against the cocoon. Once the cocoon is destroyed,
      it deflates and decays. Each creature swallowed by a moonflower is encased
      in its own cocoon.
  - name: Pod Spawn (Ex)
    description: >-
      Should a moonflower's pod prison kill and digest a Small or larger
      creature, the pod transforms into an adult moonflower with full hit points
      after 1d4 hours. The newly formed moonflower has its own consciousness,
      but some aspect of its trunk or blossoms resembles the creature that died
      within. The dead creature's equipment remains inside the new moonflower
      and can be retrieved by killing it.
Description:
  - >-
    A fully grown moonf lower easily stands 20 feet tall, its massive trunk
    frequently 4 feet or more in diameter. The roots extend away from the base
    and into the soil, making the plant seem well anchored, but the roots
    themselves possess an agility that belies the great size of the plant and
    allows the moonf lower to uproot itself and move with surprising speed. The
    tendrils of the plant are independently prehensile and writhe around the
    large flytrap-like "head" that crowns the stem.
  - >-
    Moonf lowers have never been known to communicate with other creatures, even
    with druids and others who regularly converse with plants.
  - >-
    The plants do possess some manner of strange telepathy, though, and are in
    constant communication with their nearby brethren.
  - >-
    Those who manage to intrude upon the creatures' alien thoughts face an
    assault of horrible visions of terrifying jungles filled with ancient,
    sentient, and malign plants.
