  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      A putrid ooze secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material
      and metal quickly, but doesn't affect stone. Each time a creature takes
      damage from a putrid ooze's acid, its clothing and armor take the same
      amount of damage from the acid (Reflex DC 23 negates damage to clothing
      and armor). A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a putrid ooze takes 2d6
      points of acid damage, unless the weapon's wielder succeeds at a DC 23
      Reflex save. If a putrid ooze remains in contact with a wooden or metal
      object for 1 full round, the object takes 30 points of acid damage (no
      save). The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Splatter (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a putrid ooze can throw a portion of its acidic
      sludge at a creature within 30 feet. The putrid ooze must make a
      successful ranged touch attack to hit the target. Creatures struck take
      3d6 points of acid damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Putrid oozes are primarily made from organic mire animated with Abyssal
    energies. While these creatures can exist near any rift or portal, they're
    most plentiful in the Worldwound. These oozes have become more of a threat
    in recent years, caustically burning through any plants or animals in sight
    in pursuit of their vicious, though mindless, hunger. Putrid oozes
    especially are known for their ability to subsume creatures into their own
    gelatinous bodies once they have destroyed their victims. Putrid oozes
    generally are a combination of churning, gray-and-black slurries, similar to
    chunky tar mixed with wet gravel, but their bodies also hold undigested
    portions of the creatures they consume. At any one time, they present a
    mixture of rotting limbs, severed heads, and entangled entrails among the
    miscellaneous sludge that makes up their bodies. A putrid ooze typically
    covers an area that measures 12 feet by 12 feet, and piles up on itself to a
    height of no more than 8 feet. A putrid ooze weighs about 20 tons.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Putrid oozes terrorize the Worldwound region, presenting yet another danger
    to those brave enough to face the demonic hordes.
  - >-
    How putrid oozes went from caustic environmental hazards to roving, animated
    horrors is still unclear. Some believe that the same strange Abyssal power
    that ripped the Worldwound into the face of Golarion slowly leaked into
    putrid oozes, which already contained substances native to that chaotic
    realm. This bizarre power imbued these oozes with a fundamental need to
    destroy and consume all plants and creatures in their paths. This
    explanation is as good as any-especially because it parallels the conscious
    desires of most Abyssal creatures, which seek the entropy and eventual
    destruction of all orderly existence. In this way, putrid oozes are like
    avatars of the power that seemingly gave them life.
  - >-
    To feed, putrid oozes physically roll over their victims, using their
    caustic bulk to break victims into easily digestible bits. They then churn
    these severed body parts and the other organic components of their prey
    throughout their sludge. For several days, the remnants of a putrid ooze's
    meal can easily be seen as it pulls its bulk across the ground, up walls,
    and even through water. Being resistant to acid, demons break down more
    slowly in a putrid ooze's body; it's not uncommon to find parts of clawed
    demon arms, horned heads, or spine-covered torsos churning around in a
    putrid ooze's bulk long after they were first consumed. Durable metals and
    stonework are also sometimes found suspended in these acidic creatures.
  - >-
    Most hardy materials the putrid ooze consumes are never completely devoured.
    Eventually, putrid oozes break down their meals into the same gray-black,
    chunky morass that makes up their bodies. It's these ones that are
    considered most dangerous, for oozes that are empty are also hungry and
    aggressive. Although it's rare for a putrid ooze to starve-the Worldwound
    contains no shortage of slaughtered bodies and hapless crusaders-those
    weakening from hunger use the last of their dwindling energy to seek out
    chasms or ravines where they can lie in wait, hoping for meals to wander
    past. In these dark places, the putrid oozes go dormant, existing as murky
    pools of sticky acid until a living creature draws near. Though the
    creatures are essentially in hibernation, all it takes is a simple touch to
    awaken them. In contrast, active putrid oozes are intimidating and
    disgusting sights to behold, something not likely to take someone by
    surprise.
  - >-
    Unlike other oozes, putrid oozes do not reproduce via mitosis-splitting into
    two identical, smaller oozes. Instead, they form spontaneously from the
    corrupted rifts surrounding the Worldwound. Some cultists who revere
    Jubilex, demon lord of ooze monsters, have experimented with creating putrid
    oozes by creating disgusting slurries and exposing them to Abyssal rifts and
    foul energies. To date, the cultists have been unsuccessful in their
    endeavors, but the cult has captured half a dozen of these creatures for
    study. They see the spontaneous creation of these oozes as manifestations of
    their Faceless Lord.
  - >-
    When putrid oozes are attacked and take enough damage to destroy them, they
    melt into an inert pool of muck as other oozes do, though whether putrid
    oozes eventually reform from such remnants is a point of debate. Some say
    that sunlight further breaks down putrid oozes once they are destroyed.
    Since the Worldwound has irregular patterns of daylight and even less
    sunlight, it is a relatively hospitable habitat for them. Regardless,
    because the Worldwound is seemingly growing at a steady rate, scholars
    believe these oozes will remain denizens of the region for generations to
    come.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Putrid oozes inhabit most corners of the Worldwound region, particularly in
    areas that bear the strongest Abyssal inf luence. Being mindless and thus
    lacking any sort of culture, putrid oozes have no use for each other-or for
    any other creatures, for that matter, outside of their ability to serve as
    prey. In particularly isolated parts of the Worldwound, where wildlife is
    rarely encountered, putrid oozes turn on each other to eat. In these cases,
    the intense stench of sulfur and death emanating from the creatures-as well
    as any undigested food still churning away inside full oozes' bulk-draws
    other putrid oozes to one another. When putrid oozes feed on their own kind,
    they project narrow pseudopods into the bodies of their intended target in
    an attempt to fish out some half-digested food and draw it into their own
    bulk. Those who have studied these strange creatures note that the use of
    these pseudopods is exclusive to cannibalistic behavior.
  - >-
    Among the crusaders and other goodly souls who inhabit the Worldwound,
    putrid oozes are considered yet another affront to the free and natural
    beauty that was once Sarkoris. Many superstitious people consider putrid
    oozes instruments of the Abyss's destruction-evil blobs that seek to help
    the demons rule the region. The more rational-minded know that putrid oozes
    simply attack all living creatures with impunity, including wildlife,
    plants, demons, and crusaders alike.
  - >-
    Those who have had the misfortune of encountering a putrid ooze and lived to
    tell about it warn all those who venture deep into the Worldwound to stay
    alert for the smell of sulfuric decay, the sound of gravel grating against
    bone, and the sight of suspiciously deep slurries and sludge; these are all
    signs of a nearby putrid ooze.
