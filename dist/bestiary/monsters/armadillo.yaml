    description: >-
      Armadillos can hold their breath underwater for up to 6 minutes. Their
      dense armor naturally causes them to sink; they can inflate their stomachs
      to counter this, accounting for their racial bonus on Swim checks.

      Some armadillos can roll up into a ball, increasing their natural armor
      bonus to +3 but decreasing their speed to 0.
Description:
  - >-
    These squat-bodied mammals are easily recognizable thanks to their
    distinctive leathery shell, which provides them with natural protection
    against numerous dangers and predators in their native environs. Armadillos
    have very poor eyesight, perceiving the world largely through scent and
    touch. They are exceptional diggers, and burrow both to find food and to
    make their dens. When an armadillo goes underwater, it swallows air to
    increase its buoyancy, inflating its stomach up to twice its normal size so
    it won't sink. These stats represent an average armadillo, which is 2-1/2
    feet long and weighs roughly 10 pounds, but other breeds can range from 6
    inches to up to 5 feet long, and weigh up to 130 pounds in the case of giant
    armadillos.
