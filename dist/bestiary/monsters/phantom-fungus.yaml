    description: >-
      As a move action, a phantom fungus can turn invisible as if using greater
      invisibility (caster level 4th). A moment after it attacks with
      invisibility, the creature appears briefly as a semi-transparent version
      of its normal self. This allows any viewer with line of sight to the
      phantom fungus to pinpoint its location at the time of the attack (though
      if the creature moves after it attacks, opponents have to pinpoint it
      again). An opponent can ready an action to strike at the fungus when it
      momentarily appears, in which case the creature only has concealment
      instead of invisibility (20% miss chance). The fungus can turn completely
      visible as a move action, though it normally remains invisible all the
      time. If killed while invisible, it becomes visible 1d4 minutes later.
Description:
  - >-
    A phantom fungus is a tripedal carnivorous plant that roams the vast and
    deep underground caverns of the world. It wanders in search of food, using
    its rootlike feet to detect movement along the cavern floors and the
    sensitive tendrils surrounding its mouth to pinpoint prey.
  - >-
    its ability to vanish from sight. Stealthily patrolling the perimeters of
    caverns, a phantom fungus remains invisible until it is behind its prey, at
    which point it snaps at its victim with its vicious maw.
  - >-
    A phantom fungus prefers to ambush lone creatures. When it encounters a
    larger group, a phantom fungus often stalks prey for hours, waiting for the
    targets to spread out or make camp so that it may attack a single foe at its
    leisure. Though phantom fungi are not normally pack hunters, there are
    reports of groves working together to bring down larger foes. When faced
    with no other option than to attack multiple foes, a group of phantom fungi
    focuses its attacks on single targets. They prefer to attack noisier foes if
    possible-characters wearing heavy armor or those that make heavy use of loud
    attacks (such as bards or spellcasters) are preferred over quieter
    creatures.
  - >-
    The maw with which a phantom fungus attacks prey is lined with row upon row
    of sharp, jagged teeth that resemble pointed rocks more than actual fangs.
    This "mouth" is not used to feed, however, and does not attach to a
    digestive tract-it is nothing more than a gaping natural weapon. When a
    phantom fungus feeds, it does so by squatting down on its prey and infesting
    the corpse with thousands of feeding filaments that burrow through dead
    flesh to siphon away nutrients.
  - >-
    A typical phantom fungus is 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds. Although they
    prefer dwelling underground, they have been encountered above ground as
    well.
