  Presented on these pages are base animal statistics for six additional
  familiars beyond those most commonly used by spellcasters-of course, these
  statistics can also be used for normal animals as well. These familiars
  utilize all the standard rules for familiars presented on pages 82-83 of the
  Core Rulebook. Tiny or smaller familiars in this section use Dexterity to
  modify Climb and Swim skill checks.

  - >-
    A small, slender white bird, the Arctic Tern is well known for its long
    yearly migration. Its travel from its Arctic breeding grounds to its
    wintering grounds off of Antarctica may cover perhaps 40,000 km (25,000 mi),
    and is the farthest yearly journey of any bird.
