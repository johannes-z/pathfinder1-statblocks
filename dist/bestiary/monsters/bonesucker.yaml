Description_Visual: >-
  This bizarre creature resembles a fleshy tree trunk. Atop its main body
  protrudes a mass of writhing tentacles that constantly ooze and drip a
  brownish-yellow fluid. Near the top of its body is a ring of black, unblinking
  eyes.

      of Strength and 1d2 points of Dexterity damage to an opponent as long as
      the hold is maintained.
Description:
  - >-
    A bonesucker is a bizarre creature that stalks the darkness of wastelands
    and dank caves. The body is encased in a thick, rubbery sheath of flesh and
    muscle that makes the bonesucker highly resistant to injury. The bonesucker
    moves about through the use of 5 thick tentacles at its base.
  - >-
    Bonesuckers consume only the bones of an opponent by grabbing it and
    piercing its flesh with its hollow tentacles. The tentacles inject digestive
    enzymes into the bones, which break down and are sucked up as a pasty meal
    for the bonesucker-the attack of a bonesucker is horrifyingly painful.
    Experienced adventurers always know they are nearing the hunting grounds of
    a bonesucker: the creature leaves boneless carcasses of its meals lying
    where it finished them.
  - Bonesuckers stand about 10 feet tall.
  - >-
    A bonesucker attacks with its tentacles. Initially, the tentacles appear to
    be only a foot or two in length, but the bonesucker can extend them to a
    length of approximately 10 feet. It can attack with up to four of its eight
    tentacles in a single round.
  - >-
    A bonesucker's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose
    of overcoming damage reduction.
