Description:
  - >-
    The Old Man is the herald of Irori, a teacher, mentor, guide, and trainer in
    the service of the god of knowledge. He can be patient or irate, confusing
    or enlightening, lenient or strict, depending on what his students need. He
    often wanders Golarion as a mortal man, bereft of his supernatural powers,
    instructing others and leading by example. If attacked when in this limited
    shape, he usually allows himself to be beaten or killed, especially if his
    "death" would provide a powerful lesson to an important student. If slain as
    a mortal, he simply reincarnates in his celestial form, unharmed, and never
    bears a grudge about it.
  - >-
    The Old Man's true form is that of an elderly human man, perhaps of Tien or
    Vudrani ancestry but never clearly identifiable as such. He is typically
    bald and wiry, and usually wears a long white moustache or beard. Though he
    appears frail and may support himself with a cane, crutch, or staff, he is
    incredibly strong and can move with an alien grace when he so chooses. He
    may dress in a simple robe, an elaborate ceremonial garment, or a simple
    loincloth. He is often accompanied by one of five animals: a turtle, monkey,
    ox, rooster, or pig.
  - >-
    When not acting on Irori's behalf, he likes tending to animals, planting
    gardens, meditating, practicing martial arts forms, swimming, and quipping
    with pretty young students.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    The Old Man enjoys exceedingly spicy food, good wine, hearty bread, plain
    rice, seasoned noodles, and many other kinds of Tien and Vudrani food. He of
    course does not need to eat, but he enjoys the taste and the act of sharing
    a friendly meal with mortals. He is normally an example of moderation, but
    once each year he indulges himself in an episode of gluttony and excess,
    telling raucous jokes, challenging others to wrestling matches, and pinching
    bottoms. His antics are meant in good fun, and the targets are usually folks
    too full of their own superiority to recognize their shortcomings- folks who
    could stand a good roast, throwdown, or goosing.
  - >-
    The Old Man exists mainly to teach, but takes violent action when necessary
    to protect something of value to his god or destroy a threat to Irori's
    church. Because he can deal with threats in a nonlethal manner, he may try
    to subdue and humble an opponent who is merely arrogant or misguided rather
    than malevolent, but when necessary he has been known to crush the skulls of
    giants with his bare hands and break the spine of a raging dragon. When in
    battle, he takes great care to avoid damaging mortal structures, especially
    places of study, worship, or meditation, preferring to lure his opponents
    elsewhere-often by pretending to be a coward.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    The Old Man loves to see people achieving their potential, even if a
    person's lifetime limits that potential.
  - >-
    He enjoys watching over favored students in successive lifetimes, guiding
    them in different ways each time. His soul is that of a teacher, and
    sometimes he claims to be one of Irori's first followers when the god was
    just a great mortal. If a person genuinely asks him for help with something
    (as opposed to an enemy asking as part of a ruse), he can't help but offer
    some assistance or guidance, even if he can only contribute a strong back
    and steady hands-but only if the person asking would otherwise be willing to
    do the work without help. He often says, "It is not enough to pray for a
    thing; you must work for it-the work is the prayer." The faithful claim that
    he has helped build hundreds of temples in Vudra, whether by moving heavy
    stones or simply carrying meals to hungry workers, never revealing his true
    identity or asking for payment, but accepting simple things if offered, such
    as a loaf of bread, a cup of wine, or a bowl of rice.
  - >-
    When called to Golarion with mortal magic, the Old Man is not so generous
    with his efforts, for he feels that anyone powerful enough to call him can
    afford to pay for his services. He is not interested in gold and jewels, but
    accepts magic items that can aid young monks in their training and travels;
    rare books of history that contain valuable anecdotes; magic that increases
    Intelligence or Wisdom; and pledges to build or restore temples, shrines,
    schools, and monasteries of Irori in places that could benefit from such
    attention. While he often proves curt when summoned, he quickly assesses the
    honest needs of whoever called him and proves quick to act if their wishes
    parallel the will of Irori.
  - >-
    In battle, the Old Man is fierce and direct in his attacks and elusive and
    flexible in his defense. He often uses his abilities to make himself nearly
    impossible to hit, striking carefully at his opponent to weaken or disable
    it so he can finish it off quickly. He prefers fighting with his hands or
    simple weapons such as a club or a staff, and against flying foes he throws
    individual pebbles the size of sling bullets, usually picking up a handful
    at a time but sometimes pulling them out of thin air. After a battle,
    followers of Irori look for any pebbles touched by the Old Man, noting the
    impressions of his fingerprints in the stones and the subtle aura of Irori's
    blessing. The followers use the pebbles thereafter as reliquaries in a
    temple or shrine, or incorporate them into magic items or simple jewelry.
  - >-
    Sometimes, if the Old Man thinks a dangerous foe can be humbled by a
    crippling injury and might alter its character because of this, he tries to
    put out one of an enemy's eyes to teach it a lesson, and only destroys its
    other eye if the creature continues to fight (see page 193 of Pathfinder RPG
    Ultimate Combat for details on called shots). He uses his maneuverability on
    land, air, and water to his best advantage, especially if he can slow an
    opponent in difficult terrain. He considers no creature to be his enemy, but
    willingly battles those who choose to be his opponent.
  - The Five Animals
  - >-
    Sometimes the Old Man appears or travels with one of five animals. They do
    not have unique names, and he addresses them merely as Turtle, Monkey, Ox,
    Rooster, and Pig. They obey him as any well-trained animal might obey its
    owner, though they can be temperamental and sometimes refuse to follow
    commands. They do not appear to be more intelligent than common animals or
    have any unusual powers (nothing that couldn't be taught with conventional
    training using the Handle Animal skill), though they immediately vanish if
    attacked. The animals may actually be detailed, lifelike projections of
    animals from the Old Man's mind or perhaps something like a summoner's
    eidolon, used to present himself as a common man or provide lessons on
    patience and kindness, but he treats them as if they were individual living
    creatures he has known for a long time. There may be a secret significance
    to which animal he brings with him for a particular task (other than the
    obvious, such as using Ox to pull a plough, which of course Rooster cannot
    do), but his followers have been unable to spot a pattern in these choices.
