Description:
  - >-
    Resembling giant rats with desiccated, leathery skin, and patches of missing
    fur and flesh, the rat-ghoul is created when normal or dire rats feast on
    undead flesh, or being inundated with black magic or necrotic forces.
    Rat-ghouls may be found in any evil area, and they act much as normal rats
    in their typical environments.
  - >-
    Rat-ghouls retain a spark of their former rat intelligence. They tend to
    stay in packs, looking to feast on flesh and detritus. If no "normal" food
    is available, the rat-ghouls begin feasting on each other, and then possibly
    even themselves, so strong is their hunger.
  - >-
    Rat-ghouls attack en masse, and attempt to overrun their opponents.
    Rat-ghouls that successfully take an opponent to the ground swarm and eat
    the creature as soon as possible. Rat-ghouls retain the ability to paralyze
    foes as normal ghouls.
