Description_Visual: >-
  This undulating, amorphous sac is a turgid, brown-black mass scarcely hiding a
  seething jumble of rounded subcutaneous masses churning within. One end opens
  into a yawning maw, revealing a fiery cauldron of innumerable, lidless
  eyeballs of every size, shape, and color, each wreathed in sooty orange flame.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burning Blindness (Su)
    description: >-
      When an azgenzak confirms a critical hit or a creature fails its save
      against the distraction attack of its swarming pyrocules, the azgenzak
      attempts to pluck out one of the target's eyes (Fortitude DC 20 negates).
      If the save fails, the target takes 1d6 additional points of fire damage,
      is sickened by pain for 1d4 rounds, and becomes permanently dazzled. If
      this results in the loss of all of the target's eyes, it is permanently
      blinded.
  - name: Inversion (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a move action, an azgenzak can invert its sac-like body, turning itself
      inside out and exposing its innumerable burning eyes. Doing so surrounds
      the azgenzak with a fiery aura and activates its frightful presence
      ability. These abilities are suppressed when the azgenzak is not inverted.
      When it's inverted, creatures adjacent to the azgenzak take 2d6 points of
      fire damage and risk catching on fire. A successful DC 16 Reflex save
      halves this damage and keeps the creature from catching on fire. An
      inverted azgenzak loses its racial bonus to Stealth underwater and takes a
      further -10 penalty on Stealth checks. In addition, when inverted, an
      azgenzak can't swallow its victim whole; however, if it begins its turn
      with a creature grappled, it can revert itself as a move action and then
      use its swallow whole ability. A creature swallowed by an azgenzak is
      subject to its fiery aura and frightful presence even when the azgenzak is
      not inverted.
  - name: Swarming Pyrocules (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, an azgenzak can disgorge a swarm of burning
      eyeballs. This swarm has the same statistics as a bat swarm (Pathfinder
      RPG Bestiary 30), except it lacks the wounding special ability, which is
      replaced by the azgenzak's burn ability and immunity to fire. An azgenzak
      using this ability takes 2d6 points of damage (though damage dealt to the
      swarming pyrocules does not damage the azgenzak). The swarming pyrocules
      can't survive long separated from the azgenzak, and take 1 point of damage
      each round at the end of its turn. The swarming pyrocules can be
      reabsorbed by the azgenzak as a full-round action, healing the creature of
      1d6 points of damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Azgenzaks, also called more prosaically "sacks of burning eyes," are
    shapeless predators of unfathomable appetites and undeniable malevolence.
    They might have congealed into existence within some forgotten crack of the
    Outer Rifts, escaping (or being set loose) into the Material Plane ages ago.
    However, many theorize that these beings are entirely natural, primeval
    creatures that fell into savagery or never evolved from their primitive
    state in the first place. Azgenzaks are roughly 8 feet in diameter and weigh
    over 800 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Azgenzaks are amorphous, their bodies composed of a flaccid, leathery outer
    skin enveloping an interior of glistening, wrinkled tissue, which in turn
    surrounds hundreds of cilia-rimmed sockets that weep flammable mucus. An
    azgenzak can suppress its flames by squeezing its sac tightly closed, but it
    rarely does so unless it has need for stealth. If it wishes to maintain its
    flames even when it dives underwater, it simply enfolds a large bubble of
    air within its fundus, seals the aperture with a layer of mucus, and inf
    lates itself into a lumpy spheroid, periodically venting exhaust gases to
    propel itself through the water. A rush of foul-scented bubbles and brief
    flares of deep orange below the water's surface usually accompany such
    venting as jets of flame escape the azgenzak's interior and are snuffed out.
  - >-
    Azgenzaks are primarily carnivorous, though they're able to digest any
    organic material, engulfing it within their flaming cavities. An azgenzak
    that has recently feasted-having swallowed its prey whole-might sink to the
    bottom of a body of water and enfold itself to slowly digest its meal,
    settling into a torpor for days or even weeks at a time. If undisturbed, a
    hibernating azgenzak might appear indistinguishable from an algae-covered
    boulder, a rotting log, or submerged carrion.
  - >-
    Azgenzaks reproduce by asexual budding, which is abetted in some unknown way
    by the vitreous humors found within eyeballs. Its drive to extract the eyes
    of its prey is to further of its attempts at reproduction, as the distilled
    essence of the eyes it steals germinates tissue buds within the depths of
    its stomach. These buds then replicate and mat together into a translucent
    sheath of tissue, with a portion of the eyes within the azgenzak adsorbing
    into this sheath as it grows. Once a sufficient sheath-mass has accreted, it
    begins sloughing off from the parent azgenzak's stomach walls, and is
    eventually disgorged and discarded in a steaming puddle of semisolid
    translucent slime shot through with eyeballs. Now ravenously hungry, the
    parent moves on to feast elsewhere and replenish its discarded mass.
    Meanwhile, the newly birthed azgenzak begins to darken and congeal, baked
    from within by the unquenchable heat of its burning eyes, even as its outer
    tissues are tempered by exposure to open air and water, gradually toughening
    into a mottled brown outer skin. Gorging itself on organic matter, the newly
    formed azgenzak matures within a month and can begin to unleash the swarming
    pyrocules that are its deadly signature.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Azgenzaks are solitary creatures, despising the presence of others of their
    kind as rivals for their hunting terrain. They prefer to make their dens in
    murky lakes, though they are equally happy in swamps, bogs, and even
    slow-moving rivers. They are not powerful swimmers and avoid fast-moving
    water, though they are perfectly capable of climbing out of the water and
    traversing land in an undulant slither. Their malleable mass is able to ooze
    over, around, and between obstacles that might block the passage of a more
    solid creature.
  - >-
    Azgenzaks are sometimes confused with will-o'-wisps in folktales and
    legends, as both dwell in boglands and are blamed for mysterious marshlights
    that lead travelers to their doom. This is because azgenzaks are thought of
    more in terms of the swarming pyrocules they unleash rather than their true
    bodies-the strings of floating, flaming eyes are often believed to be the
    true creature and the "bag" of its body a gate to Hell, a fleshy opening
    into the Abyss, or a shroud stitched from the skins of its victims. In many
    cultures, strange bubbling and dancing marshlights below the water or
    bobbing above bogs are seen as portents of death even when seen in the far
    distance, regardless of the creature responsible. In lands where azgenzaks
    are known to dwell, animals are often blindered at night and children are
    taught to keep shutters and curtains drawn tight to avoid seeing the deadly
    lights.
  - >-
    In truth, azgenzaks are fairly simple creatures, mostly interested in their
    next meal. That said, they prefer the flesh of sentient victims and the
    screams of victims perishing in fear and fire. While they have no love for
    will-o'-wisps, they do sense a certain kinship with them, and more
    importantly they perceive the advantages of working with them to secure
    prey. Will-o'-wisps themselves offer no sustenance for an azgenzak, with
    their nearly immaterial bodies, but an azgenzak's ability to instill fear
    has much to offer hunting will-o'-wisps. The two creatures thus sometimes
    work in concert, with the azgenzak feasting physically upon its victims
    while the will-o'-wisp feeds psychically.
