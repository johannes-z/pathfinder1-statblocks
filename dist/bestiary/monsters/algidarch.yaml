SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Avalanche (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, as a standard action, an algidarch can cause a deluge of
      snow and ice to rains down in a 60-foot radius. This ability has a range
      of 100 feet. Creatures caught in the area take 5d6 points of cold damage
      and the avalanche affects a creature as if hit with a bull rush (CMB +17).
      A DC 17 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Freezing Wind (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, as a standard action, an algidarch can create a freezing
      wind that functions as a wind wall spell (CL 7th) and that deals 5d6
      points of cold damage (DC 17 Fortitude save for half) to creatures
      affected by the wind. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Algidarchs are an offshoot of giants (possibly jotuns or frost giants) and
    dwell in crude structures built atop hills and rocky outcroppings. Entire
    villages are sometimes found jutting from the side of a cliff or hill.
    Villages are normally ruled by a chieftain (a fighter of 6th-8th level) and
    some contain witch doctors or shamans (both being witches, sorcerers, or
    clerics of 4th-6th level).
  - >-
    Algidarchs are a selfish, malevolent race that takes great pride in both of
    those facts. They frequently waylay travelers on nearby roads, stealing
    goods, treasure, women, and whatever else they desire at the time. Captured
    humanoids are kept as slaves or sold to other giant races as slaves.
    Algidarchs rarely eat humanoids they capture. In tough times when food is
    scarce they might, but the meat portion of their diet is generally deer,
    elk, moose, and even mastodon.
  - Algidarch adults stand around 9 feet tall and weigh roughly 1,000 pounds.
  - >-
    Skin color among algidarchs is always pale with a slight hint of blue.
    Algidarchs' hair is always worn long and though color can vary slightly, it
    is almost always white or some shade of white. Most males have long beards
    they wear braided or tied. Females are slightly smaller in stature than
    males, but no less effective in combat. Algidarchs can live to be 225 years
    old.
  - >-
    An algidarch announces its presence by flooding the area with freezing winds
    and a sudden avalanche. This avalanche can take the form of their special
    ability or can be a true avalanche caused by several algidarchs perched atop
    a snow-covered hillside or mountaintop. Survivors are attacked in melee with
    the intent of capturing or killing them. Slain opponents are left to
    scavengers after their bodies are looted.
