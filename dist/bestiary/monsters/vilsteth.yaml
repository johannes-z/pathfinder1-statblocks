Description_Visual: >-
  This fiend seems carved from weathered ivory, and runes and symbols of power
  cover its pale flesh. Its eyes glow an eerie yellow, and horns curl from its
  eerie, mouthless head.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Idolatry (Su)
    description: >-
      When a vilsteth uses enter image, meld into stone, possess object, or
      statue to assume the appearance of a public or religious monument (either
      by entering or controlling an existing object or by taking the semblance
      of one), it can make itself an object of worship and adoration. This
      functions as sympathy (DC 25, CL 18th) upon either a single creature
      within 30 feet or all creatures of the chosen type or alignment within 30
      feet. Any creature that fails its saving throw against this effect must
      attempt an additional DC 25 Will save after spending 24 hours within 30
      feet of the object of worship. If the targeted creature fails this second
      save, it's affected as if under a permanent mind fog effect with respect
      to the vilsteth. This is a curse effect and cannot be dispelled (although
      dispel chaos or dispel evil can remove this effect, as does break
      enchantment).
  - name: Labyrinthine Mindtrap (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a vilsteth is targeted with a divination or mind-affecting
      effect, including effects that simply facilitate mental communication, the
      caster's mind is entrapped within the twisted corridors and pathways of
      the vilsteth's intellect, causing the caster to become dazed (Will DC 25
      negates). Each round on the victim's turn, it can attempt a new saving
      throw to escape this mind trap, ending its turn, but each failed save
      deals 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain to the creature.
      A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to the
      same vilsteth's labyrinthine mindtrap for 24 hours.
  - name: Mindrender (Su)
    description: >-
      When a vilsteth hits with both claw attacks and rends its target, it gains
      a +4 profane bonus on its gore attack for that turn. In addition, if the
      vilsteth's gore attack hits, the target is affected by the vilsteth's
      labyrinthine mindtrap ability, even if the targeted creature already
      successfully saved against that ability in the last 24 hours.
  - name: Unspeakable Truth (Su)
    description: >-
      A vilsteth is surrounded by a mantle of misinformation. Creatures within
      30 feet are affected by a curse that manifests the next time they attempt
      to share information about the vilsteth, including things they have
      observed the demon saying or doing. This curse affects the creature as
      fumbletongueUM (Will DC 25 negates). A successful save negates the curse,
      but if the target fails the save, this curse manifests every time that
      target attempts to talk about the vilsteth. This curse is a mind-affecting
      compulsion effect and can't be dispelled or suppressed with protection
      from evil. A vilsteth can order creatures affected by charm or compulsion
      effects that it creates to share information about it without triggering
      the curse.
Description:
  - >-
    Vilsteth demons, also known as corruption demons, are calved from the
    essence of the demon lord Baphomet's realm of the Ivory Labyrinth. Vilsteths
    form from the souls of corrupt and deceitful politicians, priests, and power
    brokers-those who in life abused and misused whatever ephemeral power they
    wielded. The defining sin of these souls was pride, fueled by vanity and a
    desire for adulation and ever-greater authority to be wielded in whatever
    selfish way they saw fit, coupled with a furious envy of anyone more
    beloved, respected, or feared than they. Vilsteths epitomize these traits,
    and can often be found lurking in monuments dedicated to important political
    figures or disguised within statues of prominent saints and heroes. In their
    natural form, vilsteths are over 7 feet tall and weigh 400 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Like all demons, vilsteths aren't born in a biological sense. Instead, the
    souls of corrupt mortals find their way to Baphomet's Ivory Labyrinth after
    judgment, and in there gradually transform into these crooked beings. From
    their positions of power, the sinful souls that birth vilsteths manifested
    every kind of malfeasance, from pecuniary greed to self-indulgence of
    gluttony, sloth, and lust in life, but the common thread is always the
    arrogation of the self over the state or church or whatever organization
    upon which they presided, coupled with a narcissistic smugness that their
    pride and pleasures were of greater import than any other consideration. Of
    course, these sinful leaders' cynical pragmatism demanded that they keep
    their perverted proclivities secret, as they knew those beneath them would
    never understand, so each spun an ever-expanding labyrinth of lies to keep
    their corruption under cover. Some succeeded, living out their days shrouded
    in their sinister secrets; others failed spectacularly, leading to
    dissolution, schism, treason, social collapse, and revolution when the
    extent of the awful truth finally surfaced. Whether their sins were ever
    exposed, however, their corrupted pride and devious secrecy drew their souls
    into the Abyss and the Ivory Labyrinth of Baphomet, where they formed into
    vilsteth demons.
  - >-
    Vilsteths do not eat or drink in the usual sense. Their faces are like ivory
    masks-unmoving, impassive, and implacable, with only the glow of their amber
    eyes to mark their attention. Instead, they are emotional parasites, feeding
    on the reactions of others, sowing confusion and suffering and feasting upon
    the psychic residue that follows. Likewise, they do not speak with voices
    that humans might understand. Their communication is purely telepathic, from
    a subtle whisper to a psychic scream, echoing down the corridors of the
    minds of those to whom they "speak" and pushing them, whether gently or
    urgently, toward acts of sabotage, sedition, and sin of every kind.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Corruption demons are often solitary creatures who work independently on
    their schemes, though they sometimes summon lesser demons of like talents to
    further their pernicious agendas of subversion. They amass vast monetary
    wealth for common bribery and for lavish parties hosted by their minions in
    order to tempt and corrupt the unwary and the unwise. They encourage and
    inspire artists and sculptors to raise great monuments and masterworks for
    their own glory, and through these graven images they spy and speak and
    exercise a quiet dominion upon the great and small alike, working through
    prominent and respected leaders to delude the masses and subvert the common
    good.
  - >-
    When vilsteths are encountered outside of the Abyss, these demons are often
    found in places where Baphomet's cults hold power. In rural areas, such
    cults may form around insular villages that have abandoned the traditional
    gods of hunt and harvest, trading them for a predatory faith hidden from the
    eyes of outsiders. In urban settlements, cultic cells and clandestine rites
    conducted behind masks and veils work together to suborn existing
    governmental, legal, and cultural authorities. Vilsteth demons may visit
    Baphomet's faithful in either milieu, acting as ambassadors and agents
    provocateur, often sitting in judgment of those who have violated the cult's
    confidentiality and helping to design and implement their agendas for
    anarchy and societal upheaval.
