Description_Visual: >-
  Pale and bloodless, a brutally decapitated corpse lurches forth. Where a head
  should be instead lashes a forest of horrific, unnatural tentacles, whipping
  as though trying to simultaneously burrow deeper into and escape from its
  fleshy husk.

    description: >-
      Whenever a spawning canker deals damage to a sentient living creature with
      its constrict attack, it also deals 1d3 points of Charisma damage as it
      feeds off the victim's vital essence. If a spawning canker drains 10
      points of Charisma in 1 hour, the canker immediately spawns (see below).

    description: >-
      When a spawning canker has drained enough life force, it bursts apart into
      2d4+2 slugspawn. These wormlike terrors crawl into nearby shadows and lurk
      in wait for any potential hosts to come nearby. The spawning canker is
      destroyed when this occurs. There is a 1% chance that instead of turning
      into slugspawn, a spawning canker transforms into a dark young of
      Shub-Niggurath (see page 78).
Description:
  - >-
    A spawning canker is a terrible dual creature, an unnatural parasite and the
    decapitated humanoid body its tentacles writhe from like a knot of lashing,
    aberrant heads. Few ever see a spawning canker without its humanoid armor,
    but within the chest cavity of these hollowed-out hosts squirms a heartlike
    body contorting with a misassembled mass of fetal features and trailing a
    thicket of spiny tendrils. These tendrils lash from the stump of the host
    body's exploded head, but also riddle the body, taking control of muscles
    and organs like the strings of some abominable puppet master. The body of a
    former host is pumped full of strange excretions and reinforced with the
    tendrils riddling its form, giving what appears to be a crippled frame an
    unnatural strength and speed. Those tentacles that extend forth serve as
    both the thing's sensory organs and its feeding tubes, through which a
    canker drains the essence of other thinking creatures. Once it has gorged
    itself, a spawning canker erupts in a burst of obscene generation, its body
    withering with terrible speed, splitting both its own and its stolen essence
    into tentacles. These limbs split and tear from the remains of the canker's
    body as writhing, dumb slugspawn, parasitic terrors with no desire but to
    infest other living creatures and, through their deaths, spread ever more of
    their terrible kind. A typical spawning canker stands as tall as the
    humanoid body it infests, plus 2 to 3 feet of added height from its dozen or
    so wild tendrils. Slugspawn (CR 5) Bloated alien worms the length of a man's
    forearm, slugspawn are the basest form of a moit of Shub- Niggurath. These
    repulsive creatures possess sluglike bodies the color of rotting algae,
    covered with thick mucus. Vulnerable to the predations of larger creatures,
    slugspawn rarely venture forth on their own. Although they can move at a
    speed of 10 feet per round, slugspawn frequently hide themselves in dark
    pools or shadowy crevices, waiting for the warm flesh and pliant brains they
    crave to come to them. Upon entering a square with a slugspawn in it (or if
    attacked by a slugspawn), a creature must make a DC 16 Perception check to
    note that a slugspawn is something other than a normal slug (though hidden
    slugspawn can be more difficult to detect). If this Perception check is
    failed, the slugspawn leaps upon the creature and burrows into its flesh.
    The creature can attempt a DC 16 Reflex save to avoid the slugspawn, but
    only if the creature is aware of the slugspawn's presence. Any amount of
    damage reduction is enough to provide immunity to infestation. Once a
    slugspawn has infested a living body, it burrows toward the host's skull and
    wraps around the lower brain, growing and feeding upon the energies
    generated by thought. On the first round of infestation, dealing cold damage
    to the victim can kill the slugspawn and save the host-but only if the
    victim takes 10 or more points within 1 round of being infested. Cutting the
    slugspawn out also works, but the longer it remains in a host, the more
    damage this method does. Cutting it out requires a slashing weapon and a DC
    25 Heal check, and deals 1d6 points of damage per round that the host has
    been infested. If the Heal check is successful, the slugspawn is removed.
    After 3 rounds, though, the slugspawn has reached the host's brain and
    cannot be surgically removed without killing the host. Remove disease kills
    any slugspawn in or on a host. After a slugspawn has reached a host's brain,
    it proves to be a beneficial parasite-at least initially. A slugspawn's host
    benefits from complete immunity to mind-affecting effects, as the
    slugspawn's presence confuses and devours such magic. This benefit doesn't
    last for long, though, as after a variable period (typically lasting 2d6
    days in humanoids, though sometimes more or less in other creature types)
    the slugspawn matures into a spawning canker, a new stage in its lifecycle
    that begins with it violently devouring its host's brain, erupting from its
    skull, and taking over the beheaded host body-a near instantaneous process
    that immediately kills the host. The result is a new creature, a spawning
    canker garbed in its former host's skin. If the host is killed before the
    slugspawn fully matures, the parasite undergoes a rapid, emergency
    maturation, taking control of the host body as if it had fully
    matured-though such spawning cankers rarely prove as long-lived as their
    fully matured brethren. Reproductive Rampage Moits of Shub-Niggurath, in
    both their spawning canker and slugspawn forms, exist for a single reason:
    to propagate their fouls species as their unknowable brood mother desires.
    Theirs are not the ways of obsessed cultists or otherworldly masterminds.
    Rather, they are akin to living diseases, massive viruses that infiltrate,
    infest, and overwhelm, desiring nothing more than to spread their kind and
    pave the way for a new, larger generation that might spawn in the name of
    the Goat with a Thousand Young, their very existence being an unholy prayer
    to her power. Moits lack agendas beyond spawning. In their alien
    philosophies, infesting a victim, growing into a canker, and then
    "ascending" is the ultimate glory. While slugspawn have only an instinctual
    impression of their role in the greater cycle, spawning cankers are true
    fanatics, obsessed with propagation. While they avoid competing with others
    of their kind, if resources are limited, each canker seeks to assure that it
    can spawn. The moits have no interest in rationing humanoid hosts to assure
    their allies or spawn have the means to reproduce. Instead, they care only
    for the moment and the immediate potential to spawn. Thus, whole regions
    might be wiped clean by the infectious invasion of these moits, which grow
    all the more desperate as hosts and, by extension, opportunities to fulfill
    their lives' only purpose diminish.
