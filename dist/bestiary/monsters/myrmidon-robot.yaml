SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Combined Arms (Ex)
    description: >-
      When taking a full-attack action, a myrmidon can attack with melee and
      ranged integrated weapons simultaneously.
  - name: Laser Rifle (Ex)
    description: >-
      A myrmidon's eye is an integrated laser rifle. This weapon has a range
      increment of 250 feet.
  - name: Quantum Lash (Ex)
    description: >-
      A myrmidon's two facial tentacles lash out with surprising force, and are
      capable of extending up to a reach of 20 feet. These lashes are primary
      attacks that deal force damage on a successful hit. They resolve as touch
      attacks, but the damage dealt is not modified by Strength, nor can it be
      improved via Power Attack. A quantum lash threatens a critical hit on a
      19-20. A quantum lash that strikes a force field or force effect has a
      chance to disrupt that effect. Against a magical force effect like a wall
      of force, the myrmidon makes a special check as if it were casting dispel
      magic against the effect (CL 11th). Against a robot's force field, the
      robot struck must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or its force field is
      deactivated for 1d10 rounds, after which it returns at the same hit point
      level it was at before it was deactivated. The save DC is
      Intelligence-based.
  - name: Resilient (Ex)
    description: Myrmidons receive a +3 racial bonus on all saving throws.
  - name: Rockets (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a myrmidon can fire a rocket to a range of 800 feet.
      A rocket explodes on impact in a 30-foot-radius burst, dealing 6d6 points
      of fire damage and 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in
      the area (Reflex DC 18 halves). A myrmidon carries a maximum of five
      rockets. Its core can replenish fired rockets at the rate of one per 12
      hours, crafting new rockets from scrap metal and other collected
      components used in the construction process. The save DC is
      Intelligence-based.
  - name: Superior Optics (Ex)
    description: Myrmidons see invisible creatures or objects as if they were visible.
Description:
  - >-
    Myrmidons are highly mobile robots programmed to patrol the skies above
    important locations. They tend to react with swift violence, and often
    interpret any anomalous sensory input as proof of hostile intent and rain
    destruction on the offending target. Most have analyzed enough language to
    communicate, but rarely choose to do so. The Technic League has had little
    success in reprogramming myrmidons to submit to their control, with most
    such attempts resulting in devastating backlashes as the robots run amok
    until destroyed.
