Description:
  - >-
    Hideously ugly, marsh giants dwell in the most desolate of swamps-
    preferably those that share a sodden border with the sea. Marsh giants
    typically use a hooked club called a gaff (wielded in both hands) in
    combat-treat these weapons as flails, save that they do piercing damage.
  - >-
    Marsh giants are hateful thugs bound together by a common zealotry. Powerful
    opponents and beasts are the most prized of meals, though many marsh giants
    are also cannibals-they often attack fellow tribe members just to gorge on a
    particularly fearsome or delicious-looking relative.
  - >-
    deepest seas, creatures they believe are sent by their god. This has further
    contributed to their racial degradation, but the immediate offspring of
    these unholy unions are powerful. Deformed with tentacles, scales, and other
    aquatic traits, these marsh giants are known as "brineborn." They are
    advanced marsh giants with the aquatic subtype, a swim speed of 40 feet, the
    amphibious special quality, and the following additional spell-like
    abilities:
  - >-
    Constant-speak with animals; 3/day-contagion (DC 15), confusion (DC 15),
    quench (DC 14).
