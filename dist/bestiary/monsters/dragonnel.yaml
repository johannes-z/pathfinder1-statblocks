Description_Visual: >-
  This creature looks like a great dragon, at least 20 feet long with a
  serpentine body, long slender wings and a pointed snout or beak that resembles
  that of a pteranodon. Its body is colored reddish-violet with lighter shades
  on its underbelly. A ridge of maroon-colored spines runs the length of its
  body down the center of its back. A mane of frills, white in color, rings its
  head.

Description:
  - >-
    Dragonnels are believed to be either related to dragons or an abomination of
    dragon and pteranodon, as they share the physical characteristics of both
    those monsters. Dragonnels are semi-intelligent and use this ability to
    their advantage when hunting or stalking prey. Dragonnels are fierce
    hunters, though some have been trained by evil humanoids as mounts and
    guardians. A typical dragonnel is about 25 feet long. A dragonnel prefers to
    attack from the air, flying above its prey and then plunging to strike with
    its claws and bite. A solitary dragonnel is usually either hunting or
    returning to its lair from hunting, while more than one dragonnel usually
    indicates a mated pair or family. In such a case, all dragonnels attack in
    concert with one another and usually fight to the death. Training a
    Dragonnel A dragonnel requires training before it can bear a rider in
    combat. To be trained, a dragonnel must have a friendly attitude toward the
    trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check).
    Training a friendly dragonnel requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle
    Animal check. Riding a dragonnel requires an exotic saddle. A dragonnel can
    fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or
    she succeeds on a Ride check. Dragonnel eggs are worth 4,500 gp apiece on
    the open market, while young are worth 9,000 gp each. Professional trainers
    charge 1,500 gp to rear or train a dragonnel. Carrying Capacity: A light
    load for a dragonnel is up to 1,038 pounds; a medium load, 1,039-2,076
    pounds, and a heavy load, 2,077-3,120 pounds. Credit The Dragonnel
