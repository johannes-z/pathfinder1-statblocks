SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fight with Fire (Su)
    description: >-
      A delgeth can strike at the ground with its flaming hooves as a swift
      action, causing blazing sparks to appear in a square of the delgeth's
      choosing within 30 feet. A creature in that square must succeed at a DC 15
      Reflex save or catch fire (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444). The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
  - name: Flight of Flames (Su)
    description: >-
      A delgeth can use its smoldering hooves to ignite the ground and brush
      when it runs or withdraws, creating a blazing trail of fire behind it. The
      fire fills every square the delgeth moves through during its run or
      withdraw action. When the fire appears and on each of the delgeth's turns,
      the flames deal 2d6 points of fire damage to each creature in one of the
      squares of fire and 2d4 points of fire damage to each creature within 5
      feet of such a square but not inside one. The flames gutter out after 3
      rounds, but can be extinguished before then by any means that would
      extinguish normal nonmagical fires of their size. The flames can ignite
      flammable debris, but in normal forest conditions they rarely spread.
Description:
  - >-
    The delgeth is a unique breed of ungulate native to magical forests and
    places where the line between the natural and the supernatural is blurred.
    Delgeths' soaring core body temperature manifests in the elklike creatures'
    flaming hooves and smoldering extremities, both of which the beasts use to
    defend themselves and mark their territory during mating season. Delgeths
    are unpredictable creatures, and are equally as likely to run from predators
    as they are to stand their ground and face off against aggressors. Either
    way, a delgeth is sure to leave a fiery reminder of its passing, the beast's
    flaming hooves blazing a telltale trail through the brush.
  - >-
    Tribal cultures and scholars of the supernatural alike hold the majestic
    delgeth in awe. Though it has an innate connection to flame, the delgeth
    lives in balance with the natural world, allowing natural fires to purge the
    forest of excess deadwood.
  - A typical delgeth stands 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 200 pounds.
