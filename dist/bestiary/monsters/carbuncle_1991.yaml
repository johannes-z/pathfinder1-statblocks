      Carbuncles possess a crude form of telepathy, allowing them to transmit
      mild impressions and remembered sensations to other creatures. This form
      of telepathy cannot convey language or hinder a target in any way (such as
      by transmitting pain). Thus, a carbuncle can relate a feeling of fear or
      the faint smell of leaves, but cannot directly warn an ally of a monster
      or tell of a treasure under a dirt mound.

    description: >-
      As a standard action three times per day, a carbuncle can teleport as per
      the spell dimension door, but only within a range of 30 feet. Upon
      teleporting, the carbuncle leaves behind a perfect replica of itself amid
      a colored flash and the sound of a reptilian choke. This replica
      duplicates the carbuncle in all ways, though it is obviously dead and the
      colorless stone in its head is reduced to worthless dust.

    description: >-
      As a standard action three times per day, a carbuncle can concentrate
      intently on one creature within its line of sight and attempt to impose
      its will upon the target. A DC 11 Will save is enough to resist this
      compulsion. If the target fails to resist, roll 1d6. On a result of 1-2,
      the target gains a flash of insight and a +2 insight bonus to its Armor
      Class for 1 minute. On a result of 3-4, the victim is affected as if by
      suggestion for 1 minute, and must follow a single (usually embarrassing,
      always harmless) suggestion from the carbuncle. On a result of 5-6, the
      victim's thoughts are garbled with those of the carbuncle, imposing a -2
      penalty to the victim's Will saving throws for 1 minute. This is a
      mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Vulnerability to Suggestion (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any mind-affecting spell can affect a carbuncle regardless of creature
      type limitations. A spell like charm person, for example, which typically
      only affects humanoid creatures, can also affect carbuncles.
Description:
  - >-
    Never have legend and misinformation met upon a more inauspicious brow than
    that of the lowly carbuncle. Even the creature's name summons ideas that
    range from the grandiose to the grotesque. Carbuncles appear to be little
    more than ungainly reptiles. What sets them apart, however, is their strange
    magical abilities and the fist-sized gemstone horn jutting from above their
    bulging eyes. Although tales differ regarding the type and value of the
    stone, many claim it is a ruby or garnet. In truth, however, a carbuncle's
    gem is merely a highly ref lective growth, not unlike a fingernail.
  - >-
    Carbuncles exhibit a peculiar attraction to magic-users, especially
    sorcerers with the fey bloodline and any who pack supplies of fresh fruit.
    Many enchanters laud the extraordinary mind-control powers of these intense
    creatures and extol the aid they can offer mages of their field-though
    others consider such tales something of an academic in-joke.

    A neutral spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can gain a carbuncle
    as a familiar at 5th level.
