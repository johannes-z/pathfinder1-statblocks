SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Madness (Su)
    description: >-
      Any sane being within 30 feet of a conscious seugathi must make a DC 20
      Will save each round or become confused for 1 round. A creature that fails
      5 saves in a row becomes permanently insane, as per the insanity spell. A
      seugathi can suppress or activate this aura as a free action. This is a
      mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Confusion Command (Su)
    description: >-
      As an immediate action, a seugathi can issue a telepathic command to a
      confused creature within 30 feet. This allows the seugathi to pick a
      result from the confusion behavior table, rather than the confused
      creature rolling randomly for its actions that round.
  - name: Item Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      A seugathi can utilize spell trigger devices as if it were a spellcaster
      of the appropriate class. As a free action by touch, it can identify all
      spell trigger properties an item has. Use Magic Device is a class skill
      for seugathis.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2
      Wis and deafness; cure 2 consecutive saves. Deafness persists as long as
      the ability damage caused by the poison lasts. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Seugathi are spawned by the hundreds by a single neothelid that has
    performed rituals to impregnate itself. As part of the strange process of
    being spawned in such rituals, the seugathi assimilates an extensive list of
    missions from its parent-once the seugathi completes these missions, it
    perishes. No single seugathi knows the purpose of these commands, but they
    trust that their neothelid masters have a reason for sending them on these
    diverse and usually cruel missions. A seugathi is 14 feet long and weighs
    650 pounds.
