SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Whirlwind Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      When in wind form, a bralani can attack with a scouring blast of wind,
      dealing 3d6 points of damage in a 20-foot line (Reflex DC 17 half ). The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Wind Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A bralani can shift between its humanoid body and a body made of wind and
      mist as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or use its
      whirlwind blast. In wind form, it functions as if under the effects of a
      wind walk spell. It can make slam attacks and use spelllike abilities in
      either form. A bralani remains in one form until it chooses to assume its
      other form. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the bralani
      revert to any particular form when killed (both shapes are its true form).
      A true seeing spell reveals both forms simultaneously.
Description:
  - >-
    Bralanis are among the fiercest and wildest of the azatas, living from
    moment to moment and always on the lookout for chances to test their skill
    in battle. In addition to their elf-like forms, they can take the shape of
    whirlwinds of dust, snow, or sand. In the mortal realm, they are often
    mistaken for djinn. They delight in violent weather, not for the destructive
    qualities of such events, but for the intensity and energy, and many tales
    describe bralani as spirits who laugh as they sail amid the strongest
    storms. Bralanis do not need to eat, but they enjoy doing so. Most prefer
    elven food, fiery human dishes, and spiced wine. Because of their
    similarities to elementals and fey, they sometimes act as intermediaries
    between mortals, elementals, and fey, though they prefer to arrange
    temporary truces that allow the interested parties to conduct their own
    negotiations on neutral ground. When taking the role of mediators-or
    whenever else such opportunities present themselves-bralani are quick to
    suggest friendly competitions or games to end disputes and enjoy creating
    challenges or complicated contests to test both physical and mental mortal
    prowess.
