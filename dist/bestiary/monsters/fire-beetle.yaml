    description: >-

      fire beetle's luminescent glands continue to glow for 1d6 days after its
      death.
Description:
  - >-
    Although nocturnal, the fire beetle lacks darkvision- it relies on its own
    glowing glands for illumination. Caged fire beetles are a popular source of
    long-lasting illumination among eccentrics and miners. Other variations on
    the common fire beetle exist. The two most common variants are detailed
    below. Mining Beetle (CR 1/2): A mining beetle is an advanced fire beetle
    with the advanced simple template and a burrowing speed of 20 feet. Flash
    Beetle (CR 1/2): A flash beetle is an advanced fire beetle that can create a
    bright flash of light once an hour. When a flash beetle does so, all
    creatures in a 10- foot burst must make a DC 12 Fortitude save or be dazzled
    for 1d3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
