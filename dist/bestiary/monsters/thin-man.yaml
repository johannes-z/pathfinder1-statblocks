    description: >-
      Once per day as a move action while benefiting from concealment, a thin
      man can simply vanish from sight. This gives it a +20 bonus on Stealth
      checks and the ability to hide in plain sight for 1 round per Hit Die even
      when there is no cover, concealment, or shadow nearby. If it makes an
      attack, the thin man is no longer in its vanished state. It usually uses
      this ability when attempting to elude pursuit.
Description:
  - >-
    The mysterious thin men of Nuat have long been a part of Rahadoumi legend.
    They inhabited their tiny island home long before human colonists first
    arrived, and the so-called thin men have lived on the periphery of Rahadoumi
    society or among the indigenous cane fields since times long forgotten.
    Their natural coloration and slender frames serve particularly well in
    concealing them from the prying eyes of suspicious humans.
  - >-
    The thin men use their naturally hard and sharp claws to dig narrow burrows
    beneath the fields and copses of the island. Their bodies have few
    bones-instead, their skeletal frameworks are almost entirely cartilaginous
    in nature, which allows them to navigate their tiny burrows with relative
    ease and escape the notice of their human neighbors. Their close connection
    with the earth likewise gives them immunity to natural toxins.
  - >-
    Though the thin men generally keep to themselves, only observing their human
    counterparts from the shadows, on occasion they tire of the meager fare of
    plant roots, grubs, and small vermin on which they normally subsist, and
    catch a local farmer alone in his fields or traveling at night. On these
    occasions, they murder the hapless victim and feast on his remains. Their
    uncanny ability to hide in the endless waving fields of cane lets them avoid
    the patrol of the Pure Legion or posse of vengeful farmers that comes around
    to search for the killer.
