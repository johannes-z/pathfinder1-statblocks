SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Leap (Ex)
    description: >-
      A fungal crawler can perform a special kind of pounce attack by jumping
      into combat. When a fungal crawler charges, it can make a DC 20 Acrobatics
      check to jump into the air and land next to its enemies. If it makes the
      Acrobatics check, it can follow up with four claw attacks against foes in
      reach, but it cannot make a bite attack.

    description: >-
      A fungal crawler is part plant and shares many of the immunities that
      plant creatures possess. A fungal crawler is immune to mind-affecting
      effects, paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stunning.

Description:
  - >-
    Fungal crawlers are a perverse fusion of animal and plant. Over thousands of
    years, they have prospered and spread beneath the world, dominating the
    wildest depths of these underground regions. Like hyenas, fungal crawlers
    are top-tier scavengers. They are efficient hunters, but just as often feed
    on found carrion or take meals from other predators. When times are
    especially lean, fungal crawlers can even survive without food, subsisting
    on radiation and heat absorbed through the fungal flutes covering their
    pale, sickly bellies.
  - >-
    Thousands of breeds of fungal crawlers exist across the world, varying in
    appearance and habits, but all share a few common features. They invariably
    appear as monstrous crickets or locusts fused with fungal growths, often
    topped with mushroom-like caps. This hybridization makes them adept
    survivors, and infestations are notoriously difficult to clear out entirely.
    Their needle-like teeth cannot chew solid food, so most fungal crawlers rely
    on digestive enzymes injected through their bite to make their meals
    palatable. Average specimens grow to 30 pounds and 3 feet in length. They
    reproduce by releasing spores, which remain viable for decades until they
    contact organic matter and eventually develop into small, pale grubs.

    Many subterranean civilizations tame fungal crawlers as guard animals, pets,
    or food. Though simple-minded, they are amicable enough to be trained when
    well-fed. Fungal crawlers hold no loyalties, though, and often flee or
    attack their keepers at the slightest provocation.
  - >-
    Thanks to the bizarre energies that suffuse their homes, fungal crawlers are
    incredibly diverse. They have adapted over millennia to fill every
    environment: flying variants fill subterranean rifts with the deafening
    drone of their wings, while aquatic breeds skim across the surfaces of
    underground lakes, and still others thrive in the fiery chambers and tunnels
    of volcanic networks.
