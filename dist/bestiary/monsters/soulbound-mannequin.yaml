  - name: greater invisibility  Disguise Self (Sp)
    description: >-
      The soulbound mannequin can only disguise itself as the living person it
      used to be at approximately the age it was when its soul was used to make
      the mannequin (this allows it to take the appearance of another creature
      type).
  - name: Soul Focus (Su)
    description: >-
      The soul bound to the mannequin lives within a focus integrated into the
      doll or its apparel, typically a carved mask. As long as this soul focus
      remains intact, it can be used to animate another mannequin, at the same
      cost as creating a new soulbound mannequin. The new mannequin retains its
      personality and memories. A soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and
      a break DC of 20. Susceptible to Mind-Affecting

    description: >-
      Unlike most constructs, a soulbound mannequin is not immune to
      mind-affecting effects.
Description:
  - >-
    A soulbound mannequin is a human-sized improvement on the soulbound doll
    (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 255). The binding process is sophisticated enough
    to leave much of the soul's personality intact. Most are crafted to allow a
    faithful servant to remain with a prestigious family or to allow a dying
    loved one to remain among the living in a limited way. Because the
    mannequin's face is expressionless and its voice has little inf lection, it
    carries several masks that it uses to convey emotions. It often serves its
    creator as a bodyguard, companion, servant, sentry, or even paramour.

    A soulbound mannequin is made from wood or porcelain, with one expertly
    carved mask worth at least 500 gp to serve as the soul focus. Creation
    requires a soul fragment from a creature who dies at some point during the
    creation of the mannequin (this doesn't prevent the rest of the soul from
    continuing on to the afterlife or prevent the body from later being
    revived). An unwilling soul can resist the procedure with a successful DC 20
    Will save.
