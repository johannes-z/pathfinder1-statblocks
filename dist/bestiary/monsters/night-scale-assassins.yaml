Description:
  - >-
    Magnimar has its share of criminal elements, but the Night Scales claim to
    rule the city's cutthroat underworld. Their various operations and misdeeds
    include smuggling, extortion, theft, and even outright murder every now and
    then. Members of the Night Scales range from toughs to pickpockets to con
    artists, following a strict hierarchy of power based on skill as much as
    social connections. Among these ranks, the Night Scale assassins are perhaps
    the most feared members of the thieves' guild. Such assassins are
    responsible for taking care of nosy adventurers or pesky guards who don't
    know to mind their own business. Night Scale assassins work to silence some
    of Magnimar's mouthiest nobles as well as its uncorrupted political figures,
    and it is rumored that if one can get a hold of the shadowy gang, private
    parties might be able to arrange an assassination for a steep price.
  - >-
    A Night Scale assassin puts much care and time into surveying her targets.
    She tails them over the course of a week, noting where they go to market,
    what time they wake up, and whom they talk to on a regular basis. This
    wealth of information allows the assassin to choose the perfect time and
    place for an unsuspecting hit.
