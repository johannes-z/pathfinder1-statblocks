SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Desert Thirst (Su)
    description: >-
      A blue dragon can cast create water at will (CL 28). Alternatively, it can
      destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids
      are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions)
      and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 32)
      or be destroyed.
  - name: Electricity Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A great wyrm blue dragon is surrounded by an aura of electricity.
      Creatures within 10 feet take 2d6 points of electricity damage at the
      beginning of the dragon's turn.
  - name: Mirage (Su)
    description: >-
      A great wyrm blue dragon can make itself appear to be in two places at
      once as a free action for 28 rounds per day. This ability functions as
      project image but the dragon can use its breath weapon through the mirage.
  - name: Sandstorm (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a great wyrm blue dragon can create a sandstorm
      centered on itself with a radius of 1,200 feet. Creatures other than the
      dragon inside the storm take 2d6 points of damage per round in addition to
      the normal sandstorm penalties (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 431). This
      sandstorm lasts for up to 1 hour, but can be dismissed by the dragon as a
      free action.
  - name: Sound Imitation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has
      heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive
      check.
  - name: Storm Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      A wyrm blue dragon can use its breath weapon to create a storm of
      lightning. This functions as call lightning storm but the damage is 24d8.
      The dragon can call down 1 bolt per round as a free action for 1d6 rounds.
      The save DC is 32. Additional uses of this ability extend the duration by
      an additional 1d6 rounds.
Description:
  - >-
    Blue dragons are consummate schemers and obsessively orderly. In combat,
    blue dragons prefer to surprise foes if possible, and are not above
    retreating if the odds turn against them. They prefer to lair near those
    that they control, sometimes even within the confines of a city.
