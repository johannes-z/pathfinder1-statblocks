Description:
  - >-
    Kechs are monkey-like humanoids standing about 6 feet tall and weighing
    about 150 pounds. They make their homes in trees and prefer to move through
    the trees rather than on the ground. They have an almost human organization
    and society among the various tribes and clans. Family units dwell in a
    single lair (usually a hollowed tree or small hut built among the branches
    of a leafy tree). The kech has leathery skin that on first glance resembles
    a covering of leaves and foliage. Kechs attack from ambush, preferring to
    ensnare their prey in pits, traps, or the like. If faced with a weak
    adversary, they attack with a frontal assault, seeking to kill as quickly as
    possible. Slain prey is dragged into the kech's lair and devoured at the
    creatures' leisure. Kech Characters Kechs have racial Hit Dice and can have
    class levels. Kech characters possess the following racial traits. +2
    Strength, +4 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom. Kechs are dexterous and
    hardy jungle survivors. Base speed: Kechs' base speed is 40 feet. A kech has
    a climb speed of 20 feet. Darkvision: Kechs can see in the dark up to 60

    of monstrous humanoid, which provide 5d10 HD, a base attack bonus of +5, and
    base saves of Fort +1, Ref +4, and Will +4. Racial Skills: A kech's
    monstrous humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 5 x (4 + Int
    modifier, minimum 1). Kechs have a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks and a
    +2 racial bonus to Perception checks. Due to their coloration and leaf-like
    skin, kechs have a +10 racial bonus on Stealth checks when in a forested
    area. Racial Feats: A kech's monstrous humanoid levels give it three feats.
