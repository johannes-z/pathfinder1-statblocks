  With a raucous cry and a flurry of feathered wings, this jet-black bird takes
  to the air, an unnatural gleam in its otherworldly eyes.

Description:
  - >-
    The dreaded witchcrow, renowned as a harbinger of ill deeds and misfortune,
    preys on the weak and spies on the unwary. Clever, manipulative, and
    avaricious in the extreme, these foul birds have no conscience and know no
    fear. Witchcrows strive to steal not only victims' most cherished
    possessions, but their hopes and dreams as well. They delight in bringing
    anguish, sowing doubt even as they feign friendly advice designed to tear
    down alliances, dupe the gullible, and compromise the virtuous. Despite
    their deceptive nature, witchcrows can also hold valuable information-or
    come by such if paid to retrieve it.
  - >-
    Witchcrows value arcane magic above all else, not simply as
    practitioners-the birds certainly have their own innate talent for
    witchcraft-but also as collectors. In exchange for their services or
    valuable information, witchcrows trade for scrolls, potions, and other
    lesser magic items. Even if such items go unoffered, an intense covetous
    streak drives witchcrows to pilfer these things if they sense them among a
    bargainer's possessions. Often, they single out arcane casters as targets
    for thievery, closing on casters from a distance with their vanish ability
    and executing flyby attacks to snatch away any baubles they desire. They
    carry such loot back to their nests to proudly share stories of their daring
    raids under the preening adulation of their peers. Prolonged spellcasting
    (casting spells with a casting time greater than 1 round) often attracts
    witchcrows in the area. They stalk spellcasters in groups, watching for
    opportunities to steal from them.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Legends claim the first witchcrows spawned in the Dimension of
    Dreams-hatched from corrupted eggs nurtured by night hags and released onto
    other planes to carry out misdeeds. Whether this tale is true or not, these
    birds often keep company with hags. They sometimes treat with more powerful
    magical beings as messengers, spies, or informants, traveling in groups for
    mutual protection. Each covey or murder also follows a migratory pattern,
    moving between sites of power and areas of unusual magic.
  - >-
    Greater witchcrows not only hoard arcane items, but also are dependent on
    them for reproduction, siphoning away subtle emanations of magical power to
    aid their gestation process. The likelihood of an egg hatching into a
    greater witchcrow increases in direct correlation to the time it spends in
    close proximity to such items. As a result, female witchcrows are much more
    active in stealing arcane objects for their nests and aggressively fend off
    rivals to retain any treasure in their possession. Witchcrows can lay a
    clutch of up to five eggs every year and remain fertile throughout their
    entire adult lifespan-approximately 20 to 30 years.
  - >-
    As a greater witchcrow nears the end of its life, it experiences an unusual
    phenomenon called the Dreaming, in which it enters a fugue state lasting
    nearly a week. During this time, it molts and meditates as it comes to terms
    with the end of its life and attempts to pinpoint its final resting place.
    Usually, this is a place it particularly enjoyed in the past. Once the bird
    determines the location and fixates on it, the remaining members of its
    group invoke their apportation to send it there as its life's reward.
    Thereafter, the others argue and bicker over any magic items left behind by
    the elder witchcrow.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Witchcrows have an affinity for colder climes, and often masquerade as
    normal crows living in the fields and forests near the civilized settlements
    of other creatures. They particularly seek out magical societies where they
    can gain greater access to arcane items. On Golarion, this makes witchcrows
    most prevalent in Irrisen, where they've developed a terrible
    reputation-enough so that the witches of Irrisen (and the people they rule)
    both fear and revile the birds, marking them for destruction whenever they
    find them.
  - >-
    In witchcrow society, greater witchcrows always establish dominance over
    their lesser kin, rising to lead large congregations of the malicious birds
    and shepherding them from one habitat to another. Witchcrows always mutually
    support one another even as they compete for the same resources, following a
    strict social hierarchy that aggrandizes the most successful thieves among
    them. Leaders of any given covey collect and dispense the spoils of their
    activities, assigning arcane treasures to the strongest of their kind during
    mating season. Those witchcrows that contribute little to the group's
    success often find themselves with empty nests during these gatherings-or
    cast out of the flock entirely.
