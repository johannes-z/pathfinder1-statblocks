SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Flower Dart (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a blood bush can launch a barrage of six flower
      darts (make an attack roll for each dart). This attack has a range of 40
      feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each
      other. The creature can launch only 30 such darts in one day.
  - name: Implant (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by one of the blood bush's flower darts is implanted with
      one of its seeds. A seed quickly germinates as follows: Round Effect First
      DC 18 Will save or flee in fear for 1d6 rounds Third Paralysis for 1d4+2
      rounds; DC 18 Fortitude negates Fifth Wounding: 1 point of Constitution
      damage per minute until the seed is removed or destroyed.A seed can be
      removed safely up to 5 rounds after implantation with a successful DC 18
      Heal check or by cutting it from the victim (dealing 1d2 points of
      damage); otherwise only a remove disease spell destroys an implanted seed.
      The save DCs and check DC are Constitution-based.
  - name: Sonic Vulnerability (Ex)
    description: >-
      A blood bush that is subjected to a sonic-based attack or effect (such as
      a shout spell) loses its blindsight ability and is effectively blinded (as
      the blindness spell) for a 1d4+6 rounds.
Description:
  - >-
    The blood bush is a fell plant creature cursed by a wizard in times past. It
    is named for its blood-red flowers and its thorny blood-red seeds. A blood
    bush is sometimes referred to as a "grave marker plant" because a creature
    that encounters it, and fails to see the danger this sinister plant
    presents, rarely lives to tell about it. A blood bush can only be grown from
    a seed that has germinated inside the warm body of a Small or larger animal.
    Roots from the germinating seed kill the host and use the nutrients provided
    to grow rapidly into a deadly plant. A number of nobles use this horrid
    plant as a deterrent against thieves and robbers, sometimes creating entire
    hedges of these plants. A blood bush appears as a flowering bush about 3
    feet tall. Its thick trunk quickly splits off into many smaller, whip-like
    branches, each topped with a blood-red flower surrounded by deep green
    leaves. Blood bush seeds can be sold for about 20 gp each on the open
    market; collecting them and living to earn the money they bring is not the
    easiest of tasks. When a blood bush detects a warm-blooded creature within
    20 feet, it fires a volley of flower darts at the creature, attempting to
    implant it with its seeds. A creature that dies from the blood bush's seed
    implantation rapidly decomposes, and a new blood bush springs up in the area
    within four days. Living creatures within 5 feet of a blood bush are slashed
    and cut with its four whip-like tendrils. Copyright Notice Authors Scott
