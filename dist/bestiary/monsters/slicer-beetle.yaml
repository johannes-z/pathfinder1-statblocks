  - name: Crippling Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A slicer beetle's bite attack threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.
      If a slicer beetle scores a critical hit on a target, its mandibles cut
      deep, resulting in a wound that causes 1d6 bleed and leaving its foe
      staggered for 1d3 rounds from the tremendous pain dealt.
Description:
  - >-
    The slicer beetle sports specialized mouthparts that scissor apart flesh for
    easier consumption. Each side of its horizontally closing mandibles fits
    into the other with barely a hair's breadth to spare. These creatures prefer
    to dwell in compact caves or warrens.
  - A typical slicer beetle measures 10 feet long and weighs 800 pounds.
