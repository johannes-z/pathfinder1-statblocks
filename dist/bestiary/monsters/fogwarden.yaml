SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animate Dead (Su)
    description: >-
      The electrical aura of the fogwarden can animate dead creatures within 20
      feet. This is otherwise identical to an animate dead (caster level 4th).
      The animated creatures resemble zombies (and use their stats) and are
      under the control of the fogwarden that animated them. They are not undead
      however, and cannot be turned or rebuked. If the fogwarden is slain or
      moves more than 20 feet from a zombie, the animated creature collapses
      dead and cannot be animated again.
  - name: Electricity Discharge (Su)
    description: >-
      Electricity constantly plays across a fogwarden's form. Any metal object
      (including metal weapons) that contacts a fogwarden's body takes 3d6
      points of electricity damage. Magic items receive a DC 13 Reflex saving
      throw to reduce the damage by half. Nonmagical items and objects receive
      no save and automatically take full damage. A creature holding the object
      or weapon at the time of contact takes 3d6 points of electricity damage as
      well (DC 13 Reflex save for half).
  - name: Gaseous Form (Ex)
    description: >-
      The fogwarden's natural form is that of fog or mist. This ability is
      similar to the gaseous form spell (caster level 8th), except that a
      fogwarden does not lose its supernatural abilities or its lightning bolt
      ability, and has a fly speed of 40 feet. It is immune to and cannot
      perform combat maneuvers.
  - name: Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex)
    description: >-
      Fogwardens shun sunlight. A fogwarden exposed to sunlight is staggered for
      as long as it remains in the sunlight, and is destroyed utterly after 1
      hour of exposure if it cannot escape.
Description:
  - >-
    The fogwarden is sometimes called the ice apparition, for much like the
    standard apparition, the fogwarden feeds on the fear of its victims. The
    fogwarden, however, is not undead. A fogwarden is usually found inhabiting
    the coldest and most desolate areas of the world. The fog surrounding it
    flashes with its life force. These flashes are often mistaken for the
    will-o'-wisp. Fogwardens favor instilling fear and panic in their opponents
    to actual combat. In melee, the fogwarden attacks by launching a bolt of
    lightning at its foes. When a fogwarden is destroyed, it evaporates
    completely, leaving no trace of its existence. Credit The Fogwarden
