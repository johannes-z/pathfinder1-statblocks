SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Control Clockwork (Su)
    description: >-
      Any clockwork that comes within two miles of a brain gear immediately
      falls under that brain gear's control. If more than one brain gear
      attempts to control a clockwork (or if the clockwork is under the control
      of another brain gear or overseer), each gear must make an opposed
      Intelligence check; the winner gains control of that clockwork. When a
      clockwork moves more than 2 miles away from a brain gear, it continues to
      perform the last order given to it, but there is a 25% percent chance each
      hour that it ceases to function, collapsing into a pile of junk. If a
      brain gear later moves within two miles of the destroyed clockwork, the
      clockwork can reactivate if it has the self-repair ability. Otherwise, it
      remains destroyed. A brain gear in control of at least one clockwork can,
      as a free action once per round, use that clockwork to perceive the world
      through its senses (such as seeing the area surrounding the clockwork).
      This ability has a range of 2 miles. If a brain gear controls multiple
      clockworks, it can instantaneously jump from clockwork to clockwork,
      keeping tabs on all of its thralls and perceiving the world through their
      senses. A brain gear can switch control from one clockwork to another once
      per round as a free action. A brain gear uses this ability to give
      commands to its clockworks, allowing the usually mindless creatures to
      fight with highly coordinated tactics. Each clockwork is capable of
      receiving roughly 100 words worth of orders. Anything beyond that is too
      complicated for the clockwork to handle.
  - name: Dream (Su)
    description: >-
      The brain gear has a limited ability to send psychic messages. Once per
      week, it can create an effect similar to a dream spell (caster level
      10th). The brain gear can contact multiple creatures by designating a
      generic creature type, such as ogre or human. This designation affects
      every member of the target type within a 2-mile radius of the brain gear.
Description:
  - >-
    The original brain gear began as little more than a collection of gears,
    chains, counterweights, and levers, but was enhanced and grown into a
    controlling intellect through a process very similar to flesh golem
    creation.
  - >-
    A brain gear in its true form resembles nothing more than a copper or gold
    box or cube that shines with a pale blue light. It is immobile, cannot
    attack, or speak.
  - >-
    A brain gear is designed to control the actions of all other clockworks
    created by the caster, relieving the creator of having to oversee simple
    operations of the clockworks. A brain gear has no real attacks. It uses its
    clockworks to protect and defend it. Brain gears can be programmed to
    instruct clockworks to perform up to 20 specific tasks and can be programmed
    to instruct clockworks to react to certain situations that it perceives. It
    is rumored that some brain gears occasionally develop an evil intellect and
    turn their charges against its creator.
