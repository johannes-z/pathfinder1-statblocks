  Thin tendrils trail from this misshapen sphere. A gray orb hangs beneath the
  creature like a bulging lidless eye.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Pain Touch (Ex)
    description: >-
      A rhu-chalik secretes an enzyme that coats its tendrils. When this enzyme
      comes into contact with a living creature, it causes excruciating pain.
      Any creature that comes into contact with the enzyme must succeed at a DC
      18 Fortitude save or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks,
      and skill checks for 1d4 rounds. If a creature is affected by multiple
      pain touch attacks, the duration stacks but the penalty doesn't. Creatures
      that are immune to pain effects are immune to this ability. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Project Terror (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a rhu-chalik can harness the fears of any creature
      it has successfully used detect thoughts on within the last minute. This
      effect creates visions of that creature's most terrible nightmares in the
      target's mind; the target must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be
      frightened and take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Void Transmission (Su)
    description: >-
      If a creature takes an amount of Wisdom damage from the rhu-chalik's
      project terror ability that equals or exceeds the creature's Wisdom score,
      the creature falls unconscious as normal. At that point, the rhu-chalik
      can take 10 minutes to copy and absorb the creature's entire consciousness
      and send that consciousness through the void of space to its waiting
      masters. If the creature's Wisdom damage is healed and the creature is
      revived prior to the end of this process, this effect fails. If the
      creature's Wisdom damage is healed after its consciousness is successfully
      transmitted, the creature awakes disoriented, and takes a -2 penalty on
      attack rolls, ability checks, and skill checks for 24 hours. This effect
      otherwise doesn't harm the target, as the target's consciousness isn't
      eliminated, only duplicated and transmitted.
Description:
  - >-
    A rhu-chalik, also called a void wanderer, is an alien entity that scouts
    for a nebulous collection of space conquerors known as the Dominion of the
    Black. In addition to ambitions for dominating the universe, they also
    engage in a curious pursuit: collecting the memories of interesting
    creatures in the universe into a vast repository of knowledge in hopes of
    unraveling every secret of existence.
  - >-
    Though they are theoretically capable of traversing the vastness of space to
    make it to Golarion on their own, the rhu-chaliks encountered here arrived
    on the crashed spaceship Divinity. Years before Divinity crashed onto
    Golarion, the ship's crew discovered rhu-chaliks in a distant galaxy and
    became intrigued with their unique form. They collected a few specimens and
    set about observing the enigmatic creatures. Unknown to the scientists,
    these aliens had allowed their own capture in order to travel to far-f lung
    galaxies where they could explore the thoughts, dreams, and knowledge of
    thousands upon thousands of races the universe over. The rhu-chaliks kept
    their strange abilities secret onboard the ship, content to travel in
    dormancy until the Divinity encountered the Dominion of the Black, at which
    point the creatures shredded the minds of their scientist wardens. Later, as
    the ship crashed on Golarion, the creatures seeped from the vessel and began
    their exploration of this new world flush with sentient life.
  - A rhu-chalik is approximately 3 feet across and weighs only 30 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Rhu-chaliks' anatomy is as alien as their motives. The creatures resemble
    spongy masses of jet-black tissue, with lidless, pupil-less, grayish-white
    eyes at their center and four thin tendrils extending from their mass.
    Rhu-chaliks can hover in atmosphere or float in the dead vacuum of space;
    they don't need to breathe. They're capable of remaining motionless for
    decades, and some claim that their life spans may outlast even the stars
    themselves.
  - >-
    It's assumed that rhu-chaliks are the least powerful of their strange race
    and exist merely to transmit the minds of interesting creatures they
    encounter far into the depths of their masters' domain-a starless void
    beyond the edge of the universe. Those few who have studied rhu-chaliks and
    survived with their minds intact theorize that these creatures are carefully
    sculpted to suit their task, and it's likely that their original form has
    been drastically altered by millennia of specialized breeding into their
    current dread incarnation. There is no existing information about how these
    creatures procreate, and it is assumed that they are artificially crafted by
    their dark masters.
  - >-
    Void wanderers don't feed in the traditional sense, and they lack a mouth or
    any other orifice that can accept food. Some records retrieved from Divinity
    suggest that the creatures use their tendrils to absorb nutrients through
    osmosis, but this is incorrect. Rhu-chaliks maintain their bodily form and
    sustain their lengthy lifespans by feeding off the thoughts and fears of
    sentient beings. Every emotion has a different flavor to these creatures,
    and since their feedings are harmless to the sources of their meals, many
    rhu-chaliks have been observed to dine continuously from the same mind
    endlessly, prodding different emotions to elicit a new taste as if they were
    ordering a new course at a banquet.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Rhu-chaliks are the lesser cogs of a collective of star-spanning overlords
    far beyond the powers of Golarion. Rhu-chaliks serve as scouts and traveling
    collectors that wander through civilizations in search of minds that they
    can twist with fear and agony. Their ultimate goal is to copy the minds of
    those they encounter and send the consciousnesses beyond the stars to their
    masters.
  - >-
    As observers, rhu-chaliks prefer to maintain stealth for as long as
    possible. These small creatures can compress their spongy bodies into a
    fraction of their normal size, and then lodge themselves into tight hiding
    spots so that they can sift through the thoughts of nearby sentient
    creatures. If discovered, rhu-chaliks leave their hiding places, but they
    are quick to return once they're confident that they can reestablish
    secrecy.
  - >-
    Millions of these strange horrors are cast out from their dark domain every
    moment, hurtling through space until they encounter some alien race or world
    not yet probed by the dark masters of their native space. From their far-f
    lung redoubt, rhu-chaliks observe the churning cosmos,
  - >-
    gathering every speck of information and every thought ever birthed by the
    minds of a thousand races of alien species.
  - >-
    In the dark space from which they hail, catalogs of entire civilizations
    hang in a surreal miasma of misplaced minds shrieking out in disembodied
    agony for all eternity, with their every desire, fear, secret, and scrap of
    understanding exposed like raw nerves for invasive perusal. The creatures
    who survive having their consciousnesses copied and transmitted are often
    unaware of the transmission, and little realize that their most private
    moments will be pored over endlessly by alien minds.
  - >-
    Rhu-chaliks serve their masters tirelessly, and are as patient as they are
    long-lived. They rarely make an uncalculated move, and seek only the most
    prized intellects to cast into the dark beyond for their master's
    delectations. When exploring distant worlds, rhu-chaliks are not social
    beings, and they avoid other rhu-chaliks in hopes that their predations
    won't cause too much overlap in the mind collection clouds of their masters.
    However, back in their native space, rhu-chaliks number in the billions, and
    the creatures feed off a countless number of disembodied minds.
