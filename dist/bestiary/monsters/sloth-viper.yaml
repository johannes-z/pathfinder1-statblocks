    description: >-
      A sloth viper is inherently quick and can take an extra standard action or
      move action during its turn each round.
Description:
  - >-
    The sloth viper is a lightning-quick predator most often found in dense,
    thick jungles or overgrown swamplands. The typical sloth viper is 9-10 feet
    long, though they can grow to a length of 20 or more feet. They subsist on a
    diet of small animals, preferring birds, lizards, and small mammals to
    others. They are fearless however, and do not hesitate to attack much larger
    prey such as cheetahs, leopards, and even lions. Once the sloth viper has
    fed, it often recoils high above the ground, under the thicket and blanket
    of leaves, branches, and limbs where it sleeps for the next 1d6 days.
  - The sloth viper is a solitary predator; rarely is more than one encountered.
  - >-
    If such an encounter takes place, they are often a mated pair, with a nest
    of eggs nearby. A sloth viper's lair is a dense thicket of natural
    underbrush and trees. A typical nest contains 1d4 emerald colored eggs.
  - >-
    Sloth vipers are hunted by some humanoids for their scales and poison (which
    is rumored to be valued by spellcasters for its properties).
  - >-
    Sloth vipers are ambush hunters and wait patiently among the limbs and
    branches of trees for potential prey to pass underneath it. When
    unsuspecting prey is in range, the viper either drops on it from above, or
    snaps down quickly with its vicious bite, recoiling back into the trees
    afterwards.
