SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ice Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a standard action, a frost man can release a blast
      of freezing mist in a 30-foot cone from the eye underneath its eye patch.
      A frost man can remove its eye patch as a free action. A creature in the
      area takes 3d6 points of cold damage (DC 13 Reflex for half). The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Frost men are hunters that make their home in the cold regions of the world.
    Each carries his personal belongings in small sacks and takes them wherever
    he goes. A frost man's body radiates cold out to 30 feet, though not enough
    to deal damage. There is much speculation on the society of frost men. Other
    beings only encounter them as lone males. Speculation suggests that there
    must be villages somewhere with women and children, perhaps buried deep in
    cold mountain caves. Tribes that are aware of frost men fear them greatly
    for their deadly talent and refer to them as "ice demons." Frost men appear
    in the outside world occasionally and wish only to go about their unknown
    business undisturbed. Anyone bothering them can expect to be attacked. A
    frost man usually opens combat with its ice blast before moving in to kill
    off anything not subsequently frozen to death. Frost Man Characters Most
    frost man leaders are fighters or fighter/rogues. Sorcerers, rogues, and
    clerics are not uncommon among frost men. Frost men clerics can choose any
    two of the following domains: Earth, Evil, Law, Water. Frost men characters
    possess the following racial traits. +2 Dex, +2 Con: Frost men have good
    balance and are quite hardy. Darkvision: A frost man can see in the dark out
    to 60 feet. Immune: Cold. Weakness: Vulnerability to fire. Armor: Frost men
    have a +2 natural armor bonus. Racial Hit Dice: A frost man begins with four
    levels of humanoid, which provide 4d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +3,
    and base saving throw bonuses of Fort +4, Ref +1, and Will +1. Special
    Attacks (see above): Ice blast. Racial Skills: A frost man's humanoid levels
    give it skill points equal to 4 x (2 + Int modifier). Racial Feats: A frost
    man's humanoid levels give it two feats. Automatic Languages: Common, Frost
    Man. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Elven, Giant, Gnoll, Orc. Credit The Frost
