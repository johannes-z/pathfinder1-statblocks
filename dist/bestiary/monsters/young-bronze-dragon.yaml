SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A young or older bronze dragon can take any animal or humanoid form 3/day
      as if using polymorph.
  - name: Electricity Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      An old or older bronze dragon has an aura of electricity. All creatures
      within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the start of the
      dragon's turn. An ancient dragon's aura is 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage
      increases to 2d6. A bronze dragon can suppress this aura at will.
  - name: Repulsion Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Instead of a line of electricity, a bronze dragon can breathe a cone of
      repulsion gas. Targets must make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing
      but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age
      category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. Spell-Like
  - name: Abilities (Sp)
    description: >-
      A bronze dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will
      upon reaching the listed age category. Very young-speak with animals;
      Juvenile-create food and water; Adult-fog cloud; Old-detect thoughts;
      Ancient-control water; Great wyrm-control weather.
  - name: Tidal Wave (Su)
    description: >-
      A great wyrm bronze dragon can cause the sea to rise up and crush his
      enemies once per day as a standard action. This affects an area of
      coastline 120 feet in length and targets all creatures within 40 feet of
      the shore-treat the targets as if struck by an avalanche (Pathfinder RPG
      Core Rulebook 429). Treat all creatures as if they were in the bury zone.
      The save DC to halve this damage is equal to the dragon's breath weapon
      DC. Those who fail their saves take full damage and are drawn 60 feet off
      shore and deposited 20 feet under the surface on the round after the wave
      hits.
  - name: Vortex (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, an ancient or older bronze dragon can create a vortex as a
      standard action, just like an elder water elemental (see page 127). A
      bronze dragon can maintain this vortex for 1 round per age category.
  - name: Water Breathing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bronze dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and
