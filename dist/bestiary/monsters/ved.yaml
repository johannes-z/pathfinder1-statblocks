SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gale Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Every 1d4 rounds as a full-round action, a ved can draw in a mighty breath
      and expel it outward in a 30-foot cone. Targets within 10 feet of the
      origin of this cone must succeed at a DC 18 Strength check or be knocked
      prone. Those who succeed at the check or are standing farther away from
      the ved treat the effects of the gale breath as a gust of wind spell.
Description:
  - >-
    When Baba Yaga invaded the eastern Linnorm Kingdoms, she brought these
    ungainly giants with her and left them here to fend for themselves once they
    had helped her conquer Irrisen.
  - >-
    Brutish and rather stupid, these humanoids are clannish and shun even
    lightly populated areas, preferring the cold hills and mountains of southern
    Irrisen.
  - >-
    Occasionally a gang of veds (often an adult leading two or three
    adolescents) carries out raids against the mining camps in that region,
    claiming the lives of half a dozen miners or slaves. But such forced labor
    is easily replaced, and the Jadwiga overseeing operations in the region
    don't view these depredations as a serious threat to their extraction
    industry.
  - >-
    Clans of veds rarely consist of more than a few mated pairs, their
    offspring, and one or two aged specimens that are commonly left to die when
    they become unable to pull their weight. Veds are omnivores; they prefer
    meat (eaten raw), but aren't averse to consuming winteryew bark for
    nourishment.
  - >-
    Perhaps the most unusual aspect of veds is their enormous lung capacity,
    which they are able to use quite aggressively. These giants can expel air
    from their lungs in a mighty blast, extinguishing small fires and knocking
    prone any who stand before them. The veds then descend on their victims,
    pummeling their prey viciously with simple but effective clubs.
