Description:
  - >-
    Giant falcons are birds of prey that build their nests high atop mountains,
    cliffs, or other places, inaccessible to most other creatures. They are
    nocturnal hunters that enjoy swooping down on unsuspecting prey, scooping it
    up, and flying back to their nest to dine on the meal. Giant falcons prey on
    animals such as birds (normal and giant), reptiles, and rodents. Prized
    meals include snakes (both normal and giant), dire rats, and small
    humanoids. Prey is captured and carried to the nest, where it is devoured
    later or fed to the young. Mating season for giant falcons varies, but
    typically occurs during the summer months. The female lays 1d4+2 eggs which
    hatch about two months later. Within 40 days, the young falcons are fully
    feathered and capable of hunting. Many leave the nest for good and go out on
    their own. A typical giant falcon stands nine feet tall and has a wingspan
    of up to 18 feet. Feather coloration varies, but typically ranges from
    brownish-red to brown. Its eyes are brown and its wings are tapered. The
    giant falcon has a short, slim tail consisting of brown, white, and black
    feathers. Most giant falcons have a light-colored chest with white
    predominant on the neck and throat and slowly fading as it reaches the
    abdomen. Giant falcons are generally solitary hunters, though excursions
    consisting of up to four of these creatures are not unheard of. Such hunting
    teams communicate with each other, relaying their position as well as the
    position of their target through vocalizations consisting of loud squawks
    and cries. A giant falcon attacks by swooping down on its foe and raking
    with its talons and stabbing with its beak. Training a Giant Falcon A giant
    falcon must be trained before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained,
    a giant falcon must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be
    achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly giant
    falcon requires six weeks of work and a successful DC 25 Handle Animal
    check. Riding a giant falcon requires an exotic saddle. A giant falcon can
    fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or
    she makes a successful Ride check. Giant falcon eggs are worth 1,500 gp each
    on the open market, while young bring the sum of 3,000 gp apiece.
    Professional trainers charge up to 1,000 gp to rear or train a giant falcon.
    Carrying Capacity: A light load for a giant falcon is up to 258 pounds; a
    medium load, 259-519 pounds; and a heavy load, 520-780 pounds. A giant
    falcon can drag up to 3,900 pounds. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
