Description_Visual: >-
  Its head and fins are dark grayish-green.  A turtle-shark surprises many foes
  with its quickness in the water. Many assume that it is as slow as its other
  shelled kin, and underestimate its shark-like speed. Like its predatory
  cousins, a turtle-shark attacks nearly anything it can reach, especially if
  there is blood or activity in the water.

Description:
  - >-
    This fiendish monster is likely to be encountered when adventurers are
    crossing or journeying near the River Styx as it winds through the
    underworld. Swimming lazily through the mind-poisoning waters of the river,
    the Stygian turtle-shark spends much of its time hunting other natives of
    the river, though the occasional adventurer who happens to fall into the
    river or wander to close to its shore makes just as tasty a meal.
  - >-
    Charon, charonadaemons, and various demon lords often employ these monsters
    as guards.
  - >-
    A Stygian turtle-shark normally begins combat using its Power Attack feat.
    If it grabs an opponent in its mouth it is just as likely to swallow it as
    it is to dive as deep in the water as it can in an effort to drown its prey.
