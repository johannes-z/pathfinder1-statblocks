  - name: Spit Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      Every 1d4 rounds, a giant slug can spit a line of acid at an opponent

Description:
  - >-
    Giant slugs are found in moist or wet environments such as swamps, marshes,
    rain forests, and dungeons. They are both scavengers and predators feeding
    on both plants and animals. Giant slugs are nocturnal creatures and spend
    the daylight hours away from the heat of the sun.
  - >-
    On extremely hot days, giant slugs bury themselves in debris where they
    secrete a thick coating of mucus that covers their entire body and protects
    them from the heat.
  - >-
    Giant slugs are larger versions of normal slugs. They are pale gray in color
    with a dull white underbelly. They have a single pair of long, thin
    tentacles or antennae. The giant slug uses them to sense brightness, heat,
    and to smell.
  - >-
    A giant slug begins combat by spitting a line of corrosive saliva at an
    opponent. It then moves into combat and uses its bite attack.
  - A typical giant slug is 20 feet long but can grow to twice that length.
