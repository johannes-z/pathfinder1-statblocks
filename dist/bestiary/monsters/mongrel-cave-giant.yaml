Description:
  - >-
    Giants are a diverse race that can be found nearly anywhere on Golarion. As
    a people, they've grown exceedingly varied in both customs and appearance.
    While most giants bear the physical features of their immediate ancestors,
    on occasion a giant gives birth to a child possessing physical traits
    associated with one of the other types of giants. Exactly why these "mongrel
    giants" (as they're known) bear attributes of different giant varieties
    remains a mystery, particularly because giants of differing varieties who
    mate with one another don't produce viable offspring.
  - >-
    Many believe that all giants came from a single, great race of ancient
    giants and such throwbacks arise naturally. Not surprisingly, each type of
    giant argues that these ancient ancestors most resembled the giants of their
    own race and the other types of giants are their descendants.
  - >-
    Hill giants are the one type of giants whose traits don't arise in other
    giants. However, hill giants are the most prone to birthing mongrel giants.
  - Creating a Mongrel Giant
  - >-
    "Mongrel giant" is an inherited template that can be added to any creature
    with the giant subtype (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A
    mongrel giant retains all the base creature's statistics and special
    abilities except as noted here.
  - >-
    CR: Same as that of the base creature, unless the creature's size changes,
    in which case it's equal to the base creature's CR + 1.
  - >-
    Special Qualities: A mongrel giant retains all the special attacks,
    qualities, and abilities of the base creature and gains the following
    special quality.
  - >-
    Giant Ancestry (Ex): A mongrel giant displays traits and features of another
    variety of giant and gains additional abilities based on this ancestry (see
    Giant Ancestry Traits below). A mongrel giant can have only one giant
    ancestry.
  - Giant Ancestry Traits
  - >-
    A mongrel giant gains additional traits based on its ancestry. Roll 1d4 to
    determine how many traits a mongrel giant gains. Then roll 1d6 to randomly
    determine which traits for that ancestry the giant possesses, rerolling
    duplicates. For spell-like abilities, the caster level is equal to the
    creature's HD or the caster level of the base creature's spell-like
    abilities, whichever is higher. If the creature's size changes, modify its
    ability scores and natural armor bonus as noted on Table 2-2 on page 296 of
    the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary.
