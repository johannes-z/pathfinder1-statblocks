    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a devil dog can deliver a coup de grace against a
      helpless opponent. If the victim survives the attack, he must succeed on a
      Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. Opponents killed in this
      manner cannot be raised, but resurrection, true resurrection, or the like
      can restore the slain creature to life.
Description:
  - >-
    The wolf-like devil dog may be an interbred species of wild dog and winter
    wolf. A devil dog is smaller than a winter wolf but much larger than nearly
    any normal dog of any breed - about 5 feet long and 3 feet high at the
    shoulder. A devil dog is white in color, blending in almost perfectly with
    its snowbound environment. Thanks to their appearance, devil dogs are often
    mistaken for winter wolves by inexperienced travelers in icy regions. Devil
    dog packs have been known to stalk and attack humanoids and other creatures
    much larger than the pack members. They are smart enough to use their
    coloration to their best advantage in the hunt.
  - >-
    Devil dogs hunt in packs, using tactics similar to normal wild dogs and
    wolves: the pack circles the prey, with each dog taking its turn attacking.
  - Devil dogs attempt to rip out the throat of any helpless opponent.
