Description:
  - >-
    Eagle Knights are the public face of Andoran in the eyes of surrounding
    nations-an army of citizen-soldiers who rose up to defend the hard-won
    freedoms of the Andoren people. The Eagle Knights serve at the forefront of
    their nation's armed forces, acting as scouts in dangerous regions and enemy
    territory, elite troops for the most perilous missions, officers for
    militias, and advisors to communities threatened by bandits, foreign raids,
    or dangerous wildlife. Eagle Knights put their lives on the line on a
    regular basis, and that risk earns them the respect of their fellow
    citizens.

    However, the war Eagle Knights wage is not merely one of military combat. In
    a world dominated by monarchy and despotism, the citizen-soldiers must also
    fight on the vanguard of an ideological army, championing the strange notion
    that the ordinary citizens of a nation have both the right and
    responsibility to govern themselves. The Eagle Knights hold faith that the
    common folk are more than capable of holding a large nation together without
    being crushed beneath the weight of bureaucracy or dissolving into
    factional, sectional, and ideological squabbling that could hurl the nation
    into anarchy in the face of a crisis.
  - >-
    Among the Eagle Knights, the members of the Steel Falcons faction serve as
    Andoran's armed ambassadors to the world at large. While the larger part of
    the Eagle Knights is concerned with the nation's safety and order, the Steel
    Falcons travel abroad to bring awareness of the history and culture of
    Andoran to other lands and to spread the gospel of liberty. They travel not
    as seditionists (unless they are subverting tyranny), but rather as
    emissaries sharing the national narrative that makes Andoran unique among
    the nations. They are also trained listeners, culling important intelligence
    from information commonly available in the foreign lands they roam,
    returning to Andoran with invaluable details about attitudes and activities
    abroad.
