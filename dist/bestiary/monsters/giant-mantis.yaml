SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Lunge (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant mantis's limbs are capable of reaching much farther than normal
      for a creature of its size. As a fullattack action, it can make a single
      attack with its claws at double its normal reach. When a giant mantis
      attacks with a claw in this manner, it gains a +4 bonus on its attack
      roll. A giant mantis cannot make attacks of opportunity with its lunge.
  - name: Mandibles (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant mantis that grabs a foe can make a bite attack against that foe as
      a secondary attack. The mantis's bite is a +0 attack that inflicts 1d6+1
      points of damage on a hit.
  - name: Sudden Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant mantis is particularly adept at moving quickly when its foes are
      surprised. During a surprise round, a giant mantis may act as if it had a
      full round to act, rather than just one standard action.
Description:
  - >-
    Known to many as the giant praying mantis for the way the creature's deadly
    front limbs fold under its head as it lies in wait for food, this creature
    is well feared along caravan tracks that pass through dense woodlands. The
    giant mantis, a master of hiding in dense undergrowth, is almost unnaturally
    patient as it lies in wait, striking with unsettling speed as unsuspecting
    meals wander by.

    In many savage societies, the giant mantis is particularly feared-in regions
    where these vermin are common, they are often regarded as messengers of
    death sent to the world by angry gods. Their swift speed, alien appearance,
    and near-invisibility in forests give rise to many legends- that the giant
    mantis can become invisible, that it can smell fear, and that the souls of
    those who it slays and eats are digested and kept from moving on to the
    afterlife.
  - >-
    While the giant mantis is nothing more than an efficient and deadly vermin,
    the numerous legends and whispers regarding its supposed powers and alien
    intellect have inspired some spellcasters to work such features into their
    constructs as a way to make them even more fearsome. There are even stories
    of entire societies of assassins who worship an immense mantis as a god, and
    who have taken to heart the mantis's style of murderous ambush, fighting
    with twin serrated rapiers.

    The giant mantis presented here stands 7 feet tall and 15 feet long, and
    weighs 650 pounds. Larger giant mantises exist in the deepest, darkest
    forests of the world, where they might prey upon things as mighty as giants
    or dragons. Known by various names, such as the drakeeating mantis, the
    treebender mantis, or simply the deadly mantis, these immense behemoths
    average more than 60 feet in height and have a terrifying habit of
    destroying entire villages or towns in order to satiate their ravenous
    appetites. A deadly mantis is a giant mantis advanced to Colossal size, 16
    Hit Dice, and CR 14.
