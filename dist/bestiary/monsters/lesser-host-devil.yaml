Description_Visual: >-
  This tangle of scaly avian limbs furiously beats its double pair of
  vulture-like wings, keeping its fiendish, horned skull-head aloft. As fetid
  breath rises from its repulsive, fly-covered visage, clawed arms work together
  to slash the air with a vicious-looking spear.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Superior Grappler (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gaav can wield a weapon and still make grapple checks. If it's not
      wielding a weapon, a gaav gains a +4 bonus on grapple checks. In addition,
      it takes up to eight gaavs cooperatively to lift a creature that one or
      more of them is grappling; each gaav can lift up to 50 pounds and still
      fly without being impeded.
  - name: Noxious Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a gaav can exhale a breath that reeks of pure
      corruption upon a creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 14
      Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by
      the same gaav's noxious breath for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize
      poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with
      immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison
      receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. Once a gaav uses its
      breath weapon, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later.
  - name: Shared Senses (Su)
    description: >-
      All gaavs and magaavs within 100 feet of one another share the same
      senses. Thus, if one individual perceives something (for example, with a
      successful Perception check), all others within range are immediately
      aware of it. Senses are instantly relayed from one gaav or magaav to the
      next, allowing for the senses of a single devil to potentially spread
      through and inform an entire massive swarm instantly. It is still possible
      for a gaav to be surprised or flat-footed even if other gaavs nearby are
      not.
  - name: Summon Devil (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day a gaav can attempt to summon an imp with a 35% chance of
      success. This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.
  - name: Swarming (Ex)
    description: >-
      Up to two gaavs can share the same space at the same time. If two gaavs in
      the same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking
      that foe as if they were in two opposite squares.
Description:
  - >-
    Hunters of souls, host devils retrieve Hell's most elusive property. Whether
    souls that have long evaded capture upon the plains of Avernus, damned
    beings who have somehow managed to escape Hell, or creatures that have
    reneged upon infernal contracts, vast flocks of these winged fiends swarm
    from the Pit to recover their prey. Rarely seen alone, host devils travel in
    great swarms that often number in the thousands. Amid these great hosts flap
    the swarm leaders, the magaav, fierce mockeries of the angelic form capable
    of directing and redirecting massive columns of their brethren like the
    brain of a single colossal infernal beast. Gaavs stand 4 feet tall and weigh
    approximately 110 pounds, their wingspans stretching to just over 6 feet
    wide. Magaavs stand 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh 150 pounds, with wingspans
    reaching 10 feet across.
