Description:
  - >-
    Fungoids are man-sized humanoid creatures formed of mushroom flesh and
    leaves. Coloration varies from brownish-green or brown to dark green mottled
    with brown splotches. Most weigh about 300 pounds.
  - >-
    They are found in all but the coldest of swamps and marshes and delight in
    attacking creatures that wander too close to their lair. Fungoids are
    carnivores and consider the flesh of humans, elves, and goblins a delicacy.
  - When food is scarce, fungoids become scavengers and feed on carrion.
  - >-
    Fungoids lair in the darkest and most dismal place they can find-the more
    devoid of light, the better. Typically a lair is ringed with mushrooms of
    varying colors, shapes and sizes. Such a telltale sign is often the only
    clue that a fungoid lair is present as the lair itself is normally
    well-hidden or camouflaged. Woe to a creature that actually wanders close
    enough to examine the mushrooms; by then the fungoids are likely aware of
    the interloper's presence and are biding their time before an
    all-out-attack.
  - >-
    Fungoids are nocturnal hunters and often travel up to 5 miles away from
    their lair in search of prey. Slain prey is carried or dragged back to the
    lair and devoured over several days time. Multiple fungoids are often
    encountered together on hunting excursions, but they never share their kill.
    "Each to their own" is the unspoken motto among fungoids.
  - >-
    Fungoids are straightforward combatants that rush into melee swinging their
    powerful fists. They pummel their foes relentlessly until they are destroyed
    or their adversaries are killed. Multiple fungoids sometimes work with one
    another to bring down powerful foes, but once the fight is over, the
    fungoids cooperation with one another ends, and it's every creature for
    itself when assessing and gathering up the kills. Fungoids never retreat and
    always fight to the death.
