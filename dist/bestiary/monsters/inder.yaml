SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Command Elementals (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an elemental lord can attempt to gain control of any
      elemental creature of the same element within 100 feet. Elementals receive
      a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10
      + 1/2 the elemental lord's + its Charisma modifier. Elementals that make
      their save are immune to the command of that elemental lord for one day.
      Elementals that fail their saves fall under the elemental lord's control,
      obeying its commands to the best of their ability. An elemental lord does
      not need to concentrate to maintain control over commanded elementals.
      Once commanded, an elemental serves until either it dies, the elemental
      lord dies, the elemental lord dismisses it, or the summoning magic ends
      (if the elemental was summoned). An elemental lord can command any number
      of elementals, so long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed twice the
      elemental lord's Hit Dice. If an elemental creature is under the control
      of another creature, the elemental lord can attempt an opposed Charisma
      check to gain control of the elemental.
  - name: Searing Heat (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of Inder must succeed on
      a DC 37 Fortitude save or take 2d8 points of fire damage. Anyone striking
      Inder with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 4d6 points of fire
      damage (DC 37 Reflex save for half). A creature that grapples Inder or is
      grappled by Inder takes 4d6 points of fire damage each round the grapple
      persists (DC 37 Reflex save for half). The save DCs are
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Inder rules over fire elementals and makes his home within a massive fiery
    lake on the Plane of Fire. He is attended by 4 elder fire elementals who
    serve in his court as advisors. Other fire-based creatures such as efreet,
    azer, and lesser fire elementals serve him in the court in minor roles.
    Inder also keeps a large retinue of female fire-based creatures as his
    harem, having over thirty wives at last count.
  - >-
    Inder rarely engages in battle, preferring to let his fire elementals fight
    for him. If forced however, he opens with a fireball, incendiary cloud, and
    fire storm, before summoning creatures to his aid. When facing a large
    number of opponents, he often rides a red dragon of largest size into
    battle.
