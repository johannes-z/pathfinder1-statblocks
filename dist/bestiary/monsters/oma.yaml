SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Capsize (Ex)
    description: >-
      An oma can attempt to capsize a ship or other vehicle by ramming it as a
      charge attack and attempting a combat maneuver check. The DC of this check
      is 25, or the result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever
      is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the oma, the oma
      takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this combat maneuver check.
  - name: Carrier (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature swallowed whole by an oma can forgo attempts to cut itself out
      and instead attempt a DC 20 Reflex save on its turn. Success allows the
      creature to move into the creature's larger second stomach, where it can
      ride safely for an indefinite period without taking damage. When a
      passenger wishes to leave, it can cut its way free using the normal rules,
      or attempt an additional DC 20 Reflex save to be safely excreted in a
      square adjacent to the oma. An oma's carrier stomach can hold up to one
      Gargantuan creature (or twice as many creatures of the next smallest size:
      two Huge creatures, four Large, and so on). At its option, an oma can
      choose to forgo the normal bite damage of swallowing whole, but not the
      acid damage of the first stomach.
  - name: Starflight (Ex)
    description: >-
      An oma can survive in the void of outer space, and soars through vacuum at
      incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip between two
      planets within a solar system should take 3d20 days, while one to another
      system should take 3d20 weeks (or more, at the GM's discretion), provided
      the oma knows the way to its destination.
Description:
  - >-
    Oma soar through gas giants and the vast gulfs between planets on magical
    electromagnetic fields, feeding on cosmic materials strained from planetary
    rings and atmospheres with their energy baleen. Anything ingested by an oma
    is eventually sequestered in a surprisingly habitable second stomach before
    being excreted, and some alien creatures use oma as living starships, using
    telepathy to guide the colossi through the void. A typical oma is 150 feet
    long and weighs 250 tons.
