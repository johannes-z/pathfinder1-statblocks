    description: >-
      An al-mi'raj can create an effect identical to a dimension door spell once
      per round as a standard action. The ability affects only the al-mi'raj,
      which never appears within a solid object and can act immediately after
      teleporting.
Description:
  - >-
    The al-mi'raj is a dangerous creature with long white, pink, yellow, or
    light green fur. Its horn is golden or black in color. Because of the
    al-mi'raj's interdimensional travel abilities, sages often refer to them as
    "blink bunnies." Al-mi'raj react to threats much differently than their
    normal rabbit cousins. When danger is nearby, the al-mi'raj becomes
    aggressive and moves to attack. In combat, the al-mi'raj stabs with its
    horn. Credit The Al-mi'raj originally appeared in the First Edition Fiend
    Folio (Â© TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.
