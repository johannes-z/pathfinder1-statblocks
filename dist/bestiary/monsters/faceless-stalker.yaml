SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A faceless stalker can assume the form of a Medium humanoid at will but
      requires 10 uninterrupted minutes to alter its body. Performing this
      transformation is somewhat painful, but the faceless stalker can maintain
      its new form indefinitely once it has achieved it. It can change back to
      its true form as a swift action and gains a +2 morale bonus on attack
      rolls, damage rolls, skill checks, and saving throws for 1 round after it
      does so. Faceless stalkers retain their own innate abilities when they
      assume their new form and do not gain any of those belonging to the
      creature they mimic. A faceless stalker gains a +10 bonus on Disguise
      checks when they are used in conjunction with this ability.
  - name: Faceless (Su)
    description: >-
      In its natural form, a faceless stalker has no discernible facial
      features. It gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made to resist attacks or
      effects that target the senses. This includes gaze attacks, odor-based
      attacks, sonic attacks and similar attacks. This bonus does not apply to
      illusions.
Description:
  - >-
    Ugothols (as faceless stalkers call themselves) are one of the many tools
    created and then discarded by the aboleths in their long war against the
    surface dwellers. Scorned by their former masters when the scheme for which
    they were designed unraveled, the faceless stalkers fled into swamps,
    marshes, or any other dark, wet places they could find-the closest they
    could come to the aquatic cities they once considered home.
  - >-
    Originally designed to serve as spies that could walk uncontested among the
    air-breathing races, faceless stalkers adopt new forms by reshaping their
    skin and contorting their rubbery bodies. This painful process takes
    approximately 10 uninterrupted minutes-an ugothol typically seeks a private
    place to do it, avoiding even others of its own kind. The sensation of
    returning to its true form is quite exhilarating and results in a momentary
    burst of euphoria.
  - >-
    Faceless stalkers cannot digest solid food even when in the form of a
    creature with a mouth. Instead, they subsist on liquids, including blood. In
    their natural forms, they have three hollow tongues which they use to
    penetrate and lap blood from their victims. Since they have no particular
    skill at grappling foes, most ugothols wait until a victim is helpless or
    asleep before attempting to drink its blood-although the best is when a
    victim is helpless but conscious during the process, so that the faceless
    stalker can "play with its food" by having grisly and cruel conversations
    with it.
