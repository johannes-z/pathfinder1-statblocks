SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Arctic Stride (Ex)
    description: >-
      An adlet can move through any sort of difficult terrain at its normal
      speed while within arctic or snowy terrain. Magically altered terrain
      affects an adlet normally.
  - name: Frozen Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      An adlet's breath is supernaturally cold, and deals an additional 1d6
      points of cold damage with its bite. Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift
      action, it can exhale, filling a 10-footradius spread around it with
      frigid air that deals 2d6 points of cold damage and staggers those in the
      area with numbing cold for 1d6 rounds. A DC 21 Fortitude save negates the
      staggered effect but not the cold damage. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Adlets are cunning hunters of the arctic wilds. Tall, sinewy, nimble, and
    very quick, they see themselves as the true heritors of untamed arctic
    lands, and are offended by any other humanoid species that attempts to
    settle in such regions. Although not normally evil, adlets are very
    aggressive and warlike. They also have no social taboo against cannibalism,
    and their practice of eating their dead rather than burying them only
    further builds misconceptions about their morality.
  - >-
    Deeply religious, adlets worship the power and cruelty of nature, seeing
    divinity in the lash of the blizzard's wind, the ferocity of the polar bear,
    and the immensity of the towering iceberg. Many become oracles or druids,
    but all adlets know their place in the natural world. One in every dozen
    adlets is a shaman: an adlet with the advanced creature template and the
    ability to summon a greater ice elemental or 1d4+1 large ice elementals (see
    Bestiary 2 114) and commune with nature once per day each as spell-like
    abilities.
  - An adlet is 6 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds.
