SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Merge with Earth (Su)
    description: >-
      A vilstrak can merge with earth or stone at will as a standard action.
      This ability is similar to a meld with stone spell (CL 12th), except that
      a vilstrak can see what goes on outside and it can remain merged as long
      as it desires.
Description:
  - >-
    Vilstraks (or tunnel thugs) dwell underground, away from the surface world.
    Though they have no allergy or reaction to sunlight, they disdain its
    existence, preferring the cold, damp blackness of their underground world. A
    vilstrak's lair is a "pocket" formed deep inside the earth. These pockets
    have no exits or entrances and are only reachable by those who can pass
    through stone or earth.
  - >-
    A typical vilstrak stands six feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds. Its
    arms have an extra joint between the elbow and wrist, and its arms end in
    large, powerful fists of stone. Vilstraks are gray or brown.
  - >-
    Vilstraks are peaceful creatures that avoid combat if possible. They do take
    great joy and pride in robbing those that invade their territory.
  - >-
    A favored tactic of the vilstrak is to hide inside the wall of a dungeon
    corridor and spring out when prey passes nearby.
