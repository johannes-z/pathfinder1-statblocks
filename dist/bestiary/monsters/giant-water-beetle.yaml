SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ink Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per minute as a swift action, a giant water beetle can emit a cloud
      of jet-black ink that fills a 10-foot cube. The cloud provides total
      concealment, which the giant water beetle normally uses to escape. All
      vision within the cloud is obscured.
  - name: Water Dependent (Ex)
    description: >-
      Giant water beetles can survive out of the water for 1 hour per 2 points
      of Constitution. After that, they begin to suffocate.
  - name: Watersense (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant water beetle's watersense ability functions exactly like
      blindsense, except it only functions underwater.
Description:
  - >-
    These highly aggressive beetles make their home in deep fresh water, such as
    rivers, lakes, pools, and seas and can be found in any climate, stretching
    from the warmest to the coldest. Giant water beetles are predators and
    sustain themselves on fish and other aquatic animals. They spend most of
    their lives in the water, rarely coming on land. If encountered on land, a
    giant water beetle will never be more than 30 feet from any source of water.
    They are diurnal creatures and hunt during the day, diving with blinding
    speed when they spot a potential meal in the water. When not actively
    hunting, they simply drift along with the current. Giant water beetles lair
    on the bottoms of lakes, pools, and seas. If a colony is found, there will
    be at least 1 female giant water beetle and 2d4 eggs. Giant water beetle
    eggs are brownish with flecks of green. Eggs hatch within three weeks after
    the female deposits them Giant water beetles reach full maturity in six to
    eight weeks. When hunting, these creatures prefer to attack by ambushing
    their prey from above. They drift along and then dive at the target with
    blinding speed (treat this as a charge). Prey is bitten by the giant water
    beetle's oversized mandibles. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
