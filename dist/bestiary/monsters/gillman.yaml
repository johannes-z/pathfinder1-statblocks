  - name: Water Dependent (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gillman's body requires constant submersion in fresh or salt water.

      water risk internal organ failure, painful cracking of the skin, and death
      within 4d6 hours.
Description:
  - >-
    The enigmatic and reclusive gillmen (known to some as "Low Azlanti") are the
    aquatic descendants of the vanished Azlanti race. When Earthfall struck
    Golarion and the continent of Azlant was shattered, most of the Azlanti
    dwelling died in the fires or drowned in the waves. Yet a number found
    succor with their undersea aboleth enemies. For reasons that remain unknown
    to this day (but which surely have nothing to do with compassion), the
    aboleths rescued a small fraction of these drowning humans, warping their
    flesh to help them survive in the aboleths' uncontested undersea realm. Yet
    with that action, the aboleths seemed to lose interest, and in the thousands
    of years that followed, the gillmen formed a society of their own.
    Physically, gillmen resemble their ancient ancestors, with expressive brows,
    pale skin, dark hair, and bright purple eyes. Three slim gills mark each
    side of their necks, near the shoulder, but they are close enough in
    appearance to humans that they can pass as such (for a time) without fear of
    detection. Gillman Characters Gillmen are defined by their class levels-
    they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All gillmen have the following racial
    traits. +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma, -2 Wisdom: Gillmen are vigorous and
    beautiful, but their domination by the aboleths has made them weak-willed.
    Amphibious: Gillmen have the aquatic subtype, but can breathe both water and
    air. They prefer not to spend long periods out of the water, however, as
    their skin dries out very easily. Enchantment Resistance: See above.
    Servitor: Gillmen serve the dark, unfathomable schemes of the reclusive
    aboleths, but unless the gillmen go against the orders of their aboleth
    masters (which are often unknown to them, masked in the form of hidden
    memories triggered by key events), they are free to act as they wish. In a
    campaign, these orders are wholly up to the GM, meaning the player of a
    gillman character cedes some elements of self-control when it best serves
    the story of the campaign. Water Dependent: See above. Languages: Gillmen
    begin play speaking Common and Aboleth. Gillmen with high Intelligence
    scores can choose any of the following bonus languages: Aklo, Aquan,
    Azlanti, Draconic, Elven, and Sahuagin.
