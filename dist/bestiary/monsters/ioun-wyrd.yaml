  - name: Ioun Affinity (Su)
    description: >-
      An ioun wyrd may integrate a number of ioun stones into its body up to 1 +
      1/2 its Hit Dice. Because an ioun wyrd sees all ioun stones as equal and
      gains no benefits from them, the wyrd's ioun stones can be swapped out by
      any creature the wyrd trusts.

      A character with an ioun wyrd familiar gains the benefits of its ioun
      stones as long as he's within 30 feet of the ioun wyrd.
Description:
  - >-
    Ioun wyrds appear to be extraplanar creatures somewhat resembling earth
    elementals, but they're actually bizarre constructs, assembled in
    laboratories throughout Golarion to serve equally unusual masters. Ioun
    wyrds have occasionally been found in the wild, typically in regions near
    hidden wizards' towers or discreet arcane laboratories in the Nexian
    highlands or Thuvian deserts, if only because mages sometimes find it
    difficult to keep track of these wily beings. Left to their own devices,
    ioun wyrds seek out abandoned mines, gem-rich caverns, or lonely grottos
    where they might find pretty stones, which they see as somehow related to
    themselves.
  - A typical ioun wyrd is roughly 2 feet in diameter and weighs 15-20 pounds.
  - Construction
  - >-
    An ioun wyrd is made of small gemstones, lodestones, and bits of granite
    which are coated with 500 gp worth of alchemical materials. A single
    functional ioun stone must also be present, which the ioun wyrd takes as the
    first ioun stone to be integrated into its body with its ioun aff inity.
