SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Capsize (Ex)
    description: >-
      A submerged hippo that surfaces under a boat less than its space can
      capsize it by making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 10, or the
      result of the boat pilot's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher.
      For each size category the boat is larger than the hippo's size, the hippo
      takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.
  - name: Hold Breath (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hippo can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 5 times its
      Constitution score before it risks drowning.
Description:
  - >-
    The hippo is a peaceful creature, but will defend its lair and young if
    provoked. They are found dwelling near rivers and lakes. Hippos in the water
    move by running along the bottom of lakes and rivers, surfacing occasionally
    to gulp air.
  - Hippos attack by trampling and biting their foes.
