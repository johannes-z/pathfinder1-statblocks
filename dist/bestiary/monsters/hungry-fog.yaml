  Horrid shapes form within this cloying green mist, which pulses sporadically

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bewitching Brume (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature within 10 feet of a hungry fog or currently being affected by
      its enveloping mists must succeed on a DC 8 Will save at the start of that
      creature's turn or become shaken for 1 round at the half-glimpsed shapes
      of phantoms floating within the fog. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Enveloping Mists (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hungry fog can engulf foes (see Universal Monster Rules in the
      Appendices). A creature engulfed by a hungry fog does not gain the pinned
      condition and may move normally-such a creature is not in danger of
      suffocating, but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, it is staggered
      in addition to the damage the attack causes. The save DC to avoid the
      enveloping mists is Constitution-based.
  - name: Gaseous (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hungry fog has a body composed of eerie mist. It can pass through small
      holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, but cannot enter water or
      other liquid. It has no Strength score, and cannot manipulate objects as a
      result.
  - name: Vulnerable to Wind (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hungry fog is treated as a Tiny creature for the purposes of determining
      the effects high wind has upon it (see page 439 of the Core Rulebook).
Description:
  - >-
    This eerie, vaporous ooze slips silently through the air, a roiling cloud of
    green fog within which dance the indistinct shapes of twisted, spooky
    ghosts. Despite its haunting appearance, and despite the fact that hungry
    fogs often dwell in old graveyards or hunt battlefields, a hungry fog is not
    an undead creature. Rather, it is a form of gaseous ooze infused with
    negative energy. Thus, while a hungry fog is not an undead creature, undead
    gain considerable boons by fighting within a hungry fog, for its mists heal
    them as surely as they drain vitality from the living creatures caught
    within.
  - >-
    Within a hungry fog, the ooze's mists interact strangely with fragments of
    those it has consumed, creating eerie phantasms of its past victims.
    Periodically, one of these shapes might flash with light as if momentarily
    holding a lantern aloft, but as soon as the figure is approached, it fades
    away into the surrounding mists, often giving the observer a quick and
    unsettling glimpse of a skull-like countenance. These shapes, like the fog
    itself, are not truly undead, but the fact that a hungry fog is hurt by
    positive energy as surely as if it were helps to blur the distinction and
    spread even more confusion about its actual nature.
  - >-
    A hungry fog is instinctively drawn to areas where negative energy is
    strong. These nocturnal creatures are particularly fond of sites that are
    haunted, such as old houses, abandoned graveyards, or shipwrecks along
    shorelines-although their vulnerability to high winds means that they are
    rarely encountered in areas where storms are common.
