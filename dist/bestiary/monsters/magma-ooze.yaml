    description: >-
      The magma ooze is formed of molten rock. Any melee hit deals on the ooze
      inflicts 2d6 points of fire damage to the attacker. The damage continues
      for 1d3 rounds, but deals only 1d6 damage during this time.
Description:
  - >-
    A magma ooze is encountered primarily on the Material Plane but is thought
    to have its origins on the Plane of Fire. They are almost always found in or
    near volcanoes and other warm or hot places. Magma oozes do not approach
    water and are never found near such sources. Magma oozes can grow to a
    length of 10 feet, with a thickness of about 6 inches.
