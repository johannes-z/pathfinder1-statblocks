SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Powerful Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A water leaper's bite attack always applies 1-1/2 times its Strength
      modifier on damage rolls and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.
  - name: Wail (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a water leaper can unleash a high-pitched wail that
      causes living creatures within 60 feet that hear it to make a DC 14 Will
      save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save succeeds,
      that creature cannot be affected again by that water leaper's wail for one
      day. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Water leapers are the bane of fresh water fisherman. They snap angling lines
    and nets as easily one would snap a spider web. They lie in ambush in the
    shallows of lakes to attack anything that comes down for a drink, and
    overturn boats to feast on the fishermen as they struggle in the water.
    Water leapers inhabit nearly any source of fresh water, from river to lakes.
    They remain in the shallow parts of the lakes, only diving to deeper waters
    to avoid capture.

    A water leaper lair is underwater and usually close to the shoreline. Here
    the female deposits up to 30 eggs, most of which hatch within two to three
    weeks. Young water leapers resemble adults save their wings and tail. The
    wings are almost non-existent, consisting of two small ridges on the water
    leaper's back. The tail of a young water leaper is short and round, and
    lacks the barbed stinger of the adult. Both are fully developed by the time
    the young reaches maturity (in about 5 months). A water leaper has a
    lifespan of roughly 20 years.
  - >-
    Water leapers are about 6 feet long and weigh 300 pounds. Coloration varies
    depending on the creature's surroundings and environment (water leapers
    gradually change colors over time to blend more with their surroundings),
    but usually consists of gray or brownish-green. Eyes are always dull brown.
  - >-
    Water leapers hide in the water, waiting for prey to move close so they can
    spring to attack. They wail to immobilize their opponents then leap from
    their hiding places and attack, biting and stinging their prey.
