Description:
  - >-
    A pipefox is a foot-long, furry, magical snake with the head of a fox. Often
    found either climbing in trees or snaking around pipes, these curious and
    stealthy creatures prefer to skulk about to observe and learn. Neither
    malicious nor particularly beneficial, pipefoxes love to gather knowledge
    and sometimes disseminate what they've acquired to those they find worthy.
    Desirous of knowledge, no matter how obscure, these creatures only see other
    like-minded creatures worthy of their interaction. Though they might become
    curious about a tribe of barbarians, take sudden interest in learning the
    cant of a local group of thieves, or even study the method of distribution
    for the local brewery, they watch such things from a distance, never
    interacting with such "lesser minds." But if a pipefox finds a creature that
    loves knowledge as much as it does, it becomes intrigued, and after spending
    a period of time observing such a creature, will eventually muster up the
    courage to make the relationship more personal. Many pipefoxes are
    especially intrigued by spellcasters, and sometimes they offer to serve them
    as either familiars or confidants. Pipefoxes are secretive by nature, and
    even when they make themselves known, they can be shy and evasive, both
    physically and intellectually. They often see knowledge as a type of
    spiritual currency, and are hesitant to give their knowledge away unless
    they gain something in return. Some believe pipefoxes are the spirits of
    legendary scribes and lore masters given new form. Others believe the
    creatures are related to kami, and serve to preserve the world's knowledge.
    A spellcaster of at least 7th level who has the Improved Familiar feat may
    select the pipefox as a familiar, but only after the pipefox has agreed to
    pledge its services to the spellcaster.
