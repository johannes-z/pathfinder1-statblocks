SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath of Unlife (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, the demonic knight can exhale a blast of negative
      energy in a 10-foot cone. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 20
      Reflex save or take 2d4 points of Strength damage. A creature reduced to
      Strength 0 by a demonic knight dies. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoid slain by a demonic knight's breath of unlife becomes a shadow
      demon in 2d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the demonic knight
      that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess
      any of the abilities they had in life.
Description:
  - >-
    The demonic knight-known by some as a death knight-is rumored to be the
    creation of the great demon prince Orcus, the Prince of the Undead.
  - >-
    Some sages doubt the validity of such a claim, since the demonic knights are
    not undead. Though no link has been proven, however, it is known that three
    of the most powerful demonic knights (Baruliis, Caines, and Arrunes) make
    their home on the same plane of the Abyss as the Prince of the Undead within
    the shadows of his great citadel. The true origins of the demonic knight lay
    hidden deep in the stinking pits of the Abyss, and those brave few who have
    dared search for these secrets have never returned. The demonic knights
    serve their master (whoever it may be) with unswerving loyalty. They never
    question their orders and never question their superior. They are often sent
    to the Material Plane to recruit new bodies for their master's next plot or
    deception, or to punish those that have offended their lord. On some
    occasions, they are simply sent to another plane to corrupt and slay those
    that are just and good (to the delight of their master).
  - >-
    A demonic knight appears as a 6-foot tall humanoid dressed in black iron
    half-plate armor. Its head is completely hidden beneath a helmet that it
    never removes. A black iron longsword is slung at its hip. Some demonic
    knights don capes and other decorations as a badge of station.
  - >-
    It is unknown exactly how many demonic knights exist, but they are believed
    to number no more than nine.
  - A demonic knight attacks using its longsword (or fists, if unarmed).
  - >-
    Against powerful opponents, it attempts to use its breath of unlife to
    weaken its foes before slaying them. If melee goes against the demonic
    knight, it summons demons to aid it or cover its escape.
