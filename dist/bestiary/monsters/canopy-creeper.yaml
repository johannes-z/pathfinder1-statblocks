Description_Visual: >-
  What at first appeared to be nothing more than a tangle of thick, twisted
  vines growing among the canopy of the trees suddenly coils itself into a large
  mass dangling high above. A large beaklike maw emerges from the center of the
  fecund mass, numerous thick, grasping vines whipping through the air.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aerial Attack (Ex)
    description: >-
      A canopy creeper gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls when battling a creature
      that is not touching the ground or otherwise braced on a solid surface
      (such as a ship's deck). This bonus applies on combat maneuver checks and
      to CMD.
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because a canopy creeper blends in with the foliage that is its natural
      habitat, a DC 20 Perception check (modified for distance) is required to
      notice it before it attacks for the first time. Any creature with ranks in
      Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use either of those skills (also
      modified for distance) instead of Perception to notice the plant.
  - name: Feed (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a canopy creeper grapples a creature with its tendrils, it begins to
      drain the creature's bodily fluids through the target's pores or other
      body orifices with its tendrils. This feeding deals 1d8 points of damage
      and 1 point of Strength damage to the target. If the vine tendril is
      severed or the target breaks the grapple, this feeding ceases until a new
      grapple is established.
  - name: Vine Tendrils (Ex)
    description: >-
      A canopy creeper can take control of any network of vines it has attached
      itself to and use up to four of those vines as weapons to strike out at
      targets up to 100 feet away. The vine tendrils have 10 hit points, DR
      5/slashing, and a Break DC of 21. If one of these vines is destroyed, the
      canopy creeper can assume control of another vine as a move action to
      bring it to bear in combat.
Description:
  - >-
    A little-known menace of the jungles and forests of uncharted southern
    Garund, the canopy creeper is a semi-sentient plant that blends in with the
    foliage of the forest canopy and makes use of the flora's own outgrowth to
    trap and feed upon its prey. The canopy creeper resembles a mass of thickly
    knotted and twisted jungle vines that correspond to the colors and varieties
    of its native habitat. It has a larger knot of this tangle at its center
    mass, which also conceals a large, beaklike maw. The canopy creeper can
    spread itself over a broad area to resemble little more than this network of
    vines, or it can draw itself up into a large, coiled mass with its beak
    exposed.
  - >-
    The actual vines that coil together to form the canopy creeper are hundreds
    of feet long altogether in an adult specimen. When spread out, these tangles
    of vine cover an area 20 feet in diameter. They congregate into a mass
    approximately 10 feet in diameter when drawn in together. The mass of a
    canopy creeper weighs about 3,000 pounds in total. A canopy creeper can live
    for hundreds of years in a hospitable climate if sufficient sunlight and
    food sources are available.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Canopy creepers are plants naturally evolved to take advantage of their
    surroundings. They grow amid the lush foliage of jungles or rain forests
    where a diverse array of vine plants proliferates. The canopy creeper climbs
    up among the tree tops and intertwines its own vine-grown body with those
    that grow naturally, enabling it to gain control over the naturally
    occurring network of vines to use as a source of both defense and
    sustenance. While a canopy creeper does gain food and energy from
    photosynthesis, it cannot maintain its active metabolism when relying only
    on the nutrients gleaned from sun and rain. For maximum efficiency, it uses
    the vine tendrils that it gains control of to detect by scent, to entrap,
    and to draw prey toward itself. It is also able to use these vine tendrils
    to procure food as they draw the nutrient-rich fluids from creatures
    entangled within their embrace, which are then conveyed back to the
    controlling canopy creeper.
  - >-
    While the canopy creeper's primary method of attack is through its vine
    tendrils, it does have a large beak mouth composed of a hard, hornlike
    material. This beak is normally concealed within the center of its vine
    mass, but when creatures approach that prove able to resist its vine tendril
    attacks, the canopy creeper tries to draw them in close enough so that it
    can attack with its beak as well. It can consume prey with this mouth, but
    this is not its preferred method of feeding as most of the prey's fluids are
    lost as the beak tears the creature apart, resulting in fewer nutrients than
    if it were to feed solely through the vine tendrils.
  - >-
    A canopy creeper naturally mimics the appearance and growth of the types of
    vines that grow in its environment, so when one is concealed among the
    vine-tangled foliage above, it is difficult for even an experienced
    outdoorsman to detect. This is further exacerbated by the fact that it is
    usually hanging about 100 feet above the ground, making its appearance even
    more difficult to discern. Canopy creepers' preferred prey is Medium or
    larger creatures since these tend to hold more of the nutrient-rich fluids
    that the creepers feed upon; meanwhile, Small and smaller creatures-such as
    small monkeys-can often be seen cavorting around and even suspended from a
    canopy creeper, oblivious to its presence. However, during starvation
    conditions when the creeper is forced to rely upon photosynthesis for its
    survival, it readily preys upon such smaller creatures as well. The result
    of this preference, however, is that the canopy creature typically focuses
    its attacks on opponents of at least Medium size.
  - >-
    Canopy creepers store a great deal of moisture from their normally wet
    habitat in their vine structures, making them difficult to burn. However,
    this fact, as well as their adaptation to warm climates, makes them
    particularly susceptible to cold attacks, which cause them to become brittle
    and prone to fractures in their vine structures.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    A canopy creeper out of its habitat is a canopy creeper in serious trouble.
    The creature relies on the prolific presence of other vine growths to camouf
    lage its presence and to provide an aerial habitat from which it can feed
    safely above most creatures that might prey upon it. As a result, if a
    canopy creeper is caught on the ground away from screening foliage, it flies
    into a berserk frenzy, lashing out with its beak as it attempts to make for
    the nearest tree or high ground to escape.
  - >-
    A well-fed canopy creeper buds once every 4 or 5 years and drops dozens of
    small seedlings to the ground. Most of these shrivel up and die from lack of
    sustenance, but one or two usually manage to survive on rats and other
    vermin until they grow large and strong enough to become mobile, a process
    that usually takes about a month. These seedlings then instinctively begin
    looking for a new hunting area away from their parents and siblings, since
    the plants are naturally solitary and avoid encroaching on each other's
    hunting territory. A successful seedling reaches full size in 2-3 years if
    it finds a location with suitable prey to feed upon. During the time when
    the plants are seedlings, opportunistic horticulturists have been known to
    contain and transport canopy creepers, transplanting them elsewhere and
    raising them as potent guardian plant creatures.
