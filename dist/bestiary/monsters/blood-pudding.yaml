SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disgorge (Ex)
    description: >-
      A blood pudding that has infused itself with a host can force the
      creature's blood out through its pores, eyes, ears, and mouth. This is a
      standard action that deals 1d2 points of Constitution damage each round.
      At Constitution 0, the host dies and the blood pudding feeds on the
      corpse. When sated, the pudding exits, and to onlookers it appears as if
      the slain creature is bleeding profusely.
  - name: Infuse (Ex)
    description: >-
      A blood pudding that makes a successful grapple check can forcibly merge
      its form with that of a living creature. If it succeeds, the blood
      pudding's form disappears as it soaks through skin, wounds, and any other
      opening in the host's body. This special attack deals no damage but allows
      the blood pudding to use its disgorge special attack (see above). A
      creature infused with a blood pudding can try to forcibly eject the
      creature once per round as a standard action (coughing it up, vomiting,
      and so on). This requires a successful DC 17 Fortitude save. The save DC
      is Constitution-based. A creature can be affected by the pudding's infuse
      attack again, but gains a +2 conditional bonus on its Fortitude save. This
      bonus lasts for one day and is effective against the infuse attack of that
      blood pudding only.
  - name: Racial Vulnerabilities (Ex)
    description: >-
      Drinking alcohol weakens an infused pudding and reduces the Constitution
      damage sustained from its disgorge attack by one-half for the next 1d4+1
      rounds. Consuming pure vinegar causes an infused blood pudding to eject
      itself from the host in the same round the vinegar is consumed. A creature
      drinking pure vinegar must make a successful DC 12 Fortitude save or be
      nauseated for 1d3 rounds. A blood pudding will not use its infuse attack
      against that host for one day. A blood pudding hit with a cold effect or
      attack is slowed for 3 rounds (as the slow spell) and loses its racial
      bonus to grapple checks for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level.
  - name: Slime Grapple (Ex)
    description: >-
      because of the sticky slime it secretes, a blood pudding gains a +4 racial
      bonus to grapple checks.
Description:
  - >-
    This monster rolls through dark corridors or marshes looking for sustenance
    and can consume the vital fluids of any creature it contacts.
  - >-
    This sustenance most often takes the form of dungeon delvers that stumble
    upon the pudding. In marshes and swamps, the blood pudding feeds on animals
    and other natural fauna or any other living creature that happens to wander
    by.
  - >-
    A blood pudding strikes by forming a thick pseudopod and lashing out at an
    opponent. If it hits, it attempts to grab that foe and infuse itself with
    the opponent's body. Unless forcibly removed from the victim, a blood
    pudding does not relinquish its host until that creature is dead.
