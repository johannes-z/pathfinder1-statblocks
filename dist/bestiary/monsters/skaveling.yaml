Description:
  - >-
    Known in some circles as ghoul bats, skavelings are the hideous result of
    necromantic manipulation by urdefhans, who create them from mobats specially
    raised on diets of fungus and humanoid flesh. Upon reaching maturity,
    urdefhans ritually slay the bats using necrotic poisons, then raise the
    corpses to serve as mounts and guardians.
