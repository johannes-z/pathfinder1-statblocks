Description_Visual: >-
  This fiend appears to be a slim half-elf with long hair and a slender set of
  black ram horns. Covered by a sheer gown, her skin is tinged blue and covered
  with an elaborate tracery of white, scarified tattoos. A long, serpentine tail
  sprouts from the base of her spine, ending in a fanged maw. Her extremities
  are withered and blackened, ending in scorched, fleshless talons, and her
  unearthly beauty is further marred by a red, unblinking third eye.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Object of Desire (Su)
    description: >-
      While using its detect thoughts ability, an erodaemon can see into the
      mind of a humanoid and identify the person the target most desires,
      whether it be a lost loved one or an object of lust. As a full-round
      action, the erodaemon can change into the form of this desired person as
      long as the target is a Small, Medium, or Large humanoid. The erodaemon
      gains a +20 bonus on its Disguise and Bluff checks to impersonate that
      person and avoid being detected as a fraud, but spells like true seeing
      negate this effect as normal. This effect ends if the erodaemon attacks
      any creature. Actions that could reveal the erodaemon as a fraud (such as
      performing an action that the imitated person would obviously not do, like
      cast a spell or speak Infernal) require the erodaemon to make an immediate
      Bluff check to continue the impersonation, with the erodaemon losing some
      or all of its bonus depending on the severity of the breach (GM's
      discretion).
  - name: Wilting Kiss (Su)
    description: >-
      An erodaemon can draw a mortal into a state of obsession with its kiss. An
      unwilling victim must be grappled before the erodaemon can use this
      ability. A creature affected by this kiss must make a DC 23 Will save or
      become obsessed with the erodaemon, an obsession the erodaemon feeds on.
      Each round the target is more than 30 feet away from the erodaemon, it
      must make an additional DC 23 Will save. Failing the save means that the
      sheer pain of her absence deals 1 point of Charisma drain to the subject
      that round. Succeeding at the Will save two consecutive times ends the
      effects of this ability. Spells such as dispel magic and break enchantment
      end this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Erodaemons personify death by heartbreak. These fiends pose as mortals,
    insert themselves into the lives of their victims, and slowly destroy them.
    They break apart marriages, kill children or cause them to leave their
    families, destroy reputations, extinguish faith, curdle family ties, and bit
    by bit savor the slow disintegration of their victims' emotional well-being
    and consequent physical deterioration. Every tear shed, every sobbing woman,
    and every grieving man brings a rapturous smile to an erodaemon's face,
    because when a mortal dies of heartbreak and grief, the erodaemon feasts
    upon the tortured soul.
  - The typical erodaemon stands 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Erodaemons sometimes form from the hunted, the wandering mortal souls of
    Abaddon. Corrupted by their heartbreak, the resulting erodaemons seek to
    impose their morbid fate upon others.
  - >-
    Erodaemons are thought by some to be Abaddon's answer to the demonic succubi
    and diabolic erinyes, possessing the visage of beautiful mortals, yet
    tainted with obviously fiendish traits and intentions. However, rather than
    inspiring wars based on lust or torturing
  - >-
    victims ceaselessly, erodaemons seek to stoke the flames of mortal woe,
    causing many to fall into such pits of melancholy that they ultimately
    perish. When a mortal succumbs to death as a way to escape the pain of
    living without one's love, an erodaemon ensnares the soul and feasts upon
    its anguish.
  - >-
    Though they can appear as either a man or woman to their victims, in their
    true form, erodaemons are predominantly female. Erodaemons freely adopt
    whatever guises they deem necessary to infiltrate and ravage the lives of
    the mortals they hunt throughout the planes, and when not donning mortal
    figures, they often shift between various forms as they so desire, honing
    their ability to adopt each particular gender's behavioral quirks for when
    it matters.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Erodaemons know many traditions of different societies due to their
    intrusions into urban areas on other planes. In Abaddon, however, such
    communal grounds are rare, if they exist at all. In the sprawling wastes,
    erodaemons practice their forms of seduction primarily upon the hunted, who
    may still have such base desires as intimacy and love. Erodaemons are rarely
    trusted by other daemons, who have no hearts to break but can be tricked all
    the same into thinking a supposed ally or leader has turned its back on
    them.
  - >-
    While infiltrating other planes, erodaemons prefer to hunt alone most of the
    time. Selecting a particularly susceptible victim-such as one whose heart
    already throbs for another-an erodaemon will assume the guise of its
    target's lover and make the victim believe his or her partner is unfaithful,
    abusive, or worse. The devastation this causes for both of the real members
    of the relationship is delectable to the erodaemon, whose kiss snatches any
    life that still remains in the souls of those whose hearts it breaks.
    Similarly, an erodaemon might simply assume the form of a beautiful suitor,
    bewitching an already devoted mortal into relations which will ultimately be
    discovered suddenly by his or her mate. When the affair is revealed- often
    in the bedroom-the erodaemon assumes its true form to devour the emotionally
    shattered remains of both parties involved.
  - >-
    Erodaemons occasionally work together, but only if doing so results in a
    greater harvest of crushed mortal souls. This usually involves mesmerizing
    entire groups of people, often at a risquÃ© performance or event, and
    seductively sapping the life from the unwitting spectators. While such ruses
    are elaborate enough to pique erodaemons' peculiar tastes, the act of
    tricking mortals on an individual level often yields much more broken-and
    thus all the more delicious-souls.
  - >-
    Given their diverse uses and unique insights into mortals, erodaemons serve
    all of the Four equally. In addition to typical erodaemon servitors,
    erodaemons with particularly specialized skill sets serve each Horseman as
    his or her needs require. Apollyon possesses access to a group of plagued
    erodaemons who act as jubilant and seductive carriers of venereal diseases;
    Trelmarixian's erodaemons target rulers of kingdoms in order to divert
    resources meant for food; Szuriel's erodaemons woo entire legions of
    soldiers into embittered deaths; and Charon's erodaemons seek and further
    destroy the hearts of the aged.
