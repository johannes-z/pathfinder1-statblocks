  - name: Angry Glow (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per minute, as a full-round action, the sprites that make up a sprite
      swarm may coordinate their luminous abilities to create a singular,
      searing glow. Creatures within 10 feet of a sprite swarm with line of
      sight must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.
      A creature that succeeds at its save is dazzled for 1 round. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Concentrated Rush (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, if more than one creature occupies a sprite swarm's
      space, the swarm may use its attack action to concentrate on one of these
      creatures to deal 4d6 points of damage in place of its normal swarm
      damage. Other creatures within the horde's space do not take swarm damage
      that round.
  - name: Mob Mentality (Ex)
    description: >-
      As long as a sprite swarm has at least 10 hit points, it retains its
      Intelligence score and can act accordingly. Even so, it cannot be targeted
      by mind-affecting spells or effects that target a single creature. If its
      hit points fall below 10, the swarm is considered mindless as the
      individual creatures within begin to panic.
Description:
  - >-
    When intruders threaten their beloved homes, sprite guards in large villages
    are taught to call for their fellow tribe members to form a vicious,
    enveloping swarm to drive back their enemies. Typically consisting of at
    least 5,000 sprites, these swarms are known for inf licting pain upon any
    creatures in their paths. Sprite swarms typically form only when the
    sprites' village is threatened by a large number of intruders or a single
    powerful foe; however, the malevolent sprites of Geb are quick to form
    swarms when faced with intrusion of any kind.
