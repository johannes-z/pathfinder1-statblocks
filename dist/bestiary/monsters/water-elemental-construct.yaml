SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Drench (Ex)
    description: >-
      A water elemental construct's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed
      lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large
      size or smaller. The construct can dispel magical fire it touches as
      dispel magic (caster level equal's the elemental construct's HD).
  - name: Engulf (Ex)
    description: >-
      A water elemental construct can simply engulf Large or smaller creatures
      in its path as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a
      round in which it engulfs. The water elemental construct merely has to
      move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can
      make attacks of opportunity against the construct, but if they do so they
      are not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of
      opportunity can attempt a DC 36 Reflex save to avoid being engulfed- on a
      success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent's choice) as the
      construct moves forward. Engulfed creatures are in danger of suffocating,
      and are trapped within its body until they are no longer pinned. The save
      DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A water elemental construct is immune to any spell or spell-like ability
      that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects
      function differently against the creature, as noted below. A control water
      spell or cold effect slows a water elemental construct for 2d6 rounds with
      no saving throw. A horrid wilting spell deals 1d8 points of damage per
      caster level to a water elemental construct. The elemental construct can
      attempt a Fortitude save (DC 18 + caster's relevant ability modifier) for
      half damage. A create water spell heals 1d4 points of damage on the
      construct for each 2 gallons of water created.
  - name: Water Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A water elemental construct gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls if
      both it and its foe are touching water. If the opponent or the elemental
      construct is touching the ground, the elemental construct takes a -4
      penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in
      the statistics block.)
Description:
  - >-
    Water elemental constructs are rare elemental constructs (perhaps as rare or
    rarer than fire elemental constructs) found in the palaces of the Water
    Elemental Princes or in the service of a powerful spellcaster or water
    deity. The are usually given the task of keeping secret or guarding an area
    underwater as this is their native environment and they do not function well
    outside of it. A water elemental construct is a humanoid, 9 feet tall,
    composed of water. No discernable features can be seen on its head, though
    sometimes the face of an elemental spirit seems to appear randomly somewhere
    on its form. A water elemental construct crashes down on its opponents with
    watery fists before attempting to grab a foe and stuff it into its watery
    form. An engulfed foe is held until it drowns; thereafter, the elemental
    construct expels the creature's corpse onto the ground. Elemental constructs
    are used by powerful mages as servants, bodyguards, and assassins. An
    elemental construct, like any other automaton follows any order or command
    given to it to the best of its ability. An elemental construct's creator can
    command it if the construct is within 60 feet and can see and hear its
    creator. If not commanded, an elemental construct usually follows its last
    instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the
    attack. The creator can give the elemental construct a simple command to
    govern its actions in his or her absence. The elemental construct's creator
    can order the construct to obey the commands of another person (who might in
    turn place the elemental construct under someone else's control, and so on),
    but the elemental construct's creator can always resume control over his
    creation by commanding the elemental construct to obey him alone. Each
    elemental construct appears as a humanoid creature about 9 feet tall and is
    composed entirely of its native element. Construction An elemental
    construct's body is formed completely of one of the four elements air,
    earth, fire, or water. The materials must be the finest quality or purest
    form taken from the respective plane and mixed with rare oils, powders, and
    other ingredients totaling 5,000 gp. ELEMENTAL CONSTRUCT CL 17th; Price
