  thick-toothed maw is wide enough for a human to stand in, and its body

Description:
  - >-
    The angustiden is a gargantuan hunter of the deep sea. The size and ferocity
    of this behemoth are matched only by those of the megalodon, and it counts
    even the great white shark among its prey. Its foot-long, dense, and jagged
    teeth tear through anything they choose to clamp down on, and very few
    creatures manage to leave such an embrace with all of their body parts.
