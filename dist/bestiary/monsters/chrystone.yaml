Description_Visual: >-
  This creature appears as a statue constructed of rock and crystal. It has
  almost no neck; its head seems attached firmly to its shoulders, though by
  observing it, you see that it is able to turn its head freely. Each of its
  hands has two fingers and two opposable thumbs.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a chrystone is destroyed, it shatters, spraying razor-sharp fragments
      from its form. Creatures within 5 feet of the chrystone take 2d6 points of
      damage. A DC 12 Reflex saving throw halves the damage. A chrystone can
      prevent itself from shattering by making a DC 12 Will save as it is
      destroyed. Spell-like
  - name: Abilities (Sp)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a chrystone can use its stone shape to repair itself,
      healing 1d6 points of damage per use. This requires a full-round action
      that provokes attacks of opportunity. The save DC for the chrystone's
      color spray includes a +2 racial bonus.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A chrystone is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell
      resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently
      against the creature, as noted below. A transmute rock to mud spell slows
      a chrystone (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw,
      while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit points. A stone to
      flesh spell does not actually change the chrystone's structure but negates
      its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.
  - name: Shatter Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a character strikes a chrystone with a weapon (magical or
      nonmagical), the weapon must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or shatter
      into pieces. A magic weapon uses its own save bonus or that of the
      wielder, whichever is higher. If the weapon breaks, the chrystone takes no
      damage from the attack. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a
      +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Chrystones are creatures made of rock and crystal that normally stand just
    over 5 feet tall. Their coloration varies by the types of crystal and rock
    they absorb, giving each chrystone a unique pattern of striations and
    coloration that makes them easy to tell apart. Originally imbued with life
    by a spellcaster in a ritual involving the blood of several dragons and a
    demon, chrystones grow new offspring through budding. To form a new bud, a
    chrystone must consume several times its weight in crystals and consume at
    least 300 gp worth of gems. The bud continues to grow from the chrystone's
    back until it is large enough to separate. Each chrystone offspring retains
    the memories and knowledge of its entire parental line. Chrystones were
    originally created to be part of an army, but those plans were cut short by
    their creator's death. As they developed and spread, they became more
    free-willed and independent and wished to make certain they were never
    enslaved again. They retain all of the abilities that would have made them a
    powerful army, and their racial knowledge helps them put these abilities to
    the best possible use. Chrystones, while usually neutral, have a racial
    memory of being slaves to the whim of their creator. This memory makes them
    somewhat paranoid when dealing with other races, making them more likely to
    attack other races than talk with them. Chrystones open with color spray
    which emanates from their mouth like a breath weapon and then close for
    melee combat if targets are close enough; otherwise, they stand back and
    fight with their longswords. If a battle is going poorly, a chrystone
    attempts to retreat and ambush its opponents when it has repaired itself.
    Construction A chrystone's body is chiseled from a single block of hard
    stone, such as granite, weighing at least 1,000 pounds. The stone must be of
    exceptional quality, and costs 1,000 gp. CHRYSTONE CL 14th; Price 16,000 gp
    Requirements Craft Construct, color spray, limited wish, polymorph any
    object, shatter, stone shape, stone tell, creator must be caster level 14th
    level; Skill Craft (sculptures) or Craft (stonemasonry) DC 15; Cost 8,500 gp
