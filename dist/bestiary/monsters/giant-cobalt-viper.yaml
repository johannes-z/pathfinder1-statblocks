  - name: Poison Aura (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cobalt viper's poison is so potent, that it exudes it in an aura around
      its body. A creature that starts its turn within the area is subjected to
      the cobalt viper's poison. The poison from this aura is weaker than its
      bite however, and deals only 1d2 points of Con damage (instead of 1d6 Con
      damage).
Description:
  - >-
    Cobalt vipers are poisonous snakes found on the Plane of Molten Skies.
    Whatever magic transported the Steel Garden to that realm is thought to have
    brought the vipers here as well. They are indigenous to the Garden and are
    virtually unknown outside of it.
  - >-
    A cobalt viper appears to be constructed of metal; in fact its scales are
    actually a composite of the steel found within the Steel Garden and normal
    snake scales. How exactly these creatures came to exist is unknown. A
    typical cobalt viper is about 5 feet long though species up to 12 feet long
    or more have been sighted. Cobalt vipers are sometimes hunted by intelligent
    races for their scales. The scales are taken and fashioned into various
    pieces of jewelry or used to adorn armor and weapons.
  - >-
    Cobalt vipers are highly aggressive predators that prefer to attack from
    ambush. Normally, a cobalt viper trails its prey allowing its poison aura to
    sap the target's strength. After its prey is sufficiently weakened, the
    cobalt viper lunges from its hiding place and strikes.
