      as if under the effects of the spell freedom of movement.
Description:
  - >-
    Infused with the power of waves and storms, sea dragons- or jiaolungs, as
    they are known in many lands-are draconic protectors of oceans and their
    creatures. Possessing tempestuous natures, sea dragons wander widely,
    sometimes claiming thousands of miles of ocean and coastlines as their
    protectorates.
