Description_Visual: >-
  This large, bloated creature has a flattened, semi-translucent body of sickly
  yellow. Eight whip-like tentacles protrude from the monster's front, near its
  head. Hundreds of smaller tentacles line its body and seem to aid in
  locomotion. Its mouth is rounded and ringed with dozens of needle-like teeth.

Description:
  - >-
    Though not aquatic creatures, cave leeches are often found lairing near
    underground rivers, lakes, and streams. They are aggressive creatures whose
    sole purpose seems to be to kill and devour any living creature that
    stumbles into their territory.
  - >-
    Cave leeches often lair with others of their kind. Food is not shared among
    them, so each leech is effectively on its own when hunting prey. Quarrels
    over prey sometimes erupt between cave leeches lairing together; these
    disputes end when one of the leeches backs down or is driven away.
  - >-
    An adult cave leech measures about 8 feet long and its whip-like tentacles
    are each about 6 feet long. Cave leeches are often mistaken for ordinary
    giant leeches, especially when at rest because the creature folds its
    tentacles back against its body. They also do this when waiting to strike.
  - >-
    When a meal comes within range, the cave leech fires a tentacle out and
    attempts to grab its target. Grabbed prey is pulled in to the cave leech's
    mouth and bitten by its horrible teeth. Living creatures trapped by its
    tentacles are held and bitten, the leech draining blood with its bite.
  - >-
    A victim that is completely drained of blood becomes a dried, rotting husk
    and its body is cast aside. Foes killed by its bite attack are often dragged
    to the cave leech's lair and fed to the young or drained of blood over
    several days. A cave leech sometimes uses the rotting husks of its victims
    to line its lair.
