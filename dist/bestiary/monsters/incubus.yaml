SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Pain Redoubled (Su)
    description: >-
      When an incubus confirms a critical hit with a melee weapon or a natural
      weapon, that attack deals an additional 2d6 points of nonlethal damage and
      the target must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be wracked by pain,
      becoming sickened for 1d6 rounds. Multiple uses of this ability extend the
      duration. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    An incubus in his true form is always muscular and attractive, with long
    hair and intense eyes. His skin can be of any color, but is always smooth
    and silky. When not using his wings for flight, an incubus can fold them to
    drape across
  - >-
    its shoulders like a cloak-many decorate both the inside and outside of
    their wings with tattoos, ink, or self-inflicted scars. Incubi stand between
    6 and 6-1/2 feet tall and typically weigh 200 pounds.
  - >-
    When not in battle, incubi serve as counselors, torturers, and companions
    for greater demons. They are also often conjured for similar roles by mortal
    spellcasters, although care must be taken in dalliances with incubi, for
    they delight in causing pain to their companions.
  - >-
    Like succubi, incubi form from the chaotic evil souls of particularly
    lustful and rapacious mortals. Yet whereas succubi are subtle and methodical
    about using their charms to cause ruin, the typical incubus is forthright
    and forceful about his insatiable desires.
