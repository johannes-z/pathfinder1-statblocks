SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Censor (Su)
    description: >-
      A viduus that strikes a living creature with its quill can rewrite that
      creature's memories. The creature must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or
      have its memories affected in a manner similar to the spell modify memory.
      The viduus can rewrite 1 day's worth of the target's memories with a
      single strike. As a result, the creature is either stunned or confused for
      the next 1d4 rounds (50% chance of either). At the GM's discretion, this
      might have longer-term effects. A creature's memories can be restored by
      lesser restoration, modify memory, or similar spells. Memories lost in
      this manner are copied into one of the numerous tomes protected by the
      viduus. This is a mind-affecting effect. The DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Expurgate (Su)
    description: >-
      A viduus that strikes a dead creature-such as a soul, petitioner, or
      undead creature-with its quill can obliterate that creature's memories.
      The creature must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have all of its memories
      erased. It retains language and basic knowledge, but no details as to the
      events of its life. This typically leaves the creature calm and
      indifferent to all beings around it. This memory loss is permanent, though
      the memories can be restored by lesser restoration, modify memory, or
      similar spells. Memories lost in this manner are copied into one of the
      numerous tomes protected by the viduus. This is a mind-affecting effect.
      The DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Transformation (Su)
    description: >-
      A viduus that is reduced to 0 hit points transforms. Its cocoon body
      bursts open, expelling a swarm of biting white-and-black centipedes (same
      statistics as a spider swarm) and a bank of mind fog centered on the
      viduus's square. A viduus can purposefully transform by spending three
      consecutive full-round actions, in which case it reforms somewhere in the
      Boneyard 1 month later.
Description:
  - >-
    Viduuses occupy the libraries and scriptoriums located atop Pharasma's
    spire. While lesser psychopomps record every soul's death and ultimate fate
    upon the planes, viduuses are interested in more extraordinary souls-their
    lives, deeds, deaths, and secrets. Existence holds many mysteries, and those
    mortals who had brushes with the extraordinary have their tales and
    confessions recorded by these semi-cocooned scholars and added to the
    volumes of the Boneyard's expansive library, known as the Catalogue of Last
    Days. Although pretentious in the extreme, viduuses prove quite
    knowledgeable about many historical and planar secrets, and what they don't
    know they generally have a decent idea of how to research, potentially
    summoning assistants from across the planes to aid them.
