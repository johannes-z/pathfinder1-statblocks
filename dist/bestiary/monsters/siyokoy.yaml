      A siyokoy can emit a strong electrical charge from its tail. When it hits
      a creature with its tail slap, the attack deals 3d6 points of electrical
      damage and the target must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned

Description:
  - >-
    Siyokoys are eel-like aquatic creatures often mistaken for merfolk by
    sailors. On closer inspection, however, siyokoys' appearance might make one
    question the vision of said sailors, for apart from their humanoid arms,
    siyokoys are very much creatures of the sea.
  - >-
    Two primary species of siyokoys exist, although both are essentially
    identical as far as game statistics are concerned. The most commonly
    encountered siyokoys are those that dwell amid the caves and crags of coral
    reefs in relatively shallow oceanic waters. These siyokoys tend to have
    colorful patterns on their flesh to mimic the riot of hues the typical coral
    reef displays. Reef-dwelling siyokoys are fond of decorating their lairs
    with particularly strange or colorful specimens of coral, especially when
    such marine growths encrust sunken treasures.
  - >-
    A siyokoy variant that is encountered less frequently dwells in the deeper
    abysses of the ocean, far below the limits of the sun's ability to light.
    These siyokoys are darker colored, and they tend to be darker in personality
    as well. Whereas those dwelling in the bright, sunlit environs of a coral
    reef might be capricious or playful, those who dwell in the dark, vast deeps
    of the sea are often morbid, morose, and even sadistic. Most evil siyokoys
    dwell in such lightless, forgotten reaches of the world's oceans.
  - >-
    Regardless of where they dwell, siyokoys adore shipwrecks and long-forgotten
    ruins claimed by the oceans. Exploring these relics and recovering strange
    and wondrous treasures is what most siyokoys live for, and a siyokoy's lair
    is often decorated with the results of these scavenging expeditions to
    sunken ships and flooded cities. Strangely, siyokoys avoid making their
    lairs amid such ruins, mostly out of a strange superstition the creatures
    share about these areas-it is not lucky, say siyokoys, to sleep in a place
    where air breathing creatures have drowned.
