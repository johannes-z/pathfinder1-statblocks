SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      a stone pudding secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material
      and stone, but not metal. Any melee hit or constrict attack deals acid
      damage. Furthermore, clothing, leather armor, and stone and wooden weapons
      dissolve upon contact, immediately becoming useless. A DC 21 Reflex saving
      throw, negates. The save DCs are Constitution-based. The pudding's acidic
      touch deals 21 points of damage per round to wooden or stone objects
      (including creatures it has turned to stone), but the pudding must remain
      in contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage.
  - name: Petrifying Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      a stone pudding's touch attacks turn opponents to stone permanently.
      Fortitude save DC 21 negates. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Racial Vulnerability (Ex)
    description: >-
      a stone pudding is slowed (as by a slow spell) for 3 rounds if stone to
      flesh is cast on it. The stone pudding does not receive a save against
      this effect.
Description:
  - A stone pudding resembles a large blob of liquid, slow-moving stone.
  - >-
    A stone pudding spends its time slithering along dungeon passageways feeding
    on carrion, adventurers, and just about anything else it encounters.
  - It is thought to be a distant relative of the other deadly puddings.
  - >-
    Stone puddings are most active at night. During the day they simply lie
    dormant, almost as if sleeping. They serve no purpose in the Ecology of
    things and simply spend their time devouring stone and organic materials.
  - >-
    The typical stone pudding appears as a large, oozing gray blob about 16 feet
    across and from 2 to 4 feet thick. The typical stone pudding weighs in
    excess of 20,000 pounds.
  - Stone puddings attack by forming a pseudopod and grabbing their prey.
  - >-
    Opponents turned to stone are grappled and dissolved by the deadly pudding's
    acid. Though non-intelligent, a stone pudding often lies in wait, using its
    coloration to hide itself against a wall or floor of worked stone, before
    lashing out against an opponent.
