  - name: Umbral Web (Su)
    description: >-
      A nightskitter can weave semisolid webs out of shadowstuff. These webs are
      not strong enough to bear any but the lightest weight. A nightskitter can
      use these umbral webs in two different ways, as detailed below. Attacking:
      Up to eight times per day, a nightskitter can hurl a mass of umbral webs
      at a target. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum
      range of 100 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective
      against targets up to one size category larger than the nightskitter. An
      entangled creature gains 1d4 temporary negative levels while entangled,
      and can attempt to escape with a successful DC 28 Escape Artist check, or
      may try to burst the web with a DC 28 Strength check. The negative levels
      granted by an umbral web vanish as soon as the entangled character escapes
      from the web. Multiple umbral webs can entangle a single foe-the DCs to
      escape do not increase, but the temporary negative levels they cause
      stack. A creature that gains a total number of negative levels equal to
      its Hit Dice is immediately slain. Warding: By encasing all surfaces of an
      enclosed area, such as a cavern or a room, with thick layers of umbral
      webs, a nightskitter can infuse that area with necromantic energy. A
      chamber warded by umbral webs is treated as if under the effects of an
      unhallow spell with a deeper darkness spell fixed to the effect. A single
      nightskitter can maintain one such infused area at a time, to a maximum
      size of one 20-foot cube per Hit Die possessed by the nightskitter.
      Maintaining an umbral web ward does not limit its use of these webs to
      attack.
Description:
  - >-
    Despite their undead status, nightshades possess a complex relationship with
    Urgathoa, goddess of undeath.
  - >-
    At times they serve as summoned allies to her clergy, but they serve mortals
    only so long as they can be controlled, bribed, or cowed by the threat of
    deific intervention.
  - >-
    Despite their nature, nightshades only rarely interact with mortal cultists
    of Abyssal lords or archdaemons of similar mien, such as Nocticula, Orcus,
    Charon, and Trelmarixian. This fact owes more to the rarity of interactions
    between nightshades and fiends in general- despite nightshades' own fiendish
    origins-as they are relatively isolated from the Abyss and Abbadon, and prey
    on those planes' residents as willingly as on those of the Material Plane.
