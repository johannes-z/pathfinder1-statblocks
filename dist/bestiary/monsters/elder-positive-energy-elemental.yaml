SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blinding Flash (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a positive energy elemental of at least Medium size
      can release a burst of pure energy in a 10-foot radius. Creatures viewing
      this burst must succeed on a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d10 rounds.
      See the table below for the save DC for each positive energy elemental's
      blinding flash. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      A positive energy elemental that is killed explodes in a flash of blinding
      positive energy that affects all within the area (the radius for its death
      throes ability is the same as the radius for its positive energy aura).
      Undead and negative energy based creatures within the area take 1d8 points
      of positive energy damage per two HD of the elemental. Positive energy
      based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) gain hit
      points equal to the amount of damage the death throes would have otherwise
      dealt. (The rules for temporary hit points and doubling hit points as
      detailed under the elemental's positive energy apply here.) A successful
      Reflex DC (save DC same as the elemental's positive energy save DC)
      reduces the damage by half. All creatures in the area must succeed on a
      Fortitude save (same DC as the elemental's positive energy save DC) or be
      blinded for 1d10 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Positive Energy (Ex)
    description: >-
      A positive energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with
      positive energy. This deals extra damage to an undead or negative energy
      based target (as listed in the statistics block) but heals positive energy
      based creatures (including creatures from the Material Plane) by the same
      amount. Such creatures can be healed above their normal hit point total,
      gaining extra hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit
      points disappear 1 minute later. Creatures healed to twice their normal
      hit points (that is, a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled)
      must succeed on a Fortitude save or explode in a burst of positive energy.
      The save DC is Constitution-based. See the table below for each positive
      energy elemental's save DC. Positive energy (such as a cure spell or
      positive energy channeling) can heal positive energy elementals.
  - name: Positive Energy Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A positive energy elemental radiates an aura of pure positive energy
      around it. (See the table for the area each elemental affects.) Within a
      positive energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use positive
      energy, such as positive energy channeling or the Turn Undead feat,
      function as if the user were 2 levels higher. Additionally, spells and
      spell-like abilities that use positive energy are maximized (as if the
      Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don't
      require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that are
      already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. This aura does not
      affect the positive energy channeling ability of the positive energy
      elemental using it, and its effects do not stack with those of other
      positive energy elementals. Within a positive energy elemental's aura,
      class abilities that use negative energy, such as negative energy
      channeling or the Command Undead feat, function as if the user were 2
      levels lower. Spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy,
      including inflict spells, require the caster to succeed on a Concentration
      check (DC 15 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does
      not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the
      check succeeds, the spell functions normally.
  - name: Positive Energy Channeling (Su)
    description: >-
      A Large or larger positive energy elemental can channel positive energy as
      a cleric whose level equals the elemental's Hit Dice. The Will save DC
      includes a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Positive energy elementals are creatures of pure positive energy. They are
    found primarily on the Positive Energy Plane, but on rare occasions, one
    slips through a portal or is summoned to the Material Plane. These creatures
    seem to be able to communicate with others of their kind by changing the
    intensity of energy in their bodies and altering their shape ever so
    slightly. Positive energy elementals hate negative energy elementals and
    always attack them on sight. Aside from that, positive energy elementals
    rarely engage in combat. If confronted however and forced into battle, the
    creature responds by pummeling its foes with its powerful fists dealing
    positive energy to its foe. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
