    description: >-
      A churr can unleash a frightening howl as a standard action in a 60-foot
      radius. Creatures in the area must succeed on DC 15 Will save or become
      panicked for 1d6 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect.
      Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to
      the same churr's howl for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based and
      includes a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Churrs are savage ape-like creatures found in heavily forested areas. They
    are fairly intelligent, standing 8 feet tall and have great reach. Some
    churrs are known to use primitive clubs or fashion spears with which to
    hunt. Churrs are omnivorous, eating fresh game as well as fruits and
    vegetable matter. In rare instances, stone-aged tribes have been known to
    adopt churr as guardians, teaching them sign language and a few words, which
    they can repeat with a guttural accent that takes some time and practice to
    understand. Churr may cross breed with most humanoid and ape species making
    them a "missing link" or bridge species. Their progeny are often somewhat
    smaller but more intelligent, having full linguistic capacity. Evil bands of
    churr are known to kidnap humanoids to use as slaves for collecting fruit
    and de-lousing purposes. Such slaves are kept until such time as they have
    enraged the churr and it decides to eat it. A churr stands 8 feet tall and
    weighs about 800 pounds. Churrs speak a bastardized form of Giant. Churr
    begin combat by unleashing their horrific howl and beating their chests.
    They then charge opponents attempting to get their meaty paws around them
    and choke the life from them. Churr Society Churrs tend to congregate in
    small bands or packs of less than 20 individuals. Males dominate the pack
    and females are tasked with menial chores, childbearing, and the raising of
    the young. Usually the strongest and most powerful churr becomes the leader.
    Fights to the death are not uncommon when the current leader dies as the
    replacements vie for the open slot. Churr Characters Churr have racial Hit
