SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Air Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against
      the herald.
  - name: Drench (Ex)
    description: >-
      The herald's touch puts out Huge or smaller nonmagical flames. The herald
      can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic (caster level 19th).
  - name: Energy Ray (Ex)
    description: >-
      The herald can shoot rays of cold or electricity up to 100 feet. These can
      threaten a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19, or 20.
  - name: Vortex (Su)
    description: >-
      The herald can create a whirlpool at will as a standard action. This
      ability functions identically to its whirlwind special attack, but can
      only form underwater and cannot leave the water.
  - name: Water Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      The herald gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its
      opponent are touching water. These modifiers apply to bull rush and
      overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these
      kinds of attacks. (Unlike a water elemental, the herald does not have a
      penalty if it or its opponent is touching the ground.)
Description:
  - >-
    Gozreh's herald, Personification of Fury, is a living elemental storm of air
    and water. It may once have been an actual storm given independent life and
    intelligence, but it does not remember anything before awakening in the
    service of Gozreh. Its powers allow it to shift itself fully into air or
    water or even to assume the form of a beast, though it is most comfortable
    in its dual-material elemental shape. As a living storm, the herald can
    provide life-sustaining water, whisk others to safety, save mortals from
    drowning, or rain down watery death upon the enemies of Gozreh. It is
    comfortable doing any of these things, and has no objection to taking lives-
    even innocent lives, if this serves the will of Gozreh.
  - >-
    With Gozreh's permission, it sometimes acts as an intermediary between rival
    elemental forces.
  - >-
    The Herald of Gozreh rises to nearly 25 feet in height, and its changeable
    form usually weighs approximately 1 ton.
