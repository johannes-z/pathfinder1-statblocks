      A giant chameleon can rotate each eye, independently of the other, in an
      180 degree radius. This gives it a +4 racial bonus on Perception checks,
      and it cannot be flanked.

    description: >-
      By magnifying an image, a giant chameleon can see five times as far as a

Description:
  - >-
    Giant chameleons are highly territorial creatures, and rarely is more than
    one is encountered in the same area, except during mating season when both a
    male and female may be encountered. Giant chameleons are omnivorous,
    preferring to feed on giant insects such as flies, larva, crickets,
    grasshoppers, rodents, and lizards. They hunt during the daylight hours,
    spending the early morning hours sunning themselves on rocks or mounds of
    leaves and grass. Giant chameleons reproduce up to three times per year. The
    female lays a clutch of 1d10+8 eggs and buries them in shallow earth or
    soil. Six months later, the young emerge into the world. Young giant
    chameleons reach maturity in a few months and leave the lair. Giant
    chameleons are either green or brown in color with the females being
    slightly darker and heavier than the males. Males are distinguished by the
    white lateral line running the length of their bodies and the dark bands
    extending from head to tail. Females usually possess a dark yellow lateral
    stripe. Both species have striped throats and lips. Giant chameleons sit
    completely still watching for potential prey to come within range of their
    tongue. Once a creature is located, the giant chameleon shoots its tongue
    out, grabs the prey, and reels it into its mouth, where it is chewed and
    swallowed. Giant Horned Chameleon The giant horned chameleon is a
    territorial creature and is rarely encountered with another of its kind
    except during mating season. Giant horned chameleons are green or dark
    green. Males are distinguished by the three large horns protruding from
    their head. This grants them a gore attack (1d8 + Strength modifier) that
    they can use in lieu of a bite or tongue attack. Females possess the same
    horns, but they are usually underdeveloped (dealing 1d6 + Strength
    modifier). These chameleons have a crest on the back of their head, and bony
    ridges and spines running the length of their back. Rock Chameleon Rock
    chameleons resemble common giant chameleons but their natural coloration is
    gray and they are only found in warm and temperate mountains where their
    coloration allows them to blend in with their surroundings. They use the
    stats for the common giant chameleon, but only gain the bonus to Stealth
    checks in rocky surroundings. Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and
