      If a metallic ooze is subjected to a heat or fire effect, it emanates a
      cloud of semi-transparent vapor that irritates the eyes and respiratory
      system of living creatures within a 10-foot radius. Affected creatures
      must succeed on a DC 21 Fortitude save or take 2d6 points of acid damage
      initially and suffer a -2 circumstance penalty on attack and weapon damage
      rolls for 3 rounds. The cloud disperses in 1d4 rounds and can be affected
      by wind. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description:
  - >-
    A metallic ooze appears as a 9-foot blob of protoplasm of varying hue and
    color, and come in a variety of sizes and colors: gold, silver, platinum,
    copper, brass, or bronze. Regardless of the color or size, metallic oozes
    resemble large piles of coins. The oozes use their appearance to lure
    wouldbe treasure hunters to their doom. Because of this, they are sometimes
    referred to as hoard oozes. Its form is coarse and rough giving it the
    appearance of piles of coins. A metallic ooze can flatten its body in order
    to squeeze through spaces and cracks where it normally could not go. A
    metallic ooze can be found virtually anywhere, though it tends to inhabit
    dungeons, ruined temples, castles, and other buildings where treasure
    seekers seem to enjoy perfecting their craft. From a distance of 30 feet or
    more, a metallic ooze resembles a pile of loose coins (of whatever type its
    coloration most closely resembles). A creature can attempt a DC 20
    Perception check to notice the ooze for what it is. This monster does not
    collect treasure, but the remnants of living creatures that meet their
    demise at the hands of this creature are often found scattered about its
    lair. A metallic ooze lies still until it detects a potential meal within
    range. It then forms a pseudopod and pummels the opponent. Creatures killed
    by a metallic ooze are devoured. While a metallic ooze can cling to walls
    and ceilings (and often does drop on unsuspecting prey), it prefers to
    wander dungeon corridors and such on the ground, often waiting in one spot
    until living prey wanders too close. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
