Description:
  - >-
    Sea giants are the reclusive cousins of storm giants. They are most often
    found in the deepest depths of the seas where they make their dwelling in
    the cones of long dead undersea volcanoes. Sea giants have a druid like
    power over the forces of the seas, and are a living embodiment of its bounty
    and destructive wrath. Sea giants seldom come into contact with surface
    dwellers, but have been known on rare occasions to exact bounties from
    coastal cities to insure the safety of its navies and merchant vessels. Sea
    giants are most commonly encountered within a few hundred miles of their
    lair, tending to their domain and battling off incursions of sahaugin,
    aboleth, krakens and other such destructive forces of the undersea. An adult
    male sea giant stands 10 feet tall and weighs about 6,000 pounds. Females
    are slightly shorter and lighter. Both have sea green skin, dark green or
    black hair, and silver eyes. Sea giants adorn themselves in loose flowing
    robes of white, blue, or green. Many wear wreathes of coral in their hair.
    When battling at the surface of the seas, sea giants hurl rocks at great
    length against opposing ranged attackers, usually including crews of siege
    engines. When battling against surface ships their tactic is to disguise
    themselves by creating rough waters with their control water ability. They
    then hammer the hull with their mighty fists until it is holed, without ever
    revealing themselves to the crew. Once holed, they tear the hull apart and
    drown the crew. When fighting beneath the waves they use their crushing
    pressure special ability to increase the water pressure around themselves in
    an effort to destroy interlopers and trespassers. Sea Giant Characters Sea
    giants must possess fourteen levels of humanoid before taking class levels.
    Sea giants are usually barbarians or clerics. Their chaotic nature lends
