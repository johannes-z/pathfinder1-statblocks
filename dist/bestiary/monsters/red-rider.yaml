Description:
  - >-
    The Red Rider is the most fiery and aggressive of the Three Riders. When
    Irriseni citizens share old tales of previous Riders around the hearth,
    stories of the Red Rider's judgments always go into gruesome detail about
    his wholesale slaughter and shocking violence. Some argue that the Red Rider
    is no more vicious than the Black Rider, and that the larger number of
    heinous tales about the Red Rider are simply the result of the time of day
    in which he engages in his tasks. More citizens are awake and out of their
    homes during the day to witness the Red Rider's judgments before he cedes
    his time to the night.
