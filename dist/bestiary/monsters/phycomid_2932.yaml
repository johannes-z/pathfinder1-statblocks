  - name: Spore Infection (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by a phycomid's fluid globule attack must succeed on a DC
      13 Fortitude save or take 1d2 points of Constitution damage as tiny
      mushroomlike growths sprout from its body. Each minute (10 rounds)
      thereafter, until the victim receives a remove disease, heal, miracle, or
      wish, he takes 1 point of Constitution damage. At Constitution 0, the
      victim dies and his body collapses to the ground, sprouting a new
      phycomid. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A patch of phycomids is often found growing in garbage heaps, refuse, and
    other such places. A typical patch of phycomid covers an area of 2 feet. The
    actual number of mushroom-growths varies with the actual size of the patch.
    The mushroom caps are usually white, red, purple, or yellow in color, and
    the phycomid's body is milky white.
  - >-
    The phycomid attacks by extruding a small tube from its body and firing a
    glob of acid at a foe. The phycomid has a range increment of 5 feet and can
    fire a globule to a maximum range of 20 feet.
