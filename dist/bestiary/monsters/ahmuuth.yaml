      An ahmuuth's spells and spelllike abilities have their full effect against

Description:
  - >-
    An ahmuuth is a servitor of Pharasma who is responsible for helping mortals
    destroy undead and dispatch renegade souls evading the goddess's judgment.
    Unlike morrigna psychopomps (Bestiary 4 219), who hunt lost or corrupted
    souls on their own, ahmuuths work with mortal worshipers of Pharasma and try
    to usher creatures like ghosts to peaceable final ends-when they can. When
    they can't, they have no qualms about forcing wayward spirts to face their
    goddess's judgement. An ahmuuth looks like a humanoid wearing an owl mask,
    and is always accompanied by floating gravestone shards that act as a
    shield. Like owls, ahmuuths are silent stalkers, revealing themselves only
    at the moment of attack. Ahmuuths stand just over 6 feet tall and weigh
    approximately 150 pounds.
