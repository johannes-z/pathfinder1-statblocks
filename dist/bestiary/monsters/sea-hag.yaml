SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Evil Eye (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a sea hag can cast her dire gaze upon any single
      creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or
      be staggered as strange nebulous distress and a gnawing sense of impending
      doom plagues the victim. If a sea hag uses her evil eye on someone already
      afflicted by this curse, the victim must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be
      overwhelmed with fright and collapse into a comatose state for 3 days.
      Each day that passes, the comatose victim must make a DC 14 Fortitude save
      or perish. The evil eye is a mindaffecting fear effect. The save DCs are
      Charisma-based. Evil Eye Curse: Gaze-failed save; save Will DC 14;
      frequency 1/day; effect staggered (or fall comatose if already under the
      effects of the evil eye).
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    description: >-
      The sight of a sea hag is so revolting that anyone within 60 feet (other
      than another hag) who sets eyes upon one must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude
      save or instantly be weakened, taking 1d6 points of Strength damage.
      Creatures that are affected by this power or that successfully save
      against it cannot be affected again by the same hag's horrific appearance
      for 24 hours. This is a mindaffecting effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Monstrous sea witches, these wicked hags possess terrifying features that
    few dare look upon. Reveling in discord, the foul creatures drag sailors to
    watery graves and torment the peoples of the oceans with wicked promises.
    Sea hags are always terrible to look upon, and despite their gluttonous
    ways, they are usually emaciated creatures who look half-starved. Most stand
    about 6 feet tall and weigh 150 pounds.
  - >-
    Sea hags prefer to dwell relatively close to shore where fishermen and
    trading vessels are more commonly encountered.
  - >-
    Most choose to live far from urban areas so that their acts don't draw as
    much attention from would-be enemies, but it's not uncommon for a
    particularly brave or eager sea hag to settle in a city harbor or in the
    mouth of a deep river.
  - >-
    Sea hags form covens similar to other hags, but their aquatic nature
    generally keeps them from forming mixed covens.
  - >-
    In the case of a shorelinedwelling green hag (often a green hag who dwells
    in a saltmarsh or other coastal swampland), a coven often consists of two
    sea hags who look to the green hag as their mother and leader.
  - >-
    More commonly, a sea hag coven consists of a group of particularly friendly
    and sisterly sea hags. See page 167 for more details on hag covens.
