SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Enervating Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Negative energy weeps from a dreadweed's form. Living creatures in the
      area take 2d6 points of negative energy damage each round. A successful DC
      19 Fortitude save negates the damage that round. A new save must be made
      each round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Enervating Ray (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round and no more than three times per day, as a standard action,
      a dreadweed can fire a ray of negative energy at a single target to a
      range of 30 feet. This ray functions as an enervation spell (CL 8th). Each
      time a dreadweed uses this ray, it suppresses its enervating aura for 1d4
      rounds.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save DC 19 Fort; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4
      Con damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Vines (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dreadweed can extend up to four vines from its body at a time, launching
      them to a maximum range of 20 feet. A dreadweed's attacks with its vines
      resolve as ranged touch attacks. These vines are quite strong, but can be
      severed by any amount of slashing damage (a vine is AC 20).If a dreadweed
      uses its pull ability to pull a target within reach of its bite attack, it
      can immediately make a free bite attack with a +4 bonus on its attack roll
      against that target.
Description:
  - >-
    A dreadweed is a strange plant creature that grows on unholy ground. Infused
    with negative energy, it feeds on any living creature it encounters. A
    dreadweed never stops growing as long as it is able to find food, so in the
    right cursed soil these plants can grow to truly monstrous proportions. At
    rest, a dreadweed resembles a matted, chaotic tangle of vines and
    undergrowth, filled with old sticks, briars, thistles, and nettles. Once
    roused, however, the dreadweed pulls together into a vaguely humanoid shape
    and emits a chilling aura that saps the life from living creatures.
  - A dreadweed is about 6 feet tall but only weighs 75 pounds.
  - >-
    A dreadweed attacks with its vine-like tentacles, tearing at its prey and
    injecting a powerful poisonous sap with its bite attack. It often attacks in
    ambush, leaping towards its victim in a swirl of lashes. During battle, a
    dreadweed can focus its negative energy aura into a powerful ray that
    further damages its foes.
