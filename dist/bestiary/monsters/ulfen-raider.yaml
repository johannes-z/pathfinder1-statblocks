Description:
  - >-
    Raiders from the Linnorm Kingdoms seek to prove themselves by sailing to
    distant lands and returning with riches, either obtained by shrewd trading
    or taken as plunder from a successful raid. All raiders seek to show their
    courage in battle, fighting fiercely for pillage or honor.
  - >-
    While raiding, these barbarians employ the element of surprise; in the faint
    predawn light, they quietly row their longship with muff led oars as they
    draw near the targeted settlement. Sometimes Ulfen raiders might put in at a
    nearby, uninhabited harbor so as to approach their quarry on foot from
    inland, using nearby terrain as cover. However they approach, the raiders
    aim to catch their prize unawares to prevent their prey from fleeing with
    valuable plunder. When a group of raiders attacks, the clamorous sound of
    their Ulfen war songs floats over the din of battle, and the battle plan
    changes from stealth to intimidation. While Ulfen raiders have a keen sense
    of tactics, they prefer to fight as bold individuals, rather than in strict
    formations, in hopes of gaining personal glory. Once battle commences, Ulfen
    raiders often form a wedge of spears to drive their way through enemy lines.
    They use shield wall tactics when outnumbered or when they encounter stiff
    opposition.

    After a successful attack, Ulfen raiders quickly gather loot and valuable
    captives onto their longships. As well as coins and other riches, the
    raiders often take bulky luxury goods that are hard to obtain in their
    homeland, such as well-made furniture or carpets, and even appropriate
    high-pedigree livestock to increase the quality of their own herds. Slaves
    are often harvested from the ranks of a village's able-bodied youths. While
    Ulfen raiders seize anything of value that they can bring on board their
    longships, they are unlikely to wantonly destroy a raided settlement. After
    all, if the settlement is able to eventually recover from the attack, it can
    provide more plunder in the next raiding season.
  - >-
    In large groups, Ulfen raiders can take over a wide area of countryside, and
    often demand an exorbitant payment from local leaders to move on. Smaller
    communities frequently pay, rather than attempting the expensive process of
    raising an army and then fighting an uncertain battle against these
    bloodthirsty raiders.
