SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Electricity Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      An emerald automaton reduced to half its hit points or fewer emits
      hazardous energy from its damaged magical battery. Any non-construct
      creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of a damaged emerald automaton
      takes 1d10 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 12 negates). The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Magic Dependent (Su)
    description: >-
      An emerald automaton is partially powered by magic. When deprived of
      magic, the automaton is affected as if it were exhausted. The automaton's
      magic can be cut off by antimagic, or suppressed by a dispel magic or
      mage's disjunction effect as if it were a magic item.
  - name: Proficient (Ex)
    description: An emerald automaton is proficient with all simple and martial weapons.
Description:
  - >-
    Like other constructs, an emerald automaton is a mindless, unliving machine
    that exists only to follow the orders of its creator. It is a capable
    soldier and can wield almost any weapon its creator chooses to provide it,
    fighting until it or its target is destroyed.
  - >-
    In combat, emerald automatons often wield polearms and make use of their
    reach. When multiple automatons are fighting together, it's common for one
    to sunder a target's shield or weapon and the rest to gang up
  - >-
    against the target. Getting inside the reach of an emerald automaton is no
    guarantee of safety-the constructs are quite strong, and can strike with a
    powerful slam attack at need. When badly damaged, an emerald automaton
    begins to emit crackling green sparks of electricity that can severely shock
    nearby creatures.
  - Construction
  - >-
    An emerald automaton begins as an articulated iron frame connected with
    thick copper wiring, and is then covered by armored plates. These materials
    cost at least 500 gp. The creator must then use a fist-sized shard of
    crystal from the Emerald Spire as the automaton's main battery, placing it
    in the construct's hollow chest.
