Description_Visual: >-
  A writhing forest of tendrils extends from one end of this chitin-covered
  creature's body, while from the other lashes a pincer-tipped tail. Six
  transparent blisters adorn its back, each containing a brain floating in thick
  green fluid.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Brain Collection (Ex)
    description: >-
      A yah-thelgaad can store up to six brains of Small or Medium creatures and
      use them to enhance its knowledge and power. Each stored brain grants a
      yah-thelgaad a cumulative +2 insight bonus to AC, concentration checks,
      and Knowledge checks. A yah-thelgaad can extract a brain from a helpless
      opponent with a coup de grace attack, or as a standard action from a body
      that has been dead for no more than 1 minute. A yah-thelgaad that has
      fewer than six collected brains gains two negative levels for each missing
      brain. These negative levels never become permanent, and can only be
      removed by replacing one of the yah-thelgaad's collected brains. The
      statistics presented here assume a yah-thelgaad with a full collection.
  - name: Carapace (Ex)
    description: >-
      The spikes on a yah-thelgaad's carapace make melee attacks against it
      hazardous. Any opponent attempting to attack a yah-thelgaad with a light
      weapon, unarmed strike, touch attack, or natural attack must succeed at a
      DC 22 Reflex save or take 1d6 points of bleed damage from these bristling
      barbs. Bleed damage from multiple failed Reflex saves does not stack. The
      save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Command Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a yah-thelgaad can cause a disease or infection
      currently afflicting a creature within 30 feet to quicken and activate,
      forcing the afflicted creature to immediately attempt a saving throw
      against the disease's effects. Those who fail immediately suffer the
      disease's effects. These additional saving throws count against those one
      must succeed at to recover from a disease, so it's possible for a victim
      to be cured by succeeding at enough saving throws. Any creature that has
      been affected by a yah-thelgaad's command disease ability (whether or not
      the creature succeeded at the saving throw this ability triggered) takes a
      -2 penalty against any mind-affecting spell or effect generated by the
      yah-thelgaad in the next minute.
  - name: Mind Storm (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a yah-thelgaad can employ its
      own brain as well as any brains kept in its blisters to create a powerful
      psychic vortex. When the creature activates this ability, all creatures
      within a 40-foot radius must succeed at DC 23 Will save or become confused
      for 1d4 rounds. When a yah-thelgaad activates this ability, it can choose
      to absorb one of its brains as a swift action to cause one creature within
      the area of effect that has succumbed to the confusion effect to instead
      become stunned for 1d4 rounds. A creature stunned in this manner is
      confused for 1d4 rounds after the stun effect ends. A yah-thelgaad
      generally saves this tactic for when it's faced with a particularly
      dangerous foe, since the stun effect forces the yah-thelgaad to lose one
      of its stored brains and gain 2 negative levels. This is a mind-affecting
      confusion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Claw-injury; save Fort DC 26; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4
      Strength damage and nauseated for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Powerful Tentacles (Ex)
    description: A yah-thelgaad's tentacles are primary attacks.
  - name: Spells (Su)
    description: >-
      A yah-thelgaad casts spells as a 12th-level sorcerer. Its caster level is
      reduced by 2 for each negative level it gains from missing brains. A
      yah-thelgaad with no collected brains can't cast any of its spells.
  - name: Spellstrike (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a yah-thelgaad casts a spell with a range of "touch," it can
      deliver the spell through its claw attack as part of a melee attack.
      Instead of the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the
      spell, the yah-thelgaad can make one free melee attack with its claw as
      part of casting the spell. If successful, this claw attack deals its
      normal damage (including poison) as well as the effects of the spell.
  - name: Strange Knowledge (Ex)
    description: All knowledge skills are class skills for yah-thelgaads.
Description:
  - >-
    When a neh-thalggu has absorbed a critical mass of thoughts and memories
    from an unknown number of humanoid brains, its body undergoes a horrific
    transformation. The creature enters a state of torpor, its body curling into
    a tight ball as it consumes the oldest of its seven stored brains to trigger
    the metamorphosis. Over the course of several days of self-consumption, the
    neh-thalggu bursts from the shell of its old body into its new incarnation
    as a yah-thelgaad.
  - >-
    While the yah-thelgaad shares many of the features of its less powerful
    progenitor, it is in every way a more powerful creature than it was before.
    While the capacity to store one fewer brain than a neh-thalggu presents some
    disadvantage, the yah-thelgaad gains twice as much power from a collected
    brain as its lesser kin does. In addition, these creatures need not limit
    their harvest to the brains of humanoids-any Small or Medium creature's
    brain will do.
  - >-
    Yah-thelgaads are zealously devoted to the inscrutable causes of the
    Dominion of the Black, but they are also notoriously devout believers in
    that alliance's weird theology, worshiping a concept they refer to as the
    "Ineffable Void," among other cryptic mysteries. It is not uncommon for
    yah-thelgaads of high rank to also possess inquisitor or oracle levels,
    lording their authority and fanatical faith over those in their charge-the
    most powerful yah-thelgaads often take levels in mystic theurge to combine
    their class-based mastery of the divine with their stolen brains' arcane
    lore.
  - >-
    Yah-thelgaads often supervise the Dominion of the Black's surgical and
    genetic engineers on major projects, pushing those agents to attempt greater
    and more horrific procedures. For all their legendary cruelty, however,
    yah-thelgaads don't appear to gain pleasure from such experiments. Indeed,
    they don't seem to feel any emotions at all on their own, but rather
    experience such sensations vicariously through the memories of the brains
    they've collected. In this way, the creatures know lust, fear, hatred, and
    pride without exposing their own minds to the disadvantages of being
    susceptible to mind-affecting effects.
