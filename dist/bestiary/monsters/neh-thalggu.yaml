SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Brain Collection (Ex)
    description: >-
      A neh-thalggu can store up to seven humanoid brains and use them to
      enhance its knowledge and power. Each stored brain grants a neh-thalggu a
      cumulative +1 insight bonus to AC, concentration checks, and Knowledge
      checks. A neh-thalggu can extract a brain from a helpless opponent with a
      coup de grace attack, or as a standard action from a body that has been
      dead for no more than 1 minute. A neh-thalggu that has fewer than seven
      brains gains one negative level for each missing brain. These negative
      levels can never become permanent, but they can only be removed by
      replacing one of its collected brains. The stats presented here assume a
      monster with a full collection.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 21; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2
      Strength damage and staggered for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. The
      save DC is Constitution-based. Spells A neh-thalggu casts spells as a
      7th-level sorcerer. For each negative level it takes from missing brains,
      its caster level is reduced by 1. A neh-thalggu with no collected brains
      cannot cast any of its spells.
  - name: Strange Knowledge (Ex)
    description: All knowledge skill are class skills for neh-thalggus.
Description:
  - >-
    Known also as brain collectors, the alien neh-thalggus hail from distant
    worlds, traveling the gulfs of space on immense living ships that swiftly
    decay when they land upon a new world, leaving behind a deadly cargo of
    hungry monsters. Neh-thalggus are carnivores, but they do not digest
    humanoid brains they eat-rather, these brains lodge in one of several
    bulbous blisters on the creature's back and help to increase its intellect.
  - >-
    Some speculate that neh-thalggus encountered in this reality may merely be
    juveniles of their kind, perhaps exiled from their home worlds by greater
    kin until they can prove their worth on other worlds. Their brain
    collections may be a morbid form of currency in their home realm, or the
    thoughts in these brains may merely be fuel for a dark apotheosis into an
    even more sinister mature form.
