Description_Visual: >-
  Gaunt and parched, this crone-like figure moves with the predatory jerkiness
  of a hunting vulture. Unnaturally tall and lean, her form is all cracked flesh
  and stony crevices spanning a wasteland of withered gray flesh. Shattered
  black teeth jut from a chapped, lipless mouth that stretches beneath a high,
  scarred brow devoid of nose or eyes.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gem Eye (Su)
    description: >-
      Stygiras possess a special connection with gemstones. While holding or
      otherwise in contact with a gemstone of at least the size of a human eye,
      a stygira can see through the gemstone like a magical eye, viewing her
      surroundings as if her blindsense extended to 120 feet and she were under
      the effects of true seeing, which grants her a +4 bonus on Perception
      checks.
  - name: Gem Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Shaken for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 16 negates. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. A stygira can only make use of this ability while holding
      a gemstone. Light Blindness Despite their effective blindness, stygiras
      remain sensitive to light. Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds stygiras
      for 1 round; on subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain
      in the affected area.
  - name: Stone Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature struck by a stygira's claws must make a DC 18 Will save or be
      affected by a curse that gradually drains it of color, stiffens its
      joints, and finally turns the victim to stone. This curse proves
      frighteningly unpredictable, forcing another save against its effects
      every 1d3 hours. Any creature that is drained to 0 Dexterity or fails
      three saves against the curse is permanently petrified. Even if a creature
      is petrified and then restored to flesh, it is still affected by the curse
      and is petrified again upon failing its next save against the curse. A
      stone curse can only be removed in one of two ways: by casting remove
      curse or by spending a full hour in unobstructed natural sunlight. Magical
      radiance like daylight does not affect a stone curse, and remove curse
      does not return a petrified creature to flesh. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Stone curse: Claw-curse; save Will DC 18; frequency
      1/1d3 hours; effect 1d6 Dex damage, failing 3 saves results in
      petrification; cure casting remove curse or spending 1 hour in natural
      sunlight
Description:
  - >-
    Withered hermits wrapped in tattered black rags, these scarred, eyeless
    crones slip through the dark crevasses of both earth and time. Degenerate
    inheritors of the half-remembered, collapsed cyclops civilizations, the
    stygiras-or stone witches, as they are often called- command strange secrets
    of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the depths. Ages of
    communion with the darkness and reliance upon alien magics have corrupted
    the stygiras from the primitive human witches their ancestors were countless
    ages ago, transforming them into a terrifying, debased breed infused with
    magics not their own. In many a savage land, these crones were once or are
    still worshiped as seers and demigods, weaving magic and communing with the
    earth to manipulate their servants into obeying their selfish and grotesque
    whims. In other realms, they haunt the night, prowling from their caves to
    feed upon the unwary or make alliances with those cruel and ambitious enough
    to believe their perverse counsel. Yet for all their perverse blasphemies
    and primitive desires, their powers to see what none should and reduce life
    to brittle stone proves enough to inspire dread and superstitious belief in
    nearly all who hear of the harsh stone witches. Stygiras on average stand
    6-1/2 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds. Ecology It is said that
    the stygiras draw their power from stone and from the darkness. Certainly
    they live their entire lives in the dark, traveling through intricate,
    maze-like caverns and the moonless sky with equal ease. They draw their
    sustenance from the base things they scrape from the earth-vermin, molds,
    lichens, and whatever fleshy things happen into their lairs. Although
    technically blind, stygiras have almost supernaturally keen hearing, taste,
    and touch, and so have no need for sight. What remains of the eyes that lurk
    as vestigial elements of their anatomy hide beneath the scarred flesh of
    their faces. While such remnant organs typically go unused, they can still
    detect the presence of light, an uncomfortable sensation that all stygiras
    take great pains to avoid. Stygiras can in fact travel under the skies, but
    they quickly become agoraphobic and retreat to the safety of shadowy canyons
    or caves as soon as possible. They avoid the sunlight hours, with most
    willing to face death in the darkness rather than take their chances
    venturing into the light. All stygiras are female; they are capable of
    reproducing with humanoids of nearly any species and always bearing three or
    more withered-and typically stillborn-stygira young. Yet stygiras make up
    for their appallingly low live birth and survival rates with unnaturally
    long lifespans. None can say how long stygiras who don't meet their end by
    violence might live, but instances of stone witches living for 3 or more
    centuries are well documented. Habitat & Society Stygiras most commonly
    occupy lands near the phenomenally ancient tombs and monuments of the
    cyclops empires. While some of the crazed witches make the impossible claim
    that all stygira are the surviving mortal apprentices of primordial cyclops
    seers, saner minds posit that the predecessors of these crones were
    primitive human shamans and mystics who managed to tap into a degree of the
    fallen empires' powers. Whatever the case, the connection between stygiras
    and the ancient cyclopes lingers in their shared language and the mad
    scrawls covering many of these hags' lairs.
