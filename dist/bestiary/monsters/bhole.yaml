SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every minute, a bhole can expel a prodigious amount of thick slime
      from its gullet. This breath weapon has a range of 900 feet, and creates a
      40-foot-diameter spread of slime in its targeted area. Any creature within
      this area must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4
      rounds. The slime transforms the area it coats into difficult terrain.
      Furthermore, any creature that is in the area (or that attempts to enter
      the area) must succeed at a DC 29 Reflex save or be entangled by the
      slime. Bhole slime persists for 2d6 hours and bhole lairs are typically
      pre-caked with the stuff. A bhole can move through bhole slime without
      penalty. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Immune to Magical Control (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bhole is immune to nearly all forms of mind control, including all
      charm, suggestion, and dominate spells. It is similarly immune to magic
      jar and possession attempts. Confusion and other mind-affecting effects
      that don't allow another creature to directly control a bhole work
      normally. Rare effects that allow a creature to manipulate the exact
      effects of confusion on a creature provide one of the few ways to
      magically control a bhole. Other methods, particularly those tied to
      strange and powerful artifacts, may work as well.
  - name: Overwhelming Strength (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bhole always applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on all natural
      weapon attacks.
Description:
  - >-
    Known on some worlds as dholes, bholes are among the largest of living
    creatures, wormlike leviathans of such size that few can claim to have seen
    one wholly from head to tail, and those who do suffer from madness or other
    aff lictions that cause others to doubt these tales. The coloration of these
    creature ranges widely, from dark blues and purples to pale grays, yellows,
    or white. A bhole's cavernous mouth consists of long, bony jaws that extend
    and unfold from the creature's head when it feeds. Bholes are incredibly
    long-lived- those that exist in remote worlds or in other dimensions have
    done so for countless eons. The bholes themselves seem to have no interest
    in their history, perhaps as a result of their limited intellect, but they
    can live forever, barring death by violence. Regions inhabited by bholes are
    always wastelands. Bholes seem able to eat and digest anything and
    everything, and in time can reduce a huge area to just a honeycombed network
    of immense tunnels. These regions swiftly collapse in on themselves, leaving
    rubble-filled pits of terrifying size.
