SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A cloud dragon's breath weapon is a powerful cone of icy cold air. When a
      cloud dragon uses its breath weapon, make a single bull rush attack using
      the dragon's CMB against the CMD of any creature that failed its Reflex
      save and is three or more size categories smaller than the dragon. This
      bull rush does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the dragon cannot
      choose to move with any opponent pushed back. In addition to being pushed
      back, affected creatures are knocked prone and take 1d4 points of
      nonlethal damage per 10 feet they are pushed back. Flying creatures are
      buffeted and pushed back twice the distance and sustain 1d6 points of
      nonlethal damage per 10 feet they are pushed back.
  - name: Cold Bite (Su)
    description: >-
      At old age, a cloud dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of cold
      damage. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to
      6d6.
  - name: Cloud Form (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a juvenile or older cloud dragon can assume gaseous
      form at will, but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed
      of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.
  - name: Cloud Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A very young cloud dragon can see perfectly in foggy conditions (such as
      those created by fog cloud or obscuring mist).
  - name: Immunity to Winds (Su)
    description: >-
      A cloud dragon is immune to the effects of wind. It ignores the penalties
      applied to the Fly skill incurred by wind speed, and is immune to the
      negative effects of any spell or effect that manipulates wind, such as
      gust of wind and whirlwind. Spell-like Abilities A cloud dragon gains the
      following spelllike abilities, usable at will upon reaching the listed age
      category. Young-create water; Juvenile-obscuring mist; Adult-stinking
      cloud; Old-call lightning; Ancient-control winds; Great Wyrm-control
      weather.
  - name: Whirlwind (Sp)
    description: >-
      A great wyrm cloud dragon can use this ability three times per day. It
      works as a whirlwind spell. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level
      spell.
Description:
  - >-
    Cloud dragons are the most reclusive of all dragons, rarely leaving the
    safety and sanctity of their cloudy lairs. They have a great dislike for
    non-flying creatures and creatures that must use non-natural means to fly
    (such as through magical items or spells). A cloud dragon wyrmling's scales
    are silvery-blue with a slight hint of red at the tip of each scale. As the
    dragon ages, its color slowly changes to a bright sunset orange. The oldest
    cloud dragons resemble gold dragons, save for the large bony plates on their
    heads and backs. Cloud dragons are not highly aggressive, but dislike
    interlopers and attack them on sight. They open combat using their breath
    weapon, followed by their spell-like abilities. A cloud dragon rarely lands,
    preferring to fight from the air. Credit The Cloud Dragon originally
