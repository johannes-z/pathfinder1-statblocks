Description:
  - >-
    Vapor dire rats resemble normal dire rats in all respects. Though more
    intelligent than dire rats, they seem to possess a lot of the same traits
    and conduct themselves in much the same way as normal dire rats.
  - >-
    They seldom keep company with their normal counterparts and often times
    quarrel and fight with dire rats. Vapor dire rats are found just about
    anywhere save the coldest of climates. Common encounters occur underground
    or in ruined castles, keeps, temples, and so forth. Regardless of where
    these creatures construct their nest, a source of water is always found
    nearby.
  - >-
    Vapor dire rats attack with their bite. A pack uses ambush tactics against
    potential prey, and when attacking, they often attempt to flank their foe,
    sending several rats against the creature's flank while the rest hit from
    the front or sides. Injured vapor dire rats drop back where they can use
    their fast healing ability (if they are near a source of water, fog, steam,
    or mist) while the holes in their ranks are filled by other vapor dire rats.
    Vapor dire rats usually assume vapor form and attempt to escape if they lose
    more than half their numbers.
