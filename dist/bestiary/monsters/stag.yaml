Description:
  - >-
    True masters of the wild, deer gracefully glide through meadows and among
    the thickets of the deepest forests. Found in all climates and most
    terrains, deer form tightly knit herds for protection. These creatures fall
    victim to predators, and many humanoids hunt the animals for food and hides.
    They're not picky eaters, and consume all manner of plant material. In areas
    where humanoids live, deer can become pests as they graze in fields and
    destroy gardens in search of food. The stat block shown above represents a
    male deer (a stag). Unlike caribou and other similar animals, female deer
    only rarely grow antlers, thus they lack gore attacks. Stags are
    approximately 6 feet long from nose to tail and weigh up to 350 pounds.
