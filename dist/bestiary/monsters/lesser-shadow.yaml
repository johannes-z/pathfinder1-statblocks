Description:
  - >-
    According to ancient texts, an arcane creature known only as the Shadow Lord
    created beings of living darkness to aid him and protect him. These beings,
    called shadows, were formed through a combination of darkness and evil. He
    also created other beings of darkness, lesser beings, not quite as powerful
    as his original creations. These creatures became known as lesser shadows.
    Though not as powerful as their stronger relatives, lesser shadows are every
    bit as evil. A lesser shadow is completely indistinguishable from a standard
    shadow. Like its brethren, it is a creature of living darkness. Lesser
    shadows hide in darkness, springing to attack when living opponents wander
    too close. They are often led in combat by a shadow. Unlike normal shadows,
    lesser shadows do not create spawn (though it is rumored that a variant of
    the lesser shadow can in fact create spawn). Copyright Notice Authors Scott
