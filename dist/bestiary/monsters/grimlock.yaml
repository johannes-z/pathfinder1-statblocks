Description:
  - >-
    Grimlocks are evil and foul subterranean dwellers believed to be descendants
    of an ancient human race. Legends speak of long ago wars between various
    races that drove humans underground. For a while, they survived on what food
    they could forage, but eventually turned to cannibalism; beginning with
    small underground animals such as rats and other rodents, and eventually
    turning to aboveground raids on other races. Grimlocks dine on humanoid
    flesh and blood (with humans and dwarves being their favorite meals). They
    are primitive creatures, living in tribal communities of up to 60 or more
    individuals in underground caves and tunnels. Raiding and hunting bands
    often venture to the surface world to attack nearby settlements, capturing
    or killing those they encounter and returning to their lair to feast upon
    their spoils. Raids such as these are always conducted at night under the
    cover of darkness when grimlocks have the advantage. Grimlocks detest
    sunlight but are not harmed by it.

    When not raiding the surface world, grimlocks often battle with other
    subterranean races including drow, dwarves, duergar, and even other grimlock
    tribes. Such battles can consist of outright warfare, but most of the time
    the battles are simple raids into other underground lairs to procure food
    (usually human or dwarven slaves kept by the other underground races). When
    engaged in wars with other races, grimlock leaders often ride basilisks into
    battle. Some larger grimlock lairs often have at least one medusa in midst
    as well.

    A grimlock stands 5 to 6 feet tall and weighs 150 to 200 pounds. Its skin is
    slate gray and its hair is oily and matted. The creature emanates a stench
    that most others find nauseating, yet to a grimlock, it's a means of
    identification, for each scent is unique to a grimlock. Such fine
    distinctions are noticeable to other grimlocks, and possibly other creatures
    with a strong olfactory sense.
  - >-
    Due to their lack of sight, grimlocks prefer melee to ranged combat and
    close on enemies quickly when engaged. They attack with their menacing axes
    or powerful slams, slashing or pummeling their foes until their opponents
    are dead. Opponents that attempt to flee are run down and killed. Grimlocks
    that fall in combat are "honored" by being carried off the field of battle
    and devoured by their own.
  - >-
    Recent forays into underground caverns and caves by an intrepid band of
    adventurers speak of another race of grimlocks, civilized, and
    non-cannibalistic. These same adventurers speak of a large underground city
    full of these creatures. Whether these are truly advanced grimlocks or
    another race entirely is yet to be confirmed.
