Description:
  - >-
    Lurking in misty jungles and along dark riverbanks, the boalisk is a vile
    serpent that can cause death and pestilence with but a gaze. A boalisk is a
    constrictor snake 12 to 30 feet long with dark scales interspersed with pale
    green and yellow daubs of color to help it blend in with its surroundings on
    the forest floor. The eyes of a boalisk are large and reddish in color.
  - >-
    A boalisk hunts by grabbing prey with its mouth and then squeezing with its
    powerful body. More powerful opponents (or if the boalisk has recently
    eaten) will be attacked with the boalisk's gaze attack.
