Description_Visual: >-
  This creature looks like a puffy and bloated human-sized whitish-yellow maggot
  with purplish veins pulsating under its fleshy form. A vaguely humanoid head
  sits atop its body and its facial features are twisted and distraught as if
  the creature was in a constant state of pain. A pair of large,
  downward-curving horns juts from its head, just above its sunken eyes. Its
  mouth is lined with filthy and sharpened fangs.

Description:
  - >-
    Abyssal larvae are believed to be the final form of an evil soul deemed too
    weak to become a demon and too weak to become the servant of a demon.
    Another theory suggests that the larvae are the imprisoned forms of slain
    demon princes and lords. Whatever their true origin, abyssal larvae are
    plentiful throughout the Abyssal planes, and are some of the most disgusting
    and loathsome creatures encountered.
  - >-
    These creatures feed on anything they can consume, be it rotting carcasses,
    freshly slain creatures, and even waste. Consumables are first liquefied
    through a process requiring the abyssal larva to regurgitate stomach acids
    onto its meal. As the food breaks down, the larva slurps it up and consumes
    it.
  - >-
    While loathed by the more civilized, some demons, such as dretches and
    babaus, savor the juicy flesh of these creatures and often engage in hunting
    expeditions across the Abyss, killing and devouring as many of these
    creatures as they can find.
  - >-
    Acting as if almost mindless, abyssal larvae attack any living creature they
    encounter. They have no real tactics other than swarming a foe and biting
    relentlessly. These creatures fight until destroyed.
  - >-
    An abyssal larva's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, is
    treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
    damage reduction.
