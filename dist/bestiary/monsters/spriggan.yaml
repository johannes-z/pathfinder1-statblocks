SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Size Alteration (Su)
    description: >-
      At will as a standard action, a spriggan can change his size between Small
      and Large. Weapons, armor, and other objects on the spriggan's person grow
      proportionally when he changes size (objects revert to normal size 1 round
      after a spriggan releases them). When a spriggan becomes Large, his speed
      increases to 30 feet, he gains +12 Strength, -2 Dexterity, and +6
      Constitution, and he takes a -2 size penalty to his AC. While Large, a
      spriggan cannot use his sneak attack or his racial spell-like abilities
      (although if he possesses either from class levels or templates, he
      retains their use in both sizes).

    description: >-
      A spriggan gains a +1 racial bonus on concentration checks and to save DCs
      for all of its racial spell-like abilities.

    description: >-
      Climb, Disable Device, Perception, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth are class
      skills for spriggans.
Description:
  - >-
    When the gnomes first traveled to the mortal realm from the distant land of
    the fey, some found the Material Plane so strange and terrifying that they
    lost their sense of joy. Seeing only the threats of the new world but none
    of its wonders, they grimly resolved to survive no matter the cost. Their
    innate magic responded to this twisted goal by reshaping them in mind and
    body over the course of many generations, transforming them into the
    creatures known as spriggans. Love, happiness, and beauty have no meaning
    for these poor souls, so they lead lives of violence and malice. The best
    they can manage in place of positive emotions is a muted satisfaction when
    they make another suffer.
  - >-
    Spriggans resemble ugly gnomes with an alien, feral appearance. Many are
    gaunt and haggard. When magically enlarged, they look the same except much
    more hale and muscular.
