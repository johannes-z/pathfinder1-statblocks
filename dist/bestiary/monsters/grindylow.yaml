SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Tangling Tentacles (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although a grindylow can't attack to cause damage with its six tentacles,
      these wriggling legs constantly writhe and reach out to tug at and trip
      adjacent foes. During the grindylow's turn, it can make a single trip
      attack against any adjacent foe as a swift action. It gains a +4 racial
      bonus on trip attacks made with its tangling tentacles, and if it fails to
      trip a foe, that creature can't attempt to trip the grindylow in
      retaliation.
Description:
  - >-
    About 4 feet long from head to tentacle tip, grindylows appear to be
    half-goblin and half-octopus, the split occurring at the waist. Grindylows
    are violent, ravenous creatures that use their spears to hunt or just to
    poke at things that scream and cry.
  - >-
    While grindylows resemble goblins, they are not humanoid creatures.
    Nonetheless, these aquatic monsters are just as wicked as the most sadistic
    of goblins, and take immense pleasure in others' misfortunes and the spread
    of mayhem. Thanks to this twisted desire, grindylows have a nasty reputation
    among both other intelligent water-dwelling creatures and most land-dwelling
    beings.
  - >-
    Grindylows eat whatever they can kill, giving them a rather wide selection
    of meals. High or low, no one is safe from the brutish assaults; tribes of
    merfolk have been overwhelmed by bands of grindylows, as have galleons full
    of experienced sailors. While obvious predators such as giant eels or sharks
    evoke great fear from grindylows, no enemies are more hated than the squid,
    be it common or giant. None are sure where this disdain stems from, but it
    is speculated that a squid is to an octopus for a grindylow what a dog is to
    a goblin dog for goblins. Incredibly fond of their similarly designed kin,
    grindylows believe octopuses to be the epitome of beauty, with squids being
    regarded as hideous freaks in comparison. There is no greater insult to a
    grindylow than being called a squid.
  - >-
    While grindylows can take class levels to gain power, certain grindylows are
    freakish throwbacks to a primal age- these grindylows never cease growing,
    and in time can become massive beasts of Huge size. Unlike the typical
    grindylow, these giants can attack with all six of their tentacles and
    constrict with great effect. Giant grindylows are fortunately quite rare.
