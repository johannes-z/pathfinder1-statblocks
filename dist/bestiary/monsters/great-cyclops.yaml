    description: >-
      Once per day as a swift action, a great cyclops can gain a burst of savage
      of inspiration. When it does, it doubles the threat range of all weapons,
      natural attacks, and rock attacks it makes until the start of its next
      turn. Furthermore, once per day, when the great cyclops reaches 0 or fewer
      hit points and is conscious because of its Diehard feat, this ability
      recharges, allowing it to use the ability a second time that same day.
Description:
  - >-
    Degenerate giants of cyclops-kind, the legendary great cyclopes embody the
    rage and dark doom of this race of uncanny seers. In their eyes blaze
    endless possibilities for bloodshed and terror, their myopic gazes seeming
    to witness the potential for infinite deaths and devastations hidden within
    each moment. Gigantic but dull-witted, these massive savages are usually
    loners, but occasionally either need or fate drives them to rampages from
    which few are safe. Such undeniable force brings with it a dread that, in
    many instances, grows to reverence, giving rise to strange cults that cloak
    these cyclopes with veils of menace and dark legends.

    Denizens of remote and primeval parts of the world, great cyclopes typically
    dwell in lands where none might intrude upon them-deserted islands, high
    craggy mountains, and stoic hill countries often provide the great caves
    they favor as lairs. While most avoid well-traveled or populated lands,
    spending much of their time hunting megafauna and even monstrous prey in the
    wilds, some, driven by hunger or a desperation to wander, seek out the paths
    and settlements of humanoids, finding that their fragile buildings are
    easily shattered and that the mewling creatures make savory meals.

    The average great cyclops stands approximately 30 feet tall and weighs
    upward of 4 tons, though individuals of significantly greater size are
    known.
