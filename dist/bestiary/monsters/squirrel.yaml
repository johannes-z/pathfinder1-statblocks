Description:
  - >-
    Squirrels are surprisingly wily creatures. When they know they are being
    watched, they pretend to bury nuts, but instead sneak them into their mouths
    and take them away to hide elsewhere when no one is watching. They eat most
    things, occasionally even preying on small snakes and birds. The average
    squirrel is roughly 1-1/2 feet long and weighs 1 pound.
