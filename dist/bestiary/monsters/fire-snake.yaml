SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Paralysis (Ex)
    description: >-
      A fire snake's fangs inject an anesthetizing venom. A target hit by a fire
      snake's bite attack must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed
      for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A fire snake resembles a normal snake and ranges in size from 2 feet to 6
    feet in length. Fire snakes make their homes in fires and rarely journey
    more than 30 feet from such an open flame. Sages conjecture that fire snakes
    are some form of larval salamander from the Plane of Fire.
  - >-
    A fire snake's preferred method of attack is to hide in a nearby fire and
    then surprise its foes as they come nearby. A fire snake attacks by biting
    its opponents with its sharp fangs.
