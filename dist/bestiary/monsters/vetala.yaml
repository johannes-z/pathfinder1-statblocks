Description_Visual: >-
  With its bloodless flesh and eyes the color of deepest night, this imperious
  being obviously no longer numbers among the living.
Group: Vampire
Source: Inner Sea Bestiary
IsTemplate: 1
Description:
  - >-
    While most of the Inner Sea's vampires lust for living blood, the mysterious
    vetalas hunger for a more intangible force: the energy that infuses mortal
    minds. Referred to as consciousness or psyche by some, the academics of
    Vudra- from where most vetalas hail-call this fundamental vital force prana.
    Regardless of their desire's name, vetalas prey upon those who show creative
    promise, possess potent force of will, or seem destined for greatness,
    draining the most brilliant sources of mortal light to fuel their own
    unnatural embers. Their dark mastery of life force allows vetalas to possess
    corpses or even overwhelm the minds of living creatures. With these stolen
    masks and the resources of abducted lives, they work their foul wills.
  - >-
    Vetalas are said to be the spirits of children "born evil," who never
    received burial rites upon their deaths. Sometimes one of these evil spirits
    takes hold of a corpse- not necessarily its own-which becomes its anchor to
    the mortal world. Such young souls seek out experiences and life energy,
    becoming as wicked as any other vampire as they endlessly indulge their
    profane, deathless desires.
  - CREATING A VETALA
  - >-
    "Vetala" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature
    with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most
    vetalas were once humanoids, fey, or monstrous humanoids. A vetala uses the
    base creature's stats and abilities except as noted here.
  - 'CR: Same as the base creature + 2.'
  - 'AL: Any evil.'
  - >-
    Type: The creature's type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate
    class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.
  - 'Senses: A vetala gains darkvision 60 ft.'
  - 'Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +4.'
  - >-
    Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected.
    As undead, vetalas use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit
    points (instead of Constitution).
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: A vetala gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/magic and
    good, and resistance to fire 10 and electricity 10, in addition to all of
    the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A vetala also gains fast
    healing 5. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, a vetala is helpless and
    its fast healing ceases to function for 1 hour. Additional damage dealt to
    the vetala has no effect. Its body might be subjected to any method of
    dismemberment or desecration, but after 1 hour-regardless of the state of
    its remains-it regains 1 hit point, is no longer helpless, and resumes
    healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.
  - >-
    Weaknesses: Vetalas cannot tolerate the sound of prayers or religious
    mantras recited by those truly faithful to a good deity. Any character with
    a good-aligned deity can force a vetala to recoil by dramatically praying as
    a standard action. Praying doesn't harm a vetala; it merely keeps the
    creature at bay. A recoiling vetala must stay at least 5 feet away from a
    praying character and cannot touch or make melee attacks against it. After 1
    round, a vetala can fight past its revulsion and function normally each
    round it succeeds at a DC 25 Will save. The prayers of those who worship
    non-good deities or worship no deity have no effect on a vetala.
  - >-
    Reducing a vetala's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't
    always destroy it (see fast healing). However, consecrating the vetala's
    remains and burying the body destroys it forever. A vetala's body is
    considered consecrated if it is doused with a vial of holy water and buried,
    if it is buried in earth affected by the spell consecrate, or if bless,
    prayer, or a similar divine spell is cast upon it as it is being buried.
    Digging up a vetala's corpse or profaning the area where it's buried does
    not restore a buried vetala.
  - >-
    Speed: Same as the base creature. A vetala also gains a climb speed equal to
    its base land speed.
  - >-
    Melee: A vetala gains two claw attacks if the base creature didn't have
    them. A vetala's claw attacks do damage as a creature once size category
    larger (for example, a Medium vetala's claw attack deals 1d6 points of
    damage). A vetala's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
  - >-
    Special Attacks: A vetala gains several special attacks. Save DCs are equal
    to 10 + 1/2 the vetala's Hit Dice + the vetala's Cha modifier unless
    otherwise noted.
  - >-
    Drain Prana (Su): A vetala can drain the mental vitality of a grappled
    opponent. If the vetala establishes or maintains a pin, it drains this
    energy, dealing 1d4 points of Charisma damage. Additionally, the victim is
    affected by the spell modify memory, as if the vetala had spent 5 minutes
    concentrating. The vetala gains perfect knowledge of any memory it chooses
    to eliminate using this ability. Vetalas often use this ability to prevent
    victims from remembering they've been attacked.
  - >-
    Malevolence (Su): As a full-round action, a vetala can attempt to take
    control of a helpless living creature's body, as the spell magic jar (caster
    level 10th or the vetala's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it
    does not require a receptacle. The target can resist the attack with a
    successful Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that
    same vetala's possession for 24 hours. If a creature fails its save, its
    consciousness and control of its body are subsumed as the vetala takes
    command of its body. The vetala can remain in control for a number of hours
    equal to its Charisma modifier or until it decides to end the possession.
    Whenever the possession ends or the host body is killed, the vetala's
    consciousness instantly returns to its body, regardless of distance, so long
    as it remains on the same plane. If the vetala's body has been destroyed or
    moved to another plane, the vetala's consciousness is destroyed when the
    possession ends. While possessing another creature, the vetala's body is
    empty and vulnerable, though it is instantly aware if its body is disturbed
    or takes damage.
  - >-
    Paralysis (Ex): Any creature struck by a vetala's claws must make a
    successful Will save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. Elves are immune to
    this effect.
  - >-
    Possess Corpse (Su): As a full-round action, a vetala can possess a Large or
    smaller corpse just as it can a living body. The vetala's consciousness
    leaves its body and takes control of the corpse, animating it as either a
    skeleton or zombie (depending on its state of decay). The vetala can remain
    in control of a corpse indefinitely, and can communicate through the body,
    but cannot use any of its other special abilities. This ability otherwise
    functions just as malevolence.
  - >-
    Ability Scores: Str +4, Dex +2, Int +4, Wis +2, Cha +6. As an undead
    creature, a vetala has no Constitution score.
  - >-
    Feats: Vetalas gain Alertness, Blind-Fight, Deceitful, Improved Initiative,
    and Skill Focus (Disguise) as bonus feats.
  - >-
    Skills: Vetalas gain a +8 racial bonus on Disguise, Perception, Sense
    Motive, and Stealth checks.
