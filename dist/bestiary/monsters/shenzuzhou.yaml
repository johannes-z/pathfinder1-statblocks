SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Festering Heads (Su)
    description: >-
      Once the heads in a shenzuzhou's collection rot out naturally, it can hurl
      them as a thrown splash weapon (range increment 30 ft.) as a standard
      action. A thrown head ruptures on impact, releasing noxious gas that
      produces an effect identical to a stinking cloud spell (DC 22). The save
      is Charisma-based. A typical shenzuzhou carries 1d4 festering heads. The
      heads do not rupture if thrown by another creature.
Description:
  - >-
    Malevolent spirits looking to bolster their armies often look no farther
    than the burial grounds of giant tribes, where hardy corpses are typically
    left unguarded and forgotten. After a giant is animated, it is beheaded in a
    gruesome ritual, the stump of its neck is cauterized into a blackened lump
    of scar tissue, and a twisted face manifests across its torso. What was once
    a fearsome giant is now a shenzushou. It loses the ability to speak and eat
    and can do nothing but obey the commands of whoever possesses its head-often
    the necromancer or oni that created it.
  - >-
    Thrall shenzushous are nowhere near as terrible as those shenzushous whose
    heads have been destroyed or transported to another plane. These latter
    creatures run aimlessly through the land, ever searching for new heads and
    the control they believe attaining them will bring over the monsters' damned
    existences. Seeking to steal their victims' heads for themselves, shezuzhous
    decapitate their kills, keeping grisly collections of heads from the victims
    they have slain.
  - >-
    Even without their heads, shenzuzhous stand over 8 feet tall. Cords of thick
    muscle twist beneath the creatures' hairless gray corpse-flesh. Their skin
    is cold to the touch and their wounds do not bleed. A shenzuzhou carries
    little else except for its weapons and the heads of its victims, strung
    together by their hair and hung from its belt.
