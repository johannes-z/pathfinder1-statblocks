Description:
  - >-
    Blackwood satyrs are an especially infamous breed of fey indigenous to the
    Verduran Forest, which straddles the borders of Andoran, Taldor, and Galt.
    They are well known throughout southeastern Avistan for exuding the
    pleasantly sweet aroma of blackwood tar, from which they gain their name.
    Though the human population surrounding the Verduran Forest seldom ventures
    deep into the fey wood for anything other than logging, the blackwood satyrs
    seem to take perverse pleasure in waylaying noble lords and ladies during
    their passage down the heavily traveled Sellen River, playing songs from the
    river's bank to lure vessels closer and enthrall all aboard.
