SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Incorrigible Charm (Su)
    description: >-
      A blackwood satyr emits an aura of incorrigible charm out to a radius of
      30 feet. Any creature that begins its turn in this area of effect must
      succeed at a DC 19 Will save, or be affected as per the spell charm
      person. The blackwood satyr can suppress or resume this ability at will.
      This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Pipes (Su)
    description: >-
      A blackwood satyr can focus and empower his magical abilities by playing
      haunting melodies on his panpipes. When he plays, all creatures within a
      60-foot radius must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be affected by charm
      monster, deep slumber, reckless infatuation, or suggestion, depending on
      what tune the satyr chooses. A creature that successfully saves against
      any of the pipes' effects cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for
      24 hours, but can still be affected by the blackwood satyr's other
      spell-like abilities as normal. The satyr's use of his pipes does not
      count toward his uses per day of his spell-like abilities, and if
      separated from them, he may continue to use his standard abilities. The
      pipes themselves are masterwork, and a satyr can craft a replacement with
      1 week of labor. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Blackwood satyrs are an especially infamous breed of fey indigenous to the
    Verduran Forest, which straddles the borders of Andoran, Taldor, and Galt.
    They are well known throughout southeastern Avistan for exuding the
    pleasantly sweet aroma of blackwood tar, from which they gain their name.
    Though the human population surrounding the Verduran Forest seldom ventures
    deep into the fey wood for anything other than logging, the blackwood satyrs
    seem to take perverse pleasure in waylaying noble lords and ladies during
    their passage down the heavily traveled Sellen River, playing songs from the
    river's bank to lure vessels closer and enthrall all aboard.
