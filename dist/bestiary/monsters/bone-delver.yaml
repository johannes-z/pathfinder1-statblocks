Description_Visual: >-
  This rotting humanoid wears tattered rags that hang loosely about its twisted
  and hunched form. Its face is twisted into a visage of pain and rage, and its
  clawed hands clutch the tools of its trade-a shovel and a lantern that glows
  with an eerie red hue.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Filth Fever: claws or shovel-injury; save DC 13 Fort; onset 1d3 days;
      frequency 1/ day; effect 1d3 Dex damage and 1d3 Con damage; cure 2
      consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Grave Light (Su)
    description: >-
      A bone delver's lantern sheds light in a 10-foot radius. Living creatures
      within the area take 1 point of damage each round. Additionally, a bone
      delver's fast healing only works when it is within 10 feet of its lantern.
      The lantern can be extinguished with a bless spell (it relights after 1
      hour) or attacked and destroyed (hardness 5, hp 10). This lantern
      functions only for the bone delver to which it belongs. In the hands of
      living creatures it functions differently (see below).
  - name: Scream of Agony (Su)
    description: >-
      A bone delver can unleash a bone-chilling shriek that affects all who hear
      it within 30 feet. An affected creature must make a DC 13 Will save or be
      shaken for 1d4+2 rounds. Creatures with more than 4 HD are unaffected by
      this attack. Creatures that successfully save are immune to the scream of
      agony of that bone delver for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
      Shovel A bone delver suffers no penalties on attack rolls when wielding a
      shovel as a weapon.
Description:
  - >-
    Cemeteries and graveyards are well known for their concentration of negative
    energy and it is this, rather than the mere presence of the buried dead,
    that can cause all manner of creatures to rise from their graves to haunt
    the living. A few braves souls make their gruesome livelyhood by preying on
    graves, digging up the treasures and riches sometimes laid to rest with
    their owners. Thes graverobbers are detested by most civilized societies for
    their callous nature, and all too often would be graverobbers fall foul to
    the unliving denizens of the graveyard.
  - >-
    Bone delvers were in life graverobbers that died whilst performing their
    nefarious tasks. Some may have inadvertently awoken undead creatures in
    their graves, others were outwitted by cunning traps placed in well
    protected mausoleums. Bone delvers usually appear as hunched, shambling
    humanoids with faces twisted into a visage of pain and rage. They visibly
    carry the wounds that caused their demise. Bone delvers forever carry the
    tools of their trade-a lantern and a shovel, though lockpicks are also
    commonly found on their walking corpses. The lantern still burns, though
    with an unnatural and eerie red glowing light.
  - >-
    A bone delver initiatiate its attack by uttering a chilling scream of
    terribly agony, rage, and frustration that transcensds death itself. Those
    not affected by the scream are made targets of melee attacks with the
    creature's shovel or filthy claws.
