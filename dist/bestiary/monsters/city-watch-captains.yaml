Description:
  - >-
    Magnimarian watch captains are selected from the ranks of proven city guards
    and undergo more training than standard troops. Captain Acacia Uriana
    demands intelligent watch captains, and many are trained in investigative
    techniques to help solve ongoing crimes throughout the city, as well as to
    collect valuable evidence that helps determine a suspect's guilt or
    innocence. Watch captains train in deadlier weapons than their more common
    counterparts, and most prefer to wield two blades at a given time; like city
    guards, however, they prefer to use nonlethal means to handle minor crimes,
    and are adept at disarming their opponents with their swordbreaker daggers.
