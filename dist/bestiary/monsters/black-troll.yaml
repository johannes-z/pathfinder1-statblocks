SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fire Absorption (Su)
    description: >-
      Any fire effect that would deal 20 or more points of damage to a fire
      troll causes the creature to grow to Huge size. A black troll can induce
      this effect itself by stepping into a large source of fire that deals 20
      or more points of damage in a single round. It must spend one full round
      in the flames for this method to work. This size change lasts 1 hour
      before the black troll reverts to its normal size.
Description:
  - >-
    Black trolls are an offshoot of standard trolls, believed to be
    supernaturally altered by magic. They dwell in the same climate as their
  - >-
    normal brethren and often associate with them as well. Their appetites are
    no less impressive than other trolls, and some would argue theirs is even
    greater. Black trolls dine on anything they catch and kill, including
    scavenging and dining on the leftovers of other animals' meals. Black trolls
    do not eat other trolls, regardless of the food situation.
  - >-
    Black trolls stand 14 feet tall and weigh around 1,000 pounds. When they
    swell to Huge size, they reach heights of 21 feet or more and weigh over
    3,000 pounds. Black trolls flesh is rubbery to the touch and always shiny
    black in color. Eyes are almost always dull gray, though a few black trolls
    have bright blue eyes. Young are born live and reach maturity relatively
    quickly. Black trolls can mate with other trolls, but the offspring is
    always the same type as the other parent. Only black trolls mating with
    their own spawn another black troll.
  - >-
    A black troll attacks by slashing and biting its foes. Its ability to deal
    horrendous amounts of damage is cause for concern among many that have faced
    a black troll. Often when in combat, a black troll shuns fire, hoping its
    opponent senses a weakness and decides to unleash a fire attack at the
    troll. Many adventurers have met their untimely demise this way. If the ruse
    doesn't appear to work, and there is a large source of fire nearby, a black
    troll subjects itself to the fire in order to grow to Huge size.
