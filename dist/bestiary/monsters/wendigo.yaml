SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dream Haunting (Su)
    description: >-
      When a wendigo uses its nightmare spell-like ability, the victim is also
      exposed to wendigo psychosis.
  - name: Howl (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a standard action, a wendigo can emit a forlorn
      howl that can be heard up to a mile away. Any who hear the howl must make
      a DC 28 Will save to avoid becoming shaken for an hour. Creatures within
      120 feet become panicked for 1d4+4 rounds, and those within 30 feet cower
      with fear for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save
      DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Wendigo Psychosis (Su)
    description: >-
      Curse-Nightmare or wind walk; save Will DC 26; onset 1 minute; frequency
      1/day; effect 1d4 Wis drain (minimum Wis 1); cure 3 consecutive saves.
      When a victim's Wisdom reaches 1, he seeks an individual of his race to
      kill and devour. After completing this act, the afflicted individual takes
      off at a run, and in 1d4 rounds sprints up into the sky at such a speed
      that his feet burn away into jagged stumps. The transformation into a
      wendigo takes 2d6 minutes as the victim wind walks across the sky. Once
      the transformation is complete, the victim is effectively dead, replaced
      by a new wendigo. True resurrection, miracle, or wish can restore such a
      victim to life, yet doing so does not harm the new wendigo. The save is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Wind Walk (Sp)
    description: >-
      If a wendigo pins a grappled foe, it can attempt to wind walk with the
      target by using its spell-like ability-it automatically succeeds on all
      concentration checks made to use wind walk. If the victim fails to resist
      the spell, the wendigo hurtles into the sky with him. Each round, a victim
      can make a new DC 23 Will save to turn solid again, but at this point he
      falls if he cannot fly. Eventually, the wendigo strands the victim in some
      rural area, usually miles from where it began. A creature that wind walks
      with a wendigo is exposed to wendigo psychosis. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Beings of ancient evil, wendigos haunt the minds of mortals, driving them to
    desperation and, ultimately, cannibalistic madness. They enjoy whittling
    down prey before they strike, trailing victims for days, even weeks, while
    plaguing their journeys with nightmares and foul weather.
  - >-
    Tribal humanoids sometimes worship wendigos as gods, bringing them live
    sacrifices or attempting to appease the creatures by engaging in ritual
    cannibalism. They mark a wendigo's territory with fetishes and dress in the
    furs and hides of whatever animal it most closely resembles. Wendigos take
    little interest in the practices of their worshipers, and view them only as
    an ample supply of victims.
