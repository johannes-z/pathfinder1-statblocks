SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison Spines (Ex)
    description: >-
      A vydrarch is covered in jagged spines that secrete a fatal poison. A
      creature struck by a vydrarch's tail slap attack or that strikes a
      vydrarch with a melee weapon without reach, an unarmed strike, or a
      natural weapon takes 1d6 points of piercing damage and risks being
      poisoned. Any creature that grapples a vydrarch takes 2d6 points of
      piercing damage and risks being poisoned each round. Vydrarch poison:
      Spine-injury; save Fort DC 24; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2
      Con, 1d2 Wis; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Veil of Fog (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a vydrarch can produce a bank of fog in a 100-foot
      spread centered on itself. This effect is otherwise identical that created
      by a fog cloud spell.
Description:
  - >-
    The terrifying creature known as the vydrarch is most well known among
    Magnimarians from the famous tales of the legendary paladin Alcaydian Indros
    battling the beast on the shores of what would become Magnimar. The vydrarch
    was originally thought to be an entirely unique creature, but in recent
    years, reports from sailors journeying across the Steaming Sea and the
    remains of wrecked ships washing ashore have hinted at the existence of
    other such beasts.
  - >-
    Vydrarchs live solely for the thrill of destruction and chaos, but what
    elder force could have created such a monster is unknown. Their dual heads
    act in tandem to destroy vessels and devour cargo, but survivors of such
    attacks claim that the heads can act independently of one another if need
    be, occasionally talking or even arguing among themselves.
  - A vydrarch is 40 feet long from tail to head and weighs 10 tons.
