SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Feeding Tentacles (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action as part of maintaining a grapple, a yangethe can use
      its mouth tentacles to feed on a helpless or grappled creature by making a
      +14 melee touch attack. If it hits, the feeding tentacles siphon away the
      victim's emotions and deal 1d4 points of Charisma drain. The yangethe
      heals 5 points of damage for every point of Charisma it drains in this
      manner. As long as a creature continues to suffer this Charisma drain,
      each time it attempts to sleep it is affected by a nightmare spell (CL
      10th, DC 20), experiencing terrifying dreams in which it relives the
      feeling of being fed upon over and over. All effects from the feeding
      tentacles are mind-affecting effects.
  - name: Psychic Blast (Sp)
    description: >-
      This spell-like ability functions as confusion, and also deals 10d6 points
      of nonlethal damage when it first affects foes (Will DC 21 half). This
      ability is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.
Description:
  - >-
    Bred by the Dominion of the Black, yangethes have, over the eons, developed
    keen intellects. On some planets, they've formed small, independent colonies
    that keep "farms" of victims on whose emotions they feed. The yangethes'
    ability to teleport across galaxies makes them remarkable as scouts or as
    the vanguards for an invasion. Unless slain violently, yangethes are
    immortal. They don't need to eat or drink to survive-though they will
    indulge in feeding for pleasure.
