SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bend Light (Ex)
    description: >-
      By shifting the make-up of its body as a standard action, a crystalline
      horror can refract natural light into a bright light that radiates out in
      a 10-foot spread. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save
      or be blinded for 3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures
      to whom sunlight is harmful or unnatural take 2d6 points of damage from
      the light. Undead creatures caught within the area take 3d6 points of
      damage, and undead particularly vulnerable to sunlight, such as vampires,
      take 3d8 points of damage. Creatures that cannot see or perceive objects
      through the use of vision are unaffected by the blindness, but still
      suffer damage if they are vulnerable to sunlight.
  - name: Constitution Damage (Ex)
    description: >-
      A crystalline horror that confirms a critical hit with a claw attack deals
      1 point of Constitution damage from blood loss when it hits a creature.
      Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the Constitution damage
      dealt by a crystalline horror's claws.
  - name: Crystal Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      A crystalline horror's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for
      the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
  - name: Shard Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      A crystalline horror can loose a spray of razor-sharp shards of glass from
      its body in a 40-foot cone. A creature in the area takes 4d6 points of
      damage or half that amount if it succeeds on a DC 18 Reflex save. The
      crystalline horror can launch only five such sprays in a given day. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A crystalline horror is a weird, unnatural humanoid composed of crystal and
    glass. Sages believe it to be from one of the elemental planes, but in fact,
    the crystalline horror is a creature whose origins lie on the Material
    Plane. How it came to be remains speculation among many sages and scholars,
    though all agree it is in fact a living creature and not an automaton.
