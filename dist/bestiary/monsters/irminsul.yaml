  - name: Planar Portal (Su)
    description: >-
      Within the split of an irminsul's trunk swirls a large planar portal, a
      permanent gate that links one plane to another. An irminsul controls
      whether or not specific creatures can pass through its portal, which
      grants entrance to a specific location on the linked plane. Those
      attempting to breach a barred portal must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude
      save or be ejected and teleported to a random location on the current
      plane. If the trespasser successfully saves, it takes 6d6 points of damage
      and is sickened for 1 minute. The DC for this save is Wisdom-based. Mythic
      characters can expend uses of mythic power to forcefully pass through the
      gate, lowering the DC of the saving throw by 5 for each use of mythic
      power expended in this fashion.
Description:
  - >-
    According to legend, primordial gods seeded the multiverse with the
    irminsuls, powerful and intelligent tree-like beings that bind all their
    worlds together by their roots. At one time, these beings were plentiful,
    and prized for their knowledge and mystic properties. But powerful creatures
    hacked them to the ground because they believed irminsuls' wood had special
    qualities or sought to protect themselves from whatever lay beyond the
    strange portals. Every irminsul is bound to a specific plane. The bound
    plane determines the creature's alignment, the nature of its regeneration,
    and the languages it knows. Sometimes irminsuls have special abilities based
    on the planes they are linked to. The sample irminsul is bound to the primal
    land of fey.
