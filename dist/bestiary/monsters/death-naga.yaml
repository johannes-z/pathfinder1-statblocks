Description_Visual: >-
  A death naga is an undead snake covered in rotting or tattered scales flowing
  down its sinuous body from its humanoid head. A horrible stench emanates from
  the naga's snake body as its tattered skin is a husk containing rotted organs
  and entrails. Their eyes are missing, hollow voids in their female faces. A
  few lack flesh completely and appear as skeletal snakes with leering skull
  heads. Many have loose vertebrae jutting from the tips of their tails to
  create bone rattles.

  - name: Atrophic Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, death nagas can blast opponents with a 60-ft. cone
      of deteriorating negative energy. The blast deals 12d6 points of unholy
      and negative energy damage (half of each). In addition, those within the
      cone gain one negative level. A Refl ex DC 22 save halves the damage and
      prevents the negative level. Undead remain unharmed within the cone but
      gain 2d4x5 temporary hit points for 1 hour. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Description:

    Death nagas are what remains of dark or spirit nagas slain by powerful
    negative energy. It is unknown why or how these nagas return as undead
    versions of their former selves. They often dominate ruins and remote
    regions using zombies and skeleton minions. Death nagas often ally
    themselves with powerful undead. Death nagas speak Common and any languages
    known in life.
