    description: >-
      Though they are unable to move on land, a hippocampus can breathe air
      (such as if it surfaces from the water). It can survive out of the water
      for 1 minute per 1 point of Constitution (after that, refer to the
      drowning rules in the Pathfinder Core Rulebook).
Description:
  - >-
    A hippocampus is often called a merhorse or sea horse, for it is indeed a
    half-horse/half-fish creature of the sea. The hindquarters of the animal are
    that of a great fish. Its body is covered in fine scales in the fore parts
    and large scales elsewhere. The hippocampus' scales vary in color from ivory
    to deep green, with shades of blue and silver. Aquatic races often tame
    these animals, and they make fine steeds, for they are strong, swift, and
    very intelligent. A hippocampus is about 8 feet long and weighs about 600
    pounds. Hippocampuses speak Aquan. Some speak common. Hippocampuses are
    docile creatures and only fight if threatened or if an ally is threatened.
    In combat, they use their powerful bite or tail slap. On rare occasions, the
    hippocampus may butt an opponent with its head. Training a Hippocampus A
    hippocampus requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be
    trained, a hippocampus must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer
    (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a
    friendly hippocampus requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal
    check. Riding a hippocampus requires an exotic saddle. A hippocampus can
    fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or
    she succeeds on a Ride check. Hippocampus eggs are worth 1,500 gp apiece on
    the open market, while young are worth 2,500 gp each. Professional trainers
    (usually tritons) charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a hippocampus. Carrying
    Capacity: A light load for a hippocampus is up to 300 pounds; a medium load,
    301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds Credit The Hippocampus
