SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Resurrection (Su)
    description: >-
      A slain phoenix remains dead for only 1d4 rounds unless its body is
      completely destroyed by an effect such as disintegrate. Otherwise, a fully
      healed phoenix emerges from the remains 1d4 rounds after death, as if
      brought back to life via resurrection. The phoenix gains 1 permanent
      negative level when this occurs, although most use greater restoration to
      remove this negative level as soon as possible. A phoenix can
      self-resurrect only once per year. If a phoenix dies a second time before
      that year passes, its death is permanent. A phoenix that dies within the
      area of a desecrate spell cannot self-resurrect until the desecrate effect
      ends, at which point the phoenix immediately resurrects. A phoenix brought
      back to life by other means never gains negative levels as a result.
  - name: Shroud of Flame (Su)
    description: >-
      A phoenix can cause its feathers to burst into fire as a free action. As
      long as its feathers are burning, it inflicts an additional 1d6 points of
      fire damage with each natural attack, and any creature within reach (20
      feet for most phoenixes) must make a DC 25 Reflex save each round to avoid
      taking 4d6 points of fire damage at the start of its turn. A creature that
      attacks the phoenix with natural or non-reach melee weapons takes 1d6
      points of fire damage (no save) with each successful hit. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The phoenix is a legendary bird of fire that dwells in the most remote parts
    of the desert. As the birds are known to be great scholars, many seekers of
    rare lore search out particular phoenixes for advice. Yet it is the
    phoenix's ability to rebirth itself from its own dead body for which the
    creature is best known.
  - >-
    The phoenix is a benevolent creature, aiding those who do good and actively
    harming those who do evil.
