  - name: Leaping Charge (Ex)
    description: >-
      A velociraptor can jump while charging, allowing it to ignore difficult
      terrain when it charges. When a velociraptor makes a charge in this way,
      it deals double damage with its talons.
Description:
  - >-
    A smaller cousin of the deinonychus, the velociraptor is a swift, cunning
    pack hunter. It has no fear of Medium or even Large creatures. Its leaping
    charge attack grants it a significant advantage against foes in thick
    underbrush. A velociraptor is around 1-1/2 feet tall and 7 feet long, and
    weighs 35 pounds.
