    description: >-
      A hooded horror can pull back its hood and reveal its skeletal visage to
      those who gaze upon it. Anyone within 30 feet who sets eyes upon the
      hooded horror must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or be instantly weakened,
      taking 1d6 points of Strength damage. Creatures that are affected by this
      ability or that successfully save against it cannot be affected again by
      the same hooded horror's horrific appearance for one day. This is a
      mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A hooded horror is an undead creature believed to have been created by Orcus
    in order to subjugate and corrupt paladins and good-aligned priests. Though
    often found wandering the Undead Lord's great abyssal palace, the hooded
    horror itself is not native to that plane, as Orcus created and unleashed
    them on the Material Plane (if the legends are to be believed). Hooded
    horrors spend their time seeking out priests and paladins in order to
    fulfill their desires and are often found amidst graveyards, ruined temples
    to good-aligned deities, and other such places where its chosen targets
    might be encountered.
  - >-
    A hooded horror appears as a rotting and skeletal humanoid cloaked in a
    brownish-black hooded robe. Its eyes are deep sockets, pitch black with a
    small pinpoint of red light. Its hands end in razor-sharp talons.
  - >-
    Hooded horrors understand Abyssal, Celestial, and Common, but do not appear
    to speak any of these languages. Methods of communication with (and between)
    these creatures is unknown.
  - >-
    A hooded horror begins an encounter by revealing its desiccated countenance
    to its foes thereby invoking fear in those that see it. Creatures that
    succeed on their save are then assaulted by the creature's breath weapon and
    filthy claws. If it can, the hooded horror attempts to charm and bring under
    its control any paladins and good-aligned priests it encounters. Other
    good-aligned creatures that oppose the hooded horror are simply destroyed.
