Description_Visual: >-
  A borsin is a creature with the head, arms, and upper body of an ape joined to
  the body and legs of a quadruped. The lower half may be that of a boar,
  equine, or hound; these may be a race of battle-beasts magically crossbred in
  antiquity.

Description:
  - >-
    A borsin is a savage, cunning beast capable of problem-solving and setting
    crude traps. They do not use weapons or tools, or carry treasure, although
    pack leaders will drape themselves in the skins and furs of creatures they
    have killed - including humans and adventurers.
  - >-
    Borsin form packs led by the strongest member. They attack with two claws
    and a bite, and use pack tactics to drive opponents and prey into traps,
    kill zones, or natural hazards such as cliffs and ravines. Borsin packs
    stake out their territory by making small cairns topped with the skulls of
    their kills, and patrol their borders regularly. Borsin are omnivorous and
    hardy, capable of surviving on plant matter, yet enjoying a fresh kill.
  - Borsin speak Aklo, but rarely speak with those outside of their own tribe.
