SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Stroke (Su)
    description: >-
      If the Slaad Lord of Entropy scores a natural 20 on its attack roll with
      his scythe and confirms the critical hit, that opponent must succeed on a
      DC 35 Fortitude save or die. Creatures slain can be raised normally, but
      there is only a 50% chance that such magic works. Even if the Fortitude
      save succeeds, a creature struck takes 8d6 points of damage (which may be
      enough to kill it anyway). This ability only functions in the hands of the
      Slaad Lord of Entropy.
Description:
  - >-
    The Slaad Lord of Entropy is believed by some to be the supreme ruler of the
    slaadi race. He is a true agent of Chaos as can be seen in his actions and
    mood. Few have witnessed his true power, and those who have never speak of
    such experiences.
  - >-
    Hushed whispers among the slaadi say this is in fact a guise and not his
    true form. It is believed that his true form is that of a 15-foot tall black
    salad.
  - >-
    The Slaad Lord of Entropy's primary attack is with his scythe. He attacks
    relentlessly with it in combat, mixing in his spell-like abilities as he
    sees fit.
  - >-
    The Slaad Lord of Entropy's natural weapons, as well as any weapon he
    wields, are considered chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
    reduction. The Slaad Lord of Entropy's natural weapons are considered epic
    weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
  - >-
    When visiting the Material Plane, the slaad lord rides an ancient brass
    dragon named Ryssk.
