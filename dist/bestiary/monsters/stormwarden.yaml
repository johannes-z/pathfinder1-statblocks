      Once per day as a standard action, a stormwarden can create an effect
      similar to a control weather spell (caster level 10th), except that it
      affects an area in a 1,000-foot-radius circle, and the weather effects are
      immediate rather than gradual. The effects last for 1 minute before the
      weather in the area returns to normal.
Description:
  - >-
    Stormwardens dwell high in the mountains and hills away from civilization.
    They are hunters by nature and spend their time hunting and trapping game,
    though they never do so to an abundance, only enough to sustain themselves.
    They are isolationists and solitary, rarely found in groups of more than 6
    individuals. Their hair color and eye color range across the spectrum just
    as a normal human, though most tend to have dark hair and eyes. Stormwardens
    prefer to avoid combat, but if provoked, they open combat using their
    longswords, attempting to slay their opponents before escaping to their
    lair. If melee goes against a stormwarden, it alters the weather and
    attempts to escape. Stormwarden Characters Stormwardens favor
    nature-oriented classes, such as druid and ranger. They do not worship a
    single deity above all others, though they do tend to favor deities of
    storms and destruction. Though relatively few in number, stormwarden witches
    have a reputation of being some of the blackest and most vile practitioners
    of that art. +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, +4 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom.
