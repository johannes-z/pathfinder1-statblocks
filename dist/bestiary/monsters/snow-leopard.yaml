    description: >-
      Because of its large, fur-covered paws, the snow leopard suffers no
      penalties for moving through snow-covered terrain.
Description:
  - >-
    Snow leopards are relatives of the common leopard and are found in the
    coldest regions of the world, inhabiting mountain ranges and snowy
    coniferous forests. Their lairs are typically rocky shelters lined with
    their own fur for warmth.
  - >-
    Snow leopards are strong, agile, nocturnal hunters and their diet consists
    of livestock, wild boars, hares, and deer. Like most other big cats, they
    stalk and ambush their prey. Slain prey is dragged back to the lair and
    devoured over a period of several days.
  - >-
    Snow leopards are generally solitary creatures, though during mating season
    more than one can be encountered. A den typically contains 1d2 adults and
    1d4 cubs. Cubs that are captured can be sold on the market for 500 gp or
    more.
  - >-
    A snow leopard is about five feet long with light gray or smoke gray fur
    that turns white on its underbelly. Its fur is covered with large rings that
    contain smaller and darker spots of dark gray or black. Its fur is over one
    inch thick and provides it with warmth against the harshest of temperatures.
    Eyes are gray or dark blue. Its paws are large and thickfurred which enables
    it to maintain its footing on the most treacherous of snow-covered ground.
  - >-
    Snow leopards are hunted by many races for their fur which can be sold to
    furriers and made into coats, blankets, and so on. A typical male's coat
    fetches about 800 gp on the market.
  - >-
    Snow leopards, unlike other great cats, do not roar. Rather they let out a
    low, soft moan. They attack from a distance leaping or pouncing on a foe and
    attacking with their claws and bite.
