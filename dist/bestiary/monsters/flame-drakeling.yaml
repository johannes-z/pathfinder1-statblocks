SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fire Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      A flame drakeling can, as a standard action, spit a line of liquid fire to
      a range of 20 feet. A creature struck takes 2d6 points of fire damage (DC
      12 Reflex half). Further, a creature that fails its save catches on fire
      and takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the flames are
      extinguished. Once a flame drakeling uses its fire breath, it cannot do so
      again for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Heat Generation (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a flame drakeling can increase its body temperature to
      extreme levels. Creatures attacking the flame drakeling with natural
      weapons or touching the flame drakeling take 1d4 points of fire damage
      each round of contact.
Description:
  - >-
    Fire drakelings are believed to somehow be related to red dragons or flame
    drakes, but scholars have yet to find any connection linking the races
    together. Fire drakelings are generally docile creatures and make their
    lairs near active volcanoes. They are active during the day most of the
    time, feeding on insects and small game.
  - >-
    Flame drakelings are about 12 inches long and weigh close to 70 pounds.
    Scales are varying hues of red, with darker scales running the length of the
    drakelings back and wings. Females and males are indistinguishable from one
    another. Flame drakelings mate twice per year with the female laying a small
    clutch of 4-6 eggs in the lair. eggs incubate for up to 8 months before
    hatching, and hatchlings reach maturity within 2 years. Flame drakelings
    live up to 150 years on average.
  - >-
    Flame drakelings generally shun combat with larger foes, seeking refuge
    among the hills and mountains where their opponents can't reach them. If
    cornered or defending their young, flame drakelings attack with a vicious
    bite and surprisingly potent breath weapon.
