SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Crush (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dimensional slug can rear up and fall on its opponents, affecting as
      many Medium or smaller size opponents as it can cover. Opponents in the
      affected area must succeed on a DC 26 Reflex save or be pinned,
      automatically taking 2d8+15 points of bludgeoning damage during the next
      round unless the creature moves off them. If the creature chooses to
      maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal.
      Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape.
      The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Ethereal Ambush (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dimensional slug that attacks foes on the Material Plane in a surprise
      round can take a full round of actions if it begins the combat by phasing
      into the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane.
  - name: Ethereal Jaunt (Su)
    description: >-
      A dimensional slug can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane
      as a free action, and shift back again as a move action (or as part of a
      move action). The ability is otherwise identical to ethereal jaunt (CL
      15th).
  - name: Spit Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dimensional slug can spit acid at an opponent within 60 feet (no range
      increment). With a successful ranged touch attack, the target takes 12d6
      points of acid damage (no save).
  - name: Malleable (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dimensional slug's body is very malleable, allowing it to fit into
      narrow areas with ease. A dimensional slug takes no penalty to its speed
      or checks when squeezing in an area that is one size category smaller than
      its actual size (10 feet wide for most dimensional slugs). A dimensional
      slug can squeeze normally through an area two size categories smaller than
      its actual size (5 feet wide for most dimensional slugs).
  - name: Vulnerability to Salt (Ex)
    description: >-
      A handful of salt burns a dimensional slug as if the salt were a flask of
      acid, causing 1d6 points of damage per use.
Description:
  - >-
    Dimensional slugs are offshoots of giant slugs that now dwell in the
    Ethereal Plane. They feed upon the detritus, which is sometimes drawn into
    the ether, and occasionally shift themselves into the Material Plane to
    feed. These creatures detest phase spiders and attack them on sight.
  - >-
    A dimensional slug commonly attacks by spraying acid and crushing its
    opponents. If combat is going poorly for a dimensional slug, it shifts back
    to the Ethereal Plane.
