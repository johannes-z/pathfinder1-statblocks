Description:
  - >-
    Ogre spiders are brutal, terrifying hunters that spin tangled webs capable
    of encasing entire trees. So-named because the arrangement of its eyes and
    mandibles gives it a face unnervingly similar to that of an ogre as much as
    for their size, ogre spiders can fit into nooks and tunnels far more narrow
    than one might expect.
