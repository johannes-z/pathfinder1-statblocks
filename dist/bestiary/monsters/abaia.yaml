SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Eldritch Gizzard (Su)
    description: >-
      An abaia can activate arcane spell trigger items as if it were a
      14th-level sorcerer. It can store items in a special compartment within
      its stomach and activate them as if it were holding them. It can swallow
      or regurgitate an item as a standard action.
  - name: Endless Coils (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, an abaia can attempt a single combat maneuver
      check to grapple up to two Large or four Medium or smaller creatures
      within its reach. Any targets successfully grabbed take constrict damage.
      The abaia only needs to succeed at one grapple check to maintain a grapple
      against multiple opponents.
  - name: Wave Rider (Su)
    description: >-
      An abaia moving onto land brings a sheath of water with it, allowing it to
      swim on land. Its swim speed drops by 10 feet at the start of its turn if
      it is out of the water, and the sheath dissipates entirely when the
      abaia's swim speed reaches 20 feet. An abaia wave riding on land retains
      its spell resistance but loses its bonus to Stealth.
Description:
  - >-
    Originally from the primal world of the fey, an abaia protects lakes and
    their surroundings from exploitation, in particular by magic and
    overfishing. It favors waters with a mystical nature or supernatural
    properties. An abaia ignores creatures that take only what they need from
    the lake and otherwise show proper respect to the waters. Those that abuse
    an abaia's lake risk capsized boats, floods, torrential rains, and even
    direct attacks. After sinking a vessel, an abaia searches the wreckage for
    magical treasure.
