    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a gholdako can exhale its noxious breath in a
      20-foot cone, permanently blinding any creatures in the affected area

Description:
  - >-
    A gholdako is a dreadful undead cyclops created by the foul priests and
    necromancers of a fallen cyclops empire thousands of years ago. A gholdako's
    single eyeball is sunken and milky, and its body and limbs are wrapped
    tightly in ragged strips of soiled and moldering linens, much like those of
    a mummy, but with disturbing and incomprehensible glyphs scribbled on the
    ancient cloth, written in what appears to be dried blood. Layers of skin
    continually flake off the hideous monster's parched flesh wherever it is
    exposed, falling in papery strips of sickly pale yellow. The average
    gholdako stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. Gholdakos are nearly
    always guardians of some special relic or tomb, having been ordered to
    protect the object or location in life and remaining faithful to their
    duties even after dying. While they strive to keep their wards safe from
    depredations, gholdakos are nonetheless short-tempered and easy to lure away
    from their posts-though being caught by one of these undead giants almost
    always spells a gruesome and untimely end for most would-be.

    Dread Gholdako (+1 CR): Some gholdakos were created to guard the tombs of
    royalty. Such dread gholdakos possess a bluish-white halo of smoke around
    their perpetually peeling scalps. A dread gholdako generally possesses
    additional Hit Dice, and can inflict paralysis (1d4 rounds, DC 10 + 1/2 the
    dread gholdako's racial Hit Dice + the dread gholdako's Constitution
    modifier) on its foes with its bite attack.
