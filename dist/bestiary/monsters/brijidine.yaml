IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Flaming Body (Su)
    description: >-
      A brijidine's body is molten rock covered in dancing flames. Anyone
      striking a brijidine with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1d6
      points of fire damage. A creature that grapples a brijidine or is grappled
      by one takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round the grapple persists.
  - name: Heat Stone (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a brijidine uses her meld into stone, soften earth and stone,
      spike stones, stone shape, or wall of stone spell-like abilities, she can
      have the affected stone radiate intense heat for 1 minute. Any creature
      within 5 feet of the stone takes 1d6 fire damage per round.
  - name: Lava Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      A brijidine can hurl a glob of lava at a target as a standard action. This
      attack has a range increment of 30 feet.
  - name: Obsidian Blade (Ex)
    description: >-
      At will as a free action, a brijidine can create a blade of jagged
      volcanic glass that functions as a +1 flaming burst keen longsword. One
      round after it leaves the brijidine's grasp, the weapon decays into
      useless powder.
Description:
  - >-
    Brijidines are passionate, powerful azatas attuned to the powers of earth
    and fire. They love basking in volcanoes, writing poetry, tending to sick
    creatures, and pursuing spicy recipes. The quickest way to befriend a
    brijidine is to present her with a fireproof copy of an exotic poem or a bag
    of rare peppers. Though their power is tied to primal destruction, they are
    quick-witted and love clever wordplay, whether in a sonnet or a dirty
    limerick.
  - >-
    The brijidine sees fire as a form of purity, a marked difference from its
    classical association with devastation and destruction. To a brijidine, the
    existence of hellfire is the rankest blasphemy, and while many azatas look
    to the demons of the Abyss as their greatest enemies, it is among the devils
    of Hell that most brijidines find focus for their anger. The fact that
    devils are immune to fire, the brijidine's greatest strength, frustrates and
    angers these azatas all the more, forcing them to become far more
    imaginative and creative in their tactics when facing such foes. A brijidine
    stands 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.
