Description:
  - >-
    one. Their savagery in battle has turned the stomach of even the stoutest
    demonic general.
  - >-
    Chaaor are used as shock troops in the Abyssal armies. Many are the demon
    lords that have sent a battalion of these fiends against an army, watching
    in delight as the brutal chaaor tore its way through the enemy's ranks. When
    not engaging in wars with other infernal creatures, the chaaor spends its
    time roaming the Abyss in hunting packs. They have no preference as to the
    type or strength of prey: they pretty much hunt and kill what they choose.
    Chaaor packs have been known to attack creatures much larger than themselves
    and kill all opponents in short order.
  - A chaaor is a 12-foot tall, hulking, ape-like brute with the head of a bear.
  - >-
    Large downward curving, grayish-silver horns grow from its head and end in
    rounded points. The chaaor's body is covered in reddish-black fur and is
    almost always caked or matted in blood. The powerful arms of a chaaor end in
    razor-sharp and filthy claws-black in color. Long rows of sharpened teeth
    fill the chaaor's mouth. When moving, the chaaor usually drops to all fours.
    When facing an aggressor it assumes a bipedal stance.
  - >-
    Chaaor are deadly adversaries that relish the blood and adrenaline of
    battle. Their tactics are simple: target a foe, charge forward, and rake or
    slash with claws and bite. Often, a chaaor unleashes its mighty roar to
    begin a fight hoping to knock down as many foes as possible.
  - >-
    A downed foe is leapt on by multiple chaaors who proceed to tear the
    opponent to pieces. Likewise, if a chaaor grabs a foe, it holds on while the
    others move in and rip it to shreds with teeth and claws.
