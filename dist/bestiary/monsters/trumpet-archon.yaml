SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Trumpet (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures except archons within 100 feet of the trumpet's blast must
      succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. The save
      DC is Charismabased. The archon can also command its trumpet to become a
      +4 greatsword as a free action. Out of the archon's hands, it is a chunk
      of useless metal.
Description:
  - >-
    Messengers of good deities and mighty celestials, trumpet archons serve as
    the vanguard of divine armies and rally the legions of heaven to war. When
    lawful good deities have the need to communicate directly with a group of
    mortals, they often send trumpet archons to act as their intermediaries.
    Trumpet archons speak with clear, musical voices. Their otherworldly eyes
    are white and pupilless. All trumpet archons carry a gleaming magical
    trumpet or horn with which they create wondrous music, sound calls to other
    archons, paralyze enemies, or defend the virtuous. They typically adorn
    their trumpet with the standard of their liege.
