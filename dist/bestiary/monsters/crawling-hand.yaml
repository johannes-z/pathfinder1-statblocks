      A crawling hand can use its grab ability on a creature of up to Medium
      size.
Description:
  - >-
    Some say the origins of the crawling hand lie in the experiments of demented
    necromancers contracted to construct tiny assassins. Other tales tell of
    gruesome prosthetics sparked to life by evil magic, which then developed
    primitive sentience and vengefully strangled their hosts. Regardless, the
    crawling hand is an efficient killing tool.
  - >-
    When not commanded to kill, the crawling hand remains still and can be
    handled and transported safely.
  - >-
    Typically, owners carry them about in small, velvet-lined boxes. Crawling
    hands can also be placed as guardians and programmed with contingency
    commands, such as to hunt down and slay an individual who performs a
    specific task like violating a shrine, opening a warded door, or breaking
    the seal of a casket.
