SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Darting Charge (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant dragonfly is adept at swooping in to attack prey with a powerful
      bite and then, just as quickly, swooping back up out of reach. As a
      result, a giant dragonfly gains Flyby Attack as a bonus feat. In addition,
      if a giant dragonfly charges while flying, it receives a +4 bonus on CMB
      checks made to grapple foes.
Description:
  - >-
    Giant dragonflies are rare compared to other varieties of giant insects, and
    fortunately so, since they are voracious hunters of warm-blooded prey,
    including humanoids.
  - >-
    The creatures typically lair in overgrown or lightly wooded areas, using
    foliage as cover. When they spot potential prey out in the open, the dragonf
    lies swoop to the attack, using their superior flight speed and
    maneuverability to run most prey to ground or carrying off smaller foes to
    eat them somewhere safe. Giant dragonf lies feed on carrion when fresh prey
    is not available, and the scent of a fresh kill often attracts them.
  - >-
    Many swamp-dwelling cultures attach religious significance to brightly
    colored and ravenous giant dragonf lies, particularly boggards. The frog-men
    attach particular significance to a giant dragonf ly's color, and their
    priest-kings often refuse to eat anything but specific colors of giant
    dragonf lies.
