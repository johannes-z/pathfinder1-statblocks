Description_Visual: >-
  This large humanoid stands over 10 feet tall, and is clad in the garb of a
  mundane fisherman. Its eyes glow with an eerie blue light and its grizzled
  face is trimmed with a gnarled beard from which scuttle small crabs, fish, and
  shrimp.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Soul Cage (Su)
    description: >-
      Using debris that floats to the bottom of the ocean, a fisherman can
      construct a soul cage. The soul cage is a magical construction that,
      through its crafting, has been endowed with a trap the soul spell. The
      spell requires no material components other than the debris from which it
      is created. The magic of the soul cage only functions for fishermen and
      the souls remain trapped for as long as the fisherman wishes and remains
      on the Material Plane. Usually, only upon the death of the fisherman may
      the trapped souls be released. A soul cage can hold up to six souls at any
      given time.
  - name: Deathwatch (Sp)
    description: >-
      A fisherman makes constant use of the spell deathwatch, as cast by a 15th
      level cleric. The range of a fisherman's deathwatch is 1 mile per hit die,
      allowing it to sense the life state of any creature within its territory.
      This ability can be negated, but the fisherman can reactivate it the next
      round as a free action.
  - name: Exotic Weapons (Ex)
    description: A fisherman is proficient in the use of the boat hook and gaff hook.
  - name: Gambling (Ex)
    description: >-
      Fishermen are fond of games and gambling and should one be offered a fair
      chance of odds, he may find a wager impossible to resist. In this way, it
      may be possible to bargain for the release of the soul of a companion or
      loved one. Although evil, fishermen are bound by a personal code and honor
      the terms of a wager if they lose. Spells Fishermen cast divine spells as
      9th-level clerics. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric
      abilities.
  - name: Weather Sense (Su)
    description: >-
      A fisherman always knows the condition of the weather within a 30 mile
      radius, even if he is currently underwater.
Description:
  - >-
    The fisherman is a rare creature not often encountered by the mortals of the
    material world. Sages and scholars often postulate these
  - >-
    boathooks, gaff hooks, and nets to ensnare and slay those who intrude upon
    their habitat. All fishermen seem to be male - no female of the species has
    ever been witnessed by any sailor. They are powerful creatures who enjoy
    tormenting seafarers and work hard to collect the souls of those who die at
    the hands of the sea. At the bottom of the ocean they may be found tending
    to devices called soul cages that resemble ordinary lobster traps, though
    they are used to imprison the spirits of the drowned. The territory of a
    fisherman can extend over a dozen miles from its lair.
  - Fishermen stand between 11 and 12 feet tall and weigh 1,600 pounds.
  - >-
    When a fisherman detects a great storm at sea, or is otherwise aware that
    sailors are meeting watery deaths, it rises to the surface in order to start
    collecting as many of the souls as it can. An individual fisherman may tend
    to as many as 3d6 soul cages, each containing the incarcerated spirits of
    1d6 unfortunate sailors, all of which have met their deaths through storm,
    shipwreck, or some other maritime disaster. Those slain by intentional
    violence are left to wander the depths by the fisherman. They are very
    competitive with others of their kind but occasionally they swap souls to
    enhance their own collections.
  - Special Weapons
  - >-
    Boat Hook: A boat hook resembles a quarterstaff with a barbed hook at one
    end. Sailors use boat hooks to snag mooring lines and pull in small boats.
    Because a boat hook is not intended to be used as a weapon, it requires the
    Exotic Weapon Proficiency to be used in that capacity. A boat hook is a
    double weapon. The damage is given as hook/staff.
  - >-
    Cost 6 gp; Small 1d4/1d3, Medium 1d6/1d4, Large 1d8/1d6; Critical x2; Weight
    5 lb.; Type Bludgeoning/Piercing.
  - >-
    Gaff Hook: A gaff hook is a curved metallic hook with a cross bar. Gaff
    hooks are used by fishermen to lift heavy catches into their boats. Because
    a gaff hook is not intended to be used as a weapon, it requires the Exotic
    Weapon Proficiency to be used in that capacity.
  - >-
    Cost 4 gp; Small 1d4, Medium 1d6, Large 1d8; Critical x2; Weight 3 lb.; Type
    Piercing.
  - >-
    aquatic spirits may hail from some other plane of existence, whilst others
    assume the fisherman is some strange form of undead, the powerful soul of a
    legendary seaman fated to lurk in the depths of the ocean. Sailors know only
    that they are to be feared. Although they do not often engage in melee
    combat, many have found to their own detriment that fishermen are quite
    skilled. Fighting with a variety of maritime tools and weapons, fishermen
