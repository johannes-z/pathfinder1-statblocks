  spiked club in its four-fingered claws.
Group: Oni

Description:
  - >-
    While the majority of oni tend to be larger than life, and thus often end up
    having associations with giants and other enormous humanoids, not all of
    them are born into physical bodies that match their boundless appetites for
    cruelty. The kuwa are an example of this, for they are oni who clothe
    themselves in human flesh. While their true forms remain unmistakably
    fiendish, with golden skin, claws, and monstrous visages with short sharp
    horns, kuwa are most at home living in disguise among humans. As with most
    oni, they generally avoid their own kind, and instead seek positions of
    power in human cities, often as guard captains, guildmasters (particularly
    of thieves' guilds), and aristocrats. Most kuwa avoid taking on the
  - >-
    role of a spellcaster unless they possess class levels in an appropriate
    class. Likewise, all but the most ambitious kuwa avoid positions of true
    authority, such as king or mayor. Kuwa are most comfortable in the upper
    echelon of command, but avoid positions so important that they have too many
    eyes on them. To a kuwa, a position of leadership that doesn't allow
    frequent abuse of that power is a waste, and by aiming for less publicly
    visible positions, the kuwa increases its opportunities for such abuse.
  - >-
    Once a kuwa secures a position in a human society, the accumulation of
    wealth becomes its primary motivation. A kuwa wants to live a life of
    decadence and sensual pleasure, and like any oni, it wants to propagate its
    own kind. Its strength and magical powers enable it to easily dominate
    normal folk, allowing it to gather groups of thuggish, like-minded humans to
    lead in banditry and worse.
  - A typical kuwa stands about 6 feet in height and weighs 190 pounds.
