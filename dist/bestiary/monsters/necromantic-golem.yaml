SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Enervating Ray (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a necromantic golem can unleash a ray of negative energy in
      a 30-foot line. A creature struck must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or gain
      2d4 negative levels. Even on a successful save, the victim gains 1d4
      negative levels. Assuming the target survives, it regains lost levels
      after 11 hours have passed. Negative levels from a necromantic golem do
      not have a chance of becoming permanent. The save DC is Constitution-based
      and includes a +2 racial bonus.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A necromantic golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that
      allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted: A magical attack that heals
      living creatures slows a necromantic golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6
      rounds (no save). A magical attack that deals negative energy damage
      breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every
      3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of
      healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it
      gains any excess as temporary hit points. A necromantic golem gets no
      saving throw against attacks that deal negative energy damage. A raise
      dead spell deals 6d6 points of damage to a necromantic golem. A
      necromantic golem gets no saving throw against this effect. A resurrection
      or true resurrection spell negates its DR and immunity to magic for 1
      minute. In an area affected by a hallow spell, a necromantic golem takes a
      -2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, checks, and saves, and a -2
      penalty to AC. In areas affected by an unhallow spell, a necromantic golem
      gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, checks, and saves, and a
      +2 bonus to AC.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      A necromantic golem heals 1 hit point every hour up to its maximum hit
      points. If reduced to 0 hit points or less, the golem continues to heal. A
      necromantic golem can be permanently destroyed by reducing it to 0 hit
      points or less, casting a hallow spell on the corpse, and dousing the
      golem with holy water.
  - name: Unholy Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds, a necromantic golem can unleash
      a blast of negative take 6d6 points of negative energy damage
      (good-aligned outsiders caught in the area take 6d8 points of negative
      energy damage). A DC 15 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A necromantic golem resembles a flesh golem, and is often times mistaken for
    said creature. It is assembled in much the same way as a flesh golem is
    (humanoid body parts stitched together into a single form), and infused with
    negative energy during the construction process.
  - >-
    A necromantic golem stands 8 feet tall and weighs around 500 pounds. Its
    sickly greenish flesh is drawn tight around its frame in areas and rotted
    completely away in others. Its form weeps fluids from various sores and
    injuries. A necromantic golem wields no weapons and wears whatever its
    creator gives it, usually ragged clothing and nothing more.
  - >-
    A necromantic golem cannot speak, though it does seem to understand basic
    commands spoken in the Common tongue.
  - >-
    In combat, a necromantic golem attacks with its unholy blast and powerful
    slam attacks, usually opening battle with its enervating ray. It is
    relentless and fights to the death unless otherwise instructed by its
    creator. A necromantic golem moves and walks with a stiff gait.
  - Construction
  - >-
    The pieces of a necromantic golem must come from normal humanoid corpses
    that have not decayed significantly. Assembly requires a minimum of six
    different bodies-one for each limb, the torso (including head), and the
    brain. In some cases, more bodies may be necessary. Special unguents and
    bindings worth 500 gp are also required. Note that creating a necromantic
    golem requires casting a spell with the evil descriptor.
