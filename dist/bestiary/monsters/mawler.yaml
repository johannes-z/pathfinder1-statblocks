SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Magic Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A mawler continuously emits a moderate aura of transmutation magic. This
      ability can be negated or dispelled (versus caster level 6), but the
      mawler can activate it as a free action on its next turn.
  - name: Mimic Shape (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mawler can assume the general shape of any object that is roughly Tiny
      sized. A mawler's body is fleshy and pliable, but it can alter the
      rigidity of its body to resemble metal, wood, and even stone. Most mawlers
      have found that taking on the shape of articles of clothing provides the
      most ready meals. The ruse can be detected by a Perception check opposed
      by the mawler's Disguise skill.
  - name: Vorpal Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mawler that scores a critical hit with its bite attack while being worn
      severs the extremity that was inside it at the time. For example, a mawler
      being worn as a boot that scores a critical hit, severs the victim's leg.
      A mawler can only use its vorpal bite while being worn. A creature that
      loses a limb suffers a -4 penalty to skill checks that require the use of
      two limbs. For example, a victim that loses a hand or arm suffers a -4
      penalty to Climb checks, Disable Device checks, and so forth.
      Additionally, a creature that loses its primary weapon-wielding arm or
      hand suffers a -6 penalty when wielding a weapon in its offhand. A
      creature with the Two-Weapon Fighting feat that loses its primary arm or
      hand ignores the penalty for wielding a weapon in its offhand. If the
      victim loses a foot or leg, the penalty applies to Acrobatics checks and
      the like. Additionally, the creature's speed is reduced to one-quarter. If
      the severed extremity happens to be the head, the victim dies immediately
      (unless it can live without its head).
Description:
  - >-
    Sages are uncertain as to the origin of the mawler, but speculation ranges
    from it being related to the mimic to it being somehow related to the
    executioner's hood. Whatever its origins, it is considered by many to be the
    bane of treasure-seekers everywhere.
  - >-
    A mawler's natural form is that of a small blob of fleshy stuff
    approximately 2 feet across. Mawlers are rarely ever seen in their natural
    form, however, as they almost always take the shape of an article of
    clothing made for a Medium humanoid-meals are easy to come by in that form.
    A mawler can alter its texture, color, and shape to match such substances as
    leather and metal. A single mawler usually takes on the form of a single
    article of clothing, such as a hat, helmet, scarf, codpiece, or belt. A pair
    of these creatures encountered together can take the shape of a pair of
    boots or a pair of gloves.
  - >-
    A mawler radiates an aura of magic, and unwitting victims are often lured
    into believing that they have found a pair of magic boots or magic
    gloves-when in reality what they place on their legs or hands will soon grow
    reveal its true nature-much to the detriment of the would-be treasure
    hunter.
  - >-
    A mawler generally does not engage in melee. It lies in wait for an
    unsuspecting meal to don it. In the rare instance that a mawler is forced
    into melee, it attacks with its bite.
  - >-
    When an unsuspecting person dons the mimic, it usually waits 1d3 minutes
    before attacking with its bite. A mawler that scores a critical and severs a
    victim's limb tries to move away as quickly as possible to digest the meal.
