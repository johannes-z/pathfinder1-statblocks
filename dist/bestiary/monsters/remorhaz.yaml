SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Heat (Su)
    description: >-
      An enraged remorhaz generates heat so intense that anything touching its
      body takes 8d6 points of fire damage. Creatures striking a remorhaz with
      natural attacks or unarmed strikes are subject to this damage, but
      creatures striking with melee weapons are not. The heat can melt or burn
      weapons; any weapon that strikes a remorhaz is allowed a DC 19 Fortitude
      save to avoid taking damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    In a world of ice and snow, the remorhaz is particularly feared for the
    terrible fires that burn within its body. These internal fires cause the
    armor plates along its back to glow red-hot when the creature is
    particularly angry, excited, or in pain. Creatures adapted to arctic regions
    are often particularly vulnerable to fire, making the remorhaz's primary
    defense an incredibly potent one and securing its role as a dangerous
    predator in such frozen reaches.
  - >-
    Remorhazes dwell in extensive warrens carved into the hearts of glaciers.
    The beasts use their heat to melt tunnels through ice, tunnels whose smooth
    glassy sides swiftly refreeze in their wake to create uncommonly stable and
    numerous mazes.
  - >-
    Although the remorhaz has much in common superficially with lesser vermin,
    the beast is surprisingly intelligent. While not capable of speech, the
    typical remorhaz has a good grasp of the Giant tongue, and tribes of giants
    often use this to their advantage to secure allegiances with the great
    beasts. Frost giants are particularly obsessed with them, for those giants
    who brave the cruel and deadly burns a remorhaz can inf lict to become "worm
    friends" gain a potent weapon to use against their enemies-an assassin
    capable of burrowing up through the floor of a glacial keep to strike
    directly against a frost giant's greatest weakness: fire. Other giants use
    the beasts as living forges, for their backs are hot enough to melt metal.
  - A remorhaz is 25 feet long and weighs 10,000 pounds.
