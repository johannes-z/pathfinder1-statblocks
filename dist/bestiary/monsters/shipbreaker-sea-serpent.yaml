  This devastating serpent is over 120 feet long and 15 feet thick. Its body
  scales are dark gray-brown, festooned with barnacles, seaweed, and other sea
  life. Its maw is the size of a large wagon, with teeth the size of
  greatswords.

Description:
  - >-
    The legendary shipbreaker is thought to be the largest of the sea serpents,
    a true behemoth that rules the seas. It is a fearless hunter that enjoys
    attacking the largest seagoing vessels and crushing them in its mighty
    coils. It is believed by many sailors and seafarers that the shipbreaker is
    a unique creature (i.e., that only one of these mighty beasts exists), and
    apparently (and thankfully) it seems to spend most of its time hibernating.
  - A shipbreaker attacks ships and huge-sized creatures as its primary prey.
  - >-
    It ignores smaller creatures except as snacks, or if directly threatened by
    one. Its favorite tactic is to ambush a ship or approach it at speed, then
    wrap it in its coils and crush it. It then feasts on the sailors in the
    water at its leisure. The shipbreaker is most often sighted deep at sea,
    usually just before it approaches and breaks up a naval vessel into
    kindling.
  - >-
    It is unknown what language the shipbreaker speaks or understands, if any,
    since none have ever reported successfully speaking with it. A shipbreaker's
    broad flat flippers allow it to slowly propel itself onto and across dry
    land.
