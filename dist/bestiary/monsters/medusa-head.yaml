Description:
  - >-
    Beheaded are floating skulls or severed heads whose bodies have long since
    abandoned them, either in the moment of death or long after. Reanimated via
    dark magic, these horrors are usually created as mindless sentinels for
    dungeons or lairs. Beheaded silently hover at about eye-level, often making
    them the last thing a casual wanderer or careless villager in an infested
    area ever sees. Creating Beheaded Spellcasters might create and employ
    beheaded in multiple ways. Animating Beheaded: A magic-user can create any
    form of beheaded from a severed head of the appropriate size or creature.
    The spellcaster must cast the spell animate dead using an onyx gem worth at
    least 100 gp, followed by the spell fly on the head to be animated. The
    creator can only create a number of Hit Dice of beheaded equal to the amount
    allowed by animate dead. Beheaded with the variant abilities below can also
    be created, though for the purposes of how many can be created, they are
    treated as if they had one additional Hit Die for each additional ability.
    Beheaded count against the number of Hit Dice of skeletons or zombies that
    can be created using animate dead and vise versa. Beheaded Familiars: Using
    the Improved Familiar feat, a spellcaster can gain an obedient severed head
    as a familiar. The character must be at least caster level 3rd to acquire
    the severed head. This creature is always neutral evil. Although any type of
    magic-user with the proper requisites can take a severed head as a familiar,
    necromancers and undead wizards employ them most frequently. Variant
    Beheaded The following are variant abilities that a beheaded might possess.
    These traits can be mixed and matched in any way and applied to any of the
    beheaded listed above. Each ability increases the CR of the beheaded by the
    listed amount. Belching (+1 CR): A belching beheaded gains the ability to
    spew raw energy from its mouth, giving it a ranged touch attack that does
    1d6 damage of a specific type (acid, cold, electric, or fire) chosen at the
    time of the beheaded's animation. Burning (+1 CR): This beheaded is similar
    to the flaming skull; however, the fire not only surrounds the skull, but
    can pass on to those it attacks. The fire that consumes the head can be any
    color the animator chooses, though blue is one of the most common. A burning
    skull gains the burn (1d6) special ability when using its slam attack, where
    the Reflex save DC is 10 + 1/2 the burning skull's racial HD + the burning
    skull's Cha modifier. Grabbing (+0 CR): This type of beheaded has long
    tendrils of ragged hair. It gains the grab special ability when using its
    slam attack, and can attempt to grapple any creature of Medium size or
    smaller in this way Screaming (+0 CR): Once every 1d4 rounds, a screaming
    beheaded can open its jaw and emit a bone-chilling scream. All creatures
    within 30 feet must make a Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save
    DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the screaming skull's racial HD + the screaming
    skull's Cha modifier. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or
    not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same
    beheaded's scream for 24 hours.
