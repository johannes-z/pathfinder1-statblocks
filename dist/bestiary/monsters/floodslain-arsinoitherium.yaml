Description_Visual: >-
  This wild-eyed, rhinolike creature lumbers along with splashing steps, water
  streaming from its pale, sagging, hide.
Group: Floodslain
Source: Belkzen Hold Of The Orc Hordes
IsTemplate: '1'
Description:
  - >-
    Collectively known as "the after-storm" by Belkzen natives, floodslain are
    victims of flash floods that have risen as undead. They're creatures of
    panic and despair, driven by anger, fear, and a yearning to drag others into
    the waters. Long after the floodwaters recede, floodslain continue spreading
    the miserable death that claimed them.
  - >-
    Floodslain are similar in appearance to their original living forms, and are
    recognizable even in their waterlogged state. Many were gruesomely damaged
    by the floods that took their lives, though, their bodies battered and
    broken by rushing water and debris. The one feature common among all
    floodslain is wild, panicked eyes-a telltale sign of a death mired in shock
    and fear. Floodslain tend to drift toward lower ground, as if seeking the
    very water that transformed them. While this habitual migration makes them a
    contained threat in some areas, the relatively flat floodplains of Belkzen
    offer little resistance to the wandering undead. They can be found floating
    in major rivers, trapped in ravines and valleys, and staggering across
    flatlands, sometimes in large numbers. Floodslain that come close to living
    creatures try to drown them, and relentlessly follow those who flee. Targets
    who escape often draw the attention of yet more floodslain, eventually
    leading the undead to their homes. In great numbers, floodslain can
    slaughter small settlements.
  - >-
    While many find the possibility of undead born from purely natural disasters
    to be disturbing in and of itself, theories from druids and scholars in
    Lastwall hold even more chilling implications. Given that floodslain are
    most common in eastern Belkzen yet are little known outside that region, it
    is suspected that the floodwater itself was cursed even before falling as
    snow, perhaps by the dark influence of Gallowspire. If the Whispering
    Tyrant's insidious reach could extend so far using only passing clouds, the
    crusaders of Lastwall might be facing a threat even more dire than they
    realize.
  - Creating a Floodslain Creature
  - >-
    "Floodslain" is an acquired template that can be added to any non-aquatic
    living creature. A floodslain uses the base creature's stats and abilities
    except as noted here.
  - 'CR: Same as base creature + 1.'
  - 'Alignment: Chaotic evil.'
  - >-
    Type: The creature's type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate
    class BAB or saves.
  - 'Armor Class: Natural armor increases by 2.'
  - >-
    Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected.
    As undead, floodslain creatures use their Charisma modifiers to determine
    bonus hit points (instead of their Constitution modifiers).
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: A floodslain creature gains channel resistance +2, DR
    5/magic, and cold resistance 10 in addition to other defensive abilities
    granted by the undead type.
  - >-
    Speed: A floodslain creature gains a swim speed of 30 feet unless it already
    possesses a swim speed.
  - >-
    Melee: A floodslain creature gains a slam attack based on its size, if the
    base creature doesn't have one. Its slam attack also delivers the drowning
    touch effect (see below). Its natural attacks are treated as magic weapons
    for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
  - >-
    Special Attacks: Floodslain creatures gain several special attacks. The save
    DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the base creature's HD + its Charisma modifier
    unless otherwise noted.
  - >-
    Crashing Waters (Su): Once per day, a floodslain creature can instinctively
    summon a spectral echo of the rushing waters that created it. This mass of
    phantom water slams the floodslain creature from behind, carrying it forward
    at up to three times its normal speed and enabling it to charge a single
    target. These waters also impact all creatures near the end of the
    floodslain creature's movement, pushing them back. This acts as a bull rush;
    the floodslain creature attempts a single combat maneuver check against the
    CMD of each creature within 10 feet of the end of its charge. This bull rush
    attempt doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
  - >-
    Create Spawn (Su): Any creature killed by a floodslain creature rises as a
    floodslain creature if it's left immersed in water for 24 hours. These spawn
    aren't under the control of their creators.
  - >-
    Drowning Touch (Su): The slam attack of a floodslain creature partially
    fills a living victim's lungs with water. The victim must succeed at a
    Fortitude saving throw in order to cough up this water or become fatigued
    for 1d4 rounds. A fatigued creature that fails this save becomes exhausted
    instead. An exhausted creature that fails this save is staggered and falls
    to 0 hp. A creature at 0 hp that fails this save drops to -1 hp and begins
    dying. A creature killed in this fashion appears to have drowned.
  - >-
    Panic (Su): The dead eyes of a floodslain creature are frozen with shock and
    fear.
  - >-
    The floodslain creature can induce fear in a living victim as a standard
    action. Targets must succeed at a Will saving throw or become shaken for 1d6
    rounds. A creature can be affected by the same floodslain creature's panic
    attack only once every 24 hours.
  - >-
    Special Qualities: A floodslain creature gains the following special
    quality.
  - >-
    Flash Flood (Su): A floodslain creature is constantly surrounded by an echo
    of the disaster that originally took its life. Water streams from the
    floodslain creature's body, forming a 30-foot-radius pool that renders the
    ground in that area slick and muddy and increases the DCs of Acrobatics
    checks made in the area by 5.
  - >-
    Ability Scores: Str +2, Dex -2, Int +0, Wis +2, Cha +2 (minimum 14).
    Waterlogged and ruined, floodslain creatures are driven to cling to life by
    maddened fear and confusion. As undead, floodslain creatures have no
    Constitution scores.
