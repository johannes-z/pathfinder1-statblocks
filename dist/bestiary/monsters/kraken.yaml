SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ink Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      A kraken can emit a cloud of black, venomous ink in an 80-foot spread once
      per minute as a free action while underwater. This cloud provides total
      concealment, which the kraken can use to escape a fight that is going
      badly. Creatures within the cloud are considered to be in darkness. In
      addition, the ink is toxic, functioning as contact poison against all
      creatures caught within it. The ink cloud persists for 1 minute before
      dispersing. The save DC against the poison effect is Constitution-based.
      Kraken Ink: Ink cloud-contact; save Fort DC 29; frequency 1/round for 10
      rounds; effect 1 Str damage plus nausea; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Jet (Ex)
    description: >-
      A kraken can jet backward as a full-round action, at a speed of 280 feet.
      It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity while jetting.
  - name: Rend Ship (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a kraken can attempt to use four of its tentacles
      to grapple a ship of its size or smaller. It makes a CMB check opposed by
      the ship's captain's Profession (sailor) check, but the kraken gets a
      cumulative +4 bonus on the check for each size category smaller than
      Gargantuan the ship is. If the kraken grapples the ship, it holds the ship
      motionless; it can attack targets anywhere on or within the ship with its
      tentacles, but can only attack foes on deck with its free arms and can't
      attack foes at all with its beak. Each round it maintains its hold on the
      ship, it automatically inflicts bite damage on the ship's hull.
  - name: Tenacious Grapple (Ex)
    description: >-
      A kraken does not gain the grappled condition if it grapples a foe with
      its arms or tentacles.
Description:
  - >-
    The legendary kraken is one of the greatest of sailors' fears, for here is a
    creature the size of a whale, one that can strike from the unseen depths
    below, can command the winds and weather that a ship needs to move, and
    possesses the cruel intellect of the world's most creative and spiteful
    criminals. Some believe krakens to be a punishment of the gods, while others
    hold them to be the true lords of the deep, with the air-breathing races
    naught but their cattle.
  - A kraken measures nearly 100 feet in length and weighs 4,000 pounds.
