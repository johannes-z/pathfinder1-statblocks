      confusion and fatigue; cure no saves but "act normally" result on the

  - name: Shriek (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a mandragora can give voice to an
      unsettling shriek. All creatures within a 30-foot spread of a shrieking
      mandragora must make a DC 15 Will save or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds.
      This is a sonic, mind-affecting ability. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Vulnerable to Supernatural Darkness (Ex)
    description: >-
      In areas of supernatural darkness (such as those created by deeper
      darkness, but not by darkness), a mandragora is slowed, as the slow spell.
Description:
  - >-
    A mandragora rises spontaneously from a mandrake root that has drawn
    nutrition from the corpse or ichor of a demon. A typical mandragora stands
    at just over 3 feet tall and only weighs 30 pounds. However, its size hides
    the creature's fantastic strength and brutality. When a mandragora attacks,
    its fingers grow into whipping, thorny vines nearly 10 feet long, with which
    it makes its slam attacks.
  - >-
    A mandragora rarely strays far from its lair amid tangled roots or vines,
    but when it encounters any other creature, it attacks regardless of the
    odds. However, a mandragora can usually recognize druids and does not attack
    them or their animal companions unless they attack it first. It has no
    qualms about attacking a druid's allies.
  - >-
    When mandragora poison is mixed with its thick, gooey, sap-like blood and
    1,000 gp worth of alchemical reagents, the resulting fluid can be used as a
    focus for the scrying spell. The fluid only lasts for the duration of the
    spell's casting time and resulting effects but the subject of the spell
    takes a -4 penalty on the save to resist it.
  - >-
    A mandrake root that is growing on or near a demon's corpse or ichor has a
    2% chance of awakening as a mandragora within a day of first absorbing the
    tainted material. A creature that wants to create a mandragora can do so
    with alchemy; the process requires a day of work, a mandrake root, several
    pints of ichor or the body of a demon of CR 6 or above, and a successful DC
    25 Craft (alchemy) check. The newly created mandragora is hostile, even to
    its creator.
