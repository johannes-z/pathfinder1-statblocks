  - >-
    Dire hyenas (known to many as hyaenodons) are more fearsome than their
    smaller cousins. While hyaenodons won't turn down carrion as a handy meal,
    they much prefer to hunt for prey. A pack of dire hyenas rarely stops moving
    and hunting for anything other than sleep, mating, or food. Hyaenodons are 6
    feet tall at the shoulder and often over 12 feet long. They weigh 900
    pounds. Gnolls have been known to train hyaenodons to serve in their lairs
    as guardians, or more commonly as fearsome mounts.
