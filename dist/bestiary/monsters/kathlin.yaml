      bonus to Constitution checks the kathlin gains from the Endurance feat.
Description:
  - >-
    Kathlins are powerful, six-legged horses that spend their time roaming the
    temperate plains they call home. They generally avoid contact with civilized
    races, preferring the seclusion of their homeland above all else. Kathlin
    congregate in herds and two types of herds can be encountered; bachelor or
    mixed. A bachelor herd consists of all males. Each male in such a herd is
    young and hasn't reached full maturity yet. The second type of kathlin herd
    is a mixed herd that contains both females and males. In a mixed herd there
    will always be at least one male for every three females (its part of the
    harem-like structure of the kathlin society). When a bachelor male reaches
    maturity, it leaves the bachelor herd and seeks out a mixed herd where it
    selects up to three females to mate with. Should the kathlin select a female
    that is mated with another male, a battle ensues. The male that wins this
    fight claims the female as its own. Kathlins can be trained as mounts or
    beasts of burden. Young are usually easier to train than older kathlins, and
    males make better mounts than females. They can also be trained to serve as
    a mount in combat. They are fearless creatures and do quite well in such
    situations. Trained properly, a kathlin makes an excellent combat steed.
    When fighting, a kathlin rears back on its hind legs and slashes with its
    hooves or gnashes at a foe with its bite. Non-domesticated or untrained
    kathlin back away from combat if overwhelmed. They do not do so out of fear,
    but are intelligent enough to know when they are beaten. Training a Kathlin
    A kathlin requires training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be
    trained, a kathlin must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this
    can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly
    kathlin requires six weeks of work and a successful DC 25 Handle Animal
    check. Riding a kathlin does not require an exotic saddle. A kathlin can
    fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or
    she makes a successful Ride check. Kathlin young are worth 5,000 gp on the
    open market. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a
    kathlin. Carrying Capacity: A light load for a kathlin is up to 300 pounds;
    a medium load, 301 to 600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601 to 900 pounds. A
    kathlin can drag 4,500 pounds. Paladin's Mount A paladin of 6th level or
    higher may call a kathlin as his or her special mount. Copyright Notice
