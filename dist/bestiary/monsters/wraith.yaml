SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      A humanoid slain by a wraith becomes a wraith in 1d4 rounds. These spawn
      are less powerful than typical wraiths, and suffer a -2 penalty on all d20
      rolls and checks, receive -2 hp per HD, and only drain 1d2 points of
      Constitution on a touch. Spawn are under the command of the wraith that
      created them until its death, at which point they lose their spawn
      penalties and become free-willed wraiths. They do not possess any of the
      abilities they had in life.
  - name: Constitution Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures hit by a wraith's touch attack must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude
      save or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain. On each successful attack,
      the wraith gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Lifesense (Su)
    description: >-
      A wraith notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if
      it possessed the blindsight ability.
  - name: Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)
    description: A wraith caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered.
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of a wraith, unless a
      master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check.
Description:
  - >-
    Wraiths are undead creatures born of evil and darkness. They hate light and
    living things, as they have lost much of their connection to their former
    lives. Dread Wraith A wraith that exists for long enough and feeds on enough
    life force undergoes an unholy transformation, becoming a creature known as
    a dread wraith. This causes the wraith to increase in size and strength, and
    to inf lict 2d6 points of negative energy damage and 1d8 Constitution drain
    with its incorporeal touch. You can create a dread wraith by applying the
    giant and advanced simple templates, or you can increase the basic wraith to
    a Large 16 HD undead.
