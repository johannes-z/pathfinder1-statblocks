Description:
  - >-
    The scarab beetle is indigenous to warm deserts, particularly those of
    northern Garund. Scarabs are small, six-legged insects with sharp
    protrusions on their front legs that they use to aid in burrowing. They are
    primarily coprophagous, eating dung for sustenance. An individual scarab
    often spends days rolling a single ball of detritus across the desert until
    it can find the perfect place to bury and deposit eggs in the dung. Because
    of this practice of burrowing underground to create new life, scarab beetles
    have long been associated with Osirian burial rites and the church of
    Pharasma
  - >-
    A scarab swarm comprises thousands of scarab beetles, each filthy from its
    constant contact with dung. Normally inattentive toward other creatures,
    scarab swarms subject those that get in their way to thousands of sharp
    bites as well as a highly infectious disease. Indeed, the bites of a scarab
    swarm are the least of their victims' worries, as the disease they carry
    claims far more lives than their hunger.

    Some religious scholars theorize that scarabs are prone to swarm because
    they're drawn to the same malign energy that causes some undead to rise in
    Osirion, though most people regard this explanation as purely superstition.
    Some worshipers of Pharasma see the arrival of a scarab swarm as a portent
    for ill fortune and upon encountering such a sight utter quick prayers to
    the Lady of Graves.
