SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blizzard (Su)
    description: >-
      An ancient white dragon can use its breath weapon to create a blizzard in
      the area around it as a standard action. This creates heavy snow
      conditions in a 50-foot radius for 1 minute, centered on the dragon. This
      snow slows movement (4 squares of movement per square entered) and limits
      vision as fog does.
  - name: Freezing Fog (Sp)
    description: >-
      An old white dragon can use this ability three times per day. It is
      similar to an acid fog spell but deals cold damage instead of acid damage.
      It also causes a rime of slippery ice to form on any surface the fog
      touches, creating the effect of a grease spell. The dragon is immune to
      the grease effect because of its icewalking ability. This ability is the
      equivalent of a 6th-level spell.
  - name: Ice Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A young white dragon can shape ice and snow at will. This ability
      functions as stone shape, but only targeting ice and snow, not stone. A
      white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice.
  - name: Ice Tomb (Sp)
    description: >-
      A great wyrm can, as a standard action, cause a creature to sink into ice.
      This works as imprisonment, but only while the target is touching an icy
      surface. A white dragon can use this ability once per day (CL equals
      dragon's HD). Targets entombed by this ability can be freed by casting
      freedom or by physically freeing the creature from the ice (Hardness 0,
      360 hit points). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Icewalking (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the
      dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without
      penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on
      ice.
  - name: Snow Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy
      conditions. A white dragon does not suffer any penalties to Perception
      checks while in snow.
Description:
  - >-
    Although most consider it to be the weakest and most feral of the chromatic
    dragons, the white dragon makes up for its lack of cunning with sheer
    ferocity. White dragons dwell on remote, frozen mountaintops and in arctic
    lowlands, making their home in glittering caves full of ice and snow. They
    prefer their meals completely frozen.
