Description:
  - >-
    A dimetrodon is a quadrupedal reptile similar in shape to a crocodile, but
    with a blunter snout filled with jagged, sharp teeth. Its most
    distinguishing feature is the massive sail that runs the length of its back.
    By extending or contracting the fin, the cold-blooded reptile can control
    its body temperature with ease. While they are not technically dinosaurs,
    dimetrodons are still often found dwelling in regions inhabited by such
    creatures.
  - >-
    A fully grown adult dimetrodon can reach a length of up to 15 feet and weigh
    upward of 2,000 pounds.
