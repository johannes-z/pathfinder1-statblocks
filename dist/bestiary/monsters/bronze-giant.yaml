SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sardonic Laugh (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round as a standard action, a bronze giant can unleash a
      bellowing laugh that strikes fear into the hearts of any creature within
      100 feet that hears it. Affected creatures that succeed on a DC 20 Will
      save are unaffected and immune to the sardonic laugh of that bronze giant
      for 24 hours. On a failed save, that creature is shaken for as long as it
      remains within 100 feet of the bronze giant and for 2d4 rounds thereafter.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - These giants are said to by some to have been sired by the Vulcan gods.
  - >-
    Others claim that they are awakened constructs with the flesh and blood of a
    living being encased in a skin of pure bronze. Both could be true, for these
    giants truly do have hardened skin the color of bronze. Due to their unique
    skin, bronze giants disdain wearing any sort of crafted armor.
  - >-
    Bronze giants are loners, and tend to avoid large gatherings of their rare
    kind, seeking mates in volcanic regions, where they remain together long
    enough to ensure the survival of their progeny, teach them how to fight and
    then move on.
  - >-
    All bronze giants claim to be the descendants of mighty Talos and are known
    to hire themselves out as mercenaries and defenders of cities within
    eyesight of great volcanoes. More than one hero has sought out a bronze
    giant for training. They may also serve as heroes and brute force, their
    appearance on a battlefield often sending would be invaders fleeing.
  - Bronze giants stand about 25 feet tall and weigh about 14,000 pounds.
  - >-
    They have hair of black, copper, red, or dark brown. Their eyes are gray,
    brown, or black. They speak Common and Giant. Bronze giants live to be 500
    years old.
  - >-
    Bronze giants prefer to dress in loose-fitting garb, such as robes and
    tunics. Sandals, rather than boots are usually worn on their feet, and many
    bronze giants wear rings, bracelets, and other jewelry fashioned of silver,
    bronze, or gold.
  - >-
    Bronze giants start combat from a distance, hurling large rocks and using
    spears before closing to fight with fists or sword. When confronted by many
    foes they let out a self-deprecating laugh that strikes fear into their
    enemies.
