SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid Spray (Su)
    description: >-
      A nyogoth's body is full of highly corrosive digestive fluid. Every time a
      nyogoth is damaged by a piercing or slashing weapon, all creatures
      adjacent to the nyogoth take 1d6 points of acid damage (2d6 acid damage if
      the attack is a critical hit).
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures that succumb to a nyogoth's horrific appearance become nauseated
      for 1d8 rounds.
Description:
  - >-
    The nyogoth's role on the Abyss is that of a scavenger. Essentially mobile
    clumps of buoyant intestines, these writhing creatures squirt through the
    air in convulsive movements like an octopus gliding through water, and are
    constantly on the search for anything smaller than one of their many mouths
    (either the relatively small ones that pinch and gasp at the tips of their
    intestinal limbs or the larger gaping one at their cores). They can subsist
    on the waste and filth left behind by other denizens of the Abyss, but
    particularly enjoy feeding on still-living creatures.
  - >-
    Despite their seemingly lowly role in Abyssal ecosystems, the nyogoths are
    far from stupid beasts. Most are nearly as intelligent as the average human,
    and are capable of solving relatively complex problems when it comes to
    securing the next meal. As outsiders, nyogoths do not need to eat to
    survive, yet this does not exempt them from hunger-a nyogoth that goes for
    longer than 12 hours without a meal becomes increasingly violent and
    erratic. Such a "starving" nyogoth typically fights to the death when the
    prospect of food is available, and may even resort to self-cannibalism,
    drinking its own spurting digestive juices from its wounds in a nauseating
    display.

    A typical nyogoth is 5 feet in diameter and weighs 260 pounds, although they
    are known to grow much larger.
