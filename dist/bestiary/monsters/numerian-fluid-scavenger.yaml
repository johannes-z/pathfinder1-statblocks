SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Addicted (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Numerian scavenger is addicted to Numerian fluids (see page 28). She
      keeps her ability damage and penalties under control with lesser
      restoration. Roll once on the Numerian Fluids Side Effects table on page
      29. If the result indicates a side effect that includes an addiction, the
      scavenger is addicted to that specific side effect in addition to Numerian
      fluids in general.
  - name: Latest Dose (Ex)
    description: >-
      There is a 50% chance the Numerian fluid scavenger drank her latest dose
      of fluid 1d4 hours ago and is still under the effects of the drug when
      encountered. If she has done so, apply the effects of the dose and roll on
      the Numerian Fluids Side Effects table on page 29. The alchemist uses
      alchemical allocation to consume her potion of lesser restoration to cure
      any ability damage she takes from the dose. The scavenger retains the
      unused dose of fluids in her inventory, even if she has consumed a dose
      earlier in the day.
Description:
  - >-
    Once, the Numerian fluid scavenger roamed the Felldales, searching for
    fluids to sell to hapless addicts. Now, she's become addicted to her own
    merchandise, and increasingly drinks her finds instead of making the long
    trek to civilization. As her symptoms worsen, the Numerian fluid scavenger
    grows more and more paranoid, convinced that strangers seek to track her
    back to her sources of Numerian fluids and rob her of her precious liquids.
    If her addiction is lifted by a healer or simply through forced withdrawal,
    the Numerian fluid scavenger could be a powerful ally for one looking for a
    source of such potent reagents.
