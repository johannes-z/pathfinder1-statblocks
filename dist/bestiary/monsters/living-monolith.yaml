SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living monolith secrets a digestive acid that dissolves organic material
      and metal quickly, but does not affect stone. Each time a creature suffers
      damage from a living monolith's acid, its clothing and armor take the same
      amount of damage from the acid. A DC 27 Reflex save prevents damage to
      clothing and armor. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a living
      monolith takes 2d6 points of acid damage unless the weapon's wielder
      succeeds on a DC 27 Reflex save. If a living monolith remains in contact
      with a wooden or metal object for 1 full round, it inflicts 27 points of
      acid damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Spawn Offspring (Ex)
    description: >-
      Every 1d4 rounds, a living monolith spawns 1d6 crawling offspring from its
      form, but 1d6 of these are instantly destroyed or reabsorbed by the living
      monolith. (See the Crawling Offspring entry below.)
  - name: Tentacles (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living monolith can transfer a grabbed opponent from a tentacle to one
      of its mouths as a move action.
Description:
  - >-
    The living monolith, sometimes called a monolith of fecundity, is a
    slow-moving pillar of amorphous flesh dripping with slime. Along its
    gigantic bulk are several gaping mouths and writhing pseudopods. This
    loathsome being is usually brought forth by the summoning spells of clerics
    who worship perverse fertility deities.
  - >-
    At irregular intervals its flesh breaks open and instantly regenerates as
    the living monolith spawns twisted offspring that crawl and slither away
    from its progenitor. Some of these spawn are instantly disintegrated by the
    acidic slime dripping from the monolith or torn to pieces by pseudopods and
    ravenous mouths, but a few scuttle away and survive (see the crawling
    offspring entry).
  - >-
    A living monolith thrashes mindlessly at opponents with its tentacles. When
    disturbed, it constantly seeps its acidic slime which is as likely to
    destroy its crawling offspring as inflicting damage on opponents. An
    opponent unlucky enough to be grabbed by a flailing tentacle is shoved into
    one of the living monolith's maws and swallowed whole, subjected to the
    monster's deadly digestive acids.
