Description_Visual: >-
  A model sailing ship in a display bottle the size of a boot sails the air on
  vaporous waves. Speckles of water move about the deck like a crew, arming a
  miniature ballista and preparing to take aim.

    description: >-
      The first time a ship in a bottle fires its ballista, rams a creature, or
      is dealt weapon damage, the bottle containing it shatters, spraying glass
      in a circle around it. All creatures in a 5-foot radius take 1d6 points of
      piercing damage. A successful DC 12 Reflex save halves this additional
      damage.
Description:
  - >-
    A ship in a bottle signifies patience and devotion. Parts are assembled
    through an obstinate hole to create the illusion of something impossible.
    The average model maker devotes months of delicate handling and blinding
    eyestrain to its creation. Most ships in bottles are built by sea captains
    and modeled after their vessels. As the devotion of a captain to his ship
    compares to that of a marriage, a ship in a bottle could be seen as the
    offspring of that relationship. This devotion is palpable well beyond the
    Material Plane.
  - >-
    Water sprites, tiny elemental spirits from the Plane of Water, see boats as
    perversions enabling landlubbers' insistence on venturing where they do not
    belong. These water spirits commandeer ships in bottles and sail them
    through the air to chase off the sailors who invade the high seas. Even if
    the ship in a bottle is destroyed, the water spirit at the helm claims
    victory, having effectively forced a captain to destroy his offspring.
  - A ship in a bottle is about 1 foot long and weighs about 5 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Model ships in bottles stand prominently on shelves in the quarters of
    captains and admirals, usually made to perfectly replicate their creators'
    ships. Once brought to life by a water spirit, a ship in a bottle maneuvers
    through the air on waves of mist. The strings of its miniature ballistae
    winch with enough tension to fire, and the water spirit turns a tribute into
    something that is both a weapon and a parody at once.
  - >-
    Not all ships in bottles are captained willingly. Captains or admirals who
    desire more dramatic tributes to the ships they have commanded sometimes
    have mundane ships in bottles seemingly brought to life via magic. Through
    either great devotion or greater gold, they gain access to the magic
    necessary to bind water spirits to their model ships. The magic binding a
    water spirit to a ship in a bottle also enchants the elemental spirit into
    believing it is the captain and crew of a typical vessel. Magically bound
    water spirits follow the orders of either the caster who bound them or the
    maker of the ship in a bottle, treating him or her as their admiral.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    A ship in a bottle's life is on the high seas, and its water spirit captain
    sets sail toward the nearest body of water. Its mission is to seek and
    destroy land creatures on the seas, and tales of ships in bottles' voyages
    rarely speak of glory. When a ship in a bottle manages to survive long
    enough to log journeys, what can be extrapolated from its miniscule logbook
    makes for fascinating insight into the elemental mind. The ways in which the
    water spirit captain justifies the world as seen from its viewpoint reads
    like a mix of mythology and a child's bathtime story.
  - >-
    The spirit inhabiting this construct determines the nature of the crew and
    replicates tiny sailors on deck. These are solely to unnerve onlookers, as
    the spirit operates the ship in a bottle's sails and weaponry hydraulically.
    A water spirit magically bound to a ship in a bottle agains its will often
    crews the vessel with manifested sailors based on the bottle's owner, or his
    descriptions of the original ship's crew.
  - >-
    A ship in a bottle sails alone only when it has no other choice, and usually
    welcomes the opportunity to join, form, or lead a fleet with other water
    spirits, flying tiny flags designed seemingly at random. Usually unbound
    water spirits captain all the ships in a bottled armada, although sometimes
    an unbound water spirit takes advantage of naive bound water spirits.
  - >-
    A chance meeting between individual ships in bottles is not the only manner
    in which fleets form. Water spirits sometimes conspire to commandeer
    multiple ships in bottles together, and nautical museums have reported
    dozens of ships in bottles flying off shelves and out to sea.
  - Construction
  - >-
    A ship in a bottle can be created through a binding ritual undertaken by a
    powerful spellcaster. The ritual requires a masterwork model ship in a
    bottle that must be built from materials worth 100 gp, and DC 30 Craft
    (woodworking) skill checks made over 2 consecutive weeks. Alternatively, a
    masterwork model ship in a bottle can instead be purchased for the ritual,
    but it must be worth at least 600 gp.
