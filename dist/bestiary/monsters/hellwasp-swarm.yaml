      A hellwasp swarm can enter the body of a helpless or dead creature by
      crawling into its mouth and other orifices. Inhabiting a body requires 1
      minute, and the victim must be Small, Medium, or Large. The swarm can
      abandon the body at any time as a full-round action. Any attack against
      the host deals half damage to the hellwasp swarm as well, although the
      swarm's DR, resistances, and immunities may negate some or all of this
      damage. When a hellwasp swarm inhabits a dead body, it effectively
      transforms the corpse into a zombie of the appropriate size under the
      swarm's control. If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a living victim, it can
      neutralize the effects of its own poison and control the victim's movement
      and actions as if using dominate monster. Hellwasps quickly consume a
      living victim, dealing 2d4 points of Constitution damage per hour. A
      hellwasp-inhabited creature is easy to spot, since its skin crawls with
      the forms of the insects inside. A swarm can attempt a Disguise check to
      conceal its inhabitation of a host, with a -4 penalty if currently
      inhabiting a Small host. A remove disease or heal spell cast on an
      inhabited victim forces the hellwasp swarm to abandon its host.

Description:
  - >-
    Even Hell's fiendish inhabitants know to stay clear of the maddening buzz of
    hellwasp swarms. While individual hellwasps are mindless, when swarmed
    together they gain a hive mind that torments the living and the dead alike.
    Sages and diabolists argue as to why this happens, but a favored explanation
    is that all hellwasps contain the dispersed soul of some greater devil,
    scattered and imprisoned by his rivals for infractions lost to mortal
    knowledge.

    Though intelligent, these swarms are often difficult to understand and
    reason with. A hellwasp swarm can speak in a fashion with its myriad droning
    wings. The chatter is often little more than repetitive mantras of insults
    and the voicing of the twisted and base desires of the swarm. A hellwasp
    swarm has little use for reason, diplomacy, or discourse in other
    circumstances, for its desires are as savage as its home plane.
