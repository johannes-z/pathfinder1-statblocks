SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Feeblemind Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      By grinding and clicking its mandibles and chitinous plates together (a
      free action), a derghodaemon can affect all creatures within 30 feet as if
      by a feeblemind spell. Daemons are immune to this effect, but all other
      creatures must make a DC 20 Will save to resist the effects. A creature
      that makes this save is immune to the effect for 24 hours. A creature that
      fails remains affected as long as the derghodaemon continues to maintain
      the aura and the subject remains within 30 feet of the derghodaemon. Once
      either condition ends, the victim of this effect can attempt a new DC 20
      Will save once per minute to recover from the effect; otherwise, it can be
      cured by a heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell. A derghodaemon
      cannot use its spell-like abilities or rend attack in any round in which
      it uses its feeblemind aura. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Swarmwalking (Su)
    description: >-
      A derghodaemon is immune to damage or distraction effects caused by
      swarms.
Description:
  - >-
    These brutal daemons personify death resulting from violent insanity, such
    as being murdered by a maniac or torn to shreds by a pack of rabid
    predators. These insectoid creatures roam the Outer Planes, scavenging
    battlefields and following the inevitable trail of violence in those hostile
    worlds. They hunt the weak and dying along the fringe of battles, feeding
    off their victims' suffering until they make their kill. Attacks from a
    derghodaemon often come from within a cloud of biting insects.
  - >-
    Brutish and low on intellect, derghodaemons find themselves serving as
    front-line fighters in fiendish armies. A derghodaemon stands 9 feet tall
    and weighs 800 pounds.
