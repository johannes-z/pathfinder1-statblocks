SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blinding Brilliance (Su)
    description: >-
      At will as a swift action, a firebird can increase the light output of its
      tail feathers so they radiate brilliant yellow light in a 100-foot radius.
      Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or
      be blinded for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Chant (Su)
    description: >-
      By chanting for one full round, a firebird can create any one of the
      following effects: cure serious wounds, remove blindness/deafness, remove
      disease, remove fear, or slow poison. Each is usable once per round at
      will, but a single creature can only gain the benefit of each one once per
      day. Each functions as the spell of the same name with a caster level
      equal to the firebird's Hit Dice.
Description:
  - >-
    Firebirds are considered by many to be good luck. Sighting one on a journey
    is considered to be a boon (unless of course you are evil, in which case it
    is deemed bad luck to see a firebird). Firebirds are thought of as
    protectors and guardians of the forest and often befriend elves, creatures.
    They dislike orcs, goblins, and any who would despoil and destroy the
    forests.
  - >-
    These creatures roost in great caves far away from civilized lands and are
    usually only seen in the early morning or evening hours. Once a month
    firebirds take to the night sky at the stroke of midnight. To the casual
    observer a firebird in the night sky appears to be a shooting star or comet
    flying across the sky.
  - >-
    Firebirds claim vast amounts of territory as their own, protecting this
    domain from evil, and also using it as their own personal hunting ground.
    Such domains often overlap with other firebirds (which suits each just fine
    as they share the duties of guardianship over the overlapping territory).
    Firebirds live on a diet of game animals, fruits, nuts, and berries.
  - >-
    A firebird appears as a large bird about 8 feet long with golden and silver
    feathers. A majestic crest of gold runs from its head, along its back, and
    disappears into its tail feathers. Its beak and claws are the color of
    pearls and its eyes shine like crystal.
  - >-
    Firebirds almost always attack evil-aligned creatures and those that would
    despoil their forests. They prefer to fight from the air and always enter
    battle with their magic circle against evil in effect. A firebird usually
    begins combat using its blinding brilliance, followed quickly by its breath
    weapon. Foes that continue to press the fight are held (if evil) or
    subjected to a sunburst.
