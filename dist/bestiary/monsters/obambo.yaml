Description_Visual: >-
  This spectral creature looks like a scarred and shriveled ruin of an ancient
  tribal elder, with skin caked with dirt and moss, and long white hair tangled
  with sticks. Sharp teeth fill its cackling mouth, and its eyes are tiny but
  bright and piercing. Jungle vines weave through its ghostly body, which
  appears stuffed with decaying leaves and other plant matter.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Jungle Animus (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, an obambo can invest its spirit into the land
      itself and cause the ground to rise up as a Huge mass of soil, mud, vines,
      roots, and vermin. In this form, it has the statistics of an advanced
      giant shambling mound, except it keeps its own hit points.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      In most cases, it's difficult to destroy an obambo through simple combat,
      as the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Only after its
      remains or place of death is found and appropriate funeral rites are
      performed does it rest in peace and not return.
  - name: Speak with Vermin (Su)
    description: >-
      An obambo can communicate with vermin, similar to using speak with
      animals. Vermin can only communicate with instinct-level information.
  - name: Thought Eater (Su)
    description: >-
      An obambo's touch drains 1d6 points of Intelligence and dazes the target
      for 1 round; a successful DC 24 Fortitude save negates the daze effect and
      halves the ability drain. The obambo gains 5 temporary hit points and a +1
      bonus on all Intelligence-based skill checks for 24 hours with each
      successful Intelligence drain; these benefits stack. A creature reduced to
      0 Intelligence by this attack is polymorphed into a Diminutive vermin
      (Fortitude DC 24 negates; otherwise treat as baleful polymorph).
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Animals, both wild and domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of
      an obambo at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer
      than that and panic if forced to do so unless their master succeeds at a
      DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. A panicked animal
      remains so while within 30 feet of the obambo.
Description:
  - >-
    When a person wise in the lore of the jungle dies and is not buried or given
    a funeral, the jungle itself may embrace her spirit, creating an obambo
    ("forsaken one"). The embittered spirit seeps into the ground, the roots of
    plants, and the crawling things beneath, becoming one with the jungle
    itself. An obambo is cunning, spiteful, and treacherous, but it remembers
    its old role of teacher and storyteller, a duty and an obligation it both
    loves and loathes. While dealing with an obambo is dangerous, they are known
    to assist those in need, if supplicants can meet the obambo's price.
  - >-
    Ecology An obambo may rise when a tribal elder or shaman perishes in the
    wild and is never properly laid to rest.
  - >-
    Without the proper rites to lead the spirit into the afterlife, the obambo
    is lost and sundered from its community and tribe, cursed to wander the
    wild. If the obambo's place of death can be discovered and its remains
    returned for proper burial (usually in a small house-like shrine on the land
    of a blood relative), its spirit is laid to rest forever, but few obambos
    ever find such peace. Instead, whispered memories drive the obambo to
    meander endlessly between jungle villages, all vaguely familiar but none
    ever seeming right. An obambo may be male or female.
  - Obambos are solitary wanderers of the bush and veldt.
  - >-
    Animals shy away from them, but obambos share a keen spiritual symbiosis
    with vermin and plants. Through an obambo's journeys, these are its
    audience, attending faithfully to the obambo's endless tales and treating it
    as a wise mentor and leader. Their obeisance, however, can never satisfy the
    obambo's yearning for the rapt attention of its former humanoid kind to its
    riddles, stories, and lessons. An obambo is easily angered by the foolish,
    however, and its stern reproofs often leave its pupils as drooling husks or
    mindless insectile drones. An obambo's plant or vermin sycophants have been
    known to devour such hapless wretches, or even to ravage entire villages as
    they sit enthralled by the obambo's tales. As long as a few survivors remain
    and learn from the obambo's teaching, it is satisfied. In any case, an angry
    obambo hardly needs assistance in the act of destruction, as an obambo's
    spiritual communion with the land enables it to merge itself into the land,
    rising up as a roaring titan melded of soil, mud, vegetation, and crawling
    vermin.
  - >-
    Habitat and Society Obambos often establish a reputation as darkling
    oracles, wise and knowledgeable about the jungle, its creatures, and its
    people. They create small shrines to themselves called akinfa, usually in
    hollow trees where supplicants may bring gifts and the obambo may sit
    within. These gifts may be of material wealth, but as a teacher, the obambo
    prefers gifts that show the talents of the supplicant, be it a crafted item,
    a song, a story, a riddle, or some other performance.
  - >-
    An obambo begins any meeting as unfriendly, but a supplicant may make a
    Craft or Perform check opposed by the obambo's Appraise skill to offer a
    gift he has made (offering a magical or masterwork item grants a +2
    circumstance bonus on this check). If the supplicant succeeds, the obambo is
    impressed with his skill and its attitude becomes indifferent. If the check
    fails, the obambo remains unfriendly, and if failed by 10 or more, the
    obambo is insulted and becomes hostile. If a creature offers an item the
    creature did not personally create, the obambo is entitled to a Sense Motive
    check opposed by the supplicant's Craft or Perform check; if it succeeds,
    the obambo becomes hostile. An obambo is unaffected by Diplomacy until it
    receives a suitable gift.
  - >-
    An indifferent obambo's attitude may be improved with Diplomacy or by
    offering additional gifts as above; each gift that pleases the obambo
    improves its attitude by one step. Using Intimidate against the obambo makes
    it immediately hostile, as does any unsuccessful Bluff attempt. An obambo
    can also be challenged to a storytelling contest. The contest is resolved by
    a Perform (oratory) or Perform (sing) check opposed by the obambo's Perform
    (oratory) check; if the PC wins, the obambo is truly impressed and
    immediately becomes helpful.
  - >-
    Each time a supplicant tries to inf luence the obambo's attitude beyond
    indifferent, it responds with a question or riddle, using its Bluff skill or
    one of its Knowledge skills; the supplicant must oppose the check with the
    same skill. Each time a supplicant fails this opposed check, the obambo
    becomes annoyed and all skill checks to inf luence him take a -2
    circumstance penalty for 1 hour.
  - >-
    An indifferent obambo answers questions in riddles, requiring a Sense Motive
    check opposed by the obambo's Bluff check for the PC to understand what the
    creature means. A friendly obambo speaks more plainly, and visitors
    generally do not need to make opposed checks to determine its meaning. It
    may offer goodberries to supplicants who have offered it additional gifts. A
    helpful obambo answers questions clearly, and may also agree to use one of
    its spell-like abilities to aid the supplicant.
  - >-
    However, an obambo expects gratitude and an additional gift after it lends
    its aid. If no gift is forthcoming, or the supplicant requests another
    favor, the obambo flies into a rage at the ingratitude and attacks.
