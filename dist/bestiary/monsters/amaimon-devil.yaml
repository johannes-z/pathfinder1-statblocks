Description:
  - >-
    Amaimons are wicked and cruel diabolic creatures that take great pleasure in
    the torture and slaying of other creatures. For this, they are often found
    serving as inquisitors and "information extractors" under the various dukes
    of Hell. Their methods of torture vary from amaimon to amaimon but include
    both standard torture methods (racks, screws, weights) and exotic torture
    methods (capturing their fiery poisonous breath weapon in vials and
    injecting it into the bloodstream of a living creature, for example).
    Amaimons care little for other creatures, including their own kind. They are
    completely self-absorbed, selfish, and evil.
  - An amaimon stands about 9 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds.
  - >-
    An amaimon ruthlessly attacks any creatures it encounters. It begins combat
    with its breath weapon seeking to engulf as many of its opponents within the
    area as possible. It always enters combat against good-aligned foes with its
    protection from good in effect raking with its claws and gnashing with its
    bite. If the battle turns against the amaimon it summons a horde of lemures
    or another amaimon to its aid.
