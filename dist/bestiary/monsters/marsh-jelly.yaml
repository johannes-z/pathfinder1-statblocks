SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Ex)
    description: >-
      When slain, a marsh jelly explodes in a blast of acid that deals 2d6
      points of acid damage to anything within 10 feet. A successful DC 14
      Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Disorienting Glow (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a marsh jelly first takes damage, its body begins pulsating and
      flashing rapidly, emitting an eerie greenish glow. Creatures viewing a
      pulsating marsh jelly must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be dazzled for
      1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

      Tentacle-injury; save DC 14; frequency 1/ round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2
      Dexterity damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is

Description:
  - >-
    This bizarre creature floats slowly through the gloom of swamps and marshes.
    It has a gelatinous body reminiscent of a jellyfish that is nearly
    translucent, its four stringy tentacles dangling beneath it in a constant
    hunt for food. Marsh jellies are roughly man-sized and tend to thrive on
    giant swamp rats, and other creatures smaller than itself. It is not
    uncommon however for a marsh jelly or a globe of such creatures to prey on
    unwary travelers who stray to deeply into open marshland. Marsh jellies are
    responsible for the strange disappearance of many who enter their swamps for
    they digest their prey, bones and all, leaving only acidresistant precious
    metals such as gold behind.
  - >-
    A marsh jelly looks like a hovering, flying jellyfish with a translucent
    sickly green body and four long dangling grayish-pink tentacles. Many
    smaller tentacles ring its body and aid the creature in locomotion as well
    as detecting scents in the air. A marsh jelly's body emits a pulsating glow
    when it is threatened or damaged, and the creature can likewise use this
    glow to lure prey closer to it.
  - >-
    Marsh jellies descend on their prey from above, stinging repeatedly with
    their venomous tentacles. When wounded, their translucent flesh begins to
    pulse rapidly with a flashing green strobe effect that tends to disorient
    its prey, and any other creatures who may seek to harm it.
