Description:
  - >-
    Lording over the darkest swamps and marshes, black dragons are the
    undisputed masters of their domain, ruling through cruelty and intimidation.
    Those who dwell within a black dragon's reach live in fear. Black dragons
    tend to make their lairs in remote parts of the swamp, preferably in caves
    at the bottom of dark and fetid pools. Inside, they pile up their filthy
    treasure and sleep amid the roots and muck. Black dragons prefer their food
    a bit rotten and will often allow a meal to sit in a pool for days before
    consuming it. Black dragons prefer treasures that do not rot or decay,
    making their hoard, full of coins, gemstones, jewelry, and other objects
    made from stone or metal.
