SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When killed, a tooth fairy explodes into a cloud of sparkling white fairy
      dust that clings to creatures within 5 feet. This glittery substance has a
      stench so foul that it sickens any creature coated by it for 1d4 rounds
      (Fortitude DC 10 negates). This is a poison effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Pliers (Su)
    description: >-
      Each tooth fairy owns a pair of pliers it uses to torment its victims. In
      the hands of a tooth fairy, the pliers deal damage as a +1 dagger wielded
      by a Medium creature. The pliers have hardness 10 and 3 hit points. If its
      pliers are destroyed, a tooth fairy is stunned for 1 round. If the tooth
      fairy is killed, the pliers rust away into worthless splinters 1d4 rounds
      later. A tooth fairy can create a new pair of pliers by spending one hour
      crafting (no materials required), which destroys the previous pair. The
      pliers grant the tooth fairy the Greater Dirty TrickAPG feat and a +4
      bonus on dirty trick and steal combat maneuvers.
  - name: Tricky Thief (Su)
    description: >-
      A tooth fairy can use a dirty trick combat maneuver with its pliers to
      pinch an opponent's fingers, or a steal combat maneuver to steal an
      opponent's tooth. A finger pinch deals 1 point of Dexterity damage.
      Stealing a tooth deals 1 point of Charisma damage and 1 point of bleed
      damage. If the stolen tooth is reattached within 10 minutes and the
      character receives any amount of magical healing, the tooth reattaches,
      the bleed damage ends, and the Charisma damage is cured.
Description:
  - >-
    Tooth fairies are fey created when a willful child's tooth (or, rarely, a
    whole child) is buried in a place with strong connections to the mysterious
    realm of the fey. Wicked and capricious, tooth fairies delight in spreading
    fear and pain, and have a perverse need to steal the teeth of humanoid
    creatures. Each night, gangs of tooth fairies stalk humanoid settlements,
    using their magic to confuse and distract their victims, and reveling in the
    looks of horror on their victims' faces as the fey suddenly appear out of
    the darkness with their dirty, bloody pliers. The fairies then lull their
    targets to sleep and get to work at claiming their prizes. Some cautious
    fairies bite their targets to paralyze them and ensure the victims can't
    wriggle away from the fairy's grasping pliers; others enjoy the sounds of
    creatures awakening to their own screams as the fairy torments them with
    harsh pinches and painful tugs on fingers, teeth, or eyelids. Tooth fairies
    use stolen teeth either to replace their own lost teeth (if the stolen teeth
    are small) or to decorate their dwellings, which usually lie inside
    abandoned buildings or knotholes in trees. Used as stools, carved into
    minuscule sculptures, or worn as crowns, the prized teeth serves as trophies
    of their successful raids.
