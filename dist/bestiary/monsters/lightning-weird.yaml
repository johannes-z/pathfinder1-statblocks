SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Control Elemental (Ex)
    description: >-
      Lightning weirds can attempt to command any outsider with the
      "Electricity," "Elemental," or "Air" subtype that is within 50 feet. The
      Will save to avoid control has a DC of 20. The save DC is Charisma-based
      and includes a +4 racial bonus. This effect is similar to the dominate
      monster spell. The elemental receives a Will save to avoid being
      commanded. If the save succeeds, that elemental is immune to the control
      elemental ability of that lightning weird for one day. If the save fails,
      the elemental falls under the control of the lightning weird and obeys it
      to the best of its ability until either it or the lightning weird dies.
      There is no limit to the number of HD of elementals a lightning weird can
      control using this ability. The range is unlimited though both the
      lightning weird and the elemental must be on the same plane of existence;
      otherwise, the lightning weird loses control of the elemental. Lightning
      weirds cannot control other lightning weirds using this ability.
  - name: Electricity (Ex)
    description: >-
      Lightning weirds are living creatures of elemental lightning; any
      successful melee hit deals electricity damage. Creatures attacking a
      lightning weird unarmed or with natural weapons are subject to electricity
      damage. Lightning Pool A lightning weird's pool is a crackling, dancing,
      arcing, ball of electricity. Creatures touching the pool take 2d8 points
      of electricity damage per round of contact. Creatures wearing metal armor
      must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 16) each round they are in
      contact with the pool or be stunned for that round. Creatures immune to
      electricity are unaffected by the lightning weird's pool and take no
      damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Reform (Ex)
    description: >-
      When reduced to 0 hit points or less, a lightning weird collapses back
      into its pool. Four rounds later, it reforms at full strength minus any
      damage taken from earthor fire-based attacks and effects (including
      attacks by earth or fire elemental creatures).
  - name: Transparency (Ex)
    description: >-
      A lightning weird is effectively invisible in its lightning pool until it
      attacks.
Description:
  - >-
    The Quasi-Plane of Lightning is not only home to the lightning
    quasielementals (q.v.), but also is home to the serpent-like lightning
    weirds.
  - >-
    The plane itself is an inhospitable place to those without some protection
    against electricity. Lightning weirds spend their time riding electrical
    storms on their native plane.
  - >-
    Casters often summon lightning weirds to do their bidding; confining them
    into pools of lightning until their task is complete. These creatures
    sometimes find their way through a portal into the Material Plane and will
    be found in areas of concentrated lightning strikes.
  - >-
    Lightning weirds resemble 10-foot long serpents composed of yellow or white
    crackling lightning. Their body is long and thin and is always in motion.
    Brilliant flares of electricity function as the creature's eyes and small
    bolts of electricity constantly leap and dance from its form.
  - >-
    Lightning weirds lash out of their crackling pools as soon as an opponent
    moves too close. Foes are usually grabbed and pulled into the pool where the
    weird holds on and waits for the creature to die. The lightning weird always
    chooses a heavily-armored or metal-armored foe over an opponent in light or
    no armor. These creatures hate lightning quasi-elementals and attack them on
    sight.
