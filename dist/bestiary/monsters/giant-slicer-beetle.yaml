  - name: Vorpal Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      The mandibles of a slicer beetle are extremely sharp. It gains Improved
      Critical (bite) as a bonus feat. The mandibles can sever body parts from
      opponents. If a slicer beetle scores a natural 20 on its attack roll and
      confirms the critical hit, it severs one of the opponent's extremities
      (roll 1d6: 1-3 arm, 4-6 leg; 50% chance of either right or left).
Description:
  - >-
    The slicer beetle closely resembles a large stag beetle and is often
    mistaken for such. However, the slicer beetle is more aggressive than the
    stag beetle. The creature dines on carrion, fresh meat, and leaves.
  - >-
    Stag beetles are about 10 feet long, but can grow to lengths of 20 feet or
    more.
  - >-
    The slicer beetle attacks by biting with its mandibles. A critical hit by
    the slicer beetle has a chance of severing a foe's arm or leg.
