      creature. This is a negative energy effect. A creature dies if this
      Strength damage equals or exceeds its actual Strength score.
Description:

    Greater shadows are those undead shadows that have come to be particularly
    infused with negative energy, such as those that have spent vast lengths of
    time in areas of the Plane of Shadow awash in negative energy, or those that
    have drained the lives of thousands of victims. These undead monsters are
    often found with a small band of normal shadows, which typically treat a
    greater shadow as a leader to rally behind.
