Description_Visual: >-
  Once a beautiful celestial with the torso of a winged woman and a snakelike

Description:
  - >-
    A broken soul is torment and pain made manifest. Tortured to the extremes of
    both physical and mental endurance, and then taken beyond those barriers, a
    broken soul gains extraordinary reserves of fortitude and resilience as well
    as the ability to inflict a measure of its own terrible suffering on others.
    Each broken soul has a unique appearance, the torture it has endured plainly
    visible on its body. Its skin is a mass of scar tissue, marred with bruises
    that do not fade and scored with countless scars. In some cases, a broken
    soul's flesh has been flayed away, revealing the musculature and bone
    underneath. Weeping sores and open cuts cover a broken soul's body, wounds
    that never fully heal. Its limbs are often twisted, the result of broken
    bones that were never set properly, and it might be missing fingers, toes,
    ears, or other appendages. A broken soul's existence is one of unending
    suffering, and the constant pain often drives the creature irrevocably mad.
    In their insanity, these unfortunates hate all other creatures and seek to
    inflict their wounds and their agony on all they encounter. The creation of
    a broken soul can happen in a number of ways. Some broken souls arise
    spontaneously, the result of horrific treatment at the hands of cruel
    abusers. With no way to escape their torment, these creatures embrace the
    pain and anguish and transcend them, making them a part of their very being.
    In so doing, they become something both more and less than they were. Other
    broken souls are purposefully created out of helpless prisoners by sadistic
    torturers through a harrowing gauntlet of mental and physical torments. By
    breaking a creature's mind and body, these torturers hope to create
    guardians or servants whose loyalty is ensured by the constant pain they
    must endure. Even more harrowing, some broken souls take it upon themselves
    to create more of their kind, fashioning gruesome works of living, mutilated
    art in an effort to share their suffering. These "artists" often turn on
    their own torturers first, perfecting their skills on those who created them
    before turning their attention to any other unfortunate creatures they can
    find.
  - CREATING A BROKEN SOUL
  - >-
    "Broken soul" is an acquired template that can be added to any living
    creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher (referred to hereafter as
    the base creature). A broken soul uses all the base creature's statistics
    and special abilities except as noted here.
  - 'CR: Same as the base creature +2.'
  - 'Alignment: Usually chaotic evil.'
  - >-
    Armor Class: A mass of scar tissue covers every inch of the broken soul's
    body, increasing the base creature's natural armor bonus by +4.
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: Inured to pain and abuse, a broken soul gains damage
    reduction 5/- and acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic resistance 5.
  - >-
    Speed: Because a broken soul is in constant agony, reduce each of its speeds
    by 10 feet (minimum speed of 5 feet).
  - >-
    Special Attacks: A broken soul gains the following special attacks. Save DCs
    are equal to 10 + 1/2 the broken soul's Hit Dice + the broken soul's
    Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted.
  - >-
    Agonized Wail (Su): As a standard action, a broken soul can emit an agonized
    wail that inspires terror in those who hear it. All creatures within 120
    feet must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for as long as they remain
    within 120 feet of the broken soul. A successful save renders a creature
    immune to that broken soul's agonized wail for 24 hours. This is a sonic
    mind-affecting fear effect.
  - >-
    Baleful Gaze (Su): Any creature within 60 feet of a broken soul must succeed
    at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Strength, Constitution, and
    Charisma drain. Whatever the result of the saving throw, the creature cannot
    be affected by the same broken soul's baleful gaze again for 1 minute.
  - >-
    Torturous Touch (Su): A broken soul can make a touch attack to cause
    hideous, painful wounds to rip open in the target's body. This touch deals
    2d6 points of slashing damage and 1d6 points of Dexterity damage, and causes
    the touched creature to fall prone in a fit of convulsions and be dazed for
    1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save negates the Dexterity damage and the
    convulsive fit.
  - >-
    Abilities: Con +6, Wis -2 (minimum 1). In addition, a broken soul gains a +2
    bonus to one ability score of its choice and a -6 penalty to another ability
    score of its choice (minimum 1), which can apply to the ability scores
    modified by this template.
  - >-
    Feats: A broken soul gains Diehard, Endurance, Great Fortitude, and
    Toughness as bonus feats.
  - >-
    Skills: A broken soul gains a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate checks, but
    takes a -10 racial penalty on Concentration checks because of its constant
    pain.
