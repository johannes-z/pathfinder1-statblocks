SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Engulf (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per minute as a standard action, a mudman can hurl itself at any
      creature of its size or smaller within 10 feet. If it succeeds on a ranged
      touch attack, the mudman immediately makes a CMB check to grapple the
      target (this does not provoke an attack of opportunity) with a +4 racial
      bonus. If the mudman fails to establish a hold, it drops into an adjacent
      square and is staggered for 1 round. If the mudman establishes a hold, it
      flows over its opponent, covering the creature with its muddy body-it can
      attempt a new CMB check to maintain the "hold" on the creature each round
      that follows as a free action. The creature is effectively blinded and
      must either hold its breath or suffocate as long as the mudman retains its
      hold. Each round the mudman maintains its hold, it deals 1d4+3 points of
      damage as it crushes and constricts its victims.
  - name: Magic Vulnerability (Ex)
    description: >-
      Mudmen are particularly susceptible to dispel magic, as this spell
      disrupts the magical energies in their bodies. A mudman subjected to
      dispel magic takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (Fortitude save
      for half damage). Transmute mud to rock deals 1d6 points of damage per
      caster level to any mudmen caught in the area of effect and leaves them
      staggered until they can find a new mud pool. Other, similar spells may
      have similar effects.
  - name: Mud Bomb (Su)
    description: >-
      A mudman can hurl globs of its muddy body mixed with its surrounding
      mud-this attack has a range increment of 10 feet. If one of these mud
      bombs hits a target, it quickly grows semi-solid and tenacious, causing
      1d4 points of Dexterity damage. If the cumulative Dexterity damage from
      mud bombs ever equals the target's actual Dexterity score, the target
      remains conscious but is held immobile and cannot take any physical action
      (although see below) until the mud is removed or the target breaks free.
      Spell-like abilities or spells with only verbal components may be used if
      the trapped creature can make a DC 20 concentration check. It's a DC 20
      Strength check (made as a full-round action) to pry accumulated mud off
      and remove all Dexterity damage caused by the attack-a creature that is
      held immobile can break free with a DC 25 Strength check made as a
      full-round action (this is the only physical action the creature can
      attempt while encased in mud). The mud dries and crumbles to dust in 15
      minutes, or in 1d3 rounds if a large amount of water (such as results from
      a casting of create water) is used to wash it away.
  - name: Mud Pool (Su)
    description: >-
      A mudman cannot leave the bounds of the mud pool it dwells in, although
      these mud pools may be of any size. A mudman's tremorsense extends
      throughout the entire mud pool, and it gains a +16 bonus on Stealth checks
      when hiding in a mud pool. A mudman forced out of its mud pool is
      staggered.
Description:
  - >-
    Their natural form is that of a pool of mud about 5 feet in diameter. In
    this form, they cannot be discerned from normal mud. Mud pools are formed
    where the Plane of Earth and the Plane of Water commingle in the multiverse,
    and thus mudmen are born. Occasionally, a vortex opens to a region on the
    Material Plane where magical waters have stagnated against the land, thereby
    forming a mud pool. Mudmen pass through this vortex to the Material Plane.
    Though not evil, mudmen look with disdain on any who trespass in their mud
    pools.
  - >-
    When a living creature enters a mud pool, the mudman forms its humanoid
    shape (as a standard action) and attacks until the opponent is slain or
    leaves the mud pool. A mudman attacks by pummeling a foe with its fists or
    by hurling globs of mud. Mudmen are bound to the pool where they are formed
    or where they enter the Material Plane and cannot leave their mud pool.
  - >-
    A mudman's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of
    overcoming damage reduction.
