    description: >-
      In addition to being immune to cold and fire, the flames that wreath an
      undead fire elemental also act as a fire shield spell. Any creature
      striking the undead fire elemental with a natural or handheld weapon takes
      1d6+12 points of cold damage. This effect cannot be dispelled.
  - name: Coldfire (Su)
    description: >-
      Each time an undead fire elemental successfully hits a living creature,
      that creature must make a DC 19 Fortitude save or catch on fire from the
      elemental's cold flames. These flames deal 1d6 Strength damage per round
      as the life-giving heat is snuffed from its body. The afflicted creature
      is entitled to a new saving throw each round. This coldfire burns for 1d6
      rounds or until a successful save is made. Resistance to cold or fire does
      not prevent this damage, though death ward does. The save is Charisma
      based.

      As a standard action (that does not provoke an attack of opportunity), an
      undead fire elemental can extinguish itself, thereby reducing itself to
      the form of its base component - a small pile of cold ashes. The undead
      fire elemental will rarely do this while in the presence of other
      creatures because of the inherent vulnerability involved. If the cold ash
      can be scooped up and placed in a stoppered container, the undead fire
      elemental is trapped until released. Likewise if the ash pile is exposed
      to winds of 50 mph or greater, the undead fire elemental's material form
      is dispersed, and it is unable to manifest its burning form again until it
      is able to reform its ash pile - a process usually taking several years.
      While in its ash pile form, an undead fire elemental can burst into its
      burning form as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.
Description:
  - >-
    Occasionally a horrible tragedy befalls a summoned fire elemental such that
    it is destroyed but is not permitted to return to its plane of origin. When
    this happens, what can eventually form is a horrendous creature composed of
    its original element infused with raw negative energy. The resulting undead
    creature is an abomination to its element, seeking nothing more than to
    snuff out all heat it encounters. Divorced of its natural element, undead
    fire elementals are no longer hindered by water or bodies of nonflammable
    liquids.
  - >-
    An undead fire elemental stands 7 feet tall but weighs only 75 pounds due to
    its ephemeral nature.

    Undead fire elementals retain the ability to speak Ignan but rarely deign to
    speak to those they are about to consume in their cold fury.
  - >-
    Undead fire elementals usually remain in their lairs, morosely remembering
    their prior warm existence. However, when anything living comes within
    range, they quickly resume their burning form and surprise attack with glee
    to forever destroy the heat that they sense in their prey.
