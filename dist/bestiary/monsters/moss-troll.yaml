Description:
  - >-
    Moss trolls are bent and gangly creatures. They are smaller and thinner than
    normal trolls, yet their arms are unusually long and spindly for the
    creatures' size. Their flesh supports the growth of moss and mold as surely
    as tree bark.
  - >-
    Although their appetites are notoriously powerful, moss trolls are sly
    killers rather than simple brutes. They travel in the trees, singing,
    climbing, and jumping with unnerving ease. When a moss troll spots prey, it
    reaches or leaps down from above, heedless of dropping great distances in
    its eagerness to sate its ravenous appetite.
  - >-
    Moss trolls are fearless except in the face of fire, which does not stop a
    hungry moss troll from attacking, but can often cause a wounded one to
    retreat. However, those who fight moss trolls may be unpleasantly surprised
    to learn that acid has no special effect on a moss troll's regeneration.
  - >-
    Moss trolls not only hunt from the trees, but also live, breed, and hide
    their treasure among the branches. Their weirdly long arms allow them to
    attack foes on the ground without ever needing to set foot on the earth
    themselves. Young moss trolls are adept at climbing and acrobatics, as much
    as they are at eating and killing. Like other trolls, adult moss trolls
    often drive juveniles away after training them to hunt and fight. Gangs and
    troops of moss trolls exist only where food is plentiful. While moss trolls
    can digest almost any organic material, they prefer fresh meat-particularly
    when said meat is served still alive and squirming after a particularly
    invigorating session of stalking and torture.
  - A moss troll is 9 feet tall and weighs 550 pounds.
