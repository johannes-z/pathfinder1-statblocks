Description_Visual: >-
  This mangy, horse-like beast walks perversely upright. Ragged wings, a
  dragon's lengthy tail, and a wide mouth full of jagged teeth complete its vile
  appearance.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bay (Su)
    description: >-
      When the Sandpoint Devil screams as a standard action, all creatures
      within a 300-foot-radius spread must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or
      become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear
      effect. Whether or not their saves are successful, creatures within the
      effect are immune to the Sandpoint Devil's bay for 24 hours thereafter.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Hellfire Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, the Sandpoint Devil can unleash a blast of infernal
      flame from its mouth as a standard action. This hellfire fills a 30-foot
      cone and deals 10d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 20 half ). Anyone who
      takes damage from this breath weapon must also succeed at a DC 20 Will
      save to avoid becoming cursed by the infernal flames. Those who become
      cursed take a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill
      checks for a number of days equal to the damage taken, and during this
      time, the victim's skin appears to be horribly burned in places regardless
      of any healing applied. This curse effect functions at caster level 12th.
      The save DC for both saves is Constitution-based.
  - name: Kick (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Sandpoint Devil's hoof attacks are primary attacks that deal
      bludgeoning and slashing damage.
Description:
  - >-
    When residents of the small town of Sandpoint on the southwestern coast of
    Varisia speak in low voices about "the devil," they mean the dreadful
    creature that has menaced the community and its hinterlands for over a
    decade. Then again, most people don't speak of the Sandpoint Devil if they
    can help it. They say the monster knows when someone is talking about it,
    and a poor soul who can't hold his tongue is likely to glimpse the
    creature's grotesque silhouette in the sky on the next moonless night-an ill
    omen indeed. According to legend, sightings of the Sandpoint Devil presage
    times of great woe, whether for a single person or the entire town.
    Sometimes, those who see the creature or speak of it too freely vanish in
    the night, never to be seen again.

    Precise descriptions of the Sandpoint Devil vary depending on whom you ask,
    but most people agree that it resembles a large horse standing upright on
    its hind legs with leathery, ragged wings; a reptilian tail; red eyes that
    burn through the gloom; and a fanged muzzle that gives the creature a
    perpetual evil grin. Some say the devil commands fog and wind, others say it
    breathes gouts of flame or can literally frighten you to death, and still
    others say it can do all this and more.

    Whenever livestock are slaughtered in their pens or children disappear from
    their beds, townsfolk are quick to blame the Sandpoint Devil. The beast is
    also denounced (quietly) when a building burns to the ground or a farmer's
    crops wither. In short, the locals hang nearly all their ills on the devil.
    But not all residents consider it to be evil. Some believe that the creature
    is an ancient guardian of the Lost Coast, and its actions in service of that
    goal, however terrible they might seem, are not for mortals to understand.
  - >-
    Of course, hearsay and rumors only go so far, and most people outside the
    region consider the Sandpoint Devil a tall tale at best. At worst, they say
    it's a hoax perpetrated by simple folk looking for attention or hoping to
    draw travelers and adventurers with coin to spend.
