SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Contagious Whisper (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a nogitsune can influence a target she speaks to as
      per the spell suggestion. The target must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or
      be affected by this effect. In addition to being subject to suggestion's
      normal effects, any creature affected by the contagious whisper can pass
      the enchantment on to other targets. Doing so requires the target to
      communicate the nogitsune's suggestion, forcing the new target to save as
      if it were the initial target. If such a secondary target resists the
      contagious whisper, it is unaffected, but this does not remove the
      suggestion from the initial target. Failing the save puts another creature
      under the nogitsune's compulsion. Newly affected creatures are also able
      to spread the suggestion. A nogitsune's compelling whisper can affect a
      number of creatures equal to the its Hit Dice and lasts for a number of
      hours equal to its Hit Dice. Creatures that successfully save versus the
      nogitsune's compelling whisper (as a primary or secondary target) cannot
      be affected by that particular nogitsune's compelling whisper for 24
      hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Fleet Distraction (Su)
    description: >-
      A nogitsune can make a Bluff check or use its obscuring mist spell-like
      ability as a swift action in any round in which it moves up to half its
      base land speed.
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      Nogitsune are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally
      poisoning themselves. Their aptitude is such that they often paint their
      weapons and nails with blue whinnis. Blue Whinnis: injury; save Fort DC
      14; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; initial effect 1 Con damage; secondary
      effect unconsciousness for 1d3 hours; cure 1 save
Description:
  - >-
    Nogitsune are created when oni spirits take over the bodies of kitsune
    (sagacious humanoid fox-creatures). The resultant possession creates a
    creature with the kitsune's foxlike grace and cunning and infuses it with
    the destructive power of an oni. Nogitsune are always female, and resemble
    shapely humans with a covering of fur and a fox's head. A nogitsune's fur
    color varies and can be orange and white, grey, pure white, or even black.
    Whenever nogitsune use their shapechanging abilities to assume a humanoid
    form, they still evince somewhat pointed, vulpine features. In addition, any
    hair on their assumed form betrays the natural coloration of their pelts.
    Nogitsune stand between 5 and 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh just over 100
    pounds.

    Empires Gazetteer.

    Oni manifest themselves in different ways based on the creatures they take
    as vessels for their depraved wrath. They take particular joy in corrupting
    kitsune to form nogitsune, delighting in turning the mystical creatures into
    deadly killers and spreaders of woe. Most nogitsune become spies or
    assassins. Though they need no real reason to kill others, the coin they
    receive for their services allows them to afford the other vices they enjoy,
    such as pleasures of the flesh and excesses of drink and narcotics (when
    available). Nogitsune are deft killers because of their speed, grace, and
    spell-like abilities. Those who have seen them and lived tell tales of these
    oni running toward walls at blinding speed and then simply continuing upward
    to vault the wall's crown as if it were no more difficult to walk on than
    the ground. Still others
  - >-
    claim that nogitsune can dive into a shadow like a pool of water and
    disappear, while others mention the cloud of smoke that nogitsune often use
    to escape pursuit, even when running full speed.
  - >-
    Although they often don human form to disguise themselves for the purpose of
    inf iltration, nogitsune prefer to stalk and kill prey in their natural
    form. This gives the creatures the choice of whether to use manufactured
    weapons or their own sharp claws and deadly bite. When wielding weapons, all
    nogitsune enjoy using poison, whenever possible employing toxins and venoms
    that do not kill outright (unless a contract so requires it) but rather
    render the victims unconscious or helpless. This gives the oni the joy of
    dealing the killing blow with their jaws and slaking their bloodlust in
    abject savagery.
  - >-
    A nogitsune's most feared weapon, however, is its contagious whisper. This
    powerful compulsion, often whispered into the victim's ear in honeyed tones,
    not only forces the targeted creature to believe whatever lie the nogitsune
    crafts, but also infects the subject of the contagious whisper with a
    corruptive echo of deceit that causes the victim to unknowingly pass on the
    nogitsune's suggestion to others. Nogitsune may use this ability to convince
    a successive series of servants to open all of the doors to a well-guarded
    castle, or to make a host of witnesses believe they saw an innocent man
    commit a brutal crime that was really the oni's own handiwork.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Nogitsune inhabit large urban areas, where they can have their pick of a
    nearly endless stream of victims. Occasionally they will inhabit a town or
    village in the countryside, but such locales are always in the shadow of a
    large castle or estate that can provide additional opportunities to stalk
    and murder others. Wherever they choose to dwell, nogitsune lair in the
    seediest districts, where drugs, brothels, and crime are rampant. These
    areas not only discourage chase by would-be pursuers, but also place the oni
    in the midst of people who society generally doesn't miss if and when a
    contract doesn't slake the creature's bloodlust.
  - >-
    Those looking to hire a nogitsune can do so, but such a practice is both
    costly and dangerous. Although little binds a nogitsune to its accepted
    contract when it receives payment, most nogitsune happily carry out their
    orders for the sheer joy of bringing death to another. But many who
    foolishly hire nogitsune to do their killing find themselves the next victim
    once the initial target is slain. Nogitsune have little honor, and such
    treachery not only feeds their bloodlust, but also leaves fewer witnesses.
  - >-
    Nogitsune prefer to lead solitary lives and be in command of their own foul
    fates. Thus, most avoid associating with more powerful creatures, other oni,
    or even other nogitsune. Those honorable samurai and good ninja who have
    fought and killed nogitsune recount seeing a conf licted and turbulent anger
    within the creatures, as if the once-righteous kitsune within a nogitsune
    constantly battles to reassert control. Although there is no record of such
    a reversal occurring, many believe that these malevolent oni drown
    themselves in death and bloodshed in order to extinguish the last vestiges
    of the creatures they were before.
