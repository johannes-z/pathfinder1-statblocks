  - name: Death Throes (Su)

      When a dark creeper is slain, its body combusts in a flash of bright white
      light, leaving its gear in a heap ont he ground. All creatures within a
      10-foot burst must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d6
      rounds. Other dark creepesr within 10 feet are automatically blinded for
      at least 1 round,due to their light blindness. The save is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      Dark creepers are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally
      poisoning themselves. Dark creepers favor a foul-smelling black paste
      distilled from certain deep-underground fungi known as black smear. Black
      Smear-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2
      Str; cure 1 save.
  - name: Rag Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dark creeper's multiple layers of filthy rags function as leather armor
      when worn by one of their kind.
  - name: See in Darkness (Su)
    description: >-
      A dark creeper can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including that
      created by deeper darkness.
Description:
  - >-
    Dark creepers lurk in the black places deep below the surface of the world,
    venturing forth at night or into neighboring societies when the urge to
    steal and cause mayhem grows too great to resist. Endless layers of filthy,
    moldering black cloth shroud these small creatures, leading some to believe
    that the creature inside is smaller still. Usually encountered in groups,
    dark creepers flee from bright light, but are quite brave in the dark. Dark
    creepers stand just under 4 feet tall and weigh 80 pounds. Their flesh is
    pale and moist, and their eyes are milky white. Dark creepers exude a foul
    stench of sweat and spoiled food, owing primarily to the fact that they
    never take off their clothing-instead piling on new layers when the
    outermost one grows too ragged. For all the mayhem and trouble a pack of
    dark creepers can cause, this is nothing compared to the dangers a tribe led
    by the taller, even more sinister dark stalkers represents. Dark creepers
    treat their tall, lithe masters almost like gods, presenting them with
    offerings and obeying their every whim. Invariably, several dark stalkers
    serve as leaders to dark creeper tribes, with all of the tribe's heavy work
    and labor falling on the diminutive shoulders of the creepers, freeing the
    dark stalkers for their own decadent pleasures. Yet the dark creepers
    themselves see no inherent imbalance in this arrangement- to a dark creeper,
    a life in the servitude of a dark stalker is a life fulfilled. Dark Creeper
    Society It is known that subterranean cities of dark creepers exist. Most
    creatures that have seen these cities venture no closer than necessary, for
    the route to the city is often lined with traps, snares, and other deadly
    devices to detour would-be trespassers. Each city is a large circular pit
    with a spiraling staircase leading down to the multi-layered city. A dark
    creeper city is constantly shrouded in a cloud of impenetrable darkness. The
    actual habitat and details of dark creeper society remain a mystery, as
    those that have ventured into a dark creeper city have yet to return and
    tell of their exploits. It is believed that the race known as dark stalkers
    are the leaders of such cities. Dark Creeper Characters Dark creepers
