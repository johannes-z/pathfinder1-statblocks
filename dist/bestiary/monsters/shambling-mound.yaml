    description: >-
      Shambling mounds take no damage from electricity. Instead, any electricity
      attack used against a shambling mound temporarily increases its
      Constitution score by 1d4 points. The shambling mound loses these
      temporary points at the rate of 1 per hour.
Description:
  - >-
    Shambling mounds, also called shamblers, appear to be heaps of rotting
    vegetation. They are actually intelligent, carnivorous plants with a
    fondness for elf flesh in particular.
  - >-
    What serve as a shambler's brain and sensory organs are located in its upper
    body. Shambling mounds typically have an 8-foot girth and stand between 6
    and 9 feet tall. They weigh about 3,800 pounds.
  - >-
    Shambling mounds are strange creatures, more akin to animate tangles of
    creeping parasitic vines than single rooted plants. They are omnivorous,
    able to draw their sustenance from nearly anything, wrapping their creepers
    around living trees to draw forth the sap, sending rootlets into the soil to
    absorb raw nutrients, or consuming flesh and bone from crushed prey.
  - >-
    Shamblers are frighteningly stealthy in their native environments. Blending
    in with the surrounding terrain, they can lie in wait for days on end
    without moving, waiting patiently for a potential meal. A shambler could be
    almost anywhere at any time, attacking without warning and not caring
    whether it leaves any survivors, so long as it acquires its next meal.
  - >-
    Shambling mounds normally lead solitary, nomadic existences in deep forests
    and fetid swamps, although they can also be found underground living among
    damp fungal thickets. Disturbing rumors persist, however, of shamblers
    gathering in strange congregations around great earthen mounds in the depths
    of marshes and jungles, often during the height of violent electrical
    storms. Their reasons for doing so are unknown, and many sages have wondered
    whether there is some obscure and alien purpose at work.
