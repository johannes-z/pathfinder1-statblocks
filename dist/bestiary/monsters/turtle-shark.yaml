Description_Visual: >-
  From a distance this creature resembles a giant snapping turtle. It has a
  peaked and craggy shell from which protrude four long fins and a scowling head
  at the end of a long neck. Rather than a turtle's head, however, this
  creature's head has irrefutably shark-like features. It has round, black eyes
  and a gaping maw filled with rows of razor sharp teeth.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Capsize (Ex)
    description: >-
      A turtle-shark can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a
      charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the
      result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher.
      For each size category larger than the turtle-shark's size, it takes a
      cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.
  - name: Shell (Ex)
    description: >-
      If severely threatened, a turtle-shark can completely withdraw into its
      shell, leaving it almost completely impervious to attack. When withdrawn,
      a turtle-shark gains a +8 bonus to its Armor Class and a +4 bonus on
      Reflex saves.
Description:
  - >-
    A turtle-shark is a giant hybrid animal, which many think is a product of
    the same twisted magic that created the owlbear. These vicious marine
    predators have developed a taste for humanoid flesh, and routinely patrol
    shipping lanes in the hopes of making a tasty meal out of any sailor that
    has the extreme misfortune of falling overboard.
  - >-
    Much like a shark's, the teeth of a turtle-shark constantly replace
    themselves throughout the centuries-long life of the turtle-shark.
  - >-
    If the belly of a turtle-shark is cut open, it might contain the
    indigestible belongings of its previous meals.
  - Turtle-sharks average 20 feet in length and weigh about 10,000 pounds.
  - It shell is dark greenish-brown or dull green mottled with brown splotches.
