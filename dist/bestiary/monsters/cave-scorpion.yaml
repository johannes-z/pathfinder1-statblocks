Description:
  - >-
    The squat cave scorpion is quite well suited for life in caves. With its
    bulky armor, a cave scorpion at rest looks like a pile of stones. The cave
    scorpion's favorite food is dwarven meat, and when a cave scorpion finds a
    working dwarven mine, it can quickly become a major inconvenience.
  - Dwarven societies often post hefty bounties on cave scorpion stingers.
