      reduce person spell (the janni chooses when using the ability), except
      that the ability can work on the janni. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the
      effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a

    description: >-
      Jann can remain on the Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water for up to 48
      hours at a time. Failure to return to the Material Plane before that time
      expires causes a janni to take 1 point of damage per additional hour spent
      on the elemental plane, until it dies or returns to the Material Plane.
Description:
  - >-
    The jann (singular janni) are the weakest of the genies. Jann are formed out
    of all four elements and must therefore spend most of their time on the
    Material Plane. Some lore even casts the janni as the most "human" of the
    genie races, although most jann are quick to correct this insult, usually
    with the edge of a sword. A janni is human-sized, standing about 6 feet tall
    and weighing about 180 pounds. Jann are physically strong and courageous,
    and do not take kindly to insult or injury. Most are quite prone to seeing
    insult even when none is intended by the speaker. If overwhelmed in battle,
    they escape using flight and invisibility, returning later with
    reinforcements. Jann enjoy their privacy, preferring the solitude of the
    deep desert and isolated oases. They are usually suspicious of humans, but
    are often willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Jann have a strong
    cultural tradition of hospitality, and will never turn away someone in need
    of food, water, or shelter, though they might expect payment in the form of
    a favor at some later date. Among the other genie races, jann generally have
    good relations with both djinn and shaitans. While not actively enemies,
    jann dislike the proud and aloof marids. Jann have a distinct aversion to
    the efreet, who often try to enslave them or conscript them into their
    armies. A small percentage of jann are noble. Noble jann, often called
    sheikhs or amirs, have 9 Hit Dice, Strength 19, and Intelligence 18, and
    gain the following spell-like abilities: 3/day-augury, detect magic, and
    divination. A noble janni's caster level for its spell-like abilities is
    12th. Noble jann are CR 7.
