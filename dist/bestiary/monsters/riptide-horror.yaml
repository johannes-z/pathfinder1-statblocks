Description:
  - >-
    The terrifying riptide horror is a giant, sightless tubeworm found in sea
    caves or deep within desolate marshes. They are carnivorous creatures and
    have a voracious appetite that is only sated with meat, preferably that of
    warm-blooded humanoids or reptiles.
  - >-
    Opportunistic, ambush hunters, riptide horrors wait for prey to come to
    them. They can go several weeks without eating, and sometimes do, but if a
    meal is readily available, the horror does not hesitate to kill and devour
    it. Such a meal is placed in a "reserve" stomach-like sac. When the food
    supply is low, the riptide horror delves into its reserve and draws
    sustenance from the stored food.
  - >-
    Riptide horrors mate once a year, usually in flooded sea caves. The female
    crawls into the male's lair and deposits a sticky, greenish-tan mass of eggs
    on the wall of the cave. The male fertilizes the eggs and in 4 months, the
    eggs begin to hatch. Juveniles are excellent swimmers and leave the cave as
    soon as they hatch. As a riptide horror ages, its body secretes a substance
    that forms a shell-like carapace on its dorsal side.
  - >-
    Riptide horrors prefer to attack from ambush; sitting unmoving until
    potential prey moves within range. Often, they use their spider climb
    ability to cling to sea cave walls where their unsuspecting prey walks
    underneath them. Once prey wanders too close, the riptide horror lashes out
    with its tentacles and attempts to grab its meal. Grabbed foes are subjected
    to its paralytic poison and are bitten by its razor-sharp teeth.
