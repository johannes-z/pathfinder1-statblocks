  The lone female figure is clad in long, flowing grey robes and scarves which
  whip around her wildly even in the absence of a strong wind. Her head is
  covered by a wrapped veil, shielding her face from those who would see it.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Harbinger (Su)
    description: >-
      The appearance of a grey spirit is usually a harbinger of some future
      catastrophe, such as a great storm or a shipwreck. Such events occur
      within 1d6 days of the sighting of a grey spirit. Note that the grey
      spirit does not cause this catastrophe, rather she predicts it.
  - name: Ravages of Death Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Any living creature that sees the face of a grey spirit suddenly knows her
      pain, frustration, and rage, and has glimpse of the anguish of what it is
      like to die broken hearted. Any opponent experiencing this tragic emotion
      must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or be stunned for 2d6 rounds. A creature
      stunned by a grey spirit is wrought with despair, weeping and wailing
      uncontrollably. A calm emotions spell ends this effect. This is a
      mind-affecting effect A creature who succeeds on the save cannot be
      affected by the same grey spirit's gaze for one day. The save DC is
      Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the grey spirit's Ability
      Focus feat.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a grey spirit through simple
      combat: the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Even the most
      powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to
      permanently destroy a grey spirit is to confront her with irrefutable
      evidence of her loved one's death. The exact means varies with each spirit
      and may require a good deal of research, and should be created
      specifically for each different grey spirit by the GM.
Description:
  - >-
    Many a sailor who ventures out into the trackless sea is destined never to
    look again on the loved ones he left behind. Either death or the lure of
    foreign lands keeps them from returning to those who wait patiently for
    them. A grey spirit, usually female, is the shade of someone who died
    heartbroken and alone, pining away on shore and ultimately dying of a broken
    heart while waiting for the return of a loved one from across the sea.
  - >-
    A grey spirit attacks any creature that approaches her, her rage and
    frustration at having lost her loved one knowing no bounds. In melee, a grey
    spirit fails wildly with her ghostly arms and hands, screaming and cursing
    all the while. If an opponent proves to be particularly strong, a grey
    spirit pulls aside the cowl that covers her face.
