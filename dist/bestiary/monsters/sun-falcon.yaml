SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Radiance (Su)
    description: >-
      A sun falcon radiates heat and light with the intensity of the noonday
      sun. Creatures within 10 feet of a sun falcon must succeed at a DC 15
      Fortitude save each round or become fatigued. A sun falcon can suppress or
      activate its aura at will as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Blinding Flash (Su)
    description: >-
      By spreading its wings wide, a sun falcon can blast an intense wave of
      heat and light in a 20-foot cone as a standard action. All creatures
      within this area must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or take 1d6 points of
      fire damage and be blinded for 1d4+1 rounds. Creatures that succeed at
      this save take no fire damage and are instead dazzled for 1 round. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Sun falcons are birds of omen in Osirion, with a reputation that goes back
    to the days of the nation's most ancient gods. In many myths and stories,
    sun falcons act as the eyes of many deities, though most commonly for Ra,
    who considers these birds to be among his holy creatures on Golarion. Sun
    falcons seem to watch over important people and oversee noteworthy
    events-sometimes from far enough away to be mistaken as a star visible
    during the day, sometimes from close enough to appear as a second sun.
    Today, the ancient gods are largely forgotten, but sun falcons still
    gravitate toward Osirion's heroes and pharaohs, suggesting that these
    abandoned gods are not so distant.
  - >-
    A typical full-grown sun falcon weighs 2 to 3 pounds and measures 18 inches
    from beak to tail, with a wingspan approaching 5 feet.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Scholars believe that the brilliant plumage of sun falcons wasn't a natural
    or even a magical evolution so much as it was divine gift, granted by Ra in
    the first days of these favored birds' existence. Ancient papyrus scrolls
    and carvings found in ruins claim the ancient gods of Osirion desired a way
    to inform mortals they were being observed, and so Ra created the first sun
    falcons from common desert falcons, imbuing them with his power to shine as
    bright as the desert sun so as to be seen across the land. This divine gift
    suffuses every feather on their bodies. Individual lost or stolen feathers
    shed light as a candle for up to 7 days after being detached, and are often
    in high demand to accent elegant attire for the upper class.
  - >-
    Despite being creatures blessed with the heat of the sun, sun falcons are
    mortal and require normal sustenance to survive. To avoid reducing their
    captured prey to unpalatable ash, sun falcons vent gouts of fire from
    within, slowly lowering their body in temperature to a level that allows
    them to consume their meals without first incinerating them.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Sun falcons live deep within the deserts of Osirion, though they aren't
    unknown in Thuvia or even as far west as Rahadoum. They build nests atop
    rocky outcroppings from gravel, pebbles, and shards of metal capable of
    withstanding their natural heat, but often abandon their nests only months
    after creation. How long a particular nest has been inhabited can be
    identified by the darkness of the rocks it is made from. The stones from
    particularly well-used nests may even have begun to fuse together from the
    heat, and are typically lined with crude glass formed from melted desert
    sand. Some enterprising folk collect these abandoned nests wherever they can
    be found, and sell them in bazaars throughout the desert lands. But as a
    typical sun falcon may build dozens if not hundreds of these nests over the
    course of its life, only the most heavily used or otherwise impressive nests
    have any real value.
  - >-
    So long as a sun falcon remains in a particular nest, it ranges for hundreds
    of miles in search of prey, primarily desert rodents and other small birds,
    though they have occasionally been known to attack much larger prey. When
    fighting anything larger than itself, it begins the attack by making several
    passes close overhead, relying on its inborn radiance to scorch and exhaust
    its prey before diving in for the killing blow.
  - >-
    Sun falcons are only aggressive when hunting or provoked. Most often, this
    provocation comes from opportunistic profiteers searching for abandoned
    nests or molted feathers. An aggravated sun falcon takes to the sky, and
    over the course of several days it might attack everything it sees-stranding
    travelers, setting caravans ablaze, and even drying up oases in its rage.
    When fighting, a sun falcon usually opens combat with its blinding flash
    ability to confound its victim's senses. Following this initial attack, the
    sun falcon keeps its distance and uses its breath weapon. It then uses Flyby
    Attack to strafe its target and remain out of the creature's grasp. If its
    fiery attacks don't seem to affect its victim, the sun falcon disengages
    from the fight and moves on.
  - >-
    Sun falcons have few natural predators, and they are canny enough to easily
    avoid most mundane hunters. Their ability to fly protects them from most
    desert predators, and their natural talents with heat and fire help them
    fend off any other foolish creatures. The biggest threat to sun falcons
    comes from efreet who walk the deserts of northern Garund. Immune to many of
    the sun falcons' attacks, efreet hunt sun falcons for sport as if they were
    common pheasants, dining on the creatures and using their radiant plumage as
    decorations on their clothing and armor.
  - >-
    The mating habits of sun falcons have long confounded scholars, as every
    member of the species ever examined has been a mature female, carrying a
    single already fertilized egg. Because of the birds' association with Ra,
    some postulate that these eggs are divinely fertilized, though sun falcons
    are capable of breeding with males of other falcon species, and the result
    of these unions is always a baby sun falcon. This method of reproduction
    creates slight variations in the appearance of offspring, but the creatures'
    abilities are the same.
  - >-
    A sun falcon lays these eggs on an annual cycle, and each bird has its own
    cycle. It takes approximately a month for an egg to hatch once it has been
    laid, and a chick reaches full maturity after only 2 months. Sun falcons are
    often born already capable of flight. Until the chick matures, it hunts
    alongside its mother as she teaches the fledgling vital skills. After
    reaching maturity, the young sun falcon departs into the desert to build its
    first nest and begin its own cycle.
  - >-
    The only exceptions to this rule are when a sun falcon bonds to another
    creature. The subject of this bond is typically a humanoid who is suspected
    to have some great destiny in store. A sun falcon doesn't live with its
    bonded creature or even have much direct contact, but it keeps nearby,
    flying above the village or city the person lives in or trailing the person
    in her travels if she happens to be a desert nomad or leaves her native
    lands. This bonding process has proven flawed as often as not in the current
    Age of Lost Omens-though the falcon follows this creature for the remainder
    of its life, the bonded person is no more likely to have a great future in
    store for him then might any other. While some skeptics claim that those who
    believe this legend grant such chosen individuals more chances than they
    would otherwise receive, artificially inf lating their chance of success,
    others' beliefs also result in unrealistic expectations that these "blessed"
    individuals constantly fail to meet, which can lead them to instead despair
    or be rejected by the public.
