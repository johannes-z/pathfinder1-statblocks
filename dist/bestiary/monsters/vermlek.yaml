Description_Visual: >-
  A corpulent man reels on his feet as if drunk, but a closer inspection reveals
  the horrific truth-he's not so much reeling as he is seething from within, as
  if his internal organs were coiling and writhing like a knot of greased
  snakes. Suddenly, with a hideous retching and tearing sound, the man's face
  blooms out like a rotten flower and a pallid, five-jawed worm extrudes itself
  from the ragged hole in the neck where, only a moment before, a head sat.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Abandon Flesh (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a vermlek can abandon an inhabited body, crawling
      hideously out of its host and leaving behind an empty sack of skin and
      bits of gristle. In so doing, it absorbs much of the body's flesh to heal
      itself, restoring 2d6+3 hit points. A vermlek cannot later reclaim this
      body with its inhabit body ability.
  - name: Flesh Armor (Su)
    description: >-
      When a vermlek wears a humanoid body (see inhabit body, below), it treats
      the dead flesh and muscle as armor and gains a +3 armor bonus to its AC.
  - name: Inhabit Body (Su)
    description: >-
      A vermlek can crawl into the body of any dead Medium humanoid, consuming
      and replacing the bulk of the humanoid's skeleton and internal organs as
      it does so. This process takes 1d4 rounds for the vermlek to complete,
      during which it is considered flat-footed. Once the process is complete,
      the vermlek appears for all practical purposes to be a living but
      hideously obese version of the previous humanoid-it gains a +8 racial
      bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a normal humanoid while wearing a
      dead body in this manner, but does not gain any of the abilities that the
      dead creature possessed in life, including natural attacks, unusual
      movement types, or bonuses to natural armor. It loses its own burrow speed
      while inhabiting a body, but gains the ability to wield weapons or wear
      armor shaped for humanoids (although note that the armor bonus granted by
      wearing armor does not stack with the bonus granted by the vermlek's flesh
      armor ability).
  - name: Negative Energy Affinity (Ex)
    description: >-
      A vermlek is healed by negative energy and harmed by positive energy as if
      it were an undead creature.
Description:
  - >-
    The hideous vermlek demon is one of the lower-ranking members of the demon
    race, barely above the dretch in power but remarkably more ambitious and
    intelligent than its pudgy lesser kin. They wriggle and crawl in nauseating
    numbers in many Abyssal battlefields or graveyards, impatiently awaiting a
    chance to find a humanoid body to inhabit. Outside of a host body, a vermlek
    appears like a fatheaded worm with four long tails, each of which ends in a
    wriggling nest of long filaments. In this form, the vermlek cannot wield
    weapons, and its bite and spell-like abilities are its only offensive
    options. A typical vermlek is 7 feet long (with its filaments giving it a
    further 3 feet of length) and weighs 90 pounds.
  - >-
    Ecology Vermleks form from the souls of those who habitually violated the
    dead in life, such as graverobbers, necromancers, and necrophiles.
  - >-
    On the Abyss, the vermleks are countless in number. A single sinful soul can
    spawn dozens if not hundreds of these demons in much the same way that the
    body the soul leaves behind spawns maggots. A newly formed vermlek can flop
    and writhe through the stinking Abyssal necropolises and swamps and
    boneyards for eons before it finds a body to inhabit, but it's much more
    common for a vermlek to be "harvested" by a more powerful demon for use in a
    battle. Vermleks harvested in this manner are carried in huge steel cages on
    the backs of enormous fiendish beasts of burden, such as retrievers, and
    either sold to powerful Material Plane spellcasters or used in battle
    against humanoid foes. The classic use for vermleks in such cases is to open
    the cages containing the worm demons after an initial skirmish or battle so
    that they can slither out onto the battlefield and claim bodies from the
    dead, thus recycling the carrion for use in the next battle to come. As
    vermleks can only inhabit the bodies of humanoids, this tactic isn't as
    common on the Abyss (where demons typically fight themselves or other
    outsiders), but in regions of Golarion where demons hold sway, such as the
    Worldwound or Tanglebriar, their use can be a particularly demoralizing form
    of psychological combat.
  - >-
    The process by which a vermlek inhabits and controls a dead humanoid is
    partially biological, partially necromantic.
  - >-
    A vermlek's body is boneless and exceptionally elastic-it can wriggle into a
    body through the mouth, a wound, or any other opening in less than a minute,
    eating the bones and organs within with noisy rapidity. It then settles into
    the cavity thus created, extending its four tails down into the torso and
    eventually into the hollowed arms and legs of its host, whereupon the
    filaments at the tips of these tails weave through nerves and muscle like a
    puppet's strings.
  - >-
    The vermlek can immediately use the body to move about, wield weapons,
    speak, and otherwise interact with society.
  - >-
    The creature can control the coiling and wriggling of its body to keep its
    host appearing humanoid, but it can do little about the size of its
    body-humanoids inhabited by a vermlek always look hideously obese. Worse,
    the host body, which remains dead, rots normally-a vermlek that does not
    maintain its body's freshness with gentle repose must abandon the rotting
    flesh 7 days after inhabiting it to seek out a new host.
  - >-
    Vermleks know that a keen eye that peers into the mouth of a host can
    quickly undo their deceptions, and as a result they tend to mutter or mumble
    when speaking to keep from opening their mouths too wide. Many use veils,
    helms, or scarves to hide their mouths. When confronted in combat, though, a
    vermlek in a host body quickly abandons its disguise, extending its hideous
    worm head out through the host's mouth to give itself a secondary bite
    attack-doing so ruins the host body for further disguise purposes.
  - >-
    Habitat & Society Vermleks can often be found at the sites of vast
    battlefields on the Abyss where wars with humanoids (fiendish, celestial, or
    otherwise) have occurred. These sites are particularly common on Kurnugia,
    where the fiendish gnolls of Lamashtu constantly bicker and war with one
    another, and on Ishiar, where the fiendish human pirates and scoundrels that
    dwell upon that ocean's islands wage eternal war. These demons generally
    spawn in Abyssal realms like Everglut, Uligor, and the Spiral Path, where
    demon lords associated with the dead or worms rule, and they can be found in
    great number in those regions' vast graveyards and necropolises.
  - >-
    Although they are often used as disposable infantry in mass battles,
    vermleks themselves have little taste for such activities and, left to their
    own desires, prefer to live in hiding among humanoids on the Material Plane
    if they can find their way into that realm. A vermlek fortunate enough to
    find itself on the Material Plane enjoys disguising itself as a laborer,
    gravedigger, dungsweeper, or any other lowclass role in which it can blend
    in while still having access to the city's dead. A vermlek's ghoulish and
    taboo lusts are only magnified by its creation, and on the Material Plane,
    the arrival of one of these filthy demons in a society almost always
    presages a sudden upswing in scandalously violent or distasteful crime.
