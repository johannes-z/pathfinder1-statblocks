Description_Visual: >-
  This creature stands at least 20 feet tall with a huge, muscular body. Its
  massive arms and legs end in wicked claws. Its rounded, squat head, sits atop
  an extremely thick, almost nonexistent neck. The creature's gaping maw is
  filled with sharp fangs. Two large swept back horns jut from its head just
  above its rounded eyes.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Confusion (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by that
      choronzon's aura of confusion for one day. Other demons are immune to the
      choronzon's aura of confusion. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a choronzon can breathe forth a cone of bluish gas
      in a 40-foot cone. The gas lingers in the area for 1d2 rounds before
      dispersing. A creature killed by a choronzon's breath weapon has its body
      break apart into its individual protons, neutrons, and electrons.
      Creatures killed in this manner can only be restored to life by a miracle,
      wish, or true resurrection spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Choronzons are the demons of confusion, dispersion, and ultimate chaos. They
    are huge behemoths seemingly bred for war and battle, though most rarely
    take part in the Abyssal wars that rage between the planes. Choronzons
    prefer to use their talents on weak-minded creatures such as those that
    inhabit the Material planes, and as such, they are usually encountered
    there. These demons derive great pleasure in laying waste to villages and
    towns and even small kingdoms (if the mood strikes them).
  - >-
    Amongst demonkind, choronzons are both feared and hated. A great enmity
    exists between balors and choronzons that scholars and lorekeepers can
    document, but cannot determine the source of the hatred between these two
    demonic races.
  - A choronzon stands about 20 feet tall and weighs about 9,000 pounds.
  - >-
    Its scaly flesh is bluish-black and its eyes are crimson. Its horns are
    darker than the rest of its body and the creature's claws are pitch black.
    Its teeth are dull ivory in color.
  - >-
    A choronzon begins combat by surrounding itself with its aura of confusion
    and then unleashing its breath weapon at its foes. Creatures surviving
    either attack are subjected to its word of chaos. Opponents that continue to
    press the battle are met with a mix of physical attacks and spell-like
    abilities. When it uses its Power Attack feat, a choronzon usually takes a
    -8 penalty on its attack rolls in order to gain a +8 bonus on its damage
    rolls.
