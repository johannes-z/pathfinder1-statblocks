Description:
  - >-
    Sandlings are creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth. A sandling in its
    natural form resembles a mound of sand that covers a 10-foot area.
  - >-
    They are most often summoned to the Material Plane by clerics and wizards,
    though on occasion a sandling slips through a vortex connecting the
    Elemental Plane of Earth to the Material Plane. Sandlings live on a diet of
    minerals only and cannot digest plants, herbs, meat, or other substances.
    Opponents killed by a sandling are left for scavengers.
  - >-
    Sandlings have no real society and are highly solitary in nature. Though
    they harbor no ill-will towards others of their kind, it is very rare to
    find more than one sandling operating near another. Reproduction methods
    among sandlings is unknown to sages but it is believed they create others of
    their kind by division (that is, an adult sandling splits into two or more
    smaller creatures).
  - >-
    A sandling lies in wait in its natural form until it detects an interloper
    in its territory. It then assumes its serpentine form and attacks with an
    abrasive bite.
  - >-
    A typical sandling is 10 feet long but can grow to a length of 20 to 25
    feet.
