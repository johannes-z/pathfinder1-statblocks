Description_Visual: >-
  This creature resembles a man-sized cylinder covered in metallic scales.  It
  sports three large "fins" spaced even around its circumference.  Between each
  fin is a metal sheath from which slide long claw-like arms.  A large hole in
  the front of its cylindrical body is lined with many small curved metallic
  teeth and seems to function as its mouth.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Earth Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A khargra can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of
      earth, including metal, as easily as a fish swims through water. Its
      burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple
      or other signs of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area
      containing a burrowing khargra flings the khargra back 30 feet, stunning
      the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save.
  - name: Rend Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a khargra hits with a bite attack, it deals normal bite damage and
      pulls apart any metal armor worn by its foe. This attack deals 2d8+2
      points of damage to the opponent's armor. Creatures wearing no armor or
      non-metal armor are unaffected by this special attack (though they still
      take normal bite damage). Armor reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed and
      devoured by the khargra. Damaged armor gains the broken condition.
  - name: Sundering Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A khargra can making a sunder attempt with its bite attack against an
      opponent's weapon or shield without provoking attacks of opportunity.
      Resolve this using the normal rules for a sunder attempt. If the khargra
      succeeds on its CMB roll, it deals 2d8+2 points of damage to the weapon or
      shield. Note, against a khargra, a weapon or shield's hardness is only
      one-half as effective as normal. This means that a light steel shield, for
      example, is considered to have a hardness of 5 rather than 10 against a
      khargra's sunder attack. A weapon or shield reduced to 0 or less hit
      points is destroyed and half of it is swallowed by the khargra. It only
      uses this special attack against metal weapons and shields. Damaged armor
      and weapons gain the broken condition.
  - name: Vulnerabilities (Ex)
    description: >-
      A khargra takes maximum damage from a heat metal spell (no save). A
      transmute metal to wood deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level
      (maximum 20d6) to a khargra. It can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC
      17 + caster's ability modifier) to reduce the damage by half.
Description:
  - >-
    Khargras are native to the Elemental Plane of Earth and are usually only
    encountered on the Material Plane when summoned. On occasion, a khargra
    slips through a tear in the planar fabric and enters the Material Plane to
    digest ores and metals not normally found on its native plane.
  - >-
    A khargra is a 5-foot long cylinder and weighs about 300 pounds. It is
    believed that khargras speak (or at least understand) Terran and Common, but
    no one is certain as communication with these creatures has always failed.
  - >-
    Khargras attack from ambush, preferring to wait just inside the wall of a
    dungeon or corridor and springing out when prey passes nearby. The khargra
    attempts to grab and devour any metal objects within the area.
  - Nonmetallic objects may be bitten, but not devoured.
