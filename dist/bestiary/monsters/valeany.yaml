SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Embrace (Su)
    description: >-
      A valeany that grapples and pins a foe deals 1d4 points of Strength damage
      to the target each round the pin is maintained.
  - name: Mark (Su)
    description: >-
      A valeany can "mark" an opponent that instills distrust in all animals. No
      animal, wild or domesticated, approaches within 30 feet of a marked foe;
      if forced to do so, the creature panics and remains so as long as it's
      within 30 feet of the target. The mark can be removed by a break
      enchantment or dispel magic (the latter of which must be cast by a
      spellcaster whose caster level is equal to or higher than the valeany's
      Hit Dice). Dryads, druids, and valeanys can sense a marked creature within
      60 feet. Nature's
  - name: Empathy (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy class feature, except the
      valeany has a +4 racial bonus on the check. The valeany's effective druid
      level is equal to her Hit Dice for determining her total modifier to the
      check.
Description:
  - >-
    The valeany or "forest girl" is thought to be distantly related to the dryad
    and nymph. She makes her home deep in a secluded area of a forest, not far
    from civilized areas perhaps but secluded enough that it is away from prying
    eyes. Valeanys are free-spirited creatures that enjoy games, frivolity, and
    nature. They are often found in the company of dryads, nymphs, sirines, and
    elves.
  - >-
    A valeany appears as a comely human female with long flowing golden hair
    that nearly reaches the ground. The eyes of a valeany are a deep golden blue
    or brown. Skin color ranges from light golden to dark tan. The valeany wears
    either lightly colored and lightweight gowns or nothing at all.
  - >-
    Valeany, like their cousins the dryad and nymph, are not combatants. They
    seek to avoid combat when possible, unless they themselves, their homes, or
    their allies are threatened or harmed. Most often, a valeany uses its
    spell-like abilities to slip away from battle as soon as possible, marking
    its enemies as it does so.
  - >-
    If forced into combat, a valeany fights using its spell-like abilities and
    embrace. Incapacitated or weakened foes are left where they fall.
