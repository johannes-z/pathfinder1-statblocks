Description:
  - >-
    The lynx is a member of the great cat family and makes its home in the
    colder regions of the world, most often in rocky areas above the tree line.
  - Lynxes are generally solitary creatures and are excellent climbers.
  - >-
    The lynx, like other big cats, is territorial and a solitary hunter. Most of
    its hunting is done during the daylight hours, though some species of lynx
    hunts only at night. Its diet generally consists of small animals such as
    rodents, birds, fish, and rabbits. During the winter months its diet
    includes larger prey such as elk or deer. Prey that is killed is partially
    eaten and the remaining carcass is buried in thick underbrush or snow. The
    lynx returns over a period of 1d6 days to finish its meal.
  - >-
    Lynxes are generally solitary creatures, but occasionally a den is
    discovered that contains a male, female and 1d6 cubs. Cubs are generally
    ineffective and non-threatening in combat. Cubs are sometimes captured and
    sold on the market where they can be trained and raised.

    A lynx has thick, gray fur that is spotted, striped, or plain. During the
    winter months through the summer months, its coat varies from spotted to
    plain. Its short tail is ringed and tipped with black fur. Its pointed ears
    are tipped with tufts of long black hairs and its eyes range from green to
    gray to brown. Its paws are large and covered with thick fur. This helps the
    lynx distribute its weight when moving across snowy terrain. The average
    lynx is 2 1/2 feet to 4 feet long and weighs 20-40 pounds.
  - >-
    Lynxes stalk their prey and prefer to strike from ambush. They primarily use
    their bite attack in combat, only relying on their claws if they must.
  - >-
    A lynx goes for the "kill shot" at first opportunity against its quarry,
    attempting to sink its teeth into its opponent's throat.

    Caracal The caracal is a small cat, very similar to the lynx, and is
    commonly referred to as the desert lynx (even though it doesn't live in
    desert regions). The caracal uses the statistics for the lynx, but is found
    in warm or temperate plains and hills and does not have the snow move
    ability of the standard lynx.
