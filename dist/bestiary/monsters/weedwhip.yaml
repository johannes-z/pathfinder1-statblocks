      Since a weedwhip looks like a normal plant when at rest, a successful DC
      15 Perception check is required to notice it before it attacks for the
      first time. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use
      either of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant.
  - name: Dig In (Ex)
    description: >-
      A weedwhip can bury its central bulb in earth or sand as a move action,
      granting it partial cover against all attacks (Pathfinder RPG Core
      Rulebook 196), but preventing it from moving. It can extract itself from
      the ground as a move action.

    description: >-
      A weedwhip's tentacles don't threaten any squares, and doesn't make
      attacks of opportunity.

      Any creature that attacks a weedwhip with a natural piercing or slashing

Description:
  - >-
    A weedwhip is an animate plant that rarely attacks unless provoked. Its
    unpleasant smell (reminiscent of decomposing fish) and tendency to sprout in
    any passable soil makes it a nuisance to farmers and settlers. Those who
    don't know of the weedwhip's dangers quickly fall prey to this plant once
    they target it for culling. Farmers have to deal with it in croplands and
    orchards, groundskeepers find it climbing walls like ivy, druids spot it
    encroaching on sacred groves, and even cave dwellers find it growing in dung
    heaps. Animals don't eat it because of its stench and poison, and fire is a
    risky way to destroy it because the weed mixes with other plants or wraps
    around trees or buildings. A mature plant consists of a torso-sized bulb
    with small, ambulatory roots and three large, lashing vines, each as long as
    a whip, with blade-like thorns that secrete an irritating toxin. When the
    weedwhip is blooming, the bulb is crowned with a large flower and its scent
    is especially strong, often attracting pollinating flies. In rocky areas
    lacking suitable soil, a weedwhip can root itself in a corpse, leading some
    adventurers to think it prefers feeding on dead bodies or plants seeds in
    its kills, but it does so only in extreme circumstances.
