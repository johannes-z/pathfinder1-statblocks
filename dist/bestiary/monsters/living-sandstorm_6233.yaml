SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A living sandstorm can shift between its humanoid form, shaped from packed
      sand, and a sandstorm form as a standard action. In sandstorm form, a
      living sandstorm functions as if it were a swarm of Fine creatures with a
      hive mind, and it loses its burrow speed, slam attacks, and compression
      abilities, but gains a fly speed and the ability to use its create sand
      and sand blast abilities. Its Strength score is reduced to 1, but its
      ability scores are otherwise unchanged. A living sandstorm remains in one
      form until it chooses to assume its other form. A change in form can't be
      dispelled, nor does the living sandstorm revert to any particular form
      when killed (both shapes are its true form). A true seeing spell reveals
      both forms simultaneously.
  - name: Sandsight (Ex)
    description: >-
      The living sandstorm can see through sand, dust, and other particles in
      the air as if the air were clear, ignoring the miss chance for these
      obstructions, up to its normal range of vision.
  - name: Slashing Sand (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living sandstorm's swarm attack deals slashing damage. Its slam attacks
      deal bludgeoning and slashing damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Notorious for appearing suddenly out of the roiling tempests of the deep
    desert, living sandstorms are capable of turning oases and dry farmlands
    into areas of featureless desert in a shockingly short span of time. When
    angered, they can scour a whole army down to bits of shining metal and bone
    buried under feet of shifting sand over the course of one terrible night.
    Some Osiriani scholars claim that living sandstorms are related to the
    deadly khamsin storms that scour the desert, and while these creatures are
    related to elementals, they have nothing to do with the formation of those
    iconic storms. Living sandstorms are most comfortable when sand is free to
    flow across the earth. They become agitated whenever creatures make an
    effort to remove or limit sand in an area, shelter an area from the drifting
    dust, or alter the weather to reduce or prevent sandstorms. However, they
    are curious creatures and enjoy experiencing new interactions with beings of
    other shapes, and are willing to parley when they believe doing so may open
    the door to a novel diversion-or if a creature simply appears easy to
    intimidate.
  - >-
    A living sandstorm in its humanoid shape is about 6 feet tall and weighs 900
    pounds. In sandstorm form, it expands its form into a pulsing cloud of
    streaming, loose sand, which gathers into small clumps before being
    reabsorbed into the storm.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Living sandstorms are formed from and fed by the unpredictable interaction
    of raw elemental earth and planar storms or vortices carrying the essence of
    other planes. These ageless elemental creatures tend to be curious and
    outgoing when they first discover new places, but are easily frustrated by
    any kind of restraint. They use their ability to create sand liberally,
    attempting to pack caves, voids in the Plane of Earth, and other open areas
    at least half-full of their reddish sand. Because of their origin, they are
    usually found near gates, portals, and vortices between planes both on the
    Plane of Earth and on the Material Plane.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Living sandstorms dwell in the rare open caverns on the Plane of Earth. On
    that plane, they are misfits, feared for their affinities for open spaces
    and howling winds. When conflicts erupt between the powers of the Elemental
    Planes, they are sometimes recruited to lead strike teams into other planes,
    as they are adventurous and enjoy discovering open spaces they can fill with
    their fine, red sand. They are especially valuable when establishing
    beachheads on planes that have little in the way of earth, because of their
    ability to create large amounts of sand in relatively short periods of time.
  - >-
    Due to their intrepidness, they readily answer callings to serve summoners
    so they can visit new places and spread their sand far and wide. If they see
    an opportunity to do so, they may break free of their calling and explore
    the wider Material Plane, where they favor desert climes and their nearby
    regions, and where they are known to contribute to rapid desertification.
    When marooned on the Material Plane, they are generally restless until they
    find a way back to the Plane of Earth, but if they know of a route home,
    they instead explore the nearby area, wandering farther and farther until
    they lose interest in filling that world with sand and long to move on to a
    new one.
