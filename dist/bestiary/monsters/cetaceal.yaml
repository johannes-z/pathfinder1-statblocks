SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Protective Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability
      provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving
      throws to anyone within 20 feet of the cetaceal. Otherwise, it functions
      as a magic circle against evil effect and a lesser globe of
      invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals
      cetaceal's HD). The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in
      the above stat block.
  - name: Shockwave (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a cetaceal can release a 100-footradius burst of energy. All
      creatures in the area take 17d6 damage; half of this damage is cold, and
      half is electricity (DC 25 Reflex save halves). The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Stun (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature moved by a cetaceal's push attack must make a DC 25 Fortitude
      saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. The DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Cetaceals are great waterdwelling agathions who swim the planar seas and
    commune with the creatures of the deeps.
  - >-
    Rarely seen by landwalkers, they defend the waters against aquatic evils
    such as aboleths. Their spirits usually were those of great mortal leaders
    of aquatic or coastal tribes, or good folk who died underwater serving some
    great cause, reborn in a celestial form that is part humanoid, part orca.
    They are social beings and develop close friendships with other celestials
    and marine creatures.
  - >-
    A cetaceal is 8 feet long and weighs 400 pounds, although some grow quite a
    bit larger than that.
