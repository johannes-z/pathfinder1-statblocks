SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Su)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect one
      chosen by the xacarba from three options; cure 2 consecutive saves. The
      save DC is Constitution-based. Fiendish Bile: effect 1d4 Str damage
      (good-aligned creatures also take 2d8 points of damage). Mysterious Blood:
      effect 1d4 Dex and 1d4 Wis damage plus confusion for 1 round. Vile
      Disjunction: effect targeted greater dispel magic (CL 18th) on the
      creature.
  - name: Redirect Spell (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature that attempts to cast a spell within 30 feet of a xacarba
      must cast the spell defensively. If the caster fails the concentration
      check to do so (or if the caster opts to not cast defensively), the
      xacarba can choose the target of the spell as an immediate action. The new
      target must be a legal target-if there's no legal alternative target to
      choose from, this ability cannot be used.
Description:
  - >-
    Fiends hailing from the darkest reaches of the Abyss, xacarbas are
    manipulation and destruction intertwined. With their infamous ability to
    redirect spells, these serpentine goliaths wreak havoc on the mind as well
    as the body, turning allies against one another and reveling in the
    destruction doing so produces.
