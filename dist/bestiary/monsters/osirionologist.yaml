Description:
  - >-
    An Osirionologist is a scholar who specializes in the study of Ancient
    Osirion. Because this lost civilization accomplished wonders unmatched by
    current magical and engineering knowledge and did so very suddenly after a
    starkly primitive beginning, many Osirionologists- including scholars,
    collectors, and power-hungry magical researchers from Andoran, Cheliax,
    Absalom, Osirion, Qadira, Katapesh, and beyond-obsess over discovering how
    these wonders came about.
  - >-
    Osirionologists are often amenable to working with Pathfinders exploring the
    ruins of Ancient Osirion as long as they feel their academic agendas are
    respected. They also work as hired experts for the Aspis Consortium so they
    can undertake otherwise unaffordable expeditions. Naturally, most
    Osirionologists place their own motivations above those of their allies, and
    can be trusted only so long as they are moving toward their goals.
