SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Brachiation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A decapus can move through trees at its base climb speed (30 feet per
      round) by using its tentacles to swing from tree to tree. Trees used by
      the decapus in this manner can be no further than 10 feet apart.
  - name: Sound Imitation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A decapus can mimic any creature it has previously encountered with near
      total accuracy, though it cannot mimic humanoid speech longer than two or
      three words at a time. A DC 13 Will save detects the ruse. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - Decapi are solitary creatures that dwell in dense forests or underground.
  - >-
    Most prefer the forests as their ability to move among the trees allows them
    to either pursue their prey or flee in situations not to their advantage.
  - >-
    On the ground, decapi are slow-moving, thus they spend most of their time
    among the tree tops.
  - >-
    Decapi are nocturnal hunters and are quite fond of human, elf, and halfling
    flesh. In times when food is scarce, they exist on a diet of rats, snakes,
    and other small forest creatures (or dungeon denizens in the case of the
    subterranean decapus).
  - >-
    Decapi prefer a solitary life; the only time more than one will ever be
    encountered together is during mating season (usually the fall). Young
    decapi are born live, and the female only ever gives birth to a single young
    during each mating season. If food is extremely scarce, some decapus females
    have been known to eat their young.
  - >-
    This creature's body is a 4-foot diameter globe of pallid green. On rare
    occasions, a purple or even yellow hued decapus may be encountered.
  - >-
    Patches of dark hair, brown or black, grow in various locations. Regardless
    of its body color, each decapus has 10 octopus-like tentacles protruding
    from its spherical body. Each tentacle is covered in suction cups that aid
    the creature in not only climbing and moving through trees, but also in
    holding on to its prey. Its large wide maw sports sickly yellow teeth and
    foul breath.
  - >-
    Decapi seem to be able to speak with others of their kind using a series of
    guttural noises.
