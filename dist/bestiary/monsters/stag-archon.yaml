Description_Visual: >-
  This stag-headed humanoid has large, sweeping antlers and wields a
  finely-crafted longbow.
Group: Archon
Source: Inner Sea Gods
IsTemplate: '0'
Description:
  - >-
    A stag archon looks like a well-muscled human with the head of a horned
    deer, typically an elk or stag.
  - >-
    They prefer to use their bows in battle, though they are comfortable
    charging antlers-first into melee as well.
  - >-
    Each was created from the spirit of a mortal hero of Erastil's faith,
    hand-picked by the god to aid his followers in the world and defend some of
    the Outer Sphere's least tamed wildernesses. Though none remember the
    specifics of their mortal lives, they retain the skills of trained woodland
    warriors. Most are more practical than hound archons, willing to kill evil
    mortals if doing so is necessary to protect the innocent.
  - Stag archons are experienced trackers and scouts.
  - >-
    Occasionally Erastil sends one to look after a specific village or
    farmstead, particularly in a dangerous frontier area.
  - >-
    They watch in animal form, luring lost children to safety and leading hungry
    hunters to easily-caught prey. They have a deep-seated hatred of cold riders
    and other evil fey, and they gather in great numbers to pursue and take down
    those defilers of the wilderness.
  - >-
    A stag archon typically stands about 6-1/2 feet tall (a foot or more taller
    than that with its horns) and weighs around 220 pounds.
