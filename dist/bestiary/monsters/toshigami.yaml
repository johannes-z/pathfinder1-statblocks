SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Touch of Ages (Su)
    description: >-
      When a toshigami hits a target with a touch attack or any melee weapon,
      the target must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save to avoid being magically
      aged. When a toshigami strikes a foe, it must decide whether it wishes to
      physically increase the target's age or mentally reduce the target's age.
      If it increases the target's physical age, the target takes 1 point of
      Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution drain. If it decreases the target's
      mental age, the target takes 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
      drain. Combined with the toshigami's numerous attacks, this can quickly
      devastate a target, but once a target succeeds at its saving throw against
      the touch of ages, it can no longer be affected by this ability for 1
      round. This is a magical aging effect, but does not actually alter the
      victim's true age-it merely simulates the creeping effect of age on the
      flesh or the reversion to an increasingly infantile state of mind. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Toshigami, known also as blossom kami, are associated with cherry
    trees-particularly those that grow in inhabited areas. Often, long after a
    city has fallen to ruin, these kami guardians are all that remain to
    remember the lost city's glory. In this way, the toshigami are also
    associated with the passing of time.
  - >-
    Toshigami rarely show themselves except to those in dire need or who are
    harming their trees. Still, they have a fascination with mortals, and have
    even been known to form romantic relationships with them on occasion. A
    toshigami is 5 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.
