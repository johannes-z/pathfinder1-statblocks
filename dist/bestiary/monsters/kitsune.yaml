    Wily but noble, kitsune are a race of shapechanging fox-folk. Each Kitsune
    has two shapes-a slender and attractive human form and its true form of an
    anthropomorphic fox. In either form, it displays physical grace and natural
    beauty. Most kitsune have ruddy, auburn fur and salient amber or pale blue
    eyes, though some are born with black, gray, or even white fur. White-furred
    kitsune are revered for their close connection to their spirit ancestors and
    typically raised as oracles. Quick-witted and nimble, kitsune delight in the
    creative arts, particularly riddles, storytelling, pranks, and tall tales,
    and have garnered a well-deserved reputation and duplicitous tricksters.
    They are a good-natured folk and greatly value friendship. When encountered
    outside human settlements, kitsune tend to live in small and remote villages
    run by elders of ancestral clans. In human settlements, kitsune usually
    remain in human form to avoid conf lict.
