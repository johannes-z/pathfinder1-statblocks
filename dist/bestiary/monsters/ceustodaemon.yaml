Description_Visual: >-
  This brown, shaggy-furred beast stands on slate grey hooves. Its head
  resembles that of a maniacal horned ape.
Group: Daemon
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 2
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Drawn to Service (Su)
    description: >-
      When brought to another plane with a planar binding or planar ally spell
      (or any similar calling effect), ceustodaemons take a -5 penalty on the
      initial Will save and on their Charisma check to refuse service.
      Ceustodaemons also take a -5 penalty on saves against binding, planar
      binding, and other spells designed to bind a creature to a particular
      plane as long as the daemon is commanded to serve as a guardian for a
      single area or small complex.
Description:
  - >-
    Some claim the Four Horsemen created these creatures to serve as summoning
    fodder. Others believe that they form from neutral evil souls who commit
    suicide. Wherever the truth lies, ceustodaemons find themselves on the
    Material Plane more often than any other daemon, as they are easily
    pressured into service-many call these creatures "guardian daemons" as a
    result. Yet in the back of their wicked minds, ceustodaemons always think
    about escaping their bonds and ripping to shreds the ones who summoned them.
  - Greater and lesser versions of these creatures exist.
  - >-
    These variants can be represented by applying either the young creature or
    advanced creature simple templates, along with the following adjustments.
  - >-
    Lesser Ceustodaemon: This Medium daemon looks like a horned frog with a
    wide, toothy mouth. Its breath weapon is a chilling cone of ice that deals
    cold damage.
  - >-
    Greater Ceustodaemon: This daemon resembles a gigantic humanoid bear with
    the talons of an eagle and curling ram horns sprouting from its head. Its
    breath weapon is a fan of sparks that deals electricity damage.
