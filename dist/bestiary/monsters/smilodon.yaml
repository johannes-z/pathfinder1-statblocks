Description:
  - >-
    The smilodon, also known as the saber-toothed cat, is a powerful feline
    predator that savors the flesh of large creatures such as mastodons,
    mammoths, elephants, bison, buffalo, deer, and other great cats (excluding
    other smilodons). Smilodons are noted scavengers and have no problem
    devouring another animal's kill. Animals that resist the smilodon usually
    become part of the meal as well. Often mistakenly referred to as
    sabertoothed tigers by adventurers and sages, they are not in fact, related
    to tigers at all.
  - >-
    Breeding season for smilodons takes place year round (that is, they have no
    set mating period). A male smilodon mates with all females in the den.
  - >-
    Gestation lasts about 80 days after which time 1d4+2 cubs are born. Cubs
    reach maturity around two years of age. Most leave the den and go on their
    own at this age.
  - >-
    Smilodons average about five feet long and weigh nearly 500 pounds, but can
    grow to a length of eight feet and weigh up to 900 pounds. Their fur is
    golden or spotted (similar to a leopard). Their legs are short but powerful
    and their tail is short and bobbed. The smilodon has two eight-inch long,
    downward-curving canine teeth. These saber-like fangs are very sharp and are
    used for stabbing prey. This creature can open its jaws almost twice as far
    as other big cats. Other great cats, like lions and tigers, can only open
    their jaws to an angle of about 65-degrees, but the smilodon can stretch its
    jaws to an angle of 120-degrees.
  - >-
    These ferocious hunters prefer to attack from ambush, using their coloration
    to blend in with their surroundings so they can catch their opponents by
    surprise. When prey is spotted, the smilodon waits for it to come close, and
    then leaps to attack. When combating a foe, the sabertooth bites and rakes
    with its claws. It uses its long canine teeth to stab its prey, aiming for
    the fleshier and softer parts of its victim's body (such as the stomach or
    neck) where it inflicts terrible wounds with its saber-like teeth.
