Description_Visual: >-
  A brightly colored creature swoops down to land on the branch above. Its head
  is overly large, with a mouth full of sharp teeth and bright, shiny eyes. The
  thing chirps, lashes its long thin tail, and then with a flap of leathery
  wings is in the air once again.

Description:
  - >-
    Pterosaurs are often found in regions where dinosaurs and other prehistoric
    creatures are commonly encountered, yet they are not dinosaurs themselves.
    The pteranodon is the most well known and widespread of these flying
    reptiles, but numerous other species exist, such as the relatively small
    rhamphorhynchus, the venomous dimorphodon, and the lumbering, giraffe-sized
    quetzalcoatlus. While the larger pterosaurs are awkward fliers, the smaller
    ones can be quite agile and quick. Pterosaurs generally dwell on coastlines,
    along rivers, or near swamps or lakes, for the majority of their diet
    consists of fish snatched from the water in daring dives. Pterosaurs are
    quite territorial, though, and most won't hesitate to swoop down and hiss,
    shriek, and attack things their size or larger.

    Quetzalcoatlus Perhaps the largest of the pterosaurs, the quetzalcoatlus
    (known to some as the "swamp stalker" and others by the misnomer of
    "dragonling") is truly an awe-inspiring sight in the air, with its
    impressive 40-foot wingspan. On the ground, this creature's profile bears an
    uncanny resemblance to that of a giraffe, save for the fact that the folded
    wings arch up to either side of its lightly feathered body, and its head
    bears a horrific, razor-sharp beak. Unlike dimorphodons, quetzalcoatluses
    are difficult to train. Handle Animal checks made to train one of these
    looming pterosaurs take a -4 penalty. Quetzalcoatlus Companions Starting
