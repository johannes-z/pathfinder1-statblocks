SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      The spirit of any female humanoid that is slain by a lesser banshee's
      death wail or energy drain rises to become a banshee in 1d4 rounds.
      Similarly, any male humanoid slain by a banshee's death wail or energy
      drain rises to become a dread wraith in 1d4 rounds.
  - name: Lifesense (Ex)
    description: >-
      Lesser banshee's can detect living creatures within 60 feet, as if they
      possessed the blindsight ability. In addition, the lesser banshee senses
      the strength and life-force of the creature, as the spell deathwatch.
  - name: Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)
    description: >-
      A banshee is powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell)
      and flees from it, typically by hiding within a solid object. A banshee
      caught in sunlight cannot attack or use its wail and can take only a
      single standard or move action in a round.
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Animals can sense the aura of a lesser banshee at a distance of 30 feet.
      The animal will not willingly near a lesser banshee, and panics if forced
      to do so.
  - name: Wail (Su)
    description: >-
      A lesser banshee may let loose a wail so horrible that those within 30
      feet must make a DC 24 Fortitude save or die. The lesser banshee may only
      use her death wail at night, and no more than twice per day. After using
      this ability a lesser banshee must wait for 1d6 rounds before using it
      again. The save is Charisma-based, and includes the bonus from the Ability
      Focus feat.
Description:
  - >-
    Lesser banshees are the spirits of departed women (especially of elven
    heritage) that were cruel and evil in life. Lesser banshees appear as
    ghostly, translucent figures, and bear the same beauty they possessed in
    life. Lesser banshees attack with their incorporeal touch, and drain the
    energy of their foes. They are most widely known for their horrible keening
    (death wail), and fondness for attacking from solid objects.
  - >-
    Lesser banshees cling to areas they were familiar with in life; many lesser
    banshees may be found in dark forests or rolling moors; rarely, their
    incorporeal nature allows them to travel to new places, and such creatures
    become interred in dungeons or mausoleums, completely unaware of where they
    are or why they are there. This infuriates the banshees even more, and makes
    them far deadlier opponents.
