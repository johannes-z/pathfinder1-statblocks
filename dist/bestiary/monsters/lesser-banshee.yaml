Description:
  - >-
    Lesser banshees are the spirits of departed women (especially of elven
    heritage) that were cruel and evil in life. Lesser banshees appear as
    ghostly, translucent figures, and bear the same beauty they possessed in
    life. Lesser banshees attack with their incorporeal touch, and drain the
    energy of their foes. They are most widely known for their horrible keening
    (death wail), and fondness for attacking from solid objects.
  - >-
    Lesser banshees cling to areas they were familiar with in life; many lesser
    banshees may be found in dark forests or rolling moors; rarely, their
    incorporeal nature allows them to travel to new places, and such creatures
    become interred in dungeons or mausoleums, completely unaware of where they
    are or why they are there. This infuriates the banshees even more, and makes
    them far deadlier opponents.
