    description: >-

      Uncurling also requires a standard action.
Description:
  - >-
    Giant isopods are carnivorous scavengers that scour the ocean's floor. They
    vaguely resemble the common woodlouse in appearance, though they can grow to
    be up to 2-1/2 feet long and weigh nearly 4 pounds. Their unusual size and
    insectile appearance cause many humanoids to be wary of them, despite their
    relative harmlessness.
