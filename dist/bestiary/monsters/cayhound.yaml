SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Righteous Bite (Su)
    description: >-
      A cayhound's bite is treated as magical for the purpose of overcoming
      damage reduction.
  - name: Thunderous Bark (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d6 rounds, a cayhound can bark with the concussive force of a
      thunderbolt. Every creature within a 15-foot cone-shaped burst must
      succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or take 3d8 points of sonic
      damage and be knocked prone. A successful saving throw reduces this damage
      by half and negates being knocked prone. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Unbound (Su)
    description: >-
      Cayhounds move as if under a continuous freedom of movement spell. They
      are immune to dimensional anchor, but are affected by dimensional lock
      normally.
Description:
  - >-
    Cayhounds, also called leap dogs, are good-aligned outsiders who exemplify
    strength and freedom. They are descendants of Thunder, the pet mastiff of
    the Accidental God, Cayden Cailean, who uplifted his faithful companion upon
    achieving his own apotheosis. Thunder sired the entire cayhound race
    (including his famous son, Little Thunder) on the golden fields of Elysium.
    Cayhounds are filled with wild and turbulent forces barely contained within
    their canine shapes. They are intelligent and feel true lust for and joy in
    life, including righteous battle, good food, and strong drink. These fiery
    red hounds stand head to chest with most humans and weigh approximately 250
    pounds.
  - >-
    Wild as they are, the cayhounds are still more good-aligned than they are
    chaotic. Like their true master, they are great champions of freedom, and
    they channel his strength and courage (and a bit of luck) in opposing
    nefarious schemes wherever they find them. Some ally themselves with azatas,
    supporting good crusades against the Outer Planes. A pack of cayhounds might
    seek to disrupt a night hag and her steed's theft of good souls traveling to
    their intended destinations in the Great Beyond. Single cayhounds may be
    summoned via lesser planar ally by priests of Cayden Cailean to come to the
    aid of the faithful.
