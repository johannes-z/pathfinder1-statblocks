SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius that look at the spider
      lich must succeed on a DC 19 Will save or become frightened. Creatures
      with 5 HD or more must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for 1d6+6
      rounds. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the
      same spider lich's aura for one day. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
  - name: Paralyzing Bite (Su)
    description: >-
      Any living creature a spider lich hits with its bite attack must succeed
      on a DC 19 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d6+12 minutes. Remove
      paralysis or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see
      the bestow curse spell description). The effect cannot be dispelled.
      Anyone paralyzed by a spider lich seems dead, though a DC 20 Perception
      check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals that the victim is still alive.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save DC 21 Fort; frequency 1/round for 6/rounds; effect 1d4
      Strength damage; cure 1 save. The save is Charisma-based and includes a +2
      racial bonus.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      When a spider lich is destroyed, its phylactery (which is generally hidden
      by the spider lich in a safe place far from where it chooses to dwell)
      immediately begins to rebuild the undead spider lich's body nearby. This
      process takes 1d10 days-if the body is destroyed before that time passes,
      the phylactery merely starts the process anew. Spells A spider lich does
      not require any verbal, somatic, or material components to cast its
      spells.
Description:
  - >-
    The true origin of the spider lich is shrouded in mystery. Scholars argue
    constantly about its origins and how it came into existence. Some stand by
    the theory that intelligent giant spiders, perhaps phase spiders or some
    offshoot race of that dreaded creature, discovered the path to lichdom.
    Others contend a spider lich is the byproduct of a failed sorcerer's attempt
    at lichdom. Still others argue that the spider lich is simply a
    spellcaster's chosen form once it achieved lichhood. Whatever its true
    origins, the spider lich is truly a dreaded creature that many adventurers
    hope they never run across.
  - >-
    Spider liches are most often encountered underground in dungeons, caves, and
    crypts or in ruined temples and shrines, leading to further speculation
    among scholars as to the creature's origins. They do not associate with true
    spiders but are often encountered with other undead, particularly wraiths
    and spectres.
  - >-
    Spider liches have an insatiable thirst for knowledge. Countless days,
    months, years are spent pouring over ancient texts and tomes. Though evil by
    nature, spider liches often work with other creatures, particularly evil
    spellcasters to quench their thirst for this knowledge.
  - >-
    Spider liches stand over 8 feet tall and resemble skeletal spiders. Their
    eight eyes are deep black in color. Other than the sound of their bony legs
    clattering across stone floors, these creatures make no sound. They can
    speak a variety of languages but rarely do so.
  - The Spider Lich's Phylactery
  - >-
    An integral part of becoming a spider lich is the creation of the phylactery
    in which the creature stores its spirit. The only way to get rid of a spider
    lich for sure is to destroy its phylactery. Unless its phylactery is located
    and destroyed, a spider lich can rejuvenate after it is killed.
  - >-
    The typical spider lich phylactery is a gemstone of not less than 1,000 gp
    value. The spider lich hides the gemstone in a safe place and wraps it
    securely in a complex mesh of super strong webbing (DR 10/-, 24 hp).
