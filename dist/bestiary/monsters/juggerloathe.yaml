SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Devour Life (Su)
    description: >-
      The Juggerloathe's stomach leeches the life force of those trapped within
      it, rather than digesting them with acids. Any living victims that are
      swallowed whole and killed while within the Juggerloathe are turned into
      twisted creatures of undeath and pain. Regardless of their original size
      or form, those killed within the Juggerloathe become bodaks (Pathfinder
      RPG Bestiary 2 48), though their appearance may be less humanoid than
      those of typical bodaks. These undead stop taking damage while within the
      Juggerloathe, and escape its innards when it next uses its ejection
      attack. The undead aren't controlled by the Juggerloathe, but they don't
      attack it and it is immune to their powers.
  - name: Ejection (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Juggerloathe can eject the contents of its stomach in a 60-foot cone
      that deals 8d6 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 27 half) once every 1d6
      rounds. Any creatures swallowed whole by it-still living and undead-land
      prone at the far end of the cone. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Leaping Shockwave (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Juggerloathe leaps into combat much like normal bulettes, but lands
      with an earth-shaking impact. When it charges, it can attempt a DC 25
      Acrobatics check to jump into the air and land next to its enemies. If
      it's successful, all adjacent foes must succeed at a DC 30 Reflex save or
      be knocked prone. The Juggerloathe ends its charge with two bite attacks
      and two claw attacks, dividing them up as it sees fit among targets within
      reach. The save DC is Strength-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The seemingly unstoppable spawn of a bulette of massive size and Yethazmari
    (Lamashtu's herald; see page 99 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea
    Gods), the Juggerloathe is 50 feet from its nose to the base of its tail,
    and weighs slightly more than 100 tons. It has been a living legend among
    the tribes of Belkzen for centuries. Although it's seemingly content to
    remain hidden in its lair within the Mindspin Mountains, the creature is
    sometimes driven out onto the plains by hunger. Entire tribes have been
    known to disappear into its gullet, and it leaves only desolation and
    fiendishly warped undead in the wake of its rampages.
