    description: >-
      The grigs that make up a grig swarm carry tiny, grig-sized fiddles. When
      the fiddlers play, any non-sprite within 30 feet of the instruments must
      make a successful DC 17 Will save or be affected as though by irresistible
      dance for as long as the playing continues. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A grig swarm is a large mass of flying grigs. Normally grigs don't gather
    into groups larger than 80 or so creatures. But sometimes when several
    tribes come together, they join as a grig swarm.
  - >-
    The individual grigs that make up the swarm have light blue skin,
    forest-green hair, and brown hairy legs, and usually wear tunics or brightly
    colored vests with buttons made from tiny gems. A grig stands 1-1/2 feet
    tall and weighs about 1 pound.
  - >-
    A grig swarm normally attacks by surrounding and enveloping its opponents.
    Before closing to melee range, a swarm uses its entangle ability to bind its
    foes. If facing destruction, a swarm often turns invisible and flees.
