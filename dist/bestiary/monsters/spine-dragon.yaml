  This dragon bears a forest of razor-sharp crystalline spines. Its wings are
  transparent and seem almost to be made of glass.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a spine dragon can emit a
      devastating shriek of powerful sonic energy in a 60-foot cone. Creatures
      caught in this cone take 20d6 sonic damage and are permanently deafened. A
      DC 27 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the deafness. This sonic
      damage is particularly devastating to constructs-they take a -4 penalty to
      save against its effects, and if they fail the save, they are staggered
      for 1d4 rounds as well. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Ray Deflection (Su)
    description: >-
      A spine dragon's scales deflect rays and magic missile spells, rendering
      the spine dragon immune to such effects. There's a 30% chance a deflected
      effect reflects back in full force at the caster; otherwise, it is simply
      negated.
  - name: Spines (Ex)
    description: >-
      A spine dragon's body is covered with long, crystalline spines. It can
      fire up to four of these spines per round as a full-attack action (or one
      as a standard action). A creature that attacks a spine dragon with a melee
      weapon, unarmed strike, or natural weapon must make a DC 20 Reflex save or
      take 2d8+11 points of piercing damage from the spines. The save DC is
      Dexterity-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Particularly notorious in the badlands of Numeria, spine dragons are similar
    in appearance to true dragons, but do not progress through draconic age
    categories. Their abilities and defenses make them singularly adept at
    handling the alien threats and strange constructs that lurk in this realm,
    and as a result, spine dragons have become one of Numeria's most successful
    predators. Of course, a spine dragon is much more than a predator. As with
    many true dragons, spine dragons are particularly vain and enjoy being
    groveled to. It's not uncommon for them to assume the role of god for
    ignorant tribes of giants. They also have a particular love of crystalline
    treasure and magic items-a spine dragon's horde is usually sparse on the
    classic "carpet of coins" but just as valuable overall in content as those
    of true dragons. A spine dragon is 60 feet long and 20 feet high, and weighs
    16,000 pounds.
