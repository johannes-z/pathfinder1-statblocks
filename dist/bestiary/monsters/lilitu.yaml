  While this seductive woman has goat horns, goat hooves, and a serpentine tail,

IsTemplate: 0
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Branding (Su)
    description: >-
      Each time a lilitu damages a living creature with her tail slap, the wound
      leaves an angry and permanent red brand. In addition, the creature struck
      becomes staggered for 1 round from the pain. A successful DC 26 Will save
      negates the staggered condition and reduces the duration of the brand from
      permanent to 1 hour. The save DC is Charisma-based. Removing brands is
      difficult-each casting of restoration, dispel chaos, or dispel evil
      removes 1 brand. Heal removes 1d4+4 brands. Greater restoration removes a
      number of brands equal to the spell's caster level. Miracle and wish can
      remove all brands at once. The number of brands a creature gains in this
      manner has a cumulative series of effects, as summarized below. 1-3
      Brands: The lilitu can affect the branded creature with its create husk,
      husk link, and profane pact abilities. 4-6 Bands: The branded creature
      takes a -2 penalty on all Will saves made against a lilitu's spells,
      spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. The branded creature's
      aura now radiates chaos and evil. 7-9 Brands: The branded creature's
      Wisdom score is reduced by 4. A chaotic evil creature is immune to this
      effect. 10 or more Brands: The penalties to the creature's Will saves and
      Wisdom score listed above double. In addition, the branded creature
      automatically fails all Will saves made against a lilitu's spells,
      spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. A chaotic evil creature
      is immune to this effect.
  - name: Create Husk (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a swift action, when a lilitu deals enough damage with a
      weapon, spell, or spell-like ability to kill a humanoid within 30 feet,
      she can instead opt to transform that slain humanoid into a husk. A
      successful DC 26 Fortitude save negates this effect, allowing the victim
      to die normally. A humanoid transformed into a husk withers away into an
      immobile and desiccated corpse, but does not actually die-in this state,
      the creature remains aware of its surroundings but can take no actions at
      all. A husk is essentially treated as an object with hardness 15 and 60
      hit points. If a husk is destroyed, the effect ends and the body dies.
      This is a curse effect- removing this curse restores the victim to life at
      a number of negative hit points equal to the creature's Constitution -1; a
      husk restored to life in this way has 1 round to stabilize or be saved
      before it dies. A lilitu can maintain a number of husks simultaneously
      equal to her Charisma modifier (8 husks for the typical lilitu); if she
      creates one too many husks, a previously created husk is released and
      immediately dies. Lilitus hide their husk collections in very safe places.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Husk Link (Su)
    description: >-
      By spending a minute in blasphemous contact with a husk she created, a
      lilitu can establish a supernatural link to that husk. As long as she and
      that husk remain on the same plane, divination spells reveal the linked
      husk's alignment to be the same as the lilitu's alignment (chaotic evil).
      The husk link allows a lilitu to use her change self ability to assume a
      husk's original form-when she does, she gains a +20 bonus on Disguise
      checks made to impersonate that person. If a lilitu with an active husk
      link ever takes enough damage to be slain, the husk takes the
      killing-blow's damage instead and is destroyed, instantly severing the
      active husk link; if the lilitu is disguised in the husk's original form,
      she instantly reverts to her true form.
  - name: Profane Grace (Su)
    description: >-
      A lilitu gains a +4 profane bonus to AC and on Initiative checks and
      Reflex saves.
  - name: Profane Pact (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a full-round action, a lilitu may forge a profane pact
      with a willing humanoid creature bearing at least one lilitu brand by
      touching the creature for 1 full round. A single creature may have no more
      than one profane pact from a lilitu at one time. This functions
      identically to a succubus's profane gift ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary
      68), save that it grants a +4 profane bonus to an ability score of the
      humanoid's choice, and it does not grant a telepathic link to the target.
  - name: Profane Wishcraft (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that accepts a wish from a lilitu immediately becomes chaotic
      evil unless it makes a successful DC 26 Will save. A creature that becomes
      chaotic evil in this way gains the benefits of a good hope spell for 24
      hours, followed by the effects of crushing despair for 1d6 days (these
      spell effects function at CL 17th). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Swift Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a lilitu makes a full-round attack action, she can attack twice with
      each of her claws, for a total of four attacks a round.
Description:
  - >-
    Lilitu demons are subversive and hidden horrors, demons who work much more
    subtlety in their constant quest to destroy and devastate. Whereas most
    demons prefer to rend and destroy, the lilitu is more akin to the
    succubus-she labors in humanoid guise to infect society from within with
    sin. Known to some as temptation demons, lilitus enjoy little more than
    leading mortals into all matter of sinful acts, in the hopes that when the
    mortal perishes, that soul will fuel the Abyss. Despite some superf icial
    similarities to succubi, lilitus are not solely concerned with the sin of
    lust. The exact nature of sin that a lilitu tempts a mortal into committing
    varies, for these demons are adept at reading mortal desires and secrets,
    quickly discerning which sinful acts a specif ic target can be convinced to
    perform.
  - >-
    Lilitus have numerous tools at their disposal for the encouragement of
    promoting sin, but they much prefer their humanoid victims to commit sins of
    their own free will. As such, lilitus generally use their abilities to
    deceive and beguile mortals rather than forcing them to execute these
    heinous acts. A son convinced to kill for his mother (the disguised lilitu)
    to rectify a grave injustice done to her produces more delight than simply
    mind-controlling a humanoid into doing such a deed.
  - >-
    In her true form, a lilitu appears as an eyeless, horned, snake-tailed-but
    otherwise beautiful-human woman. Despite her lack of eyes, a lilitu can see
    with supernatural ease. A lilitu forms from the soul of a mortal who lured
    others of its kind to commit sins.
  - >-
    Lilitus serve many demon lords, although the demon lords associated with the
    classic seven deadly sins- Areshkagal (greed), Jubilex (sloth), Nocticula
    (lust), Orcus (wrath), Shax (envy), Socothbenoth (pride), and Xoveron
    (gluttony)-are their favorites. Lilitus who serve these seven demon lords
    are unique in appearance, ref lecting their sins more physically than others
    of their kind. A lilitu of Jubilex might appear to be made of slime, while a
    lilitu of Xoveron might be morbidly obese.
  - Lilitus typically stand 6 feet tall and weigh 130 pounds.
