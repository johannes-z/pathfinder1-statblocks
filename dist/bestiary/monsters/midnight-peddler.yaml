Description_Visual: >-

  long protruding, sharp jaw can be seen under the hood.  He moves with a
  shuffling gait, pushing a wooden cart that squeaks as it rolls along.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Chill (Su)
    description: >-
      The touch of the midnight peddler deals 1d4 negative levels to a living
      creature. The DC is 15 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level.
      The save DC is Constitution-based. The midnight peddler gains 5 temporary
      hit points for each negative level bestowed.
  - name: Divination (Su)
    description: >-
      The peddler provides advice and answers correctly any one question asked
      of him by any creature who buys something from his cart. This ability
      functions similar to a divination spell (caster level 12th).
  - name: Plane Shift (Su)
    description: >-
      The midnight peddler can plane shift (as the spell) to any inner or outer
      plane as a move action. His cart (and any non-living matter contained
      therein) shifts with him. This ability otherwise functions as the spell of
      the same name.
Description:
  - >-
    The midnight peddler wanders city streets and is normally only encountered
    on fog-covered nights. He is first detected by the audible squeaking of the
    cart he pushes, the sound growing louder as he draws closer. The sound can
    be heard at a range of 300 feet with a successful DC 12 Perception check.
    The midnight peddler moves with a slow gait as he pushes his wooden cart.
    The contents of his cart vary each time he visits the Material Plane, but at
    any given time, he has available any item listed in the Pathfinder
    Roleplaying Game (see the Equipment section) with a value of 50 gp or less.
  - >-
    The midnight peddler shuns combat. If forced into battle, he uses his death
    chill ability at first opportunity and then plane shifts away.
