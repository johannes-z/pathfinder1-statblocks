Description:
  - >-
    Silvanshees are curious but reclusive cat agathions. Unobtrusive and able to
    blend in among normal animals (unlike the more anthropomorphic agathions),
    they are the eyes and ears of the good planes in the mortal world. Most roam
    hills, forests, and plains, keeping an eye out for evil inf luences. They
    can be taken as familiars by 7th-level good spellcasters with the Improved
    Familiar feat who meet the proper prerequisites. As familiars, silvanshees
    act as moral guides and steer their mortal allies toward corruptive forces
    that must be eliminated. In some mortal lands, they are called cat sÃ¬th or
    cath sidhe, and are believed to be disguised witches or fairies-and not
    necessarily benign creatures, which only encourages silvanshees to avoid
    strangers.
  - >-
    Silvanshees are not fond of open combat, even against demons, devils, or
    other fiendish threats, and they're likely to run away if confronted. When
    they must fight, they prefer greater numbers and the element of surprise,
    using their magic to temporarily overcome their physical weaknesses, and
    melting away into mist if the battle turns against them.
  - >-
    A silvanshee is the size of a large domestic cat, though almost always sleek
    rather than fat, and weighs 20 pounds on average.
