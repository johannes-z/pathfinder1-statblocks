SpecialAbilities:
  - name: s Luck (Su)
    description: >-
      A silvanshee adds its Charisma modifier as a luck bonus on all its saving
      throws. Once per day as a standard action, it can also grant this bonus to
      one ally within 30 feet for 10 minutes.
  - name: Heroic Strength (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a silvanshee can grant itself a +8 enhancement bonus to
      Strength for 1 minute.
  - name: Spectral Mist (Su)
    description: >-
      A silvanshee can assume an eerie, mist-like form roughly the size and
      shape of a cat. This ability has the same effect as a gaseous form spell,
      except the silvanshee retains its own DR and supernatural abilities and
      can move at its normal speed. It can remain in mist form up to 5 minutes
      per day. This duration does not have to be consecutive, but it must be
      used in 1-minute increments.
Description:
  - >-
    Silvanshees are curious but reclusive cat agathions. Unobtrusive and able to
    blend in among normal animals (unlike the more anthropomorphic agathions),
    they are the eyes and ears of the good planes in the mortal world. Most roam
    hills, forests, and plains, keeping an eye out for evil inf luences. They
    can be taken as familiars by 7th-level good spellcasters with the Improved
    Familiar feat who meet the proper prerequisites. As familiars, silvanshees
    act as moral guides and steer their mortal allies toward corruptive forces
    that must be eliminated. In some mortal lands, they are called cat sÃ¬th or
    cath sidhe, and are believed to be disguised witches or fairies-and not
    necessarily benign creatures, which only encourages silvanshees to avoid
    strangers.
  - >-
    Silvanshees are not fond of open combat, even against demons, devils, or
    other fiendish threats, and they're likely to run away if confronted. When
    they must fight, they prefer greater numbers and the element of surprise,
    using their magic to temporarily overcome their physical weaknesses, and
    melting away into mist if the battle turns against them.
  - >-
    A silvanshee is the size of a large domestic cat, though almost always sleek
    rather than fat, and weighs 20 pounds on average.
