Description_Visual: >-
  This creature resembles an ordinary shark from tail to mouth, but the unusual
  shape of its lower jaw marks it as something else. A whorl of teeth spirals
  inward, tiny at the centre, but long and brutal farther out.

Description:
  - >-
    The helicoprion is a bizarre beast to behold. The remarkable physiology of
    its mouth allows it to flick out its bottom jaw, unrolling the whorl of
    teeth and snaring prey along its length. As its powerful muscles roll its
    jaw, the prey becomes trapped in a spiral of ragged, brutal incisors. Once
    it has captured a hearty meal, the helicoprion retreats in a thickening
    cloud of its victim's blood to patiently await the slowing of struggles and
    the imminent demise of its dinner.
