    description: >-
      A forester's bane can saw at an opponent, dealing slashing damage, when it
      makes a successful grapple check. This attack deals 1d4+3 points of
      slashing damage per stalk. It cannot attack a pinned opponent with any
      stalk that has already attacked another opponent that round. A forester's
      bane can only attempt to grapple opponents 1 or more sizes smaller than
      itself. Because of its four leaves, it can grapple up to four different
      opponents at one time with a single grapple check. It can also attack a
      single opponent with more than one leaf, gaining a +2 bonus on its grapple
      check with each extra leaf (+13 grapple with two leaves, +15 grapple with
      three leaves, and +17 grapple with all four leaves). Both leaves and
      stalks each have 10 hit points and can be attacked by making a successful
      sunder attempt. Attacking a forester's bane's leaf or stalk does not
      provoke an attack of opportunity. If the leaf is currently grappling a
      target, the forester's bane takes a -4 penalty on its opposed roll to
      resist the sunder attempt. Severing a leaf or stalk deals no damage to a
      forester's bane. Attacks that hit a leaf deal half their damage to the
      monster and half to the trapped victim. Destroyed leaves and stalks grow
      back in 2d4 weeks if the forester's bane is not killed.
Description:
  - >-
    The forester's bane is a huge, immobile, and carnivorous shrub. Closer
    inspection reveals large, tough leaves radiating from its central stalk.
  - >-
    These dark green leaves hide six purple serrated stalks inside its body. At
    the center of this low-growing shrub is a 3-foot diameter yellowish orb from
    which sprout many small green branches. Each branch has small, sweet
    smelling (and tasting) berries of various colors growing from it.
  - >-
    When a living creature moves near a forester's bane's leaves, it attempts to
    grab the creature. Trapped creatures are subjected to attacks by several
    serrated stalks that slash and cut until the opponent escapes. The
    forester's bane releases a trapped victim when either it or the victim is
    dead, or the leaf holding the victim is destroyed. The snapper saw can also
    attack with its stalks without first grappling an opponent.
