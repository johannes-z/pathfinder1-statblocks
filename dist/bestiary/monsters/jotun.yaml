Description:
  - >-
    Jotuns are the purest blooded of the frost giant race, from which all other
    frost giants sprang. As brutal as their lesser cousins, they are also highly
    intelligent, possessing the knowledge of ancient runes with which they may
    tap into great magical powers. The jotun lineage is said to go back to that
    of the elder gods, with some jotun females having been the mothers of
    demigods still worshipped by various races to this day. Jotuns are held as
    nobility amongst normal frost giant tribes, who obey them as the true
    children of the frost giant god.
  - >-
    Jotuns love games of chance, puzzles and conundrums. The sometimes offer
    prisoners such a game to win their freedom; of course, the jotun frequently
    cheat at these games, taking perverse pleasure in doing so.
  - >-
    Unlike normal frost giants, Jotuns have a taste for finery, not usually
    found amongst their lesser cousins. They prefer masterwork and magical gear
    as well as finely tailored furs to the sloppy filth of normal frost giants.
    Truly ancient jotuns rival titans in size and the power of their illusions.
  - >-
    A jotun's skin is white as snow and their eyes glitter like blue diamonds.
    Their hair color ranges from red, yellow, blue-grey and even white. Females
    of the species are quite beautiful and have been known to seduce human men
    to their death with their feminine wiles. Jotun females are frequently
    sorcerers.
  - >-
    Adult males stand 15-17 feet tall and weigh between 2,800 and 3,200 lbs.
    Females are only slightly smaller averaging 14-16 feet in height. Jotuns'
    have a potential lifespan of over 1,000 years and continue to grow in size
    and magical prowess throughout the span of their lives.
  - >-
    It is not uncommon for a jotun to have a few levels of sorcerer, wizard
    (Illusionist) or cleric as well as their natural powers and abilities.
  - >-
    A jotun prefers to conceal itself with powerful illusions and take its
    enemies by surprise, attacking one opponent at a time until all are subdued
    or slain. When ganged up on by greater numbers of smaller foes it overruns
    them, stomping its opponents into the snow, slaughtering them before they
    have a chance to rise. When threatened with death, a jotun may attempt to
    flee or barter for its life.
