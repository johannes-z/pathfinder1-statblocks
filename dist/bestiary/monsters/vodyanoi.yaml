SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Suffocating Water (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a vodyanoi can cause the water
      surrounding it up to a radius of 30 feet to grow thick and slimy, making
      it difficult for water-breathing creatures within the area other than
      vodyanois to breathe. A vodyanoi can control narrow currents of breathable
      water to provide oxygen to up to 3 other creatures in the area of
      effect-vodyanois themselves are immune to this effect. All other creatures
      in an area of suffocating water must hold their breath or risk
      suffocation. Once created, an area of suffocating water does not move-it
      persists for a number of minutes equal to the vodyanoi's Hit Dice. The
      slimy water does not impact swim speeds or visibility in any significant
      manner. A creature can make a DC 20 Perception check to notice the
      difference between suffocating water and any normal water that may
      surround it.
Description:
  - >-
    Vodyanois resemble humanoid salamanders. They have short noses, bulging
    eyes, and broad mouths covered with thickets of fleshy tendrils. Skin color
    varies wildly depending on the climate and terrain, from drab greens and
    grays to vibrant oranges and reds. Vodyanois stand roughly 5-1/2 feet tall
    and weigh just over 100 pounds. They can live up to 120 years.
  - >-
    Vodyanois are well known as enemies to boggards- another amphibious race
    often encountered in proximity to vodyanoi lands. While vodyanois themselves
    are rarely evil, they are capricious and often quick to anger, particularly
    when they feel their territories have been intruded upon. Their hatred of
    boggards is another sure way to arouse their anger-a vodyanoi who suspects
    one of boggard collusion will often attack on sight. Those who live in close
    proximity to vodyanoi tribes learn quickly to leave the folk alone, and when
    visits or intrusions into vodyanoi lands are necessary (such as when one
    might need to seek out a vodyanoi for aid in curing a disease), gifts of
    magic potions and exotic fruits are highly recommended.
