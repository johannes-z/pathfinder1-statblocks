SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Awaken Treants (Su)
    description: >-
      A great wyrm dragon can call on the forest itself to aid it, animating a
      number of trees to serve as treants to protect it. These treants can be
      called from any Huge or larger living tree. A green dragon can create a
      single treant as a standard action, up to a total of 4 treants per day.
      These treants remain animated for up to 1 hour, at which time they revert
      to being ordinary trees.
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    description: >-
      An old or older green dragon can use Stealth to hide in any sort of
      natural terrain, even if the terrain does not grant cover or concealment.
  - name: Miasma (Su)
    description: >-
      An ancient or older green dragon can use its breath weapon to create a
      cloud of acid as a standard action that deals damage to any creature
      inside it. The cloud moves with the dragon and has a radius of 20 feet.
      When it's created, anyone inside this area takes an amount of damage equal
      to half the dragon's breath weapon, with a Reflex save for half damage.
      The number of damage dice rolled is halved each round until the result
      would be less than 1d6. Any creature that starts its turn inside the cloud
      takes damage, but can make a Reflex save for half. A strong wind, such as
      that created by a gust of wind, disperses the cloud in 1 round. Spell-Like

    towering canopies in search of prey. Of all the chromatic dragons, green
    dragons are perhaps the easiest to deal with diplomatically.
