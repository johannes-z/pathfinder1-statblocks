  - name: Shard Spike (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a crysmal can launch its tail spike as a ranged attack that
      shatters when it hits, dealing 3d6 points of piercing damage to the target
      and 1d4 points of piercing damage to all creatures in adjacent squares.
      The spike regrows in 24 hours, but until it does, its impaired sting does
      only 1d6+3 damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Scorpion-like crysmals originate in the deepest caverns of the Plane of
    Earth. On rare occasions, these strange creatures wind up on the Material
    Plane, usually in subterranean areas rich with natural gem and crystal
    formations. The crystalline planes of their bodies absorb and refract
    natural light, which some claim is the source of their supernatural powers.
  - >-
    It does so by gathering stone crystals and gemstones, fashioning them into a
    Tiny facsimile of its own body, and jolting the new creature to life with a
    burst of the crysmal's own life energy. These newly created crysmals are
    known as shardlings (treat as a crysmal with the young creature simple
    template), and grow to adulthood after a few months of gorging on crystals
    and gemstones.
  - >-
    To make a single shardling, a crysmal requires 1,000 gp worth of crystals.
    Until it has enough material to reproduce, it stores these gems inside its
    body, and if slain, the gems are visible among the shards of the creature's
    corpse. Because of this reproductive need for gemstones, crysmals are
    relentless in their pursuit of the treasures, valuing them much as other
    living creatures value infants of their own race. Crysmals do not recognize
    that other creatures treat gems as wealth, and attempt to seize gems carried
    by others whenever the opportunity arises. A crysmal normally uses its
    spell-like abilities to befuddle opponents, grabbing at pouches with gems
    when the bearer is distracted, and normally only resorts to physical
    violence once all other tactics fail.
