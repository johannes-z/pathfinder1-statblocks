Description:
  - >-
    Four-armed gargoyles like their brethren often stand perched indefinitely
    without moving in an attempt to surprise their opponents.
  - >-
    They have a great fondness for inflicting pain on their foes. When a
    four-armed gargoyle has the upper hand in battle, it often draws out the
    conflict as long as it can in order to deal as much pain and suffering as it
    can on its foes.
