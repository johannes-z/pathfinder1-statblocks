Description_Visual: >-
  Twisted horns rise from the skinless head of this winged creature, and noxious
  fumes leak from between its yellowed fangs.
Group: Devil
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 4
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Master Grappler (Ex)
    description: >-
      A magaav can wield a weapon and still attempt grapple checks. While not
      wielding a weapon, a magaav gains a +4 bonus on grapple checks.
  - name: Noxious Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, as a standard action a magaav can exhale a breath
      that reeks of pure corruption upon a creature within 5 feet. The target
      must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds.
      Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same magaav's
      noxious breath for 24 hours. This is a poison effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Shared Senses (Su)
    description: >-
      All magaavs within 100 feet of one another share the same senses. Thus, if
      one individual perceives something (for example, with a successful
      Perception check), all others within range are immediately aware of it.
      Senses are instantly relayed from one magaav to the next, allowing for the
      senses of a single devil to potentially spread through and inform an
      entire swarm instantly. It is still possible for a magaav to be
      flat-footed for other reasons even if other magaavs nearby are not.
Description:
  - >-
    Hunters of souls, host devils retrieve Hell's most elusive property. Whether
    souls that have long evaded capture upon the plains of Avernus, damned
    beings who have somehow managed to escape Hell, or creatures that have
    reneged upon infernal contracts, vast flocks of these winged fiends fly from
    the Pit to recover their prey. Rarely seen alone, host devils travel in
    great swarms that often number in the thousands. These four-winged mockeries
    of the angelic form swarm in enormous columns, moving in tandem as though
    they were one colossal, infernal beast controlled by a single brain. Magaavs
    stand 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh 150 pounds, with wingspans reaching 10 feet
    across. Their fetid breath draws flies that swarm over their bodies.
