Description:
  - >-
    Astral spiders are ambush hunters that dwell on the Astral Plane, using
    their silvery webs to capture and entangle prey. They make their lairs
    wherever they can on their endless plane; using dead planar travelers (that
    aren't devoured), bits of planar refuse, bits of solid matter, and anything
    else they can cobble together. An astral spider's lair can stretch over
    several hundred feet.
  - >-
    A typical lair contains a single female astral spider who several times a
    year lays up to 30 eggs at a time. These eggs are wrapped tightly in the
    spider's webs and attached to some part of the lair. Within 6-8 weeks, the
    eggs hatch, the newborn astral spiders using their sharpened mandibles to
    tear through the eggs and webbing. Most hatchlings don't survive, being
    eaten by other astral spiders, astral sharks, or some other denizen of the
    plane. Those that do reach adulthood, journey off into the Astral Plane a
    few months after hatching.
  - >-
    Astral spiders sustain themselves on a diet of other creatures, particularly
    astral sharks and planar travelers. When food is scarce, an astral spider
    can enter a state of semi-hibernation, remaining motionless in its web
    without food for months at a time.
  - >-
    An astral spider is about 8 feet long with a glossy silver body covered in
    tiny, dancing black streaks. Its ten legs are glossy silver and its eyes
    appear as small dots of black ink. The creature's mandibles are slightly
    oversized and dull silver in color. Its underside is dull silver, fading to
    a dull grayish-silver near the spider's rear legs. Older astral spiders have
    completely gray undersides.
  - >-
    An astral spider rarely initiates combat and simply lies in wait,
    motionless, in its webs. When it detects movement, it scuttles out and
    attacks. In combat, an astral spider rears on its back six legs and slashes
    its foes with its front four legs, following quickly with its deadly bite.
    Particularly bothersome opponents are webbed and immobilized with the spider
    moving into bite its trapped foe quickly. Slain prey and webbed prey are
    carried back to its lair and fed to the young. Portions of the prey not
    devoured are webbed and worked into solid makeup of the lair.
