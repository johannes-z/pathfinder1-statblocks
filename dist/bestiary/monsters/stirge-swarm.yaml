    description: >-
      Stirges are harbingers of disease. Any creature subjected to a stirge's
      blood drain attack has a 10% chance of being exposed to filth fever,
      blinding sickness, or a similar disease (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core
      Rulebook, "Diseases"). Once this check is made, the victim can no longer
      be infected by this particular stirge, though attacks by different stirges
      are resolved normally and may result in multiple illnesses.
Description:
  - >-
    A massive cluster of stirges, the stirge swarm is a band of flying
    bloodsuckers combining their relatively small personal power to bring down
    larger foes (and for self-preservation). Stirge swarms are found in the same
    types of locals as normal stirges; however, they band together when other
    predators are too powerful or too numerous for the singular stirges to
    survive.
