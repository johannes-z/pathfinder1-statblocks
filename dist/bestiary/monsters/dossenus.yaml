SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burrow (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dossenus can burrow through stone (or weaker materials such as wood) as
      easily as dirt.
  - name: Devastating Maw (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dossenus' bite attack counts as adamantine for the purposes of
      overcoming DR and bypassing hardness.
  - name: Hydrophobia (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dossenus cannot swim and always fails Swim checks. If a dossenus becomes
      completely submerged in water, it must succeed at a DC 15 Will save on its
      turn each round or be paralyzed with fear until it is no longer submerged.
  - name: Swarming (Ex)
    description: >-
      Dossenuses are brutally efficient at swarming foes and often skitter atop
      one another in their haste to overwhelm and devour prey. Up to two
      dossenuses can share the same square at the same time. If two dossenuses
      sharing the same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be
      flanking that foe as if they were in two opposite squares.
Description:
  - >-
    A dossenus is a subterranean pack hunter that can digest almost anything.
    Its body is mostly head and face, dominated by a huge mouth with multiple
    rows of black, rocklike teeth. Two thin arms and four thin legs extend from
    its underdeveloped body; its front limbs end in crablike claws it can use to
    clumsily manipulate objects. A dossenus is just under 4 feet long and weighs
    60 pounds. Dossenuses are notorious for their voracious appetites and
    ability to gnaw through practically any substance with their savage teeth.
    Though their tiny eyes appear absent of thought or purpose, dossenuses are
    actually slightly more intelligent than mere beasts. These creatures have a
    primitive communal social structure, speak and understand Aklo, and practice
    a violent form of religion based on the indiscriminate consumption of all
    other forms of life. Dossenuses practice ritual cannibalism of their dead.
    Dossenuses are gifted climbers and burrowers and use their talents to
    clamber up or through walls, floors, ceilings, and over their fellows to
    quickly surround and overwhelm prey. Once one of these extremely tenacious
    creatures lays eyes on potential prey, it does not give up the chase until
    it or its target is dead, or enters or crosses a body of water. A dossenus
    cannot swim (it sinks to the bottom) and has an intense fear of deep water.
    Once every few generations, dossenuses gather in great numbers, sometimes in
    the thousands. After several weeks of worship, fasting, and frenzied mating,
    the creatures skitter forth as a massive swarm intent on devouring any
    living thing in their path.
