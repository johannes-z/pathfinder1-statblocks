SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      A baobhan sith can suck blood from a grappled or helpless opponent; if she
      establishes or maintains a pin, she deals bite damage and drains blood,
      dealing 1d4 points of Strength damage and 1d4 points of Constitution
      damage each round.
  - name: Captivating Dance (Su)
    description: >-
      When a baobhan sith dances, all living creatures within 30 feet that view
      the rhythmic swaying and movements of her body must succeed on a DC 19
      Will save or become utterly enthralled and captivated. Creatures that are
      sexually attracted to females who view this dance suffer a -2 penalty on
      their saving throws. A creature that makes its save cannot be affected
      again by the same baobhan sith's captivating dance for one day. A
      captivated creature is dazed (it cannot attack, but can defend normally).
      This continues for as long as the baobhan sith dances. A baobhan sith can
      move and act normally (including using her spelllike abilities) while
      maintaining her dance. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Dying Words (Sp)
    description: >-
      When a baobhan sith is slain, she utters a curse as a free action (whether
      it's her turn or not) that affects her killer as if it were a bestow curse
      spell (caster level 10th). The target can resist the curse with a
      successful DC 19 Will save. If the save fails, the target suffers a -6
      decrease to its highest ability score. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Baobhan sith (bavaan shee) are evil female fey that feed on the blood of
    living creatures. By entrancing creatures with their dance, they lure men to
    their deaths. Baobhan sith are always female; no males of this race are
    known to exist.
  - >-
    These creatures are generally found in remote locations such as unclaimed
    forests or overgrown and ruined keeps, castles, or the like; always a
    secluded location, but close enough to a populated area that the baobhan
    sith can feed when hungry. Their lairs are typically clean; the monsters
    have disposed of the rotting corpses of past victims. They are solitary
    creatures and never work in groups. Baobhan siths each have their own
    hunting ground and to intrude on another's is certain death.
  - >-
    Baobhan siths prefer to use their abilities against male humanoids,
    particularly elves or humans. They generally avoid dwarves and halflings,
    though if food is scarce they have no qualms about draining the blood of
    just about any living creature. They do not drink the blood of animals; no
    matter how hungry they are, as they see this as primitive and savage.
  - >-
    A baobhan sith stands 5 to 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs roughly 120 pounds.
    Her hair ranges in color from black or brown to golden yellow.
  - >-
    Eye color varies but is usually brown or green. A baobhan sith wears
    flowing, loose-fitting robes or tunics of white often tied at the waist with
    a scarf of red or black.
  - >-
    A baobhan sith prefers to attack a lone target and generally avoids combat
    with groups, fleeing if confronted by such a party. Stragglers are often the
    subject of the baobhan sith's attention if the straggler is far enough
    behind its comrades.
  - >-
    When first encountered, a baobhan sith opens combat with her captivating
    dance. Creatures that fail to succumb are entangled. Once she has captivated
    at least one foe, she moves in and sinks her teeth into its chest or throat
    and drains blood. If overwhelmed or outnumbered, the baobhan sith uses her
    entangle ability (if she hasn't already used it) and tries to slip away into
    the surrounding forest.
