SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      A juvenile humanoid slain by a skull child rises the following night as a
      free-willed skull child. A bless spell cast on the body before that time
      ceases the transformation. Adults and non-humanoids killed by a skull
      child do not rise as undead.
  - name: Daylight Powerlessness (Su)
    description: >-
      A skull child's energy drain, create spawn, terrifying gaze, and weakness
      abilities only function after sunset.
  - name: Masquerade (Su)
    description: >-
      Between the hours of dawn and dusk, it is impossible to tell a skull child
      from another, normal, child of the race it is posing as. Any form of
      detection, such as detect undead reveals nothing. True seeing or similar
      spells show a dark haze around a skull child during the day but nothing
      else. Additionally, Bluff is always a class skill for a skull child.
  - name: Terrifying Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Any living creature that meets the gaze of a skull child must succeed on a
      DC 14 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. Creatures with more than 5 HD
      are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Vicious Claws (Su)
    description: >-
      The claws of a skull child are supernaturally sharp. A skull child
      threatens a critical on a 19-20 with its claw attack.
  - name: Weakness (Su)
    description: >-
      The bite of a skull child deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage on a
      successful hit unless the target succeeds on a DC 14 Fortitude save. A
      creature dies if this Constitution damage equals or exceeds its actual
      Constitution score. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Skull children are small and pathetic but sadistic undead creatures, often
    spoken of in folklore and myth, though few actually believe in their
    existence. By day, a skull child is virtually indiscernible from any
    humanoid child of its size and apparent age. It appears as a happy, playful
    youngster who mixes with other, more normal children. At night however, its
    true demeanor becomes all too apparent. As the sun sinks below the horizon,
    the flesh retreats from the head of a skull child, revealing a bare skull
    with blazing eye sockets and sharp, needle-like teeth. The rest of the
    creature's body becomes putrid and rotten. A skull child feeds on the life
    force of other living creatures, draining the essence of its victims, though
    only at night. A skull child often poses as an orphan in order to be taken
    in by a well-meaning and unsuspecting family, while other skull children
    operate in gangs as destitute children in larger cities.
  - >-
    A skull child seeks to insinuate itself into groups of children,
    camouflaging itself among the living and slowing preying upon them, one by
    one. It is not known whether a skull child prefers to stalk children in
    order to create more of its own kind or simply because children are far
    easier targets than adults.
  - >-
    Skull children stand between 2 and 4 feet tall, and weigh about 30 to 60
    pounds.
  - >-
    Skull children prefer to avoid combat if possible, all too aware that their
    small forms are unsuited to melee. When forced to fight, however, they
    attack with their bony claws and a vicious bite.
