Description:
  - >-
    These fabled four-armed giants are native to a low-gravity planet and
    renowned across several worlds for their ferocity in battle. Most shobhads
    are born and come of age in fierce tribal clans known collectively as the
    Shobhad-neh, and disdain the "soft living" practiced by many other humanoid
    races-they believe the abandonment of nomadic culture is a slippery slope
    that leads away from individual honor and into marginalization. Whether with
    flashing swords and lances or mysterious longrifles capable of picking off
    targets on faraway horizons, the clans of the Shobhad-neh constantly vie for
    resources in the hard deserts and mountains where they live, their need to
    survive trumped only by a still greater desire for honor. Though considered
    barbaric by many, the Shobhad-neh operate under strict codes of conduct that
    dictate how a warrior may gain status via ritualistic challenges or daring
    coups in territorial squabbles. Unfortunately for other races, these rules
    almost always apply exclusively to interactions with other shobhads, and the
    Shobhad-neh see "lesser" races as little more than sheep to be culled.
    Typical shobhad warriors stand 12 feet tall and weigh 500 pounds, and their
    lean bodies are corded with ropes of muscle. Most shobhads prefer to go
    naked save for loincloths and the leather harnesses that crisscross their
    chests and secure their weapons in place. When they wear clothing, its
    either practical such as hide armor and wrappings that protect against
    biting sandstorms, or ceremonial like the brightly colored skins and
    feathers chieftains and shamans wear. Though shobhads can be found on
    occasion working as lone mercenaries in cities, such urban individuals are
    the exception rather than the rule. Shobhad shamans preach that in human
    cities, an individual is little more than a faceless cog in a machine,
    remembered by no one. Yet a shobhad warrior who rides heroically into battle
    atop her armored reptilian steed is never forgotten-neither by her own kin,
    nor by the families of those she defeats. Thus, in battle, a shobhad is made
    truly immortal.
  - SHOBHAD LONGRIFLE

    A shobhad longrifle is treated as a Large rifle (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate
    Equipment 46) with a range increment of 200 feet, but it functions only on
    low-gravity worlds.
