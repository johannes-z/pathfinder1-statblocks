Description:
  - >-
    Swarms of flesh-eating cockroaches are extremely virulent pests. Normally
    carnivorous scavengers, these vermin quickly transform into aggressive
    hunters when amassed in great numbers, actively seeking out territory and
    food and gravitating to locations that readily provide both, such as dumps,
    graveyards, sewers, swamps, and other foul areas filled with rotting waste.
  - >-
    Although a flesheating cockroach swarm prefers to feed on rot and carrion,
    these ravenous creatures do not balk at attacking living creatures as large
    as an elephant if given a chance.
