Description:
  - >-
    Although the nightcrawler might appear to be little more than an immense and
    frightening vermin, with its centipede-like body and numerous glowing eyes,
    it is actually incredibly intelligent. When not cleansing the deep caverns
    of life, the nightcrawler spends its time plotting how best to carry out its
    own private stages of the overall nightshade plan to expunge life from all
    worlds, conferring with its undead minions and, when necessary, observing
    living creatures from afar while invisible to learn about hidden enclaves
    that its depredations might otherwise have missed.
  - >-
    It would be one thing if the nightcrawlers remained in the deep caverns, for
    these regions are rife with foul life the world is better off without. Yet
    unfortunately for those who dwell upon the surface, nightcrawlers often
    crawl up through the tunnels to bring their devastation to the night above.
    Although they always retreat underground before the first tentative rays of
    dawn color the eastern skies, they can spread an incredible amount of ruin
    in the span of a few short hours each night.
  - A nightcrawler is 60 feet long and weighs 10,000 pounds.
