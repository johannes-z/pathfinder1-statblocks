  - name: Darting Claw (Ex)
    description: >-
      Evolved for snatching fast prey, a shark-eating crab is exceptionally
      quick with its claws. When making a full attack, if a shark-eating crab
      misses with both of its claw attacks, it can make an additional claw
      attack at a -2 penalty against any creature within its reach.
Description:
  - >-
    Extremely fast and agile for such a large creature, the shark-eating crab
    preys on predators of the sea. Not limiting its consumption to just sharks,
    these crabs feed on fast-moving fish like barracudas and tuna, and even
    mollusks like giant squid. Their hunting skills have evolved over the ages
    to track the movements of fast creatures swimming above them as the crabs
    blend into their surroundings.
  - >-
    The typical shark-eating crab stands 16 feet tall and weighs just over 4,000
    pounds.
