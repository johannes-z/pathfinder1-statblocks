Description:
  - >-
    The woolly mammoth is a relative of both the common elephant and the
    mastodon (see Mastodon elsewhere in this book). Like the mastodon, it is an
    herbivore and spends its days eating nuts, fruits, berries, and grasses. The
    typical mammoth consumes nearly 450 pounds of food and 50 gallons of water
    in a given day. Mammoths travel in herds with the young moving in the
    center, protected and surrounded by the adults. If danger is present or a
    threat is imminent, the males move to face the danger, while the females
    encircle the young. The woolly mammoth generally reproduces in the spring
    months with young being born about 22 months later. A young woolly mammoth
    resembles a miniature version of an adult, complete with fur, and under fur.
    It does not yet have the mighty tusks of the mammoth, though the tusks grow
    in quickly as the young mammoth reaches maturity (around age 12). The
    mammoth has the same predators as the mastodon; the dire wolf, the smilodon,
    and man. Man hunts these creatures for the same reason they hunt the
    mastodon: meat, fur, ivory, or to capture young mammoths to be trained as
    mounts and beasts of burden. The mammoth is a relative of the elephant and
    the mastodon though its head is slightly taller than an elephant's and
    slightly wider than a mastodon's. Its upward curving tusks are longer than
    those of the mastodon, and its trunk ends in two, small finger-like
    projections used for grasping branches, fruits, and other such small items.
    The mammoth stands about 22 feet tall and is covered in a thick coat of
    gray, brown, reddish-brown, yellowish-brown, or black fur with a coarse
    "under-fur" beneath it to protect it in harsh climates. Mammoths generally
    avoid combat unless provoked or the herd is threatened. They have no natural
    fear of any creature, so do not flee. If the herd is threatened, mammoths
    fight by goring with their tusks or trampling. Mammoths fight to the death
    to protect their young. Training a Mammoth A mammoth must be trained before
    it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a mammoth must have a friendly
    attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful
    Diplomacy check). Training a friendly mammoth requires six weeks of work and
    a successful Handle Animal check (DC 25). Riding a mammoth requires an
    exotic saddle. A mammoth can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider
    cannot also attack unless he or she makes a successful Ride check. Mammoth
    young are worth 13,000 gp each on the open market. Professional trainers
    charge up to 2,000 gp to rear or train a mammoth. Carrying Capacity: A light
    load for a mammoth is up to 4,152 pounds; a medium load, 4,153 to 8,304
    pounds; and a heavy load, 8,305 to 12,480 pounds. A mammoth can drag 62,400
    pounds. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
