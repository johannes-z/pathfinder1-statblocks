Description:
  - >-
    The oliphant is a 20-foot long creature resembling a mastodon. It is
    omnivorous and rarely makes its home near civilized or settled areas. Each
    of the creature's tusks, if wholly pried from a dead oliphant, brings 400 gp
    on the market. The oliphant's fur is thick, brown, and aids in protecting it
    from cooler climates and precipitation. Oliphants are sometimes trained as
    mounts or beasts of burden by various humanoid races. Oliphants seem to
    understand Common, but they do not speak it. An oliphant attacks with its
    downward curving tusks and heavy forelegs; its trunk is too short to be used
    as an effective weapon. Training an Oliphant An oliphant requires training
    before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, an oliphant must have a
    friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a
    successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly oliphant requires six weeks
    of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding an oliphant does not require
    an exotic saddle. An oliphant can fight while carrying a rider, but the
    rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check. Oliphant
    young are worth 2,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear
    or train an oliphant. Carrying Capacity: A light load for an oliphant is up
    to 2,400 pounds; a medium load, 2,401-4,800 pounds; and a heavy load,
    4,801-7,200 pounds. An oliphant can drag 36,000 pounds. Credit The Oliphant
