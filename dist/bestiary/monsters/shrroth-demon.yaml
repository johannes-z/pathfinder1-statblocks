SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sickening Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shrroth can emit a cloud of grayish liquid in a 40-foot spread once per
      minute as a free action. The cloud provides concealment and any creature
      in the area or entering the area must make a successful DC 24 Fortitude
      save or be sickened for 3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Jet (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shrroth can jet backward once per round as a full-round action at a
      speed of 240 feet. It must move in a straight line, and does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity while jetting.
Description:
  - >-
    Shrroths are the warriors of Dagon, Demon Prince of the Seas and serve in
    his abyssal army. When not fighting the abyssal wars among the demon
    princes, shrroths are often sent to the Material Plane to tempt and corrupt
    mortals with promises of power and wealth. Those refusing such offers are
    captured by the shrroth and brought to its Abyssal layer. They are confined
    in a stone cage and thrown into the Abyssal sea where they sink to the
    bottom and are never seen again.
  - >-
    Shrroths are malevolent creatures and though they follow the orders of their
    superiors, they are difficult to control. Fights amongst groups, packs, or
    battalions is not uncommon when there demons are involved, and such fights
    always end with the deaths of several of their number.
  - >-
    A shrroth is a 15-foot tall copper-colored demon with the lower torso of an
    octopus and the upper torso of a powerful humanoid. Its arms end in
    6-fingered talons. Its lower torso sports a mass of writing tentacles
    reaching lengths of 10 feet. Six larger tentacles stretching 20 feet
    surround the smaller tentacles. The shrroth's visage is one of hatred and
    despair. Its mouth is filled with serrated teeth and its eyes are violet. A
    mass of long black hair hangs from its head; from under which protrude two
    forward-curving, blackish horns.
  - >-
    Shrroths rarely confront creatures on land; they prefer to fight in the
    Abyssal waters of their native plane where they have the advantage.
  - These demons open combat using chaos hammer to batter their foes.
  - >-
    This is quickly followed by feeblemind against an arcane caster if one is
    present. If a shrroth grabs an opponent in its tentacles, it hangs on,
    constricts it and stabs it with its trident. When facing an air-breathing
    creature, the shrroth likes to cast water breathing on it, grab it, and swim
    as deep as it can in the water before dispelling the water breathing effect
    and watching the air-breather drown.
  - >-
    If in danger, or if facing powerful adversaries, the shrroth summons a horde
    of melethzus (see summon above) to aid it in battle or to cover its retreat.
