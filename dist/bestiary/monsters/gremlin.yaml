      restraints it ties using ropes.

      A gremlin can take only other gremlins through the passage and it cannot
      set triggering conditions to allow others to use the passage.
Description:
  - >-
    Gremlins are wicked fey beings who revel in destruction and creating mayhem.
    They are known to wreck machinery and equipment, often laying nasty traps
    behind, insuring that repair is next to impossible. Due to their phase door
    ability they can get inside even the most complicated and tight areas
    without fear of detection and remain as long as they like. Here they reside
    undetected until towers begin collapsing, forges explode, gates jam, and
    catapults begin to misfire. Once a village, city, or castle finds itself the
    unhappy host of a gremlin, it is almost impossible to root the creature out
    and remove it once and for all. Individual gremlins tend to scout out new
    areas in which to wreak havoc. Within weeks their numbers double, especially
    in high population areas where they may remain undetected for an extended
    period of time. A gremlin stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 40 pounds.
    When pressed into combat, gremlins fight with bites, claws and their wicked
    blades which are frequently slick with nasty venoms. They prefer to hide in
    shadows and lash out with their sneak attack and use their phase door
    ability to beat a hasty retreat. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
