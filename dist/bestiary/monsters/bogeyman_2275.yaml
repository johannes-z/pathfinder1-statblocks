Description_Visual: >-
  This creature resembles a man-sized translucent humanoid with delicate
  features not unlike those of a child. It wears flowing robes tied at the waist
  with a sash made of the same incorporeal stuff it is. The creature's face
  shows no emotion.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bump in the Night (Su)
    description: >-
      A bogeyman can create a phantasmagoric image in the mind of a single
      creature within 200 feet. Such images cause the victim to see and hear
      things that are not really there or to see and hear things differently
      than they actually are. Things such as following footsteps, bumps and
      thumps from an unknown source, a gnarled tree with outstretched limbs
      scratching on a window or reaching for someone, the idea that someone or
      something is lurking around the corner, in the closet, or under the bed,
      and so on. A creature affected by the images takes 1d4 points of Wisdom
      damage if it fails a DC 19 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and
      includes a +2 bonus from the bogeyman's Ability Focus feat. The bogeyman
      can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. A creature who drops to Wisdom
      0 is affected as if by an insanity spell (caster level 8th) until at least
      1 point of Wisdom is restored.
  - name: Frighten (Su)
    description: >-
      A living creature within 60 feet that views a bogeyman must succeed on a
      DC 17 Will save or stand frozen in fear for 1d6+2 rounds. Such a creature
      is not helpless, but cannot take any action. A creature that successfully
      saves cannot be affected again by the same bogeyman's frighten ability for
      one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Shadow Shift (Su)
    description: >-
      A bogeyman has the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a
      dimension door spell. The limitation is that the magical transport must
      begin and end in an area with at least some shadow. A bogeyman can shift
      up to a total of 80 feet each day in this way; this may be a single jump
      of 80 feet or multiple jumps of 10 feet each. This amount can be split
      among many jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot
      increment.
Description:
  - >-
    Bogeymen are the stuff of legends: creatures created in the minds of parents
    who relayed stories about incorporeal ghosts coming to carry their children
    off if they didn't go to bed when they were supposed to, didn't do their
    chores when asked, and so on. The apparitional bogeyman's ties to the land
    of the living are a result of these stories.
  - >-
    By their very nature, bogeymen are not evil. They derive more pleasure from
    tormenting and harassing an opponent rather than outright killing it.
    Generally if a bogeyman reduces a living creature to a comatose state (by
    draining its Wisdom) it leaves it where it falls. Bogeymen feed off the fear
    and madness induced in living creatures rather than their blood, life force,
    or flesh.
  - >-
    A bogeyman stands about 6 feet tall and appears as an incorporeal humanoid
    with a child-like countenance and delicate features. It robes and sash seem
    to constantly billow and blow as if by some unseen breeze.
  - >-
    A bogeyman rarely confronts a party of adventurers, preferring to attack a
    lone individual when it is most vulnerable. Bogeymen always attack at night;
    none have ever been encountered during daylight hours. A bogeyman that
    fancies a creature may stalk that being for days, torturing it with its bump
    in the night ability before finally driving the victim completely mad.
