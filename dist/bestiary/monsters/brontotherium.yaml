Description:
  - >-
    Brontotheriums (also called thunder beasts by some primitive tribes) are
    found on lost continents and large islands far from civilization. They dwell
    in wooded primeval forests bordering broad plains where there is plenty of
    vegetation for these herbivores to feast upon. They generally forage at
    night, in the early morning hours, or early evening hours so as to avoid the
    midday heat.
  - >-
    Territorial, herds tend to keep to themselves and sometimes clash with other
    herds of their kind, except on common ground (water holes, foraging areas,
    and so on). When two herds meet (on any ground other than mentioned above),
    the males quickly charge, butting heads and goring with their horns in an
    attempt to force the other herd to leave the area.
  - Mating season for brontotheriums occurs anytime throughout the year.
  - >-
    A male selects a female and fighting often ensues between them before the
    mating ritual begins. Gestation lasts for 400 days after which time the
    female gives birth to one live young. Within one year, the young becomes
    independent and no longer depends on its mother for food and protection.
  - >-
    Maturity is reached within 10 years (15 for females) and brontotheriums have
    an average lifespan of 40 years.
  - >-
    A brontotherium weighs two tons, is about 14 feet long, and stands eight
    feet tall at the shoulder. Its fur is dark brown or grayish-brown.
  - >-
    Brontotheriums defend their herds from hunters and predators by charging and
    goring foes with their massive horn. When a herd is in danger, they charge,
    tearing up everything in their path and trampling any lesser creatures which
    stand in their way. Sometimes before charging a brontotherium lets out a
    snort, growl, or roar to warn potential adversaries of its intent. If locked
    in combat defending the herd or young, a brontotherium always fights to the
    death.
