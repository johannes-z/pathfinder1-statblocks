  flares with untold magical power.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living rune is able to shift its coloration and form to blend into its
      surroundings. The creature automatically hits with its touch attack
      against any creature that fails to notice it and enters its square.
  - name: Glyph Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      A living rune deals 3d8 points of electricity damage with a successful
      touch attack, and it uses its Dexterity modifier (instead of its Strength
      modifier) to resolve all touch attacks.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living rune is immune to spells and spell-like abilities that allow
      spell resistance. In addition, certain other spells and effects function
      differently against the creature as noted below. • An erase spell deals
      6d6 points of damage to a living rune. • A living rune caught in the
      radius of any symbol spell is immune to its effects and heals 1d8 points
      of damage per spell level. Hit points beyond its total maximum are gained
      as temporary hit points that fade in 1 hour. • A living rune is affected
      normally by magic missile, maze, and spells that deal sonic damage.
  - name: Symbols of Power (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a living rune can shift its form into a number of
      powerful symbols whose effects can damage or incapacitate opponents. Each
      round the living rune can choose a new effect, but a particular symbol
      form can only be used once every 4 rounds. This attack is resolved with a
      touch attack and the save DC is Charisma-based. Fear: The target becomes
      panicked for 2d6 rounds (Will DC 24). Pain: The target suffers wracking
      pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability
      checks for 1 hour (Fort DC 24). Persuasion: The target is charmed by the
      living rune (as charm monster) for 2d6 hours (Will DC 24). Slow: The
      target is slowed (as the slow spell) for 12 rounds (Will DC 24). Stunning:
      The target is stunned for 1d6 rounds (Fort DC 24). Weakness: The target
      suffers crippling weakness that deals 2d6 points of Strength damage (Fort
      DC 24).
  - name: Truescript (Su)
    description: >-
      A living rune can sculpt its form into complicated scripts and pictographs
      that can be understood by any creature with the ability to read written
      language. A living rune can also understand any written or spoken
      language. Two-Dimensional (Ex) A living rune only exists in two
      dimensions, and has some qualities in common with incorporeal creatures. A
      living rune has no Strength score. It cannot move in three dimensions
      (such as jumping or flying), and can only navigate along solid surfaces
      such as floors, ceilings, and walls. It can only attack creatures by
      entering their squares and touching them directly. A living rune can crawl
      onto solid surfaces that can then themselves be moved (such as onto a tome
      via its telekinesis spell-like ability). It cannot fall or take falling
      damage, cannot make trip or grapple attacks, and cannot be tripped or
      grappled. It cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate
      an opponent or the opponent's equipment, has no weight, and does not set
      off traps that are triggered by weight. A living rune takes no damage from
      nonmagical attacks and only takes half damage from magical weapons.
Description:
  - >-
    Whether first scribed by some forgotten deity or birthed by magic glyphs
    long soured, living runes are among the most stubborn and arrogant of
    dungeon denizens.
  - >-
    Though two-dimensional and lacking any sort of real body, the creatures are
    sentient, but with a venomous hostility toward the so-called "lesser races"
    they feel are corrupted forms of the universe's first words of creation.
    Appearing as magical glyphs, animated pulsating runes, etched hieroglyphics,
    or even ancient cave art, these creatures live to prey on lesser beings for
    no other reason than to prove their superiority over flesh-and-blood
    creatures.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Living runes are ambush hunters, lying in wait amid ancient graffiti and
    faded pictographs, or even on the pages of ancient texts and tomes. They use
    their mutable forms to camouf lage themselves-often changing texts with
    illusory script to lead adventurers into nearby traps or hazards, or lacing
    important sources of information with explosive runes and then striking at
    trespassers when they have triggered the dangerous glyphs. Immortal unless
    destroyed, the creatures do not need sustenance in a traditional sense,
    though, like their will-o'-wisp cousins, they seem to feed on the terror and
    pain they induce in their victims. In addition to fear and pain, living
    runes feed on the written word (which they can erase through this
    consumption or leave unharmed). Living runes reproduce by a strange sort of
    mitosis, where two creatures merge to create complex sentence structures and
    concepts before splitting a portion off each of their malleable bodies to
    create a new unique rune that contains the knowledge of both parent runes.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Most commonly found in deserted ruins-in particular old alchemical labs,
    forgotten temples, and musty libraries- living runes prefer to live isolated
    existences, feeding on lost knowledge, consuming it slowly over the years
    before erasing or altering it, then hoarding the truth within themselves to
    tease races seeking to recover it. For this reason, they prefer to haunt the
    fringes of civilization, where they may terrorize lesser creatures in this
    manner- particularly arcane spellcasters. They derive a sick pleasure from
    the mental and physical torture of humanoids; in particular, they enjoy
    cornering humanoids in debates and wrapping them in riddles with the promise
    of shared knowledge or information, before ultimately growing bored and
    attacking the intruders with their myriad abilities. Such communications
    always begin-in the living rune's unique form of communication-with
    scribbled inquiries trespassing creatures will understand, and this somewhat
    playful and innocuous introduction often draws explorers to their deaths
    when they assume they are conversing with some benign artificial
    intelligence. In instances becoming horrifically frequent, archivists have
    discovered previously unheard of colonies of living runes deep in the bowels
    of urban libraries and archives, hiding out for years in an attempt to learn
    more of modern civilization, with unknown motivations that may hold terrible
    consequences for civilized races.

    Origins In the annals of recorded history, ancient texts mentioning living
    runes always seem to do so in relation to the forgotten goddess Lissala,
    leading scholars to believe that either the creatures served worshipers of
    the deity in some way, or were rewarded as gifts to particularly devout
    supplicants. Some even speculate that Lissala herself is responsible for the
    creation of living runes. Others conjecture that living runes have always
    been, and are among the universe's eldest creatures, having escaped from the
    lips of some primordial god when the first words of creation were uttered.
    Evidence seems to dispute both these claims-the creatures are known to
    spring up from the scribbled text and graffiti of magic-soured ruins or
    untriggered symbol spells long left to rot. Whatever the truth, these
    haughty creatures do not discuss their origins.
