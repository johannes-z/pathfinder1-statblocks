  - name: Darkness Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a mythic worg can activate its darkness aura, which
      reduces the light level within 30 feet of it by one step. This never
      reduces the light level to supernatural darkness. Multiple worgs within
      range can reduce the light level multiple steps. Because a mythic worg has
      darkvision and low-light vision, this ability never interferes with its
      own vision. It can end this ability as a free action.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic worg is a creature of fear and foul darkness, usually born under an
    ominous new moon or by the intervention of a deity of shadows and terror.
    Many serve vampires, protecting their masters from hunters and hazardous
    daylight.
