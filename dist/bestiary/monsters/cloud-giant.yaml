Description:
  - >-
    Cloud giants' skin ranges in color from milky white to powder blue. Adult
    males are about 18 feet tall and weigh around 5,000 pounds. Females are
    slightly shorter and lighter. Cloud giants can live to be 400 years old, and
    dress in the finest clothing and jewelry available. To many, appearance
    indicates station. The better the clothes and the finer the jewelry, the
    more important the wearer. They also appreciate music, and most can play one
    or more instruments (the harp is a favorite). Cloud giants have an unusually
    wide alignment spread- approximately half are good and half are evil. Good
    cloud giants build roads from their settlements to connect with other
    humanoid roads in order to foster trade. It's not uncommon to see a good
    cloud giant walking among humans, for example, in a human city near a tall
    mountain range. Evil cloud giants tend not to bother with permanent
    settlements and instead live on high peaks in crude shelters, only coming
    down to raid villages for whatever they might need. These two philosophies
    often see violent and long-lasting wars erupt between neighboring tribes.
    Legends abound of magical cloud giant cities nestled in the very clouds
    themselves that float with the winds and circumnavigate the world. While
    most cloud giants recognize this as a fantasy, there are some who not only
    claim to have seen them but have dedicated the entirety of their long lives
    to finding them again.
