Description_Visual: >-
  A roiling mass of rubbery skin and flailing limbs surges towards you. Demonic
  eyes stare at you above slack, fang-filled mouths. This horde is comprised of
  small creatures with pale, hairless hide compressed so close together that it
  is difficult to tell where one of these rabid monstrosities ends and the next
  one begins.
Group: Megaswarm
Source: Tome of Horrors 4
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Feral Rage (Ex)
    description: >-
      Dretch megaswarms attack in a mindless mob intent only tearing apart those
      that fall into their clutches. This frenzy prevents them from using any of
      their regularly-available spell-like or summoning abilities. However, the
      wild abandon of their attack allows them to deal 6d6 points of damage to
      any creature whose space they occupy at the end of their move rather than
      the 4d6 typical for a swarm of their HD. This ability is lost if the swarm
      is broken up.
  - name: Megaswarm Traits (Ex)
    description: >-
      Megaswarms are not so called because of the size of the swarm but rather
      the size of the creatures that compose the swarm. Unlike normal swarms,
      megaswarms are composed of Small creatures which are usually a megafauna
      version of a normal swarm and otherwise behave in a swarmlike manner.
      There are usually around 100 creatures in a megaswarm. The net effect is
      that they take only half damage from piercing weapons but take normal
      damage from other weapons. In addition when the swarm is reduced to 0 hit
      points or lower and breaks up, unless the damage was dealt by
      area-affecting attacks, then 2d6 surviving members of the megaswarm
      continue their attack, though now only as individual creatures. Otherwise,
      a megaswarm conforms to all of the other swarm traits as described in the
      Pathfinder RPG Bestiary.
  - name: Smite Good (Su)
    description: >-
      The collective chaos and evil concentrated in the existence of a dretch
      megaswarm allows the swarm deal extra damage equal to its HD (+16) once
      per day against a good foe. This ability is lost if the swarm is broken
      up.
Description:
  - >-
    The lowly dretch are the most moblike of the demons and in certain crowded
    conditions actually develop a pack mentality and form a swarm. In their
    rabid mob, dretch swarms lose their ability to communicate with others
    telepathically, though they can still receive the telepathic commands of
    other demons to guide them in their attacks.
  - >-
    If the swarm breaks up, then surviving dretches continue their attacks,
    though now as individual creatures regaining their normal abilities and
    tactics (see Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary) and losing their feral
    rage.
  - >-
    Like individual dretches, dretch megaswarms rely on their sheer numbers when
    attacking. Unlike individuals, though, megaswarms are not cowardly and
    attack in a maddened frenzy regardless of the damage they are taking or the
    stoutness of the adversity. Their own mob mentality prods them on so that
    the commanding presence of a more powerful demon is not required to motivate
    them.
  - >-
    A dretch megaswarm's natural attacks are treated as chaotic-aligned and
    evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
