SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Ex)
    description: >-
      A taniniver's breath weapon is a hideous gray cloud of disease particles.
      Any creature in the area must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or
      contract mummy rot (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 210). The disease is
      contracted immediately (the onset period does not apply) and is an
      instantaneous effect. Ongoing saving throws against the disease use the
      dragon's breath weapon DC. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      A taniniver's natural attacks infect its opponent with a random disease
      from the following list: blinding sickness, bubonic plague, cackle fever,
      leprosy, mindfire, or shakes. The initial saving throw against these
      diseases uses the breath weapon's DC.
Description:
  - >-
    Taninivers are a degenerate race of diseased dragons. A taniniver's body is
    alive but constantly rotting. Wracked by never-ending pain, with the stench
    of its own decaying flesh so strong it nearly overwhelms the vile creature's
    enhanced senses, the foul taniniver spends most of its time in magical
    research to reverse the progression of its diseases or, failing that, to
    stave off further deterioration. Taninivers often ally with cults of undeath
    or dragonkind.
