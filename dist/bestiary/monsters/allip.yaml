SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Babble (Su)
    description: >-
      An allip constantly mutters to itself, creating a hypnotic effect. All
      sane creatures within 60 feet of the allip must succeed at a DC 15 Will
      save or be fascinated for 2d4 rounds. While a target is fascinated, the
      allip can approach it without breaking the effect, but an attack by the
      allip does end the effect. Creatures that successfully save cannot be
      affected by the same allip's babble for 24 hours. This is a sonic,
      mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Madness (Su)
    description: >-
      Anyone targeting an allip with a thought detection, mind control, or
      telepathic effect makes direct contact with its tortured mind and takes
      1d4 points of Wisdom damage.
  - name: Touch of Insanity (Su)
    description: >-
      The touch of an allip deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (DC 15 Will
      negates). A successful critical hit causes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage and
      1 point of Wisdom drain (instead of double Wisdom damage). With each
      successful attack, an allip gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Those who fall prey to madness and take their own lives sometimes find
    themselves lost on the path to the afterlife, trapped in a state between
    life and death. These unfortunates, known as allips, suffer from the violent
    and incurable insanity they faced in life and take out their terror,
    confusion, and rage upon the living. They reach out to those they
    encounter-possibly in wrath, but also perhaps oblivious to their own insane
    nature-spreading the psychoses that led to their own untimely deaths.
  - >-
    In combat, allips relentlessly attack the nearest living creature, relying
    on their babble to let them close in before attacking with their touch of
    insanity. Many seem to be driven to states of ferocity upon witnessing the
    terror living creatures exhibit when facing their spectral forms, or when
    faced with the intangibility of their incorporeal states. While allips have
    no way to kill creatures, those knocked unconscious by an allip's
    Wisdom-draining touch often emerge from the state suffering from insanity
    (see pages 250-251 of the GameMastery Guide)-a fate that many would say
    qualifies as worse than death.
  - >-
    Allips often seek to harm those who played a part in causing their mad,
    unholy condition. When faced with such foes, an allip ignores all other
    targets that confront it in favor of its hated enemies, attacking them until
    its tormentors have been forced into a vacant stupor. Alas, such vengeance
    does not put the allip to rest, but simply serves to further fuel its
    madness as it finds itself trapped in a world now no longer even holding the
    satisfaction of vengeance.
