  lifeless head. The creature floats a few feet above the ground.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Annihilating Wail (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per minute, a galley beggar can emit a piercing and heart-stopping
      scream that affects all creatures within 60 feet that hear it. Affected
      creatures must make a DC 18 Fortitude save. Those making their save are
      blinded for 1d4+4 rounds. Those failing their save take 10d6 points of
      damage. A creature that makes its save is immune to the annihilating wail
      of that galley beggar for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Draining Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      The incorporeal touch of a galley beggar drains 1d4 points of Charisma. On
      a successful attack, the galley beggar also heals 5 points of damage to
      itself.
  - name: Incorporeal Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      By passing part of its incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard
      action, the galley beggar inflicts 5d6+3 damage. This damage is not
      negative energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from
      supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this
      damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A
      Fortitude save halves the damage inflicted.
  - name: Unholy Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      A galley beggar adds its Charisma modifier to damage for its incorporeal
      touch attack.
Description:
  - >-
    Galley beggars are the ghostly remains of travelers who met their demise
    before their journey was complete. Therefore most encounters with galley
    beggars occur on roads and paths between cities and towns. A galley beggar
    generally haunts a single area of no more than 1 square mile, and though it
    is not tied to the area, it rarely ever ventures far from the place where it
    died.
  - >-
    A galley beggar is a hateful creature, unhappy and resentful of its current
    state of unlife. It seeks nothing more than to kill any living creature it
    encounters.
  - >-
    Galley beggars are believed to speak Common and at least one other language,
    though sages are unsure of this as no galley beggar has ever conversed with
    a living creature (or at least conversed with any living creature that lived
    to tell about it).
  - >-
    A galley beggar begins combat the instant it encounters a living creature.
    It opens a battle using its annihilating wail if any opponent is within
    range by extending a skeletal arm and showing its severed head to its foes.
    If no opponent is within range the galley beggar moves in and uses its
    annihilating wail as soon as possible. It follows this with its incorporeal
    or draining touch.
