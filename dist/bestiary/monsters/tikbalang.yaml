SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Spines (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a tikbalang can launch four spines from its mane,
      each dealing 1d6 points of damage plus its Strength bonus. This attack has
      a range of 120 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30
      feet of each other. A tikbalang can launch only 24 spines in any 24-hour
      period.
Description:
  - >-
    Dangerous protectors of deep forests and lush jungles, tikbalangs are
    malicious creatures that enjoy leading travelers astray. Tikbalangs mimic
    sounds to lure explorers off their determined path, even separating a single
    traveler from his group and kidnapping him. They use their magical abilities
    to make the forest confusing to those passing through, often weaving
    illusions around a path to hide important turns or cloaking the entire
    jungle in an unfamiliar appearance. Sometimes a tikbalang stalks intruders,
    spying on them from afar or from within the canopies of trees to learn more
    about its visitors. It then uses its change shape ability to appear as
    someone familiar to its first victim (such as another member of the group)
    and leads that person deeper into the woods to become lost. Once the victim
    is out of hearing range, the tikbalang drags it into a high tree, wraps it
    in vines, and packs its mouth with leaves and moss to stif le its screams.
    The tikbalang may eat its prisoner, offer to release it if the other
    intruders leave, or leave its corpse as a grisly warning to other travelers.
    Though sinister and always looking to bring ruin to explorers, tikbalangs
    can be bribed or mollified into allowing safe passage with offerings or the
    performance of strange rituals, such as singing a song, wearing a shirt
    inside out, or giving the monster bread and honey. The exact bribe is
    different each day, and the tikbalang never explains what it wants.
