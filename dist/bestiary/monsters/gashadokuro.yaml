    description: A gashadokuro can breathe bone shards as a standard action.
  - name: Corpse Consumption (Su)
    description: >-
      A gashadokuro that kills creature by using its swallow whole special
      ability automatically consumes its victim's body and regains a number of
      hit points equal to the victim's Constitution score. Consumed creatures
      cannot be resurrected by any effect short of a miracle or wish spell until
      the gashadokuro is destroyed.
  - name: Starvation Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A gashadokuro emits a powerful aura that causes all creatures within range
      to feel the intense pains of starvation. Each creature within 60 feet must
      succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be fatigued and succumb to the
      supernatural starvation of the gashadokuro, taking 2d6 points of nonlethal
      damage at the end of its turn each round it remains in the aura. Even
      after leaving the area or slaying the gashadokuro, an affected creature
      continues to starve and cannot heal from the nonlethal damage dealt by
      this ability until it consumes food (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444).
Description:
  - >-
    Gashadokuros are enormous skeletons that come into being as a result of mass
    starvation. The victims of such a tragedy fuse together into an undead
    colossus that continues to hunger even in death. A gashadokuro uses its
    feral instincts to hunt living creatures, forever seeking to sate its
    ineradicable, collective memory of starvation. A typical gashadokuro is 30
    feet tall and weighs up to 5,000 pounds.
