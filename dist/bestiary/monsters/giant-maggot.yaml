SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Regurgitate (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a giant maggot can empty its putrid stomach upon one
      creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be
      sickened for 1 minute (or until the target spends a full-round action with
      at least a gallon of water to wash off the filth). The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Voracious scavengers, giant maggots feed constantly, gorging themselves on
    the dead in preparation for their transformation into giant flies. Their
    pallid, corpulent bodies are the size of human children, and their rasping
    teeth are capable of eating even the bones of a corpse. Giant maggots have
    no legs, and move with a disturbing undulation as they crawl over their
    meals.
  - >-
    Giant maggots feed for 2 weeks (often moving from one corpse to another)
    before entering a pupal stage, after which they emerge as giant flies.
