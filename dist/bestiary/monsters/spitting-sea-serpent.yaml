Description:
  - >-
    Spitting sea serpents are a fiercely territorial if not terribly intelligent
    species that can be a great hazard on unfamiliar coasts. They are renowned
    for their great ability to spit globs of acidic spittle onto creatures that
    threaten them. The spitting sea serpent always tries to use its spitting
    attack against any that anger it, using its bite and constriction attacks
    against food or as a last resort.
  - >-
    A spitting sea serpent prefers to dwell in shallow coastal waters and
    coastlines, and avoids deep water where they are ill-equipped to handle
    encounters with large marine predators, against which their ability to spit
    is ineffective. They prefer to live in wild, uncivilized lands, and fiercely
    protect their hunting grounds from intrusion by any other predators.
