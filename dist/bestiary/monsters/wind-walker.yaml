  - name: Detect Thoughts (Sp)
    description: >-
      For every wind walker present within 100 feet, the range of this
      spell-like ability increases by 100 feet.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A wind walker is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance (except those that summon or call it). In addition,
      certain spells and effects function differently against the creature as
      noted below. A control weather spell instantly slays a wind walker if it
      fails a Fortitude save against the spell. A haste spell deals 1d6 points
      of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6) to a wind walker. A
      Fortitude save halves the damage. In addition, a haste spell increases the
      damage the wind walker deals with its wind blast attack by +1d6 for one
      round. An ice storm spell deals no damage to a wind walker, but is
      affected as if by a fear spell if it fails a Will saving throw against ice
      storm. A slow spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum
      10d6) to a wind walker. A Will save halves the damage. A summoned or
      called wind walker is affected normally by magical barriers that restrict
      or inhibit called or summoned creatures (such as antimagic field).
  - name: Wind Blast (Ex)
    description: >-
      A wind walker attacks using the air surrounding it, transforming it into a
      forceful blast that deals 2d6+6 points of damage to all creatures within
      reach. The wind walker makes a single attack roll at its full attack bonus
      against each opponent within reach as a standard action.
Description:
  - >-
    Wind walkers are creatures from the Plane of Air. They are often summoned to
    the material plane by clerics or wizards who employ them as guards. On
    occasion, a wind walker is encountered in the service of a cloud giant,
    djinn, efreet, storm giant, or other such creature.
  - >-
    A wind walker's natural form is that of a roaring and whistling column of
    wind about 12 feet tall. No discernable features can be seen in the wind
    walker.
  - A wind walker attacks by using the surrounding air to pummel its foes.
