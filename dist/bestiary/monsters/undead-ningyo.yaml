Description_Visual: >-
  The repulsively fused features of a dried fish and desiccated humanoid combine
  in these monstrous remains. The crackle of tiny grinding bones and the hiss of
  parched scales whisper with every motion as the snarling miniature mummy drags
  its shriveled corpse forward.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Startle (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature of 5 Hit Dice or fewer that is attacked by an undead ningyo
      in a surprise round must make a DC 14 Will save or be frightened for 1d4
      rounds. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, it is shaken for 1 round.
      Whether or not the save is successful, the affected creature is immune to
      the same undead ningyo's startle attack for 24 hours. Creatures with 6 or
      more HD are immune to this effect. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The bane of fishermen and divers, ningyos lurk in tropical waters, gorging
    themselves on fish and attacking anything they can sink their tiny fangs
    into. Nasty little things, these primitive, miniature mer-monsters are
    bogeymen of the sea, often attacking seagoers, ships, and fishing tackle out
    of both blind ravenousness and blunt stupidity. With little more
    organization or society than a school of sharks, these cannibalistic
    half-simian, half-fish terrors swarm by night and can easily drag those
    caught on moonlit waters down to drown amid a sea of tiny claws and needling
    teeth. Yet for all their animal ferocity, ningyos are most notorious for
    their unquiet deaths. Said by natives to be too mean and stupid to die, a
    slain ningyo always returns to life by night, obliviously adopting old
    habits or dragging itself forth from the water to find its killer. By day,
    though, undead ningyos turn back into normal corpses, sometimes washing up
    on shore as gruesome and fascinating-but potentially deadly-curiosities.
    While the knowledgeable burn the eerie corpses they find along the coast,
    more than one foolhardy beachcomber has collected such an oddity, only to
    later awake in terror, the tiny withered claws and broken teeth of his weird
    curio savaging him in the dark. Ningyos measure approximately 2 to 2-1/2
    feet long from head to tail, and weigh 6 to 9 pounds. Ningyos on Golarion
    Ningyos have harassed and terrorized those dwelling along warm coasts for
    ages, proving most common along the west coast of Garund and the eastern
    shores of Arcadia. Well informed by the native folklore of those areas, most
    locals easily avoid and deal with the nasty mer-creatures. Visitors and
    invaders of such areas, though, are rarely so well informed. The Fetching
    Fishwife: This saltencrusted beach house-turned-inn teeters on a rocky beach
    a short ride north of Eleder. Popular with visitors and those seeking to
    escape the city's roughand- tumble confusion, the Fishwife offers fine
    rooms, good food, and a collection of eclectic decor- from bestial trophies
    and wall mountings to native artistry. It also bears a curse. Four guests
    and two owners have met gruesome deaths in the inn, and the most recent
    landlord quietly fled Sargava, leaving the keys to the house and a tiny,
    withered claw to his estranged brother. Kimbal Pall, the current owner, now
    runs the tavern, having no idea he holds a piece of an undead ningyo lurking
    in his collection. Treasure at Bloodcove: The treacherous inlets southwest
    of Bloodcove have long been a favorite stop for Shackles pirates, those with
    both booty to bury and plots to pillage the Kaava Lands' coastal tribes.
    Recently, a masked shaman has been sighted wandering between these coves,
    attended by a large, murderous swarm of ningyos. Although the witch doctor
    seems to only feed the nasty sea monsters fish heads and bird carcasses,
    they obey her every command, driving off the curious as they endlessly scour
    the sea floor, as if for some unknown treasure.
