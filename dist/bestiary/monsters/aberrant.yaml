SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Deformities (Ex)
    description: >-
      Aberrants possess an assortment of terrible deformities unique to each
      individual creature. When determining the deformities of a typical
      aberrant, roll randomly or choose 1d4-1 deformities from the Aberrant
      Deformities table. If two deformities are contradictory, reroll or select
      another. Racial bonuses gained from different deformities are cumulative.
      For each deformity an aberrant possesses, it gains a -2 racial penalty on
      Charisma-based checks with non-aberrants except for Intimidate checks,
      where it instead gains a +2 racial bonus.
  - name: Oversized Weapon Fighting (Ex)
    description: >-
      The twisted bodies of aberrants allow them to wield weapons designed for
      Huge-sized creatures without penalty, as if they were Large-sized weapons.
  - name: Slow and Steady (Ex)
    description: >-
      Aberrants have a base speed of 20 feet, but their speed is never modified
      by armor or encumbrance.
Description:
  - >-
    Aberrants make their homes in caves, abandoned mines, or deep underground
    away from civilization. They shun contact with outsiders except when raiding
    or ambushing travelers who have ventured near their lair. Captured
    trespassers are kept for food, slaves, or traded to other aberrant clans for
    goods. Aberrants are shunned by other giants and take great pleasure in
    attacking, killing, or maiming other giants and those that despise them.
    Aberrants stand about 14 feet tall, with malformed, grotesquely deformed
    bodies. Aberrants engage their enemies with their greatclubs. Their various
    deformities prevent them from hurling rocks. Though not as dim-witted as
    some other giants, aberrants generally employ less than graceful tactics and
    do little more than pound their enemies into paste with their clubs.
    Aberrant Society The strong rule, and the weak fall. That is the way of life
    for the aberrants. Each tribe or clan is led by the largest and strongest
    aberrant. All others rank beneath the leader. New leaders are appointed when
    the current leader dies. A contest of skill is held with the survivor being
    elected the new tribal leader and the loser being buried with his fellow
    giants. Aberrant tribes often capture defeated foes and keep them as slaves
    or trade them to other tribes in exchange for food, goods, or services.
    Aberrant Characters Aberrant leaders are barbarians or adepts. Most groups
    of aberrants include clerics with access to any two of the following
    domains: Chaos, Evil, Trickery, and War (most choose Chaos and Trickery).
    +12 Strength, -2 Dexterity, +6 Constitution, +4 Wisdom. Aberrants are
    powerful and hardy, and unusually canny creatures. Large Size: -1 penalty to
    AC, -1 penalty to attack rolls, -4 penalty on Stealth checks, +1 bonus on
    CMB and CMD, lifting and carrying limits double those of Medium creatures.
    Space/Reach: 10 ft./10 ft. Darkvision: Aberrants can see in the dark up to
    60 feet. Low-Light Vision: Aberrants can see twice as far as humans in dimly
    lit conditions. Racial Hit Dice: An aberrant begins with eight levels of
    humanoid, which provide 8d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +6, and base
    saving throw bonuses of Fort +6, Ref +2, and Will +2. Racial Skills: An
    aberrant's humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 8 x (2 + Int
    modifier). Racial Feats: An aberrant's humanoid levels give it four feats.
    AC: +7 natural armor bonus. Special Attacks: Oversized weapon fighting,
    deformities (see above). Special Qualities: Deformities, slow and steady
    (see above). Weapon Familiarity: Aberrants are proficient with simple and
    martial weapons. Armor Familiarity: Aberrants are proficient with light and
