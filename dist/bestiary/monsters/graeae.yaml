Description_Visual: >-
  Haggard and hunched, this blind and snaggletoothed crone guides herself by a
  gruesomely bloated eyeball she clutches in her claws.

IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Coven (Ex)
    description: >-
      Like hags, graeaes also form covens. A graeae coven can be composed
      entirely of graeaes, or could or include hags or witches with the coven
      hex. A hag or witch with the coven hex counts as a graeae for purposes of
      joining a graeae's coven. Likewise, a graeae counts as a hag for purposes
      of joining a hag's coven.
  - name: Eye of the Graeae (Su)
    description: >-
      Each graeae possesses a mystic eyeball. A graeae can sense the location of
      her eyeball from anywhere on the same plane. She must remain within 30
      feet of her eyeball or she becomes completely blind and cannot use any of
      her spell-like or supernatural abilities. The eyeball only works for its
      graeae. If a graeae is slain, her mystic eye instantly turns to dust.
  - name: Fate Casting (Su)
    description: >-
      A graeae has the ability to predict future events. On a creature's
      request, a graeae can expend a use of mythic power as a full-round action
      to answer a single question as if by the divination spell.
  - name: Luck Ripple (Su)
    description: >-
      A graeae can use her mystic eye to alter the circumstances of any creature
      within 30 feet. As a swift action, she can cast her eye on a single
      creature, causing the target to take a -2 penalty or gain a +2 bonus to
      one of the following (graeae's choice): AC, ability checks, attack rolls,
      saving throws, or skill checks. A successful DC 19 Will save negates the
      effect, which otherwise lasts for 1d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting
      gaze effect. The DC of the save is Intelligence-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A graeae is a haglike creature, though more human in appearance. Some
    describe them as emissaries of the gods, while others believe graeaes to be
    physical manifestations of fate.
  - GRAEAE COVEN
  - >-
    Whenever three or more graeaes of the same coven are within 10 feet of one
    another, they can work together to use any of the following spell-like
    abilities: clairaudience/clairvoyance, commune, contact other plane, speak
    with dead, and tongues. All three graeaes must spend a full-round action to
    take part in this form of cooperative magic. All coven spell-like abilities
    are CL 9th (or at the highest caster level available to the most powerful
    graeaes in the coven).
