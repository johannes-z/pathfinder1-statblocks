SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      While ash giants are immune to disease, they carry a contagious form of
      leprosy. Any creature struck by an ash giant's attacks is exposed to this
      virulent sickness. Ash Leprosy: Injury; save Fort 23; onset 1 minute;
      frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Con damage, 1d2 Cha drain; cure 2 consecutive
      saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Oversized Weapon (Ex)
    description: An ash giant can wield Huge weapons without penalty.
  - name: Vermin Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy ability, save that it
      works only on vermin. An ash giant uses its Hit Dice (normally 14) as its
      effective druid level. Vermin are normally mindless, but this empathic
      communication imparts upon them a modicum of implanted intelligence,
      allowing the ash giant to train vermin and use them as guardians (although
      it does not grant them skills or feats).
Description:
  - >-
    Whether because of disruptive magic, unearthed deep elements, or alien
    technology that fell calamitously from the sky, ash giants are victims of
    their barren terrains. Yet they somehow survive and even thrive in these
    desperate lands. Ash giants have an uncanny ability to bond with the
    enormous and often mutated vermin they share the landscape with, and
    sometimes use the largest of these creatures as mounts.
  - >-
    Ash giants are brash and violent, and their humor is incredibly dark.
    Killing someone through a prank is just as funny as tripping a friend while
    on a hunt. While not inherently evil, lifetimes of being antagonized by
    other tribes have practically bred violence into their minds.
  - Ash giants are 10 feet tall and weigh 1,200 pounds.
