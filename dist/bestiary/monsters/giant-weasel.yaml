Description:
  - >-
    Like their smaller cousins, giant weasels have long, slender bodies and
    short legs, and come in a variety of colors from reddish brown to snowy
    white. Giant weasels are active and tenacious predators, and have a
    reputation for being as clever as they are quick. Both highly aggressive and
    extremely territorial, they frequently attack creatures that are much larger
    than they are. Giant weasels are often trained to serve as guards and mounts
    by various Small humanoid s . Adult giant weasels can grow to be 5 feet
    long, stand as high as 2-1/2 feet tall at the shoulder, and weigh up to 150
    pounds.
