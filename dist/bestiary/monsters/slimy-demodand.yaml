SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Su)
    description: >-
      A slimy demodand is coated in an ever-dripping layer of acid that deals an
      extra 2d6 points of acid damage on a successful natural attack. In
      addition, opponents that successfully strike a slimy demodand with an
      unarmed strike or natural attack take 2d6 points of acid damage.
  - name: Dread Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      A slimy demodand adds 1-1/2 times its strength bonus on all attack rolls
      made when using its claws.
Description:
  - >-
    Slimy demodands are more muscular than shaggy demodands, but aren't as lithe
    or quick as their tarry brethren. They have froglike heads, similar to those
    of the shaggy demodands, but their constantly darting eyes give them a more
    feral look. A slimy demodand stands 6 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.
  - >-
    Slimy demodands often serve as shock troops in demodand armies, but they are
    also frequently put in charge of gathering and keeping slaves. Slimy
    demodands have no magical mind control powers, but prefer to rely upon
    intimidation and physical threats anyway to manage their slaves and keep
    them in line.
