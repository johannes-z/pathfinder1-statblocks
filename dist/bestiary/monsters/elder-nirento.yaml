Description:
  - >-
    Nirentos are predatory plants with brutish intelligence, their thorny vines
    able to tear foes limb from limb. A nirento lures prey toward it by swaying
    its branches and vines in a visually stimulating dance, striking at victims
    mercilessly once they are within range of its natural weapons. Slain prey
    then piles up around the tree's base and is absorbed through its roots.
    Nirentos' spongy bodies ensure they absorb most physical blows, though they
    remain susceptible to slashes and cuts, and when so injured, a translucent
    green sap oozes from their wounds.
  - >-
    Elder nirentos are individuals that have lived for well over a century, and
    have absorbed nutrients from countless victims over the years. A typical
    nirento is 15 feet tall and weighs 1,000 pounds, while elder nirentos can
    reach heights of up to 25 feet and weigh over a ton.
