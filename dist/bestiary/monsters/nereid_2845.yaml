SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Beguiling Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature sexually attracted to women runs the risk of being beguiled
      by a nereid if it looks upon her beauty from a distance of 30 feet or
      less. If the creature fails a DC 25 Will save, it is immediately
      fascinated. A nereid may use her suggestion spell-like ability at will
      against creatures that are fascinated by her beguiling aura. This is a
      mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Drowning Kiss (Su)
    description: >-
      A nereid can flood the lungs of a willing, helpless, or fascinated
      creature by touching it (traditionally by kissing the creature on the
      lips). If the target cannot breathe water, it cannot hold its breath and
      immediately begins to drown. On its turn, the target can attempt a DC 23
      Fortitude save to cough up this water; otherwise it falls unconscious at 0
      hp. On the next round, the target must save again or drop to -1 hit points
      and be dying; on the third round it must save again or die (see page 445
      of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Touch or spray-contact; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds;
      effect 1d2 Con plus blindness; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Shawl (Ex)
    description: >-
      A nereid's shawl (hardness 2, hp 6) contains a portion of her life force.
      If the shawl is ever destroyed, the Nereid takes 1d6 points of
      Constitution drain per hour until she dies. A nereid can craft a new shawl
      from water by making a DC 25 Will save, but each attempt takes 1d4 hours
      to complete. Attempts to destroy or steal a nereid's shawl require the
      sunder or disarm attempts.
  - name: Transparency (Su)
    description: >-
      When underwater, a nereid's body becomes transparent, effectively
      rendering her invisible. She can become visible or transparent at will as
      a free action.
  - name: Unearthly Grace (Su)
    description: >-
      A nereid adds her Charisma bonus as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class
      and CMD if she wears no armor.
Description:
  - >-
    The nereid's true form is that of a pool of water (a Medium water
    elemental). It can assume humanoid form at will (as a free action) and
    usually takes the form of a very beautiful female with long golden hair,
    pearly white skin, and green, almond-shaped eyes. Many sailors, seafarers,
    pirates, and other sea-goers have met their ends at the hands of the nereid.
    Their natural beauty lures men to their doom, for behind the beauty of the
    honeyed ones lies certain death for any creature that tries to steal a
    glance or kiss from the nereid.
  - >-
    Nereids shy away from combat and flee at the first sign of conflict if
    possible. If forced into melee, a nereid uses her poison spray to blind an
    opponent.
