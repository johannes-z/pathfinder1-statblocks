SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Compression (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tizheruk can use its compression ability to remain in waterways as
      shallow as 8 inches deep. While compressing itself against the floor of a
      body of water, a tizheruk gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks.
      See-Through
  - name: Skin (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because so much of a tizheruk's body is transparent, a creature swallowed
      whole by it has line of sight to creatures outside the creature, and
      creatures outside the tizheruk can see anyone inside.
  - name: Tongue (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tizheruk's tongue is a primary attack with a reach equal to double the
      tizheruk's normal reach (20 feet for a Large tizheruk). A tizheruk's
      tongue deals no damage on a hit, but can be used to grab a creature and
      pull it closer. A tizheruk doesn't gain the grappled condition while using
      its tongue in this manner.
Description:
  - >-
    The vicious tizheruk is a foul freshwater predator that wreaks havoc in the
    lakes and rivers it inhabits. To make matters worse, tizheruks also
    frequently travel far inland via smaller streams where animals and humanoids
    might think themselves safer. When a tizheruk swims upstream in such waters,
    it naturally compresses its muscles and organs, enabling it to remain in
    water less than a foot deep. It explodes to its full size as soon as it
    attacks, swallowing smaller prey or dragging larger creatures into the water
    before swimming away with its meal.
  - >-
    Though tizheruks mostly subsist on aquatic prey, they supplement their diets
    with creatures on the shore, particularly sizeable mammals such as deer or
    wild boar. To capture such creatures, a tizheruk extends its tightly coiled,
    whiplike tongue to snare one of the prey's legs, then retracts the appendage
    to pull the creature to its mouth.
  - >-
    A tizheruk's skin is nearly transparent, granting it a sort of natural
    camouflage beneath the water because its rust-colored organs and tissue can
    easily be mistaken for the floor of a creek or stream. After gorging itself
    on fish or on land animals that wander near the shore, the tizheruk
    compresses itself on the bottom of a lake or river while it slowly digests
    its prey.
  - >-
    An adult tizheruk is 8 feet long and weighs 180 pounds, though a tizheruk
    that has just fed may weigh up to two or three times as much.
