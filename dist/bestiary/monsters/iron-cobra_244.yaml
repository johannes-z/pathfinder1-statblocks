  - name: Find Target (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, an iron cobra's creator can order it to find and kill a
      specific creature within 1 mile, which it does as if guided by discern
      location. The creator must have seen or be holding an item from the
      specified creature for this order to function.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      An iron cobra's bite injects poison from a hidden reservoir within its
      body. Because it is a construct, the cobra does not naturally produce this
      poison, and its creator must refill this reservoir manually. The reservoir
      holds enough poison for 3 successful bite attacks, after which the
      creature merely deals bite damage. Refilling the reservoir takes 5 rounds
      and provokes attacks of opportunity. The creator can fill the reservoir
      with any injury poison (typically black adder venom), though acid,
      alchemical substances, and even stranger liquids have been used. Black
      Adder Venom: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 11; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds;
      effect 1d2 Con damage; cure 1 save.
Description:
  - >-
    The iron cobra is a simple construct that resembles a hooded cobra made out
    of metal. The iron cobra is typically used as a bodyguard or guardian of
    treasure, though its magical ability to unerringly locate creatures means it
    is also used as an assassin. Since an iron cobra's poison reservoir can
    contain multiple types of venom, the construct's specific use can be further
    tailored by varying the poison used. Some spellcasters even fill these
    reservoirs with potions, so that when the cobra bites, it injects the potion
    into its target. This is a somewhat dangerous method for gaining the effects
    of a potion, but it does free up the cobra's master to do other things in a
    combat round apart from quaffing potions. Iron is the most common material
    for these creations, but some crafters prefer more exotic materials when
    creating the serpentine constructs. Adamantine Cobra (+1 CR): This cobra is
    more solidly built than others. Its natural armor bonus increases to +12, it
    gains +5 hp per HD, and it gains DR 10/-. Cold Iron Cobra (+0 CR): This
    cobra's natural attacks count as cold iron for the purpose of bypassing DR.
    Darkwood Cobra (+0 CR): This cobra is more mobile; it gains a swim speed of
    30 ft. and a climb speed of 20 ft. Mithral Cobra (+1 CR): This cobra is much
    swifter. Its Dexterity increases by +4 and its speed to 70 ft., and it can
    make 2 bite attacks per round as a full attack action. Construction An iron
    cobra's body is built from 100 pounds of magically treated materials
    (typically iron). Iron Cobra CL 7th; Price 4,000 gp (iron); 20,000 gp
