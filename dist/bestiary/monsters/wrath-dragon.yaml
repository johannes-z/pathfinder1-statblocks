SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A wrath dragon's breath weapon is a 50 ft. cone of holy fire. One-half of
      the damage is from divine force and is not subject to fire resistance or
      fire immunity.
  - name: Divine Power (Su)
    description: >-
      A wrath dragon casts spells and channels positive energy as a good-aligned
      cleric. Its caster level is equal to half its Hit Dice. It has access to
      the Good and Strength domains and gains the domain power of each domain.
Description:
  - >-
    These massive powerfully built specimens are formed from the ascension of
    slain good dragons into the heavenly orders. Given the opportunity to
    return, they serve as heralds of good-aligned deities sent to deliver divine
    judgment on infidels and sinners who have turned their back on the path of
    righteousness. A flight of wrath dragons over an offending city has often
    been cause to turn an entire civilization to prayer and piety. Wrath dragons
    never enter the Material Plane, inner planes, or other outer planes unless
    under orders from the deity they serve. When such orders are given, a wrath
    dragon completes its assignment to the best of its ability before returning
    to its home plane. A wrath dragon serves no one other than the deity that
    "created" it. It aids good-aligned creatures in time of need, but does not
    serve them or stay with them any longer than is required to give aid (unless
    its deific orders say otherwise). A wrath dragon never aids an evil creature
    under any circumstances, and if forced to do so by magical means, the dragon
    seeks atonement as soon as possible. A wrath dragon is 30 feet long and
    weighs about 30,000 pounds. Its scales are silver or platinum and glitter
    under bright light. Its wings are silver-hued with a darker stripe running
    along the top portion. Its head, sitting atop its long serpentine neck, is
    long and angular and its eyes are seemingly made of sapphire. Two
    under-curved horns made of ivory jut from its head just behind its eyes.
    Wrath dragons start combat with use of their breath weapon and divine
    spells. They continue this tactic until pressed with missile fire, or magic
    that would force them to close in for melee attacks. In close combat, a
    wrath dragon attacks using a combination of its bite, claws, and spells. If
    pressed, or if the battle turns against it, a wrath dragon summons devas to
    its aid. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
