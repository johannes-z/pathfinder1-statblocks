Description:
  - >-
    Similar in many respects to standard mummies, asp mummies are created to
    guard tombs of regal kings and nobles. Some believe these creatures even
    have a spark of the divine mixed in with their creation and are appointed by
    the gods themselves to watch over their favored followers. Asp mummies are
    known to be favored as guardians among the followers of Set.
  - >-
    The creation of an asp mummy follows the same procedure as a standard mummy,
    save that many small asps are placed into the hollowed corpse along with the
    herbs and flowers.
