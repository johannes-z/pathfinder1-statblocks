SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Asp Storm (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, as a standard action, an asp mummy can call down a deluge of
      poisonous asps. The rain of asps functions as a venomous snake swarm (see
      below).
  - name: Despair (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures within a 30-foot radius that see an asp mummy must make a DC
      18 Will save or be paralyzed by fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the
      save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same asp
      mummy's despair ability for one day. This is a paralysis and a
      mind-affecting fear affect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Mummy Rot (Su)
    description: >-
      Curse and disease-slam; save DC 18 Fort; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha; cure -. Mummy rot is both a curse and disease
      and can only be cured if the curse is first removed, at which point the
      disease can be magically removed. Even after the curse element of mummy
      rot is lifted, a creature suffering from it cannot recover naturally over
      time. Anyone casting a conjuration (healing) spell on the afflicted
      creature must succeed on a DC 20 caster level check, or the spell is
      wasted and the healing has no effect. Anyone who dies from mummy rot turns
      to dust and cannot be raised without a resurrection or greater magic. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Snake Bite-injury; save DC 20 Fort; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
      1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based
      and includes a +2 racial bonus.
  - name: Writhing Snakes (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a creature adjacent to an asp mummy makes a melee attack against it,
      that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Reflex save or be subjected to the
      asp mummy's poison as the many snakes slithering in and out of the its
      bandages spring and bite. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Similar in many respects to standard mummies, asp mummies are created to
    guard tombs of regal kings and nobles. Some believe these creatures even
    have a spark of the divine mixed in with their creation and are appointed by
    the gods themselves to watch over their favored followers. Asp mummies are
    known to be favored as guardians among the followers of Set.
  - >-
    The creation of an asp mummy follows the same procedure as a standard mummy,
    save that many small asps are placed into the hollowed corpse along with the
    herbs and flowers.
