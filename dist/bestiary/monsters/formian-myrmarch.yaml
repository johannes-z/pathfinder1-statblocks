Description:
  - >-
    Myrmarchs are an elite caste of the formian race. They serve as direct
    agents for the queen, acting as advisors and generals, or administrating
    tasks where complexity or propriety renders taskmasters unsuitable. It is
    myrmarchs who answer the call when a particularly skilled diplomat or
    emissary is required to carry the queen's words outside of the territory of
    the hive to the dangerously disorganized races. While myrmarchs make up the
    aristocracy of formian society, this does not make them pampered
    intellectuals and bureaucrats. On the contrary, they are even more deadly
    than the warriors they often command, and do not hesitate to use their
    considerable might to aid and protect their kin. Myrmarchs facing combat
    apply their natural poison to their javelins, making them even more lethal.
    Like other formians, myrmarchs record their life's history upon their
    carapaces. Between their greater opportunities and longer lifespans (roughly
    as long as those of humans), myrmarchs can cover nearly every inch of their
    shells with great deeds accomplished, foes overcome, and service to the
    hive. Some myrmarchs actually run out of space for new records: some die
    shortly thereafter, knowing that they have served their queen to the utmost,
    while others add new artificial plates to their carapaces to continue their
    epics. The most accomplished, trusted, and battle-tested of their race,
    myrmarchs form the queen's elite bodyguard. In a small hive, these
    bodyguards likely have the same statistics presented above. In the oldest
    and largest hives, however, most possess class levels. A myrmarch has an
    enlarged thorax and abdomen, which give it the same general size and weight
    as a large warhorse, though its upper body is not much larger than that of a
    formian warrior's. Myrmarchs stand about 8 feet high and weigh about 1,200
    pounds.
