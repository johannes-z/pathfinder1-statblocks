Description_Visual: >-
  This creature is an immense greenish-black thing with intense yellow eyes. It
  is 30 feet long and a foot thick. The body of the thing is a wormlike mass of
  pulpy flesh with several gill-like apertures along its length with which it
  propels itself through the water. The front of the beast has a long trunk
  similar to that of an elephant. Its skin glistens as if coated with a sheen of
  oil.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite or spit-injury or contact; save Fort DC 24; frequency 1/round for 2
      rounds; effect 1d6 Dex and paralyzed 1d4 hours; cure 1 save. The save DC
      is Constitution-based. An opponent struck by a blob of vorin poison spit
      at them is protected from its effects for a short time by any amount of
      worn armor-the blob strikes the armor but not the opponent's flesh. The
      blob of poison seeps through armor in a number of rounds equal to the
      armor's armor bonus (do not apply any magical bonuses). The blob can be
      scraped off as a move action. Natural armor does not provide any defense
      as the poison seeps through the opponent's pores, nor does poison
      delivered by a vorin's sting have the same delayed effect.
  - name: Spit (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per round a vorin can spit a blob of sticky poison with a sickening
      odor at a single opponent within 50 feet (no range increment). This
      requires the vorin to make a successful ranged touch attack. If struck, a
      target is subjected to the vorin's poison.
  - name: Water Breathing (Ex)
    description: Vorins can breathe underwater indefinitely.
Description:
  - >-
    Vorins live in dismal swamps and bogs, lurking down in the murk and the
    mire. The eyes of a vorin are raised above the rest of the head on slight
    bulges. This arrangement allows the vorin to remain mostly submerged while
    it watches its potential prey. A typical vorin is 30 feet long and weighs
    3,000 pounds.
  - >-
    The boneless body of a vorin helps to protect it from impacts. A vorin feeds
    and attacks with a long proboscis. This proboscis contains the creature's
    tongue, with is tipped with a thorny barb that can inject a paralytic
    poison. A vorin can also spit its poison at prey that it can't reach
    physically.
  - >-
    A vorin relies on its poison in combat, hoping to incapacitate an opponent
    so it can consume the victim at its leisure. It enters combat by spitting
    poison at any larger opponents first. The vorin tries to remain at a
    distance, spitting its poison and darting back below the water to slither to
    another location before rising again. A vorin only enters melee if pressed
    or if it is unable to escape.
