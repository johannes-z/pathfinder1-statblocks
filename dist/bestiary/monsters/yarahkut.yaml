SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dismantling Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round as a swift action, a yarahkut can concentrate its gaze on
      any item within 100 feet and damage that item. Attended items must succeed
      at a DC 21 Fortitude save or lose half their hit points and gain the
      broken condition. Items that already possess the broken condition and fail
      this save are destroyed. Items that successfully save against this effect
      are immune to that yarahkut's dismantling gaze for 24 hours. Unattended
      non-magical items don't receive a saving throw. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Malfunctioning Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A yarahkut radiates a disruptive aura that is harmful to ranged weapons
      within 100 feet. Mechanical projectile weapons-such as crossbows,
      firearms, siege weapons, and many technological weapons-have a 20% chance
      of not firing on each attack made within the aura's area. If a weapon in
      this aura has a misfire value, its misfire value increases by 2.
  - name: Wings (Ex)
    description: A yarahkut's wings are primary attacks.
Description:
  - >-
    Yarahkuts are inevitables (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 161) tasked with
    preventing magic and technology throughout the cosmos from falling into the
    wrong hands. Their mandate is to track objects that could disrupt the
    development of cultures that are not yet ready to wield such power. In most
    cases, yarahkuts monitor the movement of advanced technologies and magical
    items from lost civilizations,
  - >-
    ensuring they aren't introduced to regions where they could have a
    disruptive impact.
  - >-
    Noted for their intricate brass wings, yarahkuts have superb control of
    these appendages and are able to use them as effective weapons. Three
    identical faces surround a yarahkut's head, staring impassively in separate
    directions with glowing golden eyes. Of its two sets of arms, one set bears
    claws for combat, while the remaining set is more humanoid and is used to
    manipulate objects-including those items it confiscates. A yarahkut stands
    11 feet tall and weighs 3,000 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    These inevitables scour the planes for those in possession of items beyond
    their ability to control-or more accurately, beyond what the yarahkuts
    believe they can control-and ensure that such items do not remain in unsafe
    hands for long. Each yarahkut has jurisdiction over a specific territory and
    monitors its region for such trespasses, tracking any new piece of
    technology or major magical item that enters its assigned area. If an item
    is determined to be a threat, the yarahkut pursues its retrieval or
    destruction without reservation.
  - >-
    A yarahkut's distinctive wings are for more than just flight; the inevitable
    has remarkable control over these mechanical appendages. The wings are just
    as sharp and dangerous as its razorlike claws, and double as weapons in
    combat. The grace with which yarahkuts use their wings awes members of many
    primitive cultures, who often mistake these inevitables for celestials. Only
    those familiar with the nature of yarahkuts understand that their wings are
    weapons first, and a mode of transportation second.
  - >-
    Compared to most other types of inevitable, yarahkuts take extra care to
    avoid being destroyed on their missions. While all inevitables know that if
    they're destroyed, replacements will simply emerge from the forges of Axis
    to continue their work, yarahkuts understand that their destruction would
    extend the time that signif icantly advanced items are allowed to
    contaminate their assigned territories. Bereft of any form of innate
    teleportation or planar travel, yarahkuts are willing to retreat from combat
    if it means surviving in order to gather reinforcements or formulate a new
    plan.
  - >-
    Yarahkuts are supported in their task by a wide array of abilities; those
    who study these inevitables learn to fear their dismantling gazes in
    particular. Just by scrutinizing an item, a yarahkut is capable of
    disassembling it in a manner of moments, to the dismay of those who wield
    dangerous items against the inevitable. Yarahkuts also exude an aura that
    tampers with nearby mechanical items. This aura causes mechanical weapons
    such as crossbows and firearms to become misaligned and misfire, and can
    affect even advanced technology such as laser weapons.
  - >-
    Once a yarahkut has tracked its quarry, it uses its innate arcane sight to
    identify any threats that require disposal and unceremoniously relieves the
    target of these items. Once the transgressor has had its dangerous
    possessions removed, the yarahkut uses its mind-affecting abilities to strip
    relevant memories from the target. If the target has expert knowledge of
    technology or has been exposed to dangerous items for long periods of
    time-such as a gun maker in a primitive land or an engineer who built a
    weapon that could instantly destroy millions-the inevitable resorts to a
    thorough memory wipe or simple execution.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Yarahkuts are mostly solitary outsiders, each with its own "jurisdiction"
    consisting of a meticulously assembled base of power and network of contacts
    from across the planes. Whenever possible, yarahkuts attempt to stay removed
    from the mundane affairs of the material world, running their networks
    through intermediaries and sending agents to investigate dangerous items
    before committing to a mission themselves. Those in service to a yarahkut
    rarely realize the true nature of their benefactor, whose identity is
    disguised by the inevitable's heightened ability to understand and adapt to
    other cultures. After reviewing the intelligence gathered by their agents,
    yarahkuts begin planning their retrieval missions. They are meticulous
    creatures, and attempt to plan for as many contingencies as possible to
    ensure success.
  - >-
    As they lack innate means of traveling the planes, yarahkuts may seek aid in
    arriving at the location of this wayward technology-including help from
    mortal spellcasters who summon them. Some conjurers seeking to bind a
    yarahkut tempt it with information about dangerous or prohibited technology
    being used in the inevitable's jurisdiction. Most conjurers fail to realize,
    though, that the yarahkut often already knows of the dangerous technology,
    word of which likely trickled through its established network of informants
    long ago; the yarahkut had counted on being summoned so it could pursue the
    item itself.
  - >-
    In rare circumstances, yarahkuts form alliances with others of their kind.
    These alliances most often occur in response to the distribution of a large
    cache of volatile items across overlapping yarahkut jurisdictions, or the
    unearthing of dangerous artifacts with immediate repercussions for a large
    region.
  - >-
    Sometimes yarahkuts seek out other types of inevitables when the need
    arises. For example, a situation in which a powerful undead creature has
    discovered a lost army of robots may prompt an alliance of convenience with
    a marut. If a bargain was broken regarding powerful technology, a yarahkut
    might instead align with a kolyarut, while a death-marked exile from Numeria
    bringing stolen items to other nations might necessitate working with a
    zelekhut in order to track the renegade down.
