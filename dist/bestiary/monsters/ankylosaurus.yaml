    description: >-
      The ankylosaurus's tail can deliver a powerful, stunning blow. A creature
      struck by this attack must make a DC 23 save or be dazed for 1 round. If
      the strike is a critical hit and the target fails its save, it is instead
      stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The ankylosaurus is a powerful, squat dinosaur more than capable of
    defending itself against enemies. Its back is heavily armored with thick
    bony plates and spikes. A solid blow from an ankylosaurus's tail can leave
    most creatures stunned long enough for the armored dinosaur to make good an
    escape, although once confronted, most ankylosauruses are too ill-tempered
    and stubborn to flee. Instead, they stand their ground and use their tails
    to great effect in battle. An ankylosaurus is 30 feet long and weighs 6,000
    pounds. Ankylosaurus Companions Starting Statistics: Size Medium; Speed 30
