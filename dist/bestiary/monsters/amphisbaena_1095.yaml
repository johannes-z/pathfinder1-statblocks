  - name: Split (Su)
    description: >-
      An amphisbaena functions normally even if cut in half. If dealt a critical
      hit with a slashing weapon, the creature is cut in half but continues to
      function as two separate creatures, each with half the original
      amphisbaena's current hit points (rounded down) after the damage from the
      critical hit is applied. Once split, an amphisbaena cannot be split again.
      If left alone for 1 minute, the split amphisbaena can rejoin its two
      halves and become a single whole creature again (add the two creatures'
      hit points together). If one of the split creatures is slain, the
      amphisbaena can regrow the lost portion over the course of 1d3 weeks.
Description:
  - >-
    The reclusive amphisbaena is a dreaded viper with a head at either end of
    its thick, serpentine coils. It travels in a strange, undulant crawl akin to
    that of a sidewinder, looping the coils of its long body back and forth and
    keeping both of its heads at the alert. Amphisbaenas are said to have formed
    from the blood of medusas, and while such stories are highly suspect, the
    creatures possess a natural immunity to petrification, which make them
    favored pets of medusas or other creatures with the petrification ability.
  - >-
    Adult amphisbaenas can grow up to 14 feet in length and weigh as much as 250
    pounds. While their thick coils twitch and ripple with muscle, they are not
    constrictors; their attacks rely on speed and their deadly venom. Most
    amphisbaenas have dark, bluish-black scales with lighter bands; however,
    they can be encountered in a variety of colors appropriate to their
    habitats. Some reports even claim lizard-like versions of this beast exists,
    with short legs and long curved talons.
  - >-
    The amphisbaena's two heads can act independently, and the creature can move
    freely in either direction. In combat, it uses this ability to its utmost
    advantage, constantly spinning about to change up the direction of its
    strikes and guarding against enemies attempting to sneak closer or flank it.
    Unlike most snakes, amphisbaenas are aggressive, attacking anything that
    enters their territory. While they prefer smaller prey, they have been known
    to hunt gnomes, half lings, and other Small humanoids, and will sometimes
    attack larger foes if they're starving or preparing to shed.
  - >-
    Amphisbaenas reproduce infrequently, laying small clutches of up to a dozen
    dark onyx eggs at a time.
  - >-
    Avidly sought by animal trainers and collectors, amphisbaena eggs can fetch
    between 300 to 500 gp on the market. Despite minimal intelligence,
    amphisbaenas are driven primarily by their instincts and are extremely
    difficult and dangerous to train. All attempts to train an amphisbaena take
    a -8 penalty on any Handle Animal checks as a result.
