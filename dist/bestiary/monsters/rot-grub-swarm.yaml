    description: >-
      Any living creature that takes damage from a rot grub swarm becomes
      infested unless it succeeds at a DC 19 Reflex save. On a failed save, the
      infested creature takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage per round as the
      rot grubs burrow through and consume its flesh-this effect continues as
      long as the victim remains in the swarm and continues for 1d6 rounds after
      it leaves the swarm. Any energy-based attack (including damage from
      negative energy) that deals at least 5 points of damage to the victim
      automatically destroys all of the rot grubs infesting it, ending the
      effect prematurely. Additionally, any effect that removes disease
      instantly ends a rot grub infestation. Immunity to disease offers no
      defense. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Rot grubs are foul, nauseating parasites that feed on flesh and use corpses
    as nests in which to grow. While a rot grub can derive nourishment from dead
    flesh, its true hunger is for the flesh of the living. Thankfully, rot grub
    swarms occur only rarely, as they require the infested carcass of a Huge or
    larger creature and many weeks to build up the numbers necessary to
    constitute a swarm.
  - >-
    In some cases, a rot grub continues to feed and grow, eventually reaching
    enormous size as a giant rot grub.
