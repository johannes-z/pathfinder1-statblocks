SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Delicious (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ghorans take a -2 penalty on Escape Artist and combat maneuver checks made
      to escape a grapple against any creature that has a bite attack with the
      grab ability.
  - name: Ghorus Seed (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a ghoran can expel its ghorus seed from an orifice
      in its abdomen. If planted in fertile ground and left undisturbed for 2d6
      days, the seed grows into a healthy duplicate of the original ghoran, save
      that the duplicate may reallocate all of its skill ranks upon sprouting.
      Once a ghoran expels its seed, it gains 1 negative level, and it dies as
      soon as its duplicate sprouts. This duplicate replaces the previous ghoran
      character.
  - name: Light Dependent (Ex)
    description: >-

    description: >-
      Ghorans remember memories encoded in their ghorus seed. They treat all
      Knowledge skills as class skills.
Description:
  - >-
    When Geb's magic despoiled his kingdom, the archmage Nex enlisted the
    renegade druid Ghorus to create a form of plant life that could survive in
    the blighted wasteland and sustain his starving people. Eventually, the
    plants evolved sentience and ambulatory bodies mimicking the appearance of
    their human farmers and consumers.
