Description_Visual: >-
  A foul mist surrounds this huge, three-eyed, tentacled fish creature, and
  plates of hardened slime guard its body.
Group: Aboleth
Source: Mythic Adventures
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mucus Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      While underwater, an aboleth exudes a cloud of transparent slime. All
      creatures adjacent to an aboleth must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save
      each round or lose the ability to breathe air (but gain the ability to
      breathe water) for 3 hours. Renewed contact with an aboleth's mucus cloud
      and failing another save extends the effect for another 3 hours. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Mucus Mist (Ex)
    description: >-
      When exposed to the air, a mythic aboleth can release its mucus as a fine
      mist. This obscures vision like obscuring mist and has the same properties
      as its mucus cloud. Creatures that breathe water are able to breathe
      normally while within the cloud. The mist moves with the aboleth.
  - name: Slime (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by an aboleth's tentacle must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude
      save or its skin and flesh transform into a clear, slimy membrane over the
      course of 1d4 rounds. The creature's new "flesh" is soft and tender,
      reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as the transformation
      persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries quickly and
      the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. Remove disease
      and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but
      immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Slime Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mythic aboleth can spend 1 minute to create an armorlike carapace from
      hardened slime. This gives it a +4 armor bonus, reduces its swim speed to
      30 feet, and increases its land speed to 30 feet. The aboleth can dissolve
      the armor as a full-round action.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic aboleth has exceptional magic, usually gained by staying alive long
    enough to see some of its dark experiments through to fruition. Brooding and
    brilliant, it seeks to conquer the dry lands.
