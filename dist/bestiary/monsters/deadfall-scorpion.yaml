    description: >-
      A deadfall scorpion is adept at moving quickly when its foes are
      surprised. During a surprise round, a deadfall scorpion may act as if it
      had a full round to act, rather than just one standard action.
Description:
  - >-
    The enormous deadfall scorpion is disturbingly stealthy for a creature of
    its size. So named for the creatures' habit of making their lairs amid the
    hollows created by deadfalls of old trees, deadfall scorpions adorn their
    already camouf laged carapaces with moss and old branches, then lie in wait
    to ambush prey when it draws near. They prefer to drag their prey back to
    their hidden deadfall lairs to eat, and thus incidental treasure can often
    be found within such a den. A deadfall scorpion is 24 feet long and weighs
    10,000 pounds.
