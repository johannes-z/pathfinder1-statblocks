SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Shriek (Ex)
    description: >-
      A doombat can emit a piercing shriek every 1d4 rounds. All creatures that
      can hear the doombat's shriek (except other doombats) within a 100-ft.
      radius must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or become shaken for 1d4+1
      rounds. Successive shrieks do not stack with each other but do extend the
      duration of the effect. A creature that successfully saves is immune to
      the same doombat's shriek for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Yip (Ex)
    description: >-
      A doombat yips constantly while in combat. The noise interferes with an
      opponent's ability to focus on difficult tasks. Spellcasters within 100
      ft. of a yipping doombat must succeed on a concentration check (DC 15 +
      spell's level) anytime they attempt to cast a spell. The effect of several
      doombats yipping at once is not cumulative.
Description:
  - The doombat is a nocturnal hunter that desires living flesh to sustain it.
  - >-
    The approach of a doombat can be heard long before the creature arrives on
    the scene, the yipping growing louder as the doombat draws closer.
  - >-
    The doombat has a 10-ft. wingspan, though specimens with wingspans reaching
    25 feet have been reported.
  - >-
    Doombats attack any living thing they encounter. They enter melee and attack
    with their vicious bite and tail slash, yipping for the duration of the
    fight.
