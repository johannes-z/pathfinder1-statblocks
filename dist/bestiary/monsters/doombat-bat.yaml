Description:
  - The doombat is a nocturnal hunter that desires living flesh to sustain it.
  - >-
    The approach of a doombat can be heard long before the creature arrives on
    the scene, the yipping growing louder as the doombat draws closer.
  - >-
    The doombat has a 10-ft. wingspan, though specimens with wingspans reaching
    25 feet have been reported.
  - >-
    Doombats attack any living thing they encounter. They enter melee and attack
    with their vicious bite and tail slash, yipping for the duration of the
    fight.
