Description_Visual: >-
  This burly, primitive-looking creature has an ape-like upper body, demonic
  horns, cloven hooves, and skin the color of a snow-buried corpse.
Group: Demon
Source: AP 69
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Icewalking (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the demon
      climbs must be icy. The demon can move across icy surfaces without penalty
      and does not need to attempt Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.
  - name: Mutilating Gouge (Ex)
    description: >-
      If the andrazku hits with both slams in the same round, its target must
      succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Charisma damage. The
      DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Andrazkus are thugs who use their strength to lord over weaker creatures.
    Their hatred is cold and seething, prone to suddenly snapping in an
    avalanche of ice and crushing blows. Birthed from the protomatter of the
    Abyss with natural gifts for tracking and subduing prey, they are sometimes
    used as trackers and jailors by more powerful demons who need to find lost
    prisoners and slaves.
  - >-
    From the waist up these demons are built much like strong, hairy humans or
    dwarves, but with exaggerated proportions resembling those of a gorilla.
    Their thick necks sport bristling manes that merge with the hair on their
    backs, and their flat faces bear two ramlike horns and cold eyes filled with
    hate. Their breath is a freezing fog, and their teeth are small but
    numerous, like a shark's. An andrazku's legs seem small in comparison to its
    torso, bend backward like a satyr's, and end in large cloven hooves. Their
    skin is the dead blue of a frozen corpse or a frost giant. Their top-heavy
    builds mean they have difficulty standing upright and normally assume a
    hunched posture; many prefer to walk and run on all fours, like apes. An
    andrazku is 7 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 450 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    An andrazku forms from the soul of a chaotic mortal who hated women and used
    his or her power to oppress and demean them, such as a tyrant who
    selectively enforced laws against women, a priest who preached that women
    are the source of all sin, or a father who secretly beat his wives and
    daughters for their supposed failures. For this reason andrazkus are known
    to scholars as "misogyny demons." Few of these souls dared to greater crimes
    (which would cause their souls to become incubi or babaus), nor were they
    once mortals who hated women but never acted upon their hatred-an andrazku
    only forms from a soul filled with suff icient hatred toward women to
    provoke action, but that is hampered by enough cowardice to prevent it from
    performing acts of greater evil. Most of them were male mortals, but an
    especially misogynistic evil female creature might become an andrazku in the
    Abyss.
  - >-
    An andrazku grows excited when it senses its prey's fear, but becomes
    frustrated if the hunt lasts for too long. Despite these demons' masculine
    appearance and aggression, most of them are impotent and some completely
    lack genitalia, rendering their lust pointless. Their nature is to berate,
    degrade, and beat; they tend to kill only when they feel an urge to eat,
    when their stymied passion becomes too great to tolerate, or when they are
    mocked for their shortcomings.
  - >-
    An andrazku prefers to attack with its bite and fists (often contemptuously
    slapping foes, minions, and prey with an open hand), but a vicious one may
    use a scourge and jagged-bladed sword as if pretending to be a balor.
    Sadistic and cruel, andrazkus have been known to chase down their prey,
    batter it for a while, and then release it, giving it enough of a head start
    that it thinks it has a chance of escaping. The andrazkus then track it down
    (using locate creature and teleport) to repeat the cycle again.
  - >-
    An andrazku in a position of authority likes to mark its minions and slaves
    with a scar on one side of the face indicating the demon's ownership. The
    demon typically uses its breath weapon to freeze a metal brand until it is
    cold enough to leave a permanent mark. If a slave is resistant or immune to
    cold, the demon uses a knife to carve its mark into one side of the
    creature's face.
  - >-
    Because of their long-simmering tempers and magical abilities, andrazkus are
    often called "cold demons," and they mainly live in frigid Abyssal realms
    such as Jhuvumirak, home of demon lord Kostchtchie. Their intolerance of
    fire (despite their demonic resistance to it) and the cowardly nature of
    their origin-sin make them laughingstocks among demons (particularly babaus
    and incubi); as a result, andrazkus are sullen, resentful, and prone to take
    out their frustrations on weaker creatures- especially if said creatures are
    female.
  - >-
    Andrazkus prefer to lair in ice caves or tunnels dug out of hard-packed
    snow. Some take advantage of their cold immunity and strong swimming ability
    to live in simple shelters on ice floes. An andrazku's hooves and huge hands
    allow it to cling to ice as though it were rough stone, preventing it from
    slipping and allowing it to use much of the vertical space in its lair to
    store treasure and observe intruders.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Andrazkus loathe associating with more powerful female demons in any way,
    and curse under their breath at mariliths and similar demons of great
    stature. Among female demons of similar power, they are quick with clever
    words, believable boasts, and secret confessions of desire, but these are
    all lies to disguise the hatred crackling beneath the surface. If given the
    opportunity, an andrazku would capture and torture a succubus merely because
    she is female (though a succubus is physically more powerful than a lone
    misogyny demon, and the hairy brutes have to gang up to have any chance of
    defeating a "weakling" succubus). Succubi and mariliths are aware of these
    simple-minded feelings held by andrazkus and they delight in tormenting the
    brutish creatures. Those female demons know they hold greater strength and
    power than andrazkus, and they enjoy lording over the creatures, even going
    so far as to kidnap them from time to time, bringing them to their own lairs
    and forcing the creatures into servitude.
  - >-
    Andrazkus band together for strength, using their telepathy to silently
    coordinate their attacks. They often taunt their prey telepathically, either
    with words, promises of violence, or mocking laughter.
  - >-
    When set loose on the Material Plane, an andrazku usually forces itself into
    a position of power over a humanoid tribe. Some ally with frost giant
    tribes, especially those who worship Kostchtchie. Duller ones find better
    company among girallons and dire apes.
  - Summoning Andrazku
  - >-
    Andrazkus are receptive to flattery about their size and strength. They like
    offers of weapons and strength-enhancing items as payment for their
    services. They can be assigned to guard, hunt, or retrieve; any Charisma
    check attempted as part a spell to convince an andrazku to undertake a
    mission other than these kinds of tasks takes a -2 penalty. A female
    summoner has a -10 penalty on all Charisma checks made to bargain unless the
    caster acts inferior and unworthy of the demon's aid.
