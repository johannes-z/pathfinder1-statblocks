SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fiddle (Su)
    description: >-
      Grigs are capable of rubbing their legs together like a cricket to create
      a surprisingly pleasant sound not unlike that of a tiny fiddle. As a
      standard action, a grig can create a catchy tune that compels any creature
      within a 20-foot spread to dance and caper. A creature can resist this
      compulsion by making a DC 12 Will save. Creatures that fail are compelled
      to dance and shuffle their feet, and are effectively staggered as long as
      the grig continues to fiddle. A grig can maintain this effect for up to 10
      rounds per day by concentrating. Once a creature makes the save against a
      grig's fiddle, it is immune to further fiddle effects from that grig for
      24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Grigs are tiny fey with the upper bodies of elf-like sprites and cricket
    bodies below. Their humanoid features vary wildly in individual appearance,
    but they usually wear their brown, silver, or green hair long and uncombed.
    In most cases, grigs' skin bears gold or green stripes or markings, and
    their legs are brightly colored. They prefer to eschew clothes entirely,
    wearing clothing only when such apparel has desirable magical effects. Grigs
    stand 1-1/2 feet tall, and weigh just under 10 pounds.
  - >-
    Grigs make their homes in thick woods alongside rolling hills, often near
    bodies of water. In every grig community may be found a clearing where the
    group observes the moon during its many lunar holidays.
  - >-
    Despite their tiny size, grigs are eager to confront evil and vanquish
    ugliness-as a result, grigs often find themselves in trouble. They rarely
    attack directly, instead preferring the element of surprise. In combat,
    grigs maintain their distance and either depend on their spell-like
    abilities or fire their longbows from afar. Grigs use their movement to
    their advantage, frequently jumping about their enemies or flying beyond
    their reach.
  - >-
    Gigs excel at music, and can create lively ditties simply by sawing their
    legs against their bodies. Grig music often stirs people to dance, even when
    the grigs don't enhance their music with supernatural compulsions. In
    addition to loving music, grigs enjoy the visual arts, especially paintings
    and sketches, and they often decorate their homes with bright colors and
    delightful images.
