Description:
  - Creating a Mutant Goblin
  - >-
    "Mutant goblin" is an acquired template that can be added to a goblin
    (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A mutant goblin uses the base
    creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
  - 'CR: Same as the base creature + 1.'
  - 'Armor Class: Natural armor bonus increases by 4.'
  - >-
    Mutations: A mutant goblin gains four of the following mutations, determined
    randomly when it gains the template. For every 5 Hit Dice it has (5, 10, and
    so on), it gains another random mutation. (Other possible mutations include
    tusks, a spiked tail, and gills.)
  - >-
    Breath Weapon (Su): The goblin can spew a line of foul acidic blood from its
    mouth (20-foot line, Reflex DC = 10 + 1/2 Hit Die + its Constitution
    modifier for half damage, 1d4 points of acid damage per HD, usable every 1d4
    rounds). If it has 5 or more HD, the range increases to 30 feet and the
    damage increases to 1d6 points of acid damage per HD.
  - >-
    Claws (Ex): The goblin's hands become claws. It gains a natural claw attack
    for each hand that deals damage appropriate to its size, and gains the grab
    ability with its claws.
  - >-
    Extra Arm (Ex): The goblin gains an extra arm with a functional hand, as the
    vestigial armUM discovery. If it gains this mutation again, it gains another
    arm.
  - >-
    Fast Healing (Ex): The goblin gains fast healing 1. If it has 5 Hit Dice or
    more, this increases to fast healing 2. If the creature has 10 HD or more,
    this increases to fast healing 5.
  - >-
    Venomous Bite (Ex): The mutant goblin grows large fangs, gaining a poisonous
    bite as a natural attack that deals damage appropriate to its size. The
    poison functions like wyvern poison, except its DC is 10 + 1/2 HD + its
    Constitution modifier.
  - >-
    Wings (Ex): The goblin gains dragonf ly wings, granting it a fly speed of 30
    feet with clumsy maneuverability.
  - 'Abilities: Str +4, Int -2.'
