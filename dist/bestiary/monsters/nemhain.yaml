SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bound Spirits (Su)
    description: >-
      A nemhain is surrounded by a whirling cloud of spirits bound to her-often,
      these are the spirits of close relatives or friends she had in life. As a
      swift action, she can direct these bound spirits to strike at any creature
      within 30 feet as a +21 ranged touch attack. These spirits may be used to
      cause damage as if she had touched the target with her incorporeal touch,
      or they can be used to deliver a harm or slay living effect-if used to
      deliver one of these spell-like abilities as a swift action, that use
      counts against the number of times per day she can use that spell-like
      ability. The nemhain can also send these spirits up to 1 mile away to act
      as scouts at a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect)-she can observe and listen
      through them, but as long as they do not share her space, she cannot use
      them to deliver ranged touch attacks. These spirits are impervious to
      almost all attacks and magic, save the following: protection from evil
      prevents bound spirits from harming persons so protected; dispel evil,
      raise dead, or resurrection causes the spirits to vanish and be useless to
      the nemhain for 1 hour; true resurrection makes them useless for 24 hours.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      All nemhains are tied to a ritual object used in their creation. This
      object is typically a Large statue, pillar, or monolith. Until this object
      is destroyed, a destroyed nemhain automatically rejuvenates back to full
      health 1d4 days after it is destroyed.
Description:
  - >-
    A nemhain is formed when a soul deliberately assumes undead status as a
    means of protecting a person, object, place, or ideal. Often, a devoted
    priest or ally volunteers for transformation into a nemhain in order to
    continue protecting her master even beyond her death. The blasphemous
    rituals used to create nemhains are believed to have been lost.
