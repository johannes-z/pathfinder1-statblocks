SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Destructive Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      An adamantine golem's slam attacks threaten a critical hit on a 19 or 20.
      In addition, whenever an adamantine golem scores a critical hit, it deals
      6d10+13 points of damage to the target's armor or shield in addition to
      the normal damage, as if it had also made a successful sunder combat
      maneuver.
  - name: Indestructible (Ex)
    description: >-
      An adamantine golem is nearly impossible to destroy. Even if reduced below
      0 hit points, its fast healing continues to restore hit points, though the
      golem is helpless unless above 0 hit points. It can only be permanently
      destroyed if reduced to negative hit points and then decapitated using an
      adamantine vorpal weapon- alternatively, miracle or wish can be used to
      slay it while it is at negative hit points.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      An adamantine golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that
      allows spell resistance, except as noted below. â€¢ Transmute metal to wood
      slows an adamantine golem for 1d4 rounds, during which time its damage
      reduction is reduced to 15/adamantine (no save).
Description:
  - >-
    Made using one of the hardest and most precious substances, the adamantine
    golem is a deadly work of art. It can crush the life from foes that dare to
    get in its way and is nearly impossible to permanently destroy. The vast
    amount of adamantine required to build even one of these destructive golems
    is so significant that most worlds do not have enough resources, forcing the
    creator to travel to the Plane of Earth or remote Outer Planes simply to
    gather the raw materials needed to build the golem's body.
  - >-
    Construction A adamantine golem's body is made of more than 4,000 pounds of
    adamantine, mithral, gold, platinum, and other metals worth a total of
    100,000 gp.
