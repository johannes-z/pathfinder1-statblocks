  This creature vaguely resembles a gorilla. It is gray in color, however, and
  much more powerfully muscled than any natural ape. From its lower jaw sprout
  two vicious upward-thrusting tusks.

Description:
  - >-
    Tombotu are believed to be the foul offspring of a quasi-deity ape god
    (believed to be Bonjo Tombo or his twin brother Ponjo Tombo). These gray,
    apelike humanoids are bred from human or apelike mothers, although the
    resulting progeny often kills the mother. Tombotu may mate with other
    tombotu. The tombotu are fairly intelligent aggressors and are often found
    leading dire apes, girallons, and other ape-like creatures, communicating
    with them through grunts and body language. Some humanoid cultures journey
    to the tombotu homelands where they conduct raids, capturing as many tombotu
    as they can. Captured tombotu are sold as slaves and used as opponents in
    gladiatorial contests where their ferocious skills are put to the test. Some
    few tribes of tombotu have actually made truces with other humanoid races,
    agreeing to sell off their children in exchange for food and other things
    the tribe may need. Such things are frowned upon by most other tombotu
    tribes, viewing those who engage in such practices as savages and traitors
    to their own race.

    Tombotu are fond of human flesh and often organized massive hunts where
    humans are the prey. Some tombotu tribes disdain this practice, feeling it
    makes them little better than the animals they ascended from. Others
    however, relish in the hunts, which can lasts for days at a time. Humans are
    also kept as slaves by many tombotu tribes. Even those tribes that look down
    upon the hunts keep human slaves. Most human slaves are house slaves,
    tending to the needs of the family, such as cooking and cleaning.

    In combat, a tombotu likes to attack using surprise, often hiding and
    dangling from jungle trees as its prey pass beneath, snatching up the
    unsuspecting prey and strangling it to death or breaking the neck of its
    quarry while it is held immobile by the tombotu's great strength. If
    threatened with death, a tombotu attempts to flee rather than face certain
    destruction.
