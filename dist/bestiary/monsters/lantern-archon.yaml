SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gestalt (Su)
    description: >-
      Nine lantern archons can fuse together as a full-round action, becoming a
      single Large entity that is more powerful than the individual archons that
      make up its parts. Looking like a whirlwind of dancing firefly lights, the
      gestalt has all the powers and abilities of a Large air elemental plus the
      following: archon, good, and lawful subtypes; archon traits (aura of
      menace DC 16); 2 light rays (2d6); DR 5/evil and magic. The archons can
      remain in this form for 2d4 rounds. When the gestalt separates back into
      individual lantern archons, its remaining hit points are divided evenly
      among them; if it had less than 9 hit points, some of the component
      archons die when the gestalt ends.

    description: >-
      A lantern archon can fire beams of light to damage foes. These light rays
      have a maximum range of 30 feet. This attack overcomes damage reduction of
      any type.
Description:
  - >-
    Friendly and curious beings, lantern archons eagerly converse with and
    assist other creatures. Their bodies, however, are merely globes of
    spiritual purity and pale light, and though they might interact with their
    surroundings through pure force of will, such interaction proves too weak to
    help with most physical tasks. Their evasive natures make them exceptional
    at scouting-at least in areas where strange lights aren't unusual-relaying
    messages, and overwhelming enemies with surprise and group tactics. Although
    they appear fragile, their forms guard them against all but the most profane
    attacks. A lantern archon always glows, usually as bright as a torch. They
    have total control over the color of light they shed, and take great
    pleasure in modulating their colors and brightness in time to music or to
    entertain other creatures. Most lantern archons speak in airy, echoing
    voices, with tones that range from somber whispers to hurried chirping.
    Often, their light fluctuates along with their words or tones, punctuating
    their speech with sparks of light or gentle pulses. As a swift action, a
    lantern archon can dampen its light to that of a candle for 1 round. Only
    death can extinguish this light. As lantern archons never sleep or eat, they
    make excellent watchers and guardians. Lantern archons light many
    settlements in the celestial realms in lieu of mundane or magical
    illumination, serving as disguised sentinels always watchful for approaching
    evil. Small but fast and zealous, lantern archons make excellent support
    troops in celestial armies, swarming over weak opponents or teleporting en
    masse to flanking positions to cut off reinforcements or escape routes.
    These miniature archons work well together and know that there is great
    strength in numbers, uniting in times of need and desperation to form
    gestalts with greater control over their surroundings. Especially brave
    lantern archons might eventually be promoted into a more powerful kind of
    archon, but most are content with their status.
