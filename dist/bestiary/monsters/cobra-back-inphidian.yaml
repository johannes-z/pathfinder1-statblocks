Description_Visual: >-
  This hideously formed humanoid covered with bluish green scales stands roughly
  taller than a man. A large flap of skin forms a cobra-like hood that runs from
  the back of the head, halfway down the spine. Its eyes burn like crimson
  embers and its long forked tongue flickers. But the creature's most unnerving
  features are its hands which end in viper heads complete with sharp fangs that
  drip with venom.

Description:
  - >-
    Cobra-backs are a race of inphidian bred for combat and they relish the
    savagery of such events. They bully others of their own kind, and can often
    be found leading common inphidians on hunting excursions. They primarily
    function as muscle in inphidian hunting or adventuring parties and serve in
    inphidian communities as guards and protectors. Cobrabacks are loyal and
    follow orders without question. When threatened or enraged, the hood of the
    cobra-back fans open just like that of a true cobra. Cobra-backs are
    extremely aggressive and prone to attacking opponents on sight. Though they
    possess superb stealth skills, they prefer a straightahead fight rather than
    one that relies on trickery and guile. A cobra-back opens combat by spitting
    its poison at an opponent before moving into melee where it bites with its
    snake-hands. Of all the inphidians, the cobra-backs are the most likely to
    employ inphidian gauntlets (see the sidebar above for details). Those
    wearing inphidian gauntlets wield longswords or spears. Cobra-Back Inphidian
    Characters +6 Strength, +6 Dexterity, +4 Constitution, +2 Intelligence, +2
    Wisdom, +2 Charisma. Quick and deadly, cobra-backed inphidians make highly

    + Int modifier). Racial Feats: a cobra-back's monstrous humanoid levels give
    it three feats AC: +5 natural AC bonus. Special Attacks: poison, spit poison
