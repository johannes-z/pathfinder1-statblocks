SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A jyoti's breath weapon is a focused burst of searing fire infused with
      positive energy. Undead in the area take 11d8 damage rather than 11d6.
  - name: Divine Aversion (Su)
    description: >-
      Jyoti dislike deities and are never divine spellcasters. Jyoti gain a +2
      racial bonus on saves against divine magical effects.
  - name: Positive Energy (Su)
    description: >-
      A jyoti's natural weapons and any weapons it wields strike as if they were
      ghost touch weapons. In addition, any weapon (natural or manufactured) a
      jyoti uses deals +1d6 fire damage on a hit.
  - name: Positive Energy Affinity (Ex)
    description: >-
      A jyoti can exist comfortably on the Positive Energy Plane, and does not
      benefit (or suffer) from that plane's overwhelming infusions of
      life-giving energies. Whenever a jyoti is subjected to a magical healing
      effect, that effect functions at its full potential, as if enhanced by
      Maximize Spell.
Description:
  - >-
    Enigmatic and swift to anger, the avian race known as the jyoti are
    xenophobic natives of the Positive Energy Plane. Though some believe the
    jyoti are inherently good because their home plane is the source of all
    life, these beliefs are quite in error, for the jyoti react to all other
    races with wary suspicion at best, and usually assume the worst and attack
    before they can themselves be attacked. They guard their crystalline cities
    from all intrusion, especially by creatures from other planes and servants
    of the gods. They have been known to hold dangerous artifacts in their
    vaults on behalf of desperate visitors, though in the case of holy or unholy
    artifacts, the jyoti are more likely to destroy the artifacts as soon as
    possible.
  - >-
    Jyoti loathe natives of the Shadow Plane and the Negative Energy Plane in
    particular, though there is an element of pity in their actions toward
    undead. They never discuss the sceaduinar, and even hearing that name inf
    lames jyoti into immediate anger. Those who dare argue on the sceaduinar's
    behalf are immediately attacked.
