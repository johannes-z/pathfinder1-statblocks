  This innocuous-looking scroll abruptly rises in the air, unraveling as it
  flies. It flits about with serpentine grace, baring its razor-sharp edges.

  - name: Slice (Ex)
    description: >-
      A guardian scroll's slice attack is a primary attack that deals slashing
      damage.
  - name: Strangle (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a guardian scroll grapples a creature, it entirely covers its
      opponent's head with an airtight grip. A creature grappled by the scroll
      cannot see, speak, or cast spells with verbal components, and it must hold
      its breath (see Suffocation on page 445 of the Pathfinder RPG Core
      Rulebook). Creatures that don't speak or breathe through their heads
      aren't affected in those manners, nor are those who can see through other
      means blinded. Any attacks targeting a guardian scroll while it's
      grappling deal half damage to the scroll and the other half to the
      grappled creature. Susceptible to Mind-Affecting
  - name: Effects (Ex)
    description: >-
      As an intelligent construct, a guardian scroll is subject to
      mind-affecting effects.
Description:
  - >-
    Magical practitioners, both arcane and divine, often use artificial
    creatures to protect their lairs, libraries, temples, and sacred texts.
    Sometimes the best of these protectors are ones a thief never suspects-until
    it's too late. Guardian scrolls are deceptive constructs created from
    enchanted paper or papyrus. When an intruder enters a proscribed area or
    touches a prohibited object without first speaking a password or otherwise
    signaling that it has permission to enter, the guardian scroll rises to
    attack.
  - >-
    At rest, guardian scrolls appear identical to any number of different types
    of magical or nonmagical scrolls. Sometimes their ends terminate in wooden
    or light metal rods. These weighted ends do not hinder or alter the guardian
    scrolls' ability to move and attack. The texture of such a scroll is quite
    different from that of any paper, parchment, or papyrus-though from visual
    inspection alone it's indistinguishable from those materials. Instead, a
    guardian scroll's papery body is surprising strong and tensile. Even with
    casual handling, an observer can tell the material is tear-resistant, though
    it has a fine edge.
  - >-
    When a guardian scroll becomes active, it rises in the air and unfurls to a
    length of almost 4 feet. It wafts through the air with casual ease as it
    approaches its target. When it attacks, it stiffens its edges, making them
    almost as sharp as razors. It races past its target and draws its entire
    length across any exposed flesh, leaving a long, deep, and often painful
    slash that bleeds badly afterward. This is not the scroll's only means of
    attack, however. It can also wrap itself around a Medium or smaller creature
    in the blink of an eye, constricting it. While the strength of its
    constriction is not as terrible as that of a giant snake, the guardian
    scroll is intelligent enough to strategically wrap itself around the face of
    its target to blind and asphyxiate. While some barroom adventurers laugh at
    the absurdity of "aggressive paper," anyone who has faced a guardian scroll
    knows its tenacity is surpassed only by its viciousness.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Guardian scrolls are artificial creatures, more akin to intelligent magic
    items than anything spawned in nature. Many do have some connection to the
    natural world, in that the material used in the creation of their paper is
    sometimes harvested from treants, quickwoods, or other intelligent tree
    creatures. In Osirion, guardian scrolls are often created from patches of
    stranglereeds that grow along the riverbank (see Pathfinder Adventure Path
    #82). Some researchers argue this explains the almost murderous nature that
    some guardian scrolls manifest. It is possible to create a guardian scroll
    without killing an intelligent plant creature, but it's a lengthier process
    that requires much more material, and doesn't appear to change the
    construct's disposition.
  - >-
    Unlike most constructs, guardian scrolls have a limited intelligence. They
    lack the bludgeoning strength of other automata, and the variety and
    sophistication of their possible attacks require more than a simple brute
    force approach. This same spark of awareness also makes them subject to
    attacks on their minds.
  - >-
    Sometimes a guardian scroll's creator uses the scroll to record the very
    information the construct is intended to protect-often a treasure map. The
    idea is that the scroll fights relentlessly rather than allowing an
    unauthorized party to study it, such that a would-be thief must destroy it
    to stop its attacks. This is risky, however. The scroll could be grappled,
    pinned, and held down by two or more creatures so it could be examined.
    Worse, since it fights to the death, the information it protects could be
    lost entirely.
  - >-
    Guardian scrolls forced into scroll tubes go dormant unless they succeed at
    a DC 15 Will save. A scroll that is still active can usually pop the
    canister open and escape unless the case has a locking mechanism or other
    special precautions are taken. If its tube is disturbed, a dormant guardian
    scroll must attempt a Will save to shake off this forced quiescence; if
    successful, it abruptly returns to life.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    One might expect that guardian scrolls would be found only in the lairs of
    wizards and in great libraries, but the truth is that while they are
    commonly placed wherever someone has a secret to keep, they can be found in
    any number of surprising locations. The scrolls make splendid treasure maps
    for pirate lords, and as such they are found on ships and islands throughout
    the Inner Sea. They've even been sent anonymously as sealed missives via
    courier with instructions to murder the recipient.
  - Construction
  - >-
    A guardian scroll's body is usually made of paper crafted from the body of a
    living, intelligent tree or plant creature; the complex process of
    extraction usually destroys the creature in the process. For this reason,
    the creation of a guardian scroll is often, but not strictly, an evil act. A
    Large- or Medium-sized creature can provide more than enough paper to create
    dozens of guardian scrolls. The paper produced does not need to be used
    within a specific time frame, and so may be sold and purchased without the
    creator destroying an intelligent creature herself. The paper can also be
    produced alchemically from normal sources of pulp at greater expense with a
    successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check. The additional cost and price for
    this alternative process are listed within parentheses in the stat block
    below. Additionally, the creator must inscribe a series of magical words at
    the very bottom of the scroll. This does not prohibit the scroll from use
    for spells or other writings, but does require meticulous calligraphy or
    penmanship.

    Magic Guardian Scrolls It's possible to include additional magical writings
    in the process of a guardian scroll's creation. This process is more
    expensive, adding 10,000 gp to the construction cost, but grants the
    guardian scroll spell-like abilities determined by its creator. To make a
    magic guardian scroll, apply the following changes.
  - 'Challenge Rating: +1'

    Abilities: +2 Int, +2 Cha. The guardian scroll gains no additional skill
    ranks.

    Spell-like Abilities: CL 4th, concentration +6, two 1st-level spells and one
