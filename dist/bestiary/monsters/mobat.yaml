    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a mobat can produce an ear-splitting
      screech that stuns non-mobats in a 20-foot-radius burst. All creatures
      within the area must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1d3
      rounds. Other mobats and urdefhans (see page 276) are immune to this
      effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Mobats are magical giant bats with wolfish grins and immense wingspans.
    Survivors of a lost era, they are rarely seen beyond the dark forests and
    deep caves they haunt.
  - >-
    Although mobats are omnivores, they vastly prefer the flavor of fresh meat
    over that of other prey.
  - >-
    Mobats' fur varies in coloration, from deep auburn to almost black, and
    their skin is black. A mobat's wingspan is 15 feet across, and it weighs 250
    pounds.
