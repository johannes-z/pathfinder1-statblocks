    description: >-
      A monstrous crayfish can survive out of the water for 1 hour per 2 points
      of Constitution. Beyond this limit, a monstrous crayfish runs the risk of
      suffocation, as if it were drowning.
Description:
  - >-
    Giant crayfish are freshwater creatures that dwell on the bottom of seas,
    lakes, ponds, and other shallow waters. They are predators and scavengers
    and exist on a diet of decaying flesh (dead fish and other water-based
    animals), algae, snails, worms, and other animals (including swimmers who
    come to close to their lair). Giant crayfish make their homes under rocks or
    in underwater tunnels burrowed out by the crayfish. Most underwater tunnels
    extend over long distances and include a "chimney" found along the edge of
    the water or even as far as 100 feet away from the water which allows the
    giant crayfish to enter and exit its passageways onto dry ground. Giant
    crayfish are often hunted as food by dragon turtles, humans, storm giants,
    and giant turtles. Credit The Monstrous Crayfish originally appeared in the
