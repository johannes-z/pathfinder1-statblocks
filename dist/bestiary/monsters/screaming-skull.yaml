      When a screaming skull detects movement within 40 feet, it emits an
      ear-shattering roar of tumultuous sounds as a free action that can be
      heard up to 1,000 feet away. All creatures within 60 feet that hear the
      sound must make a successful DC 13 Will save or take 1d6 points of sonic
      damage each round they remain in the area. The screaming also distracts
      spellcasters attempting to cast spells. A spellcaster within the area must
      make a successful Concentration check (DC 10 + sonic damage taken) to
      successfully cast a spell. The screaming lasts for 1d4 rounds before
      ceasing for one round. After that, the skull remains silent unless a
      creature is within or moves within 40 feet of it-it then screams again and
      repeats the above cycle. The save DC is Constitution-based. Additionally,
      this cacophonous scream risks attracts wandering monsters. Whenever the
      skull first screams, the GM makes an additional wandering monster check to
      determine if nearby creatures come to investigate the source of the
      disturbance.

    description: >-
      Physically touching the screaming skull (including attacks with natural
      weapons and unarmed attacks) requires the opponent to make a successful DC
      13 Will save or be stricken insane as by an insanity spell (caster level
      6th). The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Screaming skulls are immobile guardians created with the purpose of guarding
    or protecting a specific object or area. They are often used in concert with
    other monsters as their screaming alerts other creatures to the presence of
    intruders. A screaming skull obeys its commands to the letter. Should its
    creator die or should the screaming skull be unable to carry out its
    commands, its magical nature ceases to function and it becomes nothing more
    than a normal skull. Its gemstone eyes dull to a lackluster gray,
    effectively becoming worthless stones.
  - >-
    A screaming skull sits undisturbed until a creature moves within 30 feet of
    it when it unleashes its hellish scream. Other creatures are subjected to
    its magic missile attack. The screaming skull is a relentless guardian and
    continues its assault until it is destroyed or its foes leave the area. The
    gemstones that function as the screaming skull's eyes can be pried from a
    destroyed skull by making a successful DC 20 Strength check. The gems retain
    their value after the screaming skull is destroyed.
