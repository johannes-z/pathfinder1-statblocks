  double standard Sheol: Baal's unique weapon is a Large +4 unholy morningstar.

  increasing his reach with this weapon. It can likewise retract to its normal
  length as a free action.
Description_Visual: >-
  This diabolical-looking golden-skinned humanoid towers over you, dressed in
  battered bronze chainmail. It wields a large morningstar in its clawed hand as
  it stares at you. Its bovine head features large round eyes of black, a large
  nose, wolf-like upright ears, and a large mouth lined with razor-sharp teeth.
  Tiny forward-curving horns protrude from its forehead.

Description:
  - >-
    Baal is a duke in the employ of Great Mammon and leads 5 legions of barbed
    devils in his service. Baal follows Lord Mammon's orders without question
    but secretly plans one day to wrest the throne from his master (who has
    become complacent as of late). For now, though, he waits and schemes.
  - Baal stands 8 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.
