Description:
  - >-
    Coddling, cooing mothers of nails and aberrant life, kyton termagants seek
    to make all living creatures adopted members of their malformed brood. That
    most of their purposefully deformed progeny die shortly after coming into
    their care only compels termagants to search farther for sturdier beings
    better suited to the honor of becoming their misshapen children.
