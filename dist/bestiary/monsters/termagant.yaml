SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Su)
    description: >-
      Anytime a creature is grappled by a termagant's tentacles or is affected
      by its rupture or shared rupture ability, it is exposed to the termagant's
      flux infusion. Flux infusion functions as a poison, but with unpredictable
      effects. Those who fail their saving throws take 1d4 points of ability
      drain. The ability score drained is randomly determined every time the
      flux infusion affects the creature (roll 1d6: 1-2 Constitution, 3-4
      Dexterity, 5-6 Strength). The save DC is Constitution-based. Flux
      Infusion: Injury; save Fort DC 28; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect
      1d4 Con, Dex, or Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Rupture (Su)
    description: >-
      When killed, a termagant explodes in a blast of its flux infusion poison.
      All living creatures within 15 feet must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude
      saving throw or be poisoned. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Shared Rupture (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature killed while poisoned by a termagant explodes. All living
      creatures within 10 feet of the creature must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude
      save or be poisoned. The save DC is based on the termagant's Constitution
      with a -5 penalty.
  - name: Unnerving Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that succumbs to a termagant's unnerving gaze becomes nauseated
      for 1d4 rounds as its mind attempts to comprehend the horrors it has
      witnessed.
Description:
  - >-
    Coddling, cooing mothers of nails and aberrant life, kyton termagants seek
    to make all living creatures adopted members of their malformed brood. That
    most of their purposefully deformed progeny die shortly after coming into
    their care only compels termagants to search farther for sturdier beings
    better suited to the honor of becoming their misshapen children.
