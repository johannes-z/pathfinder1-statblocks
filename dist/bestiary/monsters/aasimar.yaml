Description:
  - >-
    Aasimars are humans with a signif icant amount of celestial or other good
    outsider blood in their ancestry. Aasimars are not always good, but it is a
    natural tendency for them, and they gravitate to good faiths or
    organizations associated with celestials. Aasimar heritage can hide for
    generations, only to appear suddenly in the child of two apparently human
    parents. Most societies interpret aasimar births as good omens. Aasimars
    look mostly human except for some minor physical trait that reveals their
    unusual heritage. Typical aasimar features are hair that shines like metal,
    unusual eye or skin color, or even glowing golden halos. Aasimar Characters
    Aasimars are defined by class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice.
    Aasimars have the following racial traits. +2 Charisma, +2 Wisdom: Aasimars
    are insightful, confident, and personable. Normal Speed: Aasimars have a
    base speed of 30 feet. Darkvision: Aasimars can see in the dark up to 60
    feet. Skilled: Aasimars have a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Perception
    checks. Spell-Like Ability: Aasimars can use daylight once per day as a
    spell-like ability (caster level equals the aasimar's class level).
    Celestial Resistance: Aasimars have acid resistance 5, cold resistance 5,
    and electricity resistance 5. Languages: Aasimars begin play speaking Common
    and Celestial. Aasimars with high Intelligence scores can choose any of the
    following bonus languages: Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Half ling, and
    Sylvan.
