    description: >-
      As a move action, a hedgehog can roll itself up into a spiny ball. While
      rolled up, it gains a +1 enhancement bonus to its existing natural armor,
      and any creature attempting to grapple the hedgehog takes 1d3 damage on
      making a grapple check. While rolled up, a hedgehog cannot take any action
      other than leaving this state. The hedgehog can leave this state as a move
      action.
Description:

    Hedgehogs are spiny, insectivorous mammals. When threatened, a hedgehog
    rolls up into a spiny ball as a defense mechanism.
