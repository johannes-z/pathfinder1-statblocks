SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Enslave Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      A kalavakus can attempt to enslave the soul of any mortal creature within
      60 feet as a swift action. The kalavakus must have line of sight to the
      target. The target can resist this special attack with a DC 18 Will save,
      but is staggered for 1 round even if the save is successful. If the save
      is successful, the creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If the
      save is a failure, the target's soul is enslaved-this creature takes a -6
      penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws against that kalavakus. If a
      creature with an enslaved soul is slain by that kalavakus, the soul
      immediately infuses the demon's body, affecting it with a heal spell (CL
      12th). A kalavakus can have only one mortal soul enslaved at a time-if it
      enslaves a second soul, the first is released. This is a mind-affecting
      death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Horns (Ex)
    description: >-
      The kalavakus's numerous horns can easily catch weapons and yank them away
      from opponents. The demon gains a +4 racial bonus on all disarm attempts
      as a result.
Description:
  - >-
    Known to some as "horned demons," the kalavakus demons are hulking, muscled
    beasts. They work as slavers on the Abyss, sometimes as harem keepers or
    captains of the guard for a more powerful demon, and at other times as
    mercenaries who sell their captured victims for profit to anyone with the
    funds to pay.
  - >-
    A kalavakus is 7 feet tall and weighs 450 pounds. They form from the souls
    of evil mortals who were slavers in their mortal lives.
