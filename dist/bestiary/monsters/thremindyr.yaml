SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cold Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A thremindyr is surrounded by an aura of intense cold. At the beginning of
      the thremindyr's turn, all creatures within 10 feet of the thremindyr take
      1d6 points of cold damage.
  - name: Indistinct (Ex)
    description: >-
      A thremindyr barely stands out against snow and wintery skies except when
      it attacks. While in cold terrain, a thremindyr can use the Stealth skill
      even while being observed.
  - name: Sense Protection (Su)
    description: >-
      A thremindyr can automatically sense when a creature within 30 feet is
      under the effects of protection from energy (cold) or resist energy
      (cold).
  - name: Shatter Protection (Su)
    description: >-
      A thremindyr can pit its intense supernatural cold against another
      creature's magical protections in an attempt to wear them down or even
      shatter them completely. As a melee touch attack, the thremindyr can
      attempt to diminish the effectiveness of resist energy (cold) or
      protection from energy (cold) effects. If the touch attack is successful,
      the target is affected by a targeted dispel magic effect (caster level
      11th). If the dispel check is successful, the spell protecting the target
      ends. This ability can affect only protection from energy (cold) or resist
      energy (cold) effects, and it deals no damage to the target directly. This
      ability can be used at will, but each use can affect the effects of only
      one spell. If the target is under the effects of both spells, this ability
      affects protection from energy first; a separate use of this ability is
      needed to remove resist energy. If a target is under the effects of resist
      energy (cold) or protection from energy (cold) as an effect of a magic
      item, the thremindyr's dispel check must overcome the item's caster level.
      Creatures with inherent resistance or immunity to cold are unaffected by
      this ability. This does not extend to creatures that have immunity or
      resistance due to the effects of magic items or spells.
Description:
  - >-
    Thremindyrs are often mistaken for ghosts or some manner of frozen spirits
    when spotted in the wild. Although they are not incorporeal, these icy
    elemental beings are pale and wispy, and are easily overlooked in the
    wintery outdoors where there is little to contrast with their translucent
    white bodies. If viewed against a dark backdrop, a thremindyr looks like a
    long-limbed humanoid. Close up, their features have an inhuman, angular, and
    almost crystalline quality to them. They sport high cheekbones,
    upward-slanted eyes, and pointed ears. What might represent hair is a
    swirling mass of ever-roiling tendrils of mist and snow. Thremindyrs are
    usually androgynous, but very rarely some thremindyrs sport what appears to
    be a beard composed of icicles. When agitated, these arctic elementals
    radiate a flurry of snow in the direction of their attention, especially
    when they howl and roar. They possess a considerable strength but are
    ephemeral, like an air elemental. Thremindyrs stand roughly 7 feet tall and
    weigh no more than 15 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    The name "thremindyr" roughly translates from the Giant language as "breath
    of Thremyr," and a connection between the giant god and these creatures
    appears certain. Students of ancient lore and experts on the planes point to
    legends that describe how parts of the god Thremyr fell away from the deity
    and sprang to life, creating the frost giant, ice troll, and winter wolf
    races, and suggest that thremindyrs may have been created in the same way.
    These legends say that, instead of sloughing off of Thremyr as he staggered
    into the Steaming Sea, the first thremindyr escaped from Thremyr's lungs as
    the ancient being sighed, passing through his lips and onto Golarion.
  - >-
    Although this in some ways parallels how thremindyrs reproduce on the
    Material Plane, the theory that thremindyrs spawn directly from the deity
    isn't supported by the evidence. For one thing, thremindyrs hail from the
    Plane of Air, and Thremyr does not reside there. Scholars propose that the
    thremindyrs' existence actually informs one of the nature of Thremyr-and
    other gods worshiped by giants (such as Gozreh)-far more than the other way
    around.
  - >-
    Thremindyrs are consistently humanoid in shape, unlike many other elemental
    beings, whose shapes are often chaotic or take on animalistic forms.
    Thremindyrs spontaneously generate on the Plane of Air, but procreate
    through asexual reproduction on the Material Plane. They seem to thrive on
    the Material Plane, and by some accounts are slowly evolving to a less
    elemental state of existence.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Thremindyrs are thought to have originally sprung into existence in the
    misty zone where the Elemental Plane of Air juts up against the Plane of
    Water. Whatever their origin, thremindyrs have proliferated and are
    encountered as indigenous forms of life in many places on the Material
    Plane, especially on Golarion. When encountered outside of the Material
    Plane, thremindyrs possess the extraplanar subtype. Thremindyrs who dwell on
    the Material Plane require air, food, and moisture and have daily periods of
    inactivity. The creatures wither and die quickly in hot environments, and
    are found only in environments where water can freeze. Though thremindyrs
    need to eat, the period of time between each feeding can stretch for months.
  - >-
    Thremindyrs are curious creatures, but they are contemptuous of beings that
    can't adapt to the environments in which these outsiders thrive. When they
    coexist with creatures immune to their bitter cold presence, it is with a
    reserved indifference or muted curiosity. They are fickle and rarely
    maintain long-term alliances with other creatures.
  - >-
    Among their own kind, thremindyrs are peaceable and demonstrate a
    willingness to share ideas and cooperate- though they lack any ideas that do
    not lend themselves to mischief and mayhem. Thremindyrs are disastrously
    curious, and tend to treat any new stimulus as an excuse for playful
    destruction. A gathering of thremindyrs is dangerous indeed; more than one
    mountaineering expedition has been lost by being frozen to the side of a
    mountain by these strange elemental beings.
  - >-
    Thremindyrs chafe at being summoned-they have little patience for
    communication with creatures that have no natural inclination to cold or
    abilities to overcome it. Yet if directed toward an objective or opponent
    that it can freeze solid, a summoned thremindyr quickly forgets the
    indignity and sets about its work with malicious glee.
  - >-
    In combat, thremindyrs attempt to keep their distance from their enemies.
    They prefer to fly just out of the reach of their foes and attack with their
    breath weapons, hoping to entrap those struck. Once an opponent is
    immobilized, the thremindyr focuses on other foes until they are all coated
    in rime. Thremindyrs can tell whether creatures are magically protected
    against the cold, and they find these sorts of protections affronts to their
    icy nature. Thremindyrs focus their attacks on protected creatures first,
    and use their shatter protection ability to break down these defenses. If
    their enemies fight using ranged weapons, thremindyrs soar down and attack
    using Flyby Attack, sometimes remaining in melee combat long enough for
    their auras to damage their opponents.
