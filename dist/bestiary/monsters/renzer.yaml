Description_Visual: >-
  A massive, grayish-white shark-like creature swims forth. Its head is
  horrifically human-like in appearance, but completely hairless, having neither
  hair, nor eyebrows, nor lashes. Its teeth are long and pointed and its tongue
  is forked and brown in color. Its shark-like pectoral fins end in
  three-fingered claws and it has two dorsal fins, side-by-side. Its tail fins
  curve sharply and are a bit lighter in color than the rest of its body.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Command Fish (Su)
    description: >-
      Twice per day, a renzer can command fish and aquatic creatures as the mass
      charm spell (caster level 8th). The renzer can communicate with any
      creature it currently commands as if by speak with animals.
Description:
  - >-
    The deadly renzer roams the seas and oceans preying on fish, aquatic plants,
    and very often- travelers that enter its domain. Thought to be the result of
    a wizard's deadly experiment gone awry, the renzer hates most other forms of
    life and attacks them on sight.
  - >-
    Renzer are a malevolent and vile race and care little for anyone one,
    including others of their kind. They are solitary, selfish creatures that
    derive great pleasure from killing other creatures, and so they spend a
    large amount of time hunting prey; sometimes for food, other times for the
    thrill of the hunt. Most intelligent races avoid the renzer, but some have
    actually in recent times opened trade with these creatures. Certain colonies
    of sahuagin trade goods and services with them, though the deals prove shaky
    at best. Even the sahuagin don't really like or trust the renzer.
  - >-
    A renzer usually initiates combat with its spell-like abilities, using a
    cone of cold to blast its foes. In melee combat, a renzer focuses on bite
    attacks and once it locks its teeth on an opponent, it rarely lets go until
    either it or its opponent is dead. If fighting a surface-dwelling race or
    air-breathing creature, a renzer often grabs the opponent and dives straight
    down, swimming as fast as it can in hopes of drowning the foe. If
    outnumbered or overwhelmed, the renzer moves a safe distance away and uses
    its command fish ability.
