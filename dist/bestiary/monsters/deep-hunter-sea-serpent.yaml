Description:
  - >-
    The immense deep hunter serpent lives in deep oceans, and delights in
    hunting down and killing the most fearsome creatures of the sea. The deep
    hunter lives on the ocean floor, usually near thermal vents and volcanic
    areas where it is relatively warm. However, when hunting it may be
    encountered just about anywhere at sea; its preferred prey are krakens and
    the largest whales, though it may attack any other fearsome sea predator-the
    more dangerous, the better.
  - >-
    The deep hunter sea serpent is seldom seen near the surface, as its prey
    tends to stick to deep waters. It does not initiate combat against creatures
    it sees as its inferiors, but if it does regard a creature as a threat, it
    uses stealth to surprise its prey when possible, and launches into a
    full-scale assault using all of its physical attacks to the best of its
    ability.
