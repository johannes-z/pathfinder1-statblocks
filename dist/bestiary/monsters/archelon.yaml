Description:
  - >-
    An ancient relative of the smaller leatherback sea turtle, the archelon can
    grow up to 13 feet long and 16 feet from flipper to flipper. Weighing as
    much as 5,000 pounds, the archelon has an exceedingly powerful bite, and
    doesn't hesitate to use it to deter aquatic nuisances.
  - >-
    Like other sea turtles, female archelons come ashore to lay and bury their
    eggs in sandy beaches, preferably facing deep water and without coral reefs.
    Once done, they return to the sea, leaving their eggs defenseless.
  - >-
    These creatures are often used by coastal tribes as guardians and escorts
    from island to island. Aquatic creatures, particularly locathah, often use
    them as beasts of burden, but their relatively slow swim speed makes them
    poor mounts.
