Description_Visual: >-
  This bizarre construct appears to be crafted from stuffed human skin, with
  large button like platters in place of eye holes and crude stitching forming a
  pinched mouth. Knots of humanoid hair top its head and it is dressed in a
  patchwork of ill fitting clothes. Large needles and pins pierce the creature
  where a humanoid's vital organs would be.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Extra Damage Against Foe (Su)
    description: >-
      When it successfully establishes a witch-doll link, a witch-doll golem
      deals an extra 1d8 points of damage against its programmed target each
      time one of its attacks hits.
  - name: Find Target (Sp)
    description: >-
      When ordered to find its programmed target, a witch-doll golem does so
      unerringly, as though guided by discern location.
  - name: Linked Attack (Su)
    description: >-
      When a witch-doll golem successfully establishes a witchdoll link, any
      damage taken by the witch-doll golem from any source other than the linked
      host deals half its damage to the golem and half its damage to the linked
      target so long as they are within 60 feet of each other. Only the linked
      target can successfully attack a witchdoll golem and not take "linked
      damage". Attacks that don't damage a witch-doll golem (because of its
      immunities or its damage reduction) likewise deal no damage to the linked
      target. Attacks that damage the linked target do not damage the witchdoll
      golem (the link it establishes is one way). Healing (or repair in the case
      of the witch-doll golem) is not passed through the link. A witch-doll
      golem cannot be programmed to attack itself in order to damage its
      programmed target. Witch-Doll
  - name: Link (Su)
    description: >-
      A witch-doll golem can establish an invisible link between itself and its
      programmed target by making a successful melee attack against its
      programmed target. If successful, the opponent can attempt a DC 19
      Fortitude save to resist the link. The save DC is Constitution-based and
      includes a +2 racial bonus. A witch-doll link is broken if the witch-doll
      golem is destroyed, the target dies, or the witch-doll golem is programmed
      with a new target. A witch-doll golem cannot establish this link with any
      other creature other than its programmed target.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A witch-doll golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that
      allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells function differently
      against the creature, as noted below. A confusion spell slows it (as the
      slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. A mending spell heals
      2d6 hit points.
  - name: Resist Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A witch-doll golem gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws against any spell
      or spell-like ability or effect cast by its programmed target (provided
      the effect gets past its immunity to magic). The witch-doll does not have
      to be linked to its target to gain this bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    The witch-doll golem is a horrific hunter/assassin crafted in the likeness
    of a spellcaster's chosen foe. Witch-doll golems are designed to enact some
    vengeance on behalf of its creator and are thus made from some of the foe's
    personal effects (hair, blood, bit of skin, fingernail clippings, etc.). It
    may be re-programmed should the witch-doll golem's master find a new enemy.
    The master merely adds new personal effects to the golem and fills it with
    new commands. The witch-doll golem then follows these commands mindlessly
    until it or its target is destroyed. Note that the witch-doll golem can only
    have one programmed target at one time. A witch-doll golem stands twice the
    height of a human and weighs about 1,000 pounds. A witch-doll golem cannot
    speak. When facing its programmed target, the witch-doll immediately
    attempts to establish a witch-doll link by pummeling the target with its
    fists or stabbing it with one of the needles in its body. It relentlessly
    attacks its foe with a ferocity unseen in most mindless automatons. Against
    other foes, the golem employs its fists and needles while attempting to keep
    its programmed target within range. Construction A witch-doll golem is made
    from a patchwork of cloth, leather, rags, and other miscellaneous materials
    totaling 1,000 gp, all haphazardly stitched together. The creator of a
    witchdoll golem must have a physical part of the programmed target and use
    it in the construction of the witch-doll golem. This physical part can be a
    piece of hair, fingernail clippings, a few drops of blood, a piece of skin,
    and so on. WITCH-DOLL GOLEM CL 13th; Price 42,200 Requirements Craft
