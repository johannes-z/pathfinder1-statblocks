SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Engulf (Ex)
    description: >-
      A slithering tracker can engulf a paralyzed foe up to one size larger than
      itself as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack during a round
      in which it engulfs. The slithering tracker merely has to move into a
      space occupied by a paralyzed creature, completely covering it. An
      engulfed opponent is subjected to the slithering tracker's paralysis and
      plasma drain, and is considered to be grappled and trapped within its
      body. A slithering tracker only uses this ability against a paralyzed,
      sleeping, or otherwise helpless opponent.
  - name: Plasma Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      A slithering tracker drains the body fluids from an engulfed opponent.
      Each 5 minutes an opponent is engulfed, it takes 1 point of Constitution
      damage. Because it takes a long time to completely drain a foe, a
      slithering tracker generally only uses this ability against a paralyzed,
      stunned, held, or sleeping opponent.
  - name: Sealed Mind (Ex)
    description: >-
      Even though a slithering tracker has an Intelligence score, it is immune
      to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns,
      and morale effects) just as other oozes are.
  - name: Transparent (Ex)
    description: >-
      A slithering tracker is hard to identify, even under ideal conditions, and
      it takes a DC 15 Perception check to notice one. Creatures who fail to
      notice a slithering tracker and walk into it are automatically hit with a
      slam attack and subjected to the creature's paralysis attack.
Description:
  - >-
    The slithering tracker is an amorphous and transparent creature that
    inhabits dark underground areas of the world. Unlike other oozes, the
    slithering tracker does not feed on organic matter. It survives by devouring
    living creatures. A typical slithering tracker is 3 feet long and has a
    thickness of about 6 inches. It can grow to a length of about 8 feet. A
    slithering tracker prefers to attack helpless or immobile opponents. Once it
    paralyzes an opponent, the slithering tracker flows over it and drains its
    body fluids. The tracker, now sated, slithers off to digest its meal. All
    that's left of the opponent is a dry and rotted husk. Credit The Slithering
