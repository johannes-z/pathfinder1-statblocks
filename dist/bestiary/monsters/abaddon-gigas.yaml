SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Devour Souls (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, an Abaddon gigas can drain the
      souls from all living creatures within 60 feet that are not native to
      Abaddon. Such creatures must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or gain 1d4
      negative levels. If even one creature is affected, the Abaddon gigas gains
      fast healing 15 for 15 rounds. If a creature dies from an Abaddon gigas's
      energy drain special attack, energy drain spell, or devour souls attack,
      the Abaddon gigas devours that creature's soul, gaining the benefits of
      death knell at a caster level equal to the dead creature's HD. Such a
      creature cannot be raised or resurrected by any means until the Abaddon
      gigas is slain. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Planar Empowerment (Su)
    description: >-
      While on the plane of Abaddon, an Abaddon gigas can cast each of the
      following as a spell-like ability once per day: blasphemy (DC 28),
      earthquake (DC 29), and unholy aura (DC 29) . If the gigas ventures onto
      another plane, it can't use these abilities (though its other spell-like
      abilities remain available). The save DCs for these spell-like abilities
      are Charisma-based and include a +5 racial bonus.
  - name: Vile Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, an Abaddon gigas can transform its weapon into a +3
      wounding adamantine greatsword, a +5 nullifyingUE adamantine spiked
      gauntlet, a +5 unholy adamantine quarterstaff, a +3 cruelUE keen scythe,
      or a +3 weapon of any other kind.
Description:
  - >-
    Abaddon gigas are megalithic extraplanar giants that roam Abaddon and embody
    the same vile energies that permeate that plane. Their cruel forms and
    unusual powers give them nefarious reputations, and few giant hunters-even
    among those who traverse the Great Beyond-would willingly seek out one of
    these monstrosities.
  - >-
    An Abaddon gigas stands over 50 feet tall and weighs 30 tons, not including
    the weight of its enormous armor.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    The first known record of an Abaddon gigas dates back to Lamashtu's first
    struggles with the daemon race, when the Demon Queen captured and murdered
    two of the Four Horsemen. The putrid remains of the slain Horsemen oozed
    toward Abaddon's heart, where they merged with the body of a captured
    Thanatotic titan (and perhaps some of the energy of the fabled Oinodaemon)
    to create the first gigas on that plane. A hideous and gigantic being of
    size beyond reason and composed of some of the multiverse's most powerful
    souls, this mythic gigas soon tore itself into pieces while struggling
    against its uncompromising quaternary nature. In doing so, this first
    behemoth created countless "children," the beings known in present times as
    Abaddon gigas.
  - >-
    Abaddon gigas are asexual and incapable of reproducing; the Abaddon gigas in
    existence are all there ever will be. This fact is a small comfort, though,
    considering the terrible might of even a single Abaddon gigas. Worse still,
    whispered rumors among planar scholars say that, when an Abaddon gigas is
    slain, its power crawls back toward the heart of Abaddon, where the original
    mythic Abaddon gigas will one day reform once all its offspring have
    perished.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    While some Abaddon gigas serve the Four Horsemen- sensing in these demigods
    some missing piece of their original selves lost long ago-most instead
    wander the decrepit wastes of Abaddon in a never-ending search for something
    they cannot define. The daemons and divs believe that Abaddon gigas roam in
    search of souls to sate their enormous hunger for life. The rare interplanar
    scholars who travel to Abaddon claim that the gigas carry out nefarious
    deeds for fell beings such as olethrodaemons or akvans. Only Charon, the
    eldest of the current Four Horsemen, knows the true source of the Abaddon
    gigas' wanderlust: they yearn for the Oinodaemon. The Boatman keeps this
    secret to himself, and keeps a distant watch over the gigas of Abaddon,
    though it is unclear whether his surveillance is out of curiosity or some
    ulterior motive.
  - Known Gigas of Abaddon
  - >-
    While all Abaddon gigas share a special level of infamy, several of these
    beings have gained reputations (and unusual powers) that extend beyond the
    fell lore surrounding their kind. Below are descriptions of two such
    legendary gigas.
  - >-
    Goros: Thought to be a twisted creation of Trelmarixian the Black, the gigas
    called Goros possesses even less control over its mental faculties than most
    Abaddon gigas. The monster resembles a towering naked man with dark red skin
    the texture of granite. The right half of its body has been mutilated beyond
    comprehension, revealing a mess of blue veins that intermingle with oozing
    alien organs and pulsing black guts.
  - >-
    Goros wears no armor (reducing its AC to 22 and its flat-footed AC to 19),
    and flies into a rage if reduced to half its hit points. While in a rage,
    Goros gains all the same benefits and penalties as a raging 20th-level
    barbarian (gaining a +8 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a -2
    penalty to AC, and a +4 morale bonus on Will saves), though the gigas
    doesn't gain any rage powers.
  - >-
    Mephengitan: Mephengitan the Arch-Giant dwells among the icy wastes of
    Hoarspan, a borderland of polluted arctic waters and vicious icebergs where
    the fetid swamps of Plaguemere meet with Charon's Drowning Court. The
    gigas's eyes are the color of a clear winter sky, and on its frosty breath
    one can hear the whispers of a thousand souls whose lives were claimed by
    the Arch-Giant.
  - >-
    Mephengitan emits a 30-foot-radius aura of frigid cold. Any living creature
    that begins its turn in this area must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or
    take 4d6 points of cold damage as its core body temperature plummets and its
    blood begins to freeze. Creatures that don't need water to live are immune
    to this effect. Creatures with the water subtype take twice as much as
    damage.
