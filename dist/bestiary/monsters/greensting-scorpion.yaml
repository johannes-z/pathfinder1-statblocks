    Deadly greensting scorpions normally live in forests, though they can
    survive nearly anywhere. A greensting scorpion familiar grants a +4 bonus on
    Initiative checks so long as the familiar is within 1 mile of the
    spellcaster. A greensting scorpion familiar loses the mindless trait and has
    an Intelligence score appropriate for its master's level.
