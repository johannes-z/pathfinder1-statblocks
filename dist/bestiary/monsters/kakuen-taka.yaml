SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Consume Flesh (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round, when a kakuen-taka kills or reduces a creature to negative
      hit points with its swarm attack, it automatically attempts to consume the
      target's flesh as a free action (Fortitude DC 24 negates). If the target
      fails its save, its body is destroyed and the kakuen-taka gains the
      benefits of a death knell spell. This is a death attack.
  - name: Create Carrionstorm (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action at sunrise, a kakuen-taka (a bhoga swarm with a
      flesh mansion) can create 1d4 carrionstorms (see page 408 of the Rise of
      the Runelords Anniversary Edition). These carrionstorms have a blinding
      poison in addition to their swarm attack. The carrionstorms are not under
      the control of the kakuen-taka but instinctively follow it, attacking
      minor foes while the kakuen-taka destroys greater threats. If the flesh
      mansion is destroyed and the kakuen-taka does not create another one
      within 24 hours, the carrionstorms are destroyed. Any carrionstorms in
      excess of four wander away from the kakuen-taka and are automatically
      destroyed 24 hours later.
  - name: Carrionstorm Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Swarm-injury; save Fort DC 12, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect
      permanent blindness, cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based (using the carrionstorm's Constitution).
  - name: Dimensional Snare (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature affected by the kakuen-taka's swarm attack must succeed at a
      DC 21 Will save or be affected by dimensional anchor for 1 round. This
      save is Charisma-based.
  - name: Flesh Mansion (Ex)
    description: >-
      A kakuen-taka's bhoga swarm normally inhabits a hollowed-out reconfigured
      corpse called a flesh mansion, which it uses as a shelter, vehicle, and
      war machine. When the swarm wears a flesh mansion, it uses the above stat
      block (unlike a normal swarm, the flesh mansion's slam attacks have reach
      and threaten squares within its reach). As a standard action, the swarm
      can abandon its flesh mansion (which falls inert in its square), inhabit
      an empty flesh mansion, hide within its flesh mansion (gaining cover
      against all opponents but still being able to use its swarm attack), or
      stop hiding within the flesh mansion. If the flesh mansion is destroyed,
      the swarm can create another by performing a ritual that requires 1 hour
      and the corpse of a Huge creature. The flesh mansion is not a separate
      creature, nor is it undead; it is merely a corpse the swarm manipulates.
      Without a flesh mansion, the bhoga swarm's statistics are CE Diminutive
      outsider (chaotic, evil, extraplanar, swarm); AC 22, touch 21, flat-footed
      15; Defensive Abilities swarm traits; Melee swarm (5d6 plus dimensional
      snare and distraction); Reach 0 ft.; Str 1; CMB -; CMD - (can't be
      tripped); Stealth +32.
  - name: Fleshy Shield (Ex)
    description: >-
      A newly created flesh mansion has 150 hit points. The swarm takes only
      half damage from all attacks that deal hit point damage, with the
      remainder taken by the flesh mansion. Because a swarm of Diminutive
      creatures is immune to all weapon damage, apply half of all weapon damage
      to the fleshy shield and ignore the half that would be applied to the
      swarm. When the flesh mansion reaches 0 hit points, it is destroyed and
      the swarm functions like a normal swarm (see Flesh Mansion above). A
      kakuen-taka can repair a damaged flesh mansion by spending a full-round
      action grafting a corpse into it (restoring 5 hit points for a Small
      corpse, 10 for Medium, 20 for Large, 50 for Huge).
Description:
  - >-
    In the far northern lands bordering on the Worldwound, a strange and
    terrifying menace plagues the tundra and prairie-shambling fleshy
    abominations called kakuen-taka, the Hunger That Moves. They wander the
    desolate emptiness of the subpolar wilds, a living manifestation of the
    Worldwound's taint whose horrific onset is presaged by a sour-sweet wind and
    wheeling, screaming flocks of undead birds. The lucky victims of the birds'
    blinding poison are spared the sight of the rumbling juggernauts of
    putrefying meat driven like siege engines by a swarm of fiends called
    bhogas. Individually these fiends have little wit or skill, but together
    they have a malign intellect that allows them to construct mobile nests out
    of dead flesh like morbid termites building a mound.
  - >-
    The bhogas find a giant, mammoth, or other creature of great size and devour
    its organs, usually while the creature is still alive and trying to resist.
    Once the creature is dying or dead, the fiends reconfigure the corpse's
    remaining flesh and bone into a hideous, multilegged pillar, which they then
    invade and inhabit like a hollow tree. Some of the bhogas use their
    collective strength to move the fleshy mansion's limbs while the rest
    clamber about its walls or skulk underneath it, searching for new prey to
    terrorize and consume. This monstrosity attracts birds the fiends animate as
    flesh-craving undead swarms. Together, the three components of this peculiar
    Ecology stalk the demon-tainted lands. If a healthy swarm discovers another
    suitable corpse, the fiends engage in a frenzy of mating, build a second
    flesh mansion, split into two swarms, then rapidly give birth to fill all
    the available space in their new home.
  - >-
    When a flesh mansion becomes so rotted that it cannot maintain its structure
    or the swarm cannot easily move it, the bhogas abandon their creation and
    seek out another, leaving behind a monstrous, decaying shell, unrecognizable
    as the living creature it once was. Necromancers can use the husk for parts
    or animate the entire thing as a new abomination. Desperate ghouls, zombies,
    or animals might feed on it and become tainted by its latent Abyssal
    energies.
  - >-
    As much a plague upon demons as upon the mortal races, kakuen-taka have no
    true allies. Perhaps this accounts for their constant wandering and their
    fondness for desolate and isolated locales, far from any that might
    interfere with their feasting. Rarely, a powerful demon might enslave one
    with magic and use the swarm's dimensional snare ability to capture and kill
    its rivals. Driven out of the central part of the Worldwound by more
    intelligent and organized demons, kakuen-taka have become a recurring plague
    in the southern fringes of the territory, below Storasta and abutting the
    borders with Numeria and Ustalav. In these lonely moors and hills,
    kakuen-taka regularly eradicate patrols and entire settlements. None of the
    adjacent countries values the empty lands highly enough to risk major
    resources to stamp them out.
  - >-
    Kakuen-taka are indifferent to their own kind and attack each other only if
    one swarm has a flesh mansion and the other does not. Given adequate food,
    several kakuen-taka might travel together to tear apart larger prey, but
    over time they usually wander apart, following their separate carrionstorms,
    and have no sense of loyalty toward their former comrades.
