SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Paralyzing Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Paralyzed for 1d6 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude (DC 14) negates. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Hailing from the barren wastes of the Plane of Fire, the rast is as
    dangerous as it is bizarre. Its body is a single tumorous sack that bulges
    with hidden organs and veins and bears no sensory apparatus beyond two
    miniscule eyes almost lost in the folds and wattles of its flesh.
  - >-
    Instead, its defining feature is a mouth of flesh-ripping teeth and a
    wriggling mass of tangled legs. The exact number of legs on a particular
    rast is seemingly a random trait. Strangely, these tangled limbs do not
    support the creature, but rather hang twitching and waving beneath it as the
    rast floats through the air with an easy grace, only reaching out to
    manipulate objects or-more often-to slash at its prey.
  - >-
    Though rasts do not appear to have any spoken language, they display a
    degree of intelligence that places them above mere animals, and use this
    innate cunning to aid in their hunts. As prey is scarce in the barren, ashy
    deserts of the Plane of Fire where they make their home, rasts prefer to
    hunt in packs, swarming through the skies like schools of fish, their
    movements precise and coordinated despite their thrashing limbs. When they
    come across a likely target, they descend en masse, paralyzing those foes
    susceptible to their gaze and then abandoning them temporarily to focus on
    any opponents that remain mobile and dangerous, slashing with their claws
    and latching on with thick-lipped mouths to suck their victims' blood and
    viscera. Though each rast has roughly a dozen limbs, it can only control up
    to four at any given time, leaving the others to dangle uselessly.
  - >-
    Rasts make their homes in small ashen burrows, no more than holes scooped
    out by the thrashing of their claws, and bear their squirming young live. An
    adult rast is the size of a human and weighs 200 pounds. Rasts tend to be
    red, yellow, or purple, with darker coloration on their legs and heads, the
    better to blend in with the fiery plains of their homeland. Though most
    other intelligent species on the Plane of Fire are powerful enough (or wise
    enough) to avoid direct conf lict with a rast pack, a cluster that stumbles
    through a portal to the Material Plane (or perhaps more tragically, is
    summoned to the Material Plane by a foolish spellcaster) can prove
    disastrous for the local ecosystem, consuming everything in its path with
    seemingly no limit to its repulsive hunger.
