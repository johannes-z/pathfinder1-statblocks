Group: Rat

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Filth fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 11; onset 1d3 days, frequency
      1/day; effect 1d3 Dex damage and 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Incorporeal Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A shadow rat can, as a standard action, assume an incorporeal form for up
      to 1 hour per day. In this form, the shadow rat loses its natural AC bonus
      but gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC. While in this form, the shadow rat
      is AC 16 (+2 deflection, +2 Dex, +2 size), touch 15, flat-footed 13. The
      shadow rat can still attack corporeal opponents while in its incorporeal
      form, but its attack only inflicts Strength damage and cannot cause
      physical damage. The shadow rat gains the incorporeal subtype while using
      this ability.
  - name: Shadow Blend (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shadow rat can disappear into the shadows as a move action, gaining
      total concealment in all levels of illumination save bright light.
  - name: Strength Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      A shadow rat deals Strength damage to living foes it bites. A creature
      reduced to 0 Strength cannot move but does not die-at least, not until the
      shadow rat's physical damage takes its toll.
Description:
  - >-
    Shadow rats are undead rats that can assume an incorporeal form. Other than
    their semi-translucent form (which they maintain regardless of their
    incorporeality or not), they resemble their earthly counterparts in all
    respects. Shadow rats attack relentlessly with their bite attack. Unlike
    normal shadows, shadow rats do not create spawn. Copyright Notice Authors
