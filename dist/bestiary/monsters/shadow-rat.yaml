Description:
  - >-
    Shadow rats are undead rats that can assume an incorporeal form. Other than
    their semi-translucent form (which they maintain regardless of their
    incorporeality or not), they resemble their earthly counterparts in all
    respects. Shadow rats attack relentlessly with their bite attack. Unlike
    normal shadows, shadow rats do not create spawn. Copyright Notice Authors
