    The sleek elasmosaurus is a long-necked, aquatic reptile. Although not
    technically a dinosaur, they and their kind are often found hunting in
    oceans and lakes in areas where dinosaurs are more common. You can create
    statistics for smaller, similar aquatic reptiles (such as the pleisosaurus)
    by applying the young simple template to the statistics presented above. An
    elasmosaurus is 45 feet long and weighs 4,000 pounds.
