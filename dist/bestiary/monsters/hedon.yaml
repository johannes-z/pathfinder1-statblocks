Description_Visual: >-
  This creature resembles an ugly elf with the lower torso of a giant bird. Its
  legs are the clawed talons of a falcon, covered in sickly greenish-brown
  feathers. Its hands end in wicked claws with dirty brown nails. A forked black
  tongue dances across the creature's lips, revealing a mouth of sharpened
  fangs.

Description:
  - >-
    The origins of the hedon are shrouded in mystery but many sages and scholars
    believe the creatures to be the union of a harpy and an elf or a harpy and
    some fey creature. Other sages dispute these claims and believe the hedon
    are the result of a curse laid on an entire community of fey creatures by a
    vengeful annis or hag.
  - >-
    Hedons are malevolent and violent fey creatures that dwell in darkened
    forests found on the fringes of civilization. They take great delight in
    tormenting travelers and townsfolk and always lair near heavily traveled
    roads or paths and communities. Many hedons sneak into nearby towns under
    the cover of darkness and slaughter livestock or kidnap children (because
    they are easier to carry and control than adults).
  - >-
    Hedons lair in caverns, caves, or nests built from branches, straw, twigs,
    and so on. Lairs are always kept well hidden away from prying eyes and are
    difficult to locate by all but the best of scouts and trackers. A typical
    hedon lair contains 2-4 adults and an equal number of noncombatant young.
    Mating season for hedons is year round and the female lays a clutch of 1d4
    eggs. The eggs hatch after about 3 months and young reach maturity within 2
    or 3 years.

    A hedon appears as a tan-skinned elf with the lower torso of a hawk or
    falcon. It rarely wears clothes, but should it choose to do so (and some do,
    especially to hide their appearance when they attempt to move through a
    populated area without drawing undue attention to themselves), it usually
    dons a long hooded cloak or robe of green, gray, or brown. Hedons rarely
    carry weapons, preferring to fight with their claws.
  - >-
    A hedon attacks with its spell-like abilities, targeting the strongest
    perceived foes first. It quickly follows this barrage with melee by grabbing
    its foe and raking with its clawed feet.
