  - name: Electricity Discharge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a giant electric catfish can generate a pulse of
      electricity that deals 2d6 points of electricity damage to everything a 10
      ft. radius. Living creatures within the area not only take damage but also
      are stunned for one round. A successful DC 20 Reflex save reduces the
      electricity damage by half and negates the stunning effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Giant electric catfish make their homes beneath fallen logs and in streambed
    pits where they face upstream with their mouth open, swallowing everything
    resembling food that should tumble or float into its toothless maw. They
    favor dank, dark, slow moving or stagnant water with limited visibility.
    They are nocturnal hunters and venture out a few hours after sunset to hunt.
    Giant electric catfish are about eight feet long but can grow to lengths of
    12 feet or more. Its bloated body is generally gray or grayish-brown in
    color fading to a dull white or cream color on its underbelly. Its eyes are
    small and its snout wide and round. Three sets of barbels (or feelers) are
    located around its mouth. Unlike many fish, a giant electric catfish has no
    dorsal fin. Giant electric catfish are territorial and defend their realms
    with great ferocity. Before engaging in combat, when threatened or facing a
    potential enemy, an electric catfish generates a pulse of crackling
    electricity in an effort to intimidate or discourage would-be predators.
    Failing this, the giant electric catfish enters combat and bites its foe. A
    giant electric catfish produces an electrical charge that tends to stun any
    creature within ten feet of it. Stunned prey are bitten and swallowed.
