Description:
  - >-
    The hyaenodon, sometimes called the short-faced hyena is a slightly larger
    relative of the common hyena. Hyaenodons (and hyenas) are generally thought
    of as scavengers but, in fact, most are skilled hunters quite capable of
    taking down large prey. When food is scarce, hyaenodons cover large areas
    individually in search of food, relying primarily on their sense of smell to
    locate potential prey.
  - >-
    Hyaenodons are very dangerous predators. They cover wide ranges of territory
    when hunting and prefer to disembowel their kills. These creatures either
    hunt alone or in large packs led by a single leader. Though they sometimes
    scavenge animals, the hyaenodon's sheer strength and size allows it to kill
    animals with ease (often animals larger than itself).
  - >-
    Favored meals include lions, deer, elk, moose, zebras, and bison. The
    largest hyaenodons (those of Huge size) do not generally hunt in packs.
  - They are solitary creatures by nature and hunt alone.
  - >-
    Hyaenodons have large, upward pointing ears and dark spots along their
    bodies. As they age, these spots grow darker. They range in size from 5 to 8
    feet long and weigh anywhere from 300 to 330 pounds. The largest hyaenodons
    reach lengths of 14 feet and weigh up to 600 pounds.
  - >-
    Hyaenodons have massive jaws and large bone crushing teeth. They walk on
    their toes, and their claws are blunt and non-retractile. A distinguishing
    feature of the hyaenodon is the difference in length between the front and
    rear limbs, which gives it the appearance of always running uphill.
  - >-
    Hyaenodons generally circle their opponents, sending a few of their number
    against their prey from all sides. The larger hyaenodons simply charge and
    bite their prey, crushing bone and tearing flesh with their teeth.
