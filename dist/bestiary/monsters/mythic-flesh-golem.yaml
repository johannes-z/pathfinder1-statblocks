SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Berserk (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a mythic flesh golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance
      each round that the golem goes berserk. A berserk golem attacks the
      nearest living creature or smashes some object smaller than itself if no
      creature is within reach, then moves on to spread more destruction. If the
      golem's creator is within 60 feet and succeeds at a DC 20 Charisma check,
      she regains control of the golem by speaking firmly and persuasively to
      it. If the golem is inactive for 1 minute, its berserk chance resets to
      0%.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mythic flesh golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that
      allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. • A mythic magical
      attack that deals cold or fire damage slows a mythic flesh golem (as the
      slow spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save). • A magical attack that deals
      electricity damage (other than the golem's own sparking slam) ends any
      slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of
      damage the attack would otherwise deal; (the golem gets no save against
      these attacks). If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed
      its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.
  - name: Mythic Brawler (Ex)
    description: >-
      The mythic flesh golem can spend a use of its mythic power to attempt a
      combat maneuver as a swift action with no attack of opportunity for the
      attempt.
  - name: Sparking Slams (Su)
    description: >-
      If a mythic flesh golem strikes an opponent twice in 1 round with its
      slams, that creature takes an additional 2d10 points of electricity
      damage. A flesh golem cannot use its electricity attacks to deal
      electricity damage to itself.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic flesh golem retains an unnatural level of electrical energy from
    the process that created it. This grants it limited intelligence, extra
    strength, and the ability to shock its opponents.
