Description:
  - >-
    Plantoid servitors are humans (and their ilk) who have fallen prey to a
    plantoid. It is possible for a plantoid servitor to operate independently of
    a plantoid, in which case the eyes will not glow. Plantoid servitors acting
    independently from one of the plantoid masters are capable of following only
    the simplest of instructions, such as "attack anyone entering this room,"
    and the plantoid is not able to give further instructions until it can once
    again gain physical contact with the plantoid servitor.
  - >-
    Plantoid servitors drop any held equipment when they are first dominated,
    but retain any worn gear such as armor, backpacks, capes, rings, and so on.
    At the GM's discretion, a plantoid servitor may still be wearing-and gaining
    the full benefit of-any special worn gear or magic items it possessed in its
    previous life.
