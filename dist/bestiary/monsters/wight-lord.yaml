SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoid creature that is slain by a wight lord becomes a wight itself
      in only 1d4 rounds. Although spawn so created are less powerful than wight
      lords, they are more powerful than typical wights, and are treated as
      wights with the advanced simple template. Spawn are under the command of
      the wight lord that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at
      which point they become fullfledged, free-willed advanced wights. They do
      not possess any of the abilities they had in life.
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A wight lord inflicts a negative level each time it hits a foe with a slam
      attack. Like cairn wights, a wight lord can channel this negative energy
      through any weapon it wields, inflicting a negative level with each
      successful hit with the weapon.
  - name: Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)
    description: >-
      While a wight lord is vulnerable to resurrection magic, it isn't quite as
      vulnerable as a typical wight. A raise dead or similar spell cast on a
      wight lord staggers it for 1d6+1 rounds if it fails a Will save, but does
      not destroy the wight. Using the spell in this way does not require a
      material component.
Description:
  - >-
    Dark princes and warlords of old, wight lords are undead monarchs. Where
    typical wights rise from a wide variety of individuals, wight lords rise
    from the bodies of despotic rulers or ruthless generals. Wight lords haunt
    the same ancient burial grounds and battlefields their lesser kin dwell in,
    but wight lords aren't satisfied by simply guarding their haunts against the
    living. They continue their reign as tyrants in death, ruling over undead
    armies and often compelling their unliving minions to wage war upon nearby
    towns or cities, sometimes even at the behest of bold and powerful
    necromancers. The statistics that are presented above represent the minimum
    power level of a wight lord. A wight lord can rise from the remains of any
    cruel or sadistic leader, but those who were higher than 11th level when
    they perished retain some of their previous life's knowledge-although not
    all of it. When this occurs, subtract 11 from the creature's previous number
    of class levels to determine the total number of class levels the wight lord
    possesses. Assign these class levels to the wight lord in a logical way-if
    it was a single-classed NPC in life, simply add more levels of that class to
    the wight lord. Multiclassed characters and those who possessed levels in
    prestige classes require more creativity in applying the class levels. The
    goal for building such a wight lord should be to approximate the themes and
    general abilities the creature had in life.
