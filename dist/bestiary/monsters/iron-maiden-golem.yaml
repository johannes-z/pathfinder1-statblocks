Description_Visual: >-
  A horrific torture device, the iron maiden stands ready for its next victim-
  only it doesn't stand patiently. It begins to clomp forward on iron legs, its
  lid slowly swinging open as if hungry for a new soul to torture.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animated Host (Su)
    description: >-
      Once a victim trapped within an iron maiden has died, it reanimates as a
      zombie in the next round (as if by an animate dead spell). It cannot
      escape, however, and serves only to fuel the iron maiden and provide it
      with skills and abilities. While it is trapped, the zombie cannot be
      attacked, damaged, turned, rebuked, or commanded, and it doesn't suffer
      any damage from the bladed lid. If the lid of the golem is somehow forced
      open, the zombie has the normal abilities of a Medium zombie (as detailed
      in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary). The victim of an iron maiden
      golem must be alive when it is placed inside and the lid is closed or the
      golem's animate host ability fails.
  - name: Bladed Lid (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living creature inside an iron maiden when the lid is closed is pierced
      by twenty dagger-like blades, dealing a total of 50 points of piercing
      damage each round. The lid automatically seals with an arcane lock spell
      with a caster level equal to that of the iron maiden golem's creator (14th
      level usually). The lid can be forced open with a successful Strength
      check (DC 34) or by casting dispel magic. The knock spell has no effect on
      the lid. The check DC is Strength-based and includes a +10 bonus from the
      arcane lock spell. Because of the shape of the iron maiden, only a Medium
      humanoid can be sealed inside.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      An iron maiden golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that
      allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. A magical attack that
      deals electricity damage slows an iron maiden golem (as the slow spell)
      for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire
      damage breaks any slow effect on the iron maiden golem and heals 1 point
      of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If
      the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit
      points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.
  - name: Steal Essence (Su)
    description: >-
      An iron maiden golem that has created a host using its animate host
      ability (see above) gains 10 temporary hit points, uses its own base
      attack bonus or the host's (whichever is higher), and can make normal use
      of the victim's skills, feats, and non-magical class abilities. The golem
      must substitute its own ability scores when determining its total skill
      bonuses; therefore it cannot use skills requiring Constitution or
      Intelligence, and since it cannot speak, many Charisma skills are severely
      limited. Likewise, the iron maiden golem must meet the requirements for
      any feat in order to make use of that feat (thus feats such as Dodge and
      Combat Expertise are unavailable to the golem). An iron maiden cannot use
      any divine spells or divinely granted special abilities, since the host
      within is no longer able to receive such abilities from her deity. An iron
      maiden likewise cannot use any arcane spells as its inherent magic
      immunity disrupts any attempt to do so.
  - name: Vulnerability to Rust (Ex)
    description: >-
      An iron maiden golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as that of
      a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.
Description:
  - >-
    An iron maiden golem is a variation of the iron golem. Like the torture
    device that is its namesake, an iron maiden golem is a hollow structure with
    several dagger-like blades on the inside of the lid. The golem itself has
    the appearance of a tall, well-muscled male or female warrior. When a living
    creature is placed into the iron maiden and the lid is closed the blades
    impale the unfortunate victim, causing an agonizing death. Unlike the
    coffin-like torture device, however, an iron maiden golem has articulated
    arms and legs, and is capable of moving under its own power. Although
    standard iron golems have a breath weapon, an iron maiden does not; it has
    the ability to usurp the essence of any humanoid being enclosed within,
    however. The corpse of the unfortunate victim trapped in the iron maiden
    golem is transformed into an undead being similar to a zombie. The iron
    maiden, with a victim trapped inside, can then utilize some of that victim's
    skills, feats, or combat capabilities. A trapped victim decays at an
    accelerated rate, so at least once a month an iron maiden golem must be
    given a fresh victim or it reverts to its normal capabilities (as reflected
    in the statistics block above). An iron maiden golem without a victim
    attacks by slamming opponents with its powerful fists. When a victim is
    trapped within, it fights in a style relevant to the victim. Construction An
    iron maiden golem is constructed from 5,000 pounds of pure iron, mixed with
    rare chemicals and ingredients costing at least 8,000 gp. IRON MAIDEN GOLEM
