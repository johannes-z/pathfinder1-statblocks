    description: >-
      When making a combat maneuver check, a gribbon gains a +2 bonus on its CMB
      check for the first gribbon adjacent to it, and an additional +1 bonus on
      CMB checks for each additional adjacent gribbon.
Description:
  - >-
    Gribbons, at first glance, resemble large monkeys with bat wings. Closer
    examination, however, reveals facial features of a more human than simian
    nature. Their bodies are covered in a coarse, brown fur, and their hands end
    in powerful and sharp claws. These creatures are fiercely territorial and
    prefer to swoop down from the treetops and assault trespassers without
    warning. Though they greatly prefer forests, gribbons have been known to
    reside in caves and caverns, especially those higher up with outcroppings
    where they can perch and survey their territory.
  - >-
    Gribbons are equally as likely to attack their opponents with weapons
    (preferring daggers and darts, though sometimes employing short swords) as
    they are with their claws. Their favorite tactic is to grab an opponent, fly
    above the ground and drop it.
