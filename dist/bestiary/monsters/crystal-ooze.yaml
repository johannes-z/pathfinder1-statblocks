SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      The digestive acid that covers a crystal ooze dissolves metals and organic
      material, but not stone. Each slam and constrict attack deals 1d6
      additional acid damage. Armor or clothing worn by a creature grappled by a
      crystal ooze takes the same amount of acid damage unless the wearer
      succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex saving throw. A wooden or metal weapon that
      strikes a crystal ooze takes 1d6 acid damage unless the weapon's wielder
      succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex save. The ooze's touch deals 12 points of acid
      damage per round to wooden or metal objects, but the ooze must remain in
      contact with the material for 1 full round in order to deal this damage.
      The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Transparency (Ex)
    description: >-
      Due to its lack of vivid coloration, a crystal ooze is difficult to
      discern from its surroundings in most environments. A DC 15 Perception
      check is required to notice the ooze. Any creature that fails to notice a
      crystal ooze and walks into it automatically suffers damage as if struck
      by the ooze's slam attack and is immediately subject to a grab attempt by
      the ooze.
  - name: Water Dependency (Ex)
    description: >-
      Crystal oozes can survive out of the water for 1 hour per 4 points of
      Constitution (after that, refer to the drowning rules in the Pathfinder
      Core Rulebook).
Description:
  - >-
    The crystal ooze is an aquatic variety of the gray ooze. It is
    semitransparent and clear and almost impossible to see in the water. The
    crystal ooze can grow to a length of up to 8 feet and a thickness of about 6
    inches. A crystal ooze strikes by slamming into its opponents. Paralyzed
    victims are devoured. Credit The Crystal Ooze originally appeared in the
