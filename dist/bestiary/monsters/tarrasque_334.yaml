IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Carapace (Su)
    description: >-
      The tarrasque's scales deflect cones, lines, rays, and magic missile
      spells, rendering the tarrasque immune to such effects. There is a 30%
      chance a deflected effect reflects back in full force at the caster;
      otherwise it is simply negated.
  - name: Powerful Leaper (Ex)
    description: >-
      The tarrasque uses its Strength to modify Acrobatics checks made to jump,
      and has a +24 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump.
  - name: Regeneration (Ex)
    description: >-
      No form of attack can suppress the tarrasque's regeneration-it regenerates
      even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If the tarrasque fails a
      save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3
      rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is inflicted upon its
      remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported as a means to save a
      region, but the method to truly kill it has yet to be discovered.
  - name: Rush (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per minute for 1 round, the tarrasque can move at a speed of 150
      feet. This increases its Acrobatics bonus on checks made to jump to +87.
  - name: Spines (Ex)
    description: >-
      The tarrasque can loose a volley of six spear-like spines from its body as
      a standard action with a toss of its head or a lash of its tail. Make an
      attack roll for each spine-all targets must be within 30 feet of each
      other. The spines have a range increment of 120 ft.
Description:
  - >-
    The legendary tarrasque is among the world's most destructive monsters.
    Thankfully, it spends most of its time in a deep torpor in an unknown cavern
    in a remote corner of the world-yet when it wakens, kingdoms die.
  - >-
    Although far from intelligent, the tarrasque is smart enough to understand a
    few words in Aklo (though it cannot speak). Likewise, it isn't mindless in
    its rampages, but instead focuses on targets that threaten it, and is
    difficult to distract with trickery.
