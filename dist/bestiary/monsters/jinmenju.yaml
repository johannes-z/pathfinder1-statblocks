SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fruits (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature that begins its turn within 5 feet of a jinmenju must succeed
      at a DC 22 Will save or be magically compelled to immediately grab a
      head-fruit and eat it. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. A
      creature that successfully saves is immune to that jinmenju's enticing
      head-fruits for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based. Anyone who
      takes a bite out of one suffers from the following effect. Head-Fruit
      Poison: Head-fruit-ingested; save Fort DC 22; frequency 1/round for 6
      rounds; effect 1d3 Wisdom damage and confused for 1 round; cure 2
      consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Intoxicating Stench (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a swift action, a jinmenju can cause its fruits to emit an
      unnaturally sweet aroma in a 60-foot spread for 6 rounds. All creatures
      within the area must succeed at a DC 22 Will save each round or be
      captivated. A captivated creature takes no actions except to approach the
      jinmenju via the most direct route possible. If this path leads it into a
      dangerous area or the jinmenju attacks it, the captivated creature
      receives a new saving throw. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Unsettling Drone (Su)
    description: >-
      A jinmenju emits a low, persistent hum that unnerves living creatures that
      hear it. Those within 30 feet of it must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or
      become shaken until they leave the affected area and for 1d4 rounds
      thereafter. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that
      jinmenju's unsettling drone for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Jinmenjus are trees that grow in hilly regions far from civilized lands, and
    prey on those who come too close. They are remarkably intelligent and
    crafty, and use both scent and magical compulsion to lure prey.
