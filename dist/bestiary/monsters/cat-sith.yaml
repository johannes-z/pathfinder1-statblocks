SpecialAbilities:
  - name: False Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a cat sith can fool a creature into believing it has been
      cursed by the cat sith's black magic. The target must be within 60 feet
      and must be able to see the cat sith to be affected by the false curse
      (Will DC 15 negates). An affected creature takes a -4 penalty on attack
      rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks, as if affected by
      bestow curse. Because this effect is not a true curse, the target gains a
      new saving throw to end the effect at the beginning of each day. This is a
      language-dependent, mind-affecting effect that can be affected by remove
      curse. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: No Luck (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by a cat sith's claws must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or
      be stricken with lucklessness. For 1d4 rounds, the affected creature can't
      benefit from any luck bonuses. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Cat siths are inscrutable feline creatures that inhabit highlands around
    towns and cities. They resemble common housecats at a glance, but cat siths
    are supernatural beings that have the cunning of civilized races and strange
    magical powers rivaling those of fey. They're capable of easily walking
    balanced on just their hind legs and wearing magic boots. They can carry one
    object in their front paws when walking bipedally, though they can't
    manipulate such objects with the fine control required to use weapons,
    wands, and similar objects.
  - >-
    Unpredictable yet sophisticated, these strange beings use their unassuming
    appearances to infiltrate civilized areas, either serving as spies for
    powerful spellcasters or entertaining their own unknowable agendas.
  - >-
    Many cultures fear cat siths and tell myths about their otherworldly powers.
    Some say that letting a cat sith near an unburied corpse may allow the beast
    to steal the departed's soul before it has made it to the Great Beyond.
  - >-
    A 7th-level spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can gain a cat sith
    as a familiar. Cat siths are heavier than most housecats, weighing between
    25 and 30 pounds. A cat sith is nearly 2 feet long from its nose to the base
    of its tail.
