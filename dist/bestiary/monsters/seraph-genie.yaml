SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fire Burst (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a seraph can emit a blast of
      elemental fire in a 30-foot-radius burst. Creatures in the area take 8d6
      points of fire damage. A successful DC 19 Reflex save reduces the damage
      by half. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Heat (Ex)
    description: >-
      A seraph generates so much heat that its mere touch deals an additional
      1d6 points of fire damage. A seraph's metallic weapons also conduct this
      heat. A seraph can start or stop this ability as a free action once per
      round on its turn.
Description:
  - >-
    The seraphs are genies from the Plane of Fire, and the sworn enemies of the
    efreet. A violent war between the two genie races has spanned centuries and
    spilled into an uncountable number of planes. Any encounter between a seraph
    and an efreeti sparks a battle that only ends when one or the other is
    killed. Those that aid the efreeti are treated by seraphs as if they were
    efreeti themselves; no mercy is shown in battle to an ally of the hated fire
    genies. The seraphs often align themselves with djinn as they both share the
    efreeti as a common enemy.
  - >-
    A seraph prefers to use its spell-like abilities over melee weapons in
    combat, often allowing its opponents to move in close so the seraph can
    unleash its fire burst. A seraph facing overwhelming odds in battle attempts
    to flee; covering its escape by turning invisible or erecting a wall of fire
    between itself and its enemies. When battling efreet, a seraph often employs
    cold-based magic weapons such as frost scimitars and icy burst spears.
  - A typical seraph stands 10 feet tall and weighs about 1,500 pounds.
  - >-
    Some seraphs are noble, known as beys or caliphs. A noble seraph has 14 Hit
    Dice and gains the following spell-like abilities: 3/day-fire seeds, heat
    metal; 1/day- elemental swarm (fire elementals only), greater invisibility.
    A noble seraph's caster level for its spell-like abilities is 16th. Noble
    seraphs are CR 10.
