Description:
  - >-
    Hydrodaemons are frog-like daemons that swim the River Styx. They are the
    only known creatures in existence that can touch the waters of the Styx
    without suffering any ill effects. Hydrodaemons are 10 feet tall and weigh
    about 4,000 pounds. They move by leaping in a manner akin to a frog. Large
    flaps of skin under their arms allow them seemingly to glide when leaping.
    The flesh of a hydrodaemon is warty and green. Its eyes are a sickly yellow
    in color.
