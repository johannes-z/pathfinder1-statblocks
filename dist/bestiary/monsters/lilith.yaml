  A curvaceous and beautiful woman with cinnamon-brown skin, dark red hair, and
  shining emerald eyes stands before you. She is scantily clad in scarlet robes
  and carries a longsword at her side.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by her fear
      aura for one day. Other devils are immune to the aura. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. Amaheuris: Lilith carries a unique +2 axiomatic unholy
      longsword. Once per day, she can fire a finger of death (caster level
      15th) from her weapon at a single target she can see and that is within 50
      feet. A target struck must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or die. Even
      if the save succeeds, the target takes 3d6+10 points of damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Lilith was once consort to Moloch, ruler of the 6th plane of Hell. When the
    Great Uprising that pitted Lucifer and his minions against Asmodeus and his
    minions occurred, Lilith sided with Lucifer. When Moloch heard of her
    betrayal he raged against her, nearly killing her. If not for the swift
    action of several of her lilins (who sacrificed themselves for her), she
    would have surely been killed. During the commotion and chaos, she was
    spirited away to a safe location by Xaphan.
  - >-
    When Lucifer constructed the plane of Infernus, Lilith had found her new
    home. She became a member of Lucifer's court and serves as one of his
    concubines and chief officers (ruling and commanding several companies of
    lilins). Lucifer, as of late has taken a special interest in her and rumors
    abound that should he take a queen to rule beside him it will be Lilith.
    This has infuriated more than one of his consorts, especially Demoriel who
    jealously wants the throne of Infernus and Lucifer all to herself. Lilith
    knows of Demoriel's jealousy and always keeps an open eye on her (including
    planting several spies in Demoriel's camp).
  - >-
    Lilith appears as an insanely comely female standing 5'7" tall and weighing
    roughly 130 pounds. Her skin is cinnamon colored and her hair, waist length
    and blood red. Her eyes are emerald green and sparkle under the fiery skies
    of Infernus. Her hands end in claws and underneath her thick hair she hides
    two tiny dark black horns. She has a small pair of leathery black bat-like
    wings that she can fold against her back and hide under her robes at a
    moment's notice should the need for such deception arise.
  - >-
    "…and thus, Lucifer created Infernus, a plane of eternal and everlasting
    fire and suffering: one plane, one ruler; created by his own hands, his own
    blood, and a portion of his very essence.
  - >-
    From his great keep, Malefacta, Lucifer waits for the day he can challenge
    for the Throne of Hell again." - translated from the ‘Infernal Grimoire: The
    Politics of Hell' Lilith begins combat by peppering her foes with her
    spell-like abilities.
  - >-
    When combat begins, Lilith usually hits the closest opponents (she deems
    most susceptible) with her mass hold monster ability. Next she unleashes a
    fireball hoping to engulf as many opponents as possible. She then charges in
    with her longsword, peppering her foes with lightning bolts and fireballs.
    If she has time before battle begins, she uses her magic circle against good
    and her unholy aura on herself. Any foes slain in combat are subjected to
    her animate dead spell-like ability. Against powerful foes she summons other
    devils to fight with her.
