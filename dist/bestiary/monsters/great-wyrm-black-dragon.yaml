SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid Pool (Su)
    description: >-
      An ancient or older black dragon can use its breath weapon to create an
      acid pool as a standard action. This acid pool has a radius of 60 feet.
      When an acid pool is created, anyone inside its area takes 24d6 points of
      acid damage (Reflex half). Any creature that starts its turn touching this
      pool takes damage, but can make a Reflex save for half. Each round, the
      total damage dice of the pool is halved (10d6 round 2, 5d6 round 3, 2d6
      round 4, 1d6 round 5) until the result would be less than 1d6. The acid
      pool floats on water, and deals damage to anything on the surface.
  - name: Acidic Bite (Su)
    description: >-
      At old age, a black dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of acid
      damage. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to
      6d6.
  - name: Charm Reptiles (Sp)
    description: >-
      A great wyrm black dragon can use this ability three times per day. It
      works as a mass charm monster spell that affects only reptilian animals.
      This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.
  - name: Corrupt Water (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day an adult or older black dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of
      still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life.
      The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items
      (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a
      Will save (DC equal to the dragon's frightful presence) or become ruined.
      This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to
      that of the dragon's frightful presence.
  - name: Crush (Ex)
    description: >-
      A flying or jumping Huge or larger dragon can land on foes as a standard
      action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective
      only against opponents three or more size categories smaller than the
      dragon. A crush attack affects as many creatures as fit in the dragon's
      space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC
      equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically
      taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves
      off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a
      combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush
      each round if they don't escape. A crush attack deals the indicated damage
      plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus.
  - name: Speak with Reptiles (Sp)
    description: >-
      A young or older black dragon gains the constant spell-like ability to
      speak with reptiles. This functions as speak with animals, but only with
      reptilian animals.
  - name: Swamp Stride (Ex)
    description: >-
      A very young or older black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand
      without penalty at its normal speed.
  - name: Tail Sweep (Ex)
    description: >-
      This allows a Gargantuan or larger dragon to sweep with its tail as a
      standard action. The sweep affects a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet
      (or 40 feet for a Colossal dragon), extending from an intersection on the
      edge of the dragon's space in any direction. Creatures within the swept
      area are affected if they are four or more size categories smaller than
      the dragon. A tail sweep automatically deals the indicated damage plus
      1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (round down). Affected creatures
      can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage (DC equal to that of the
      dragon's breath weapon).
  - name: Water Breathing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its
      breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.
Description:
  - >-
    Lording over the darkest swamps and marshes, black dragons are the
    undisputed masters of their domain, ruling through cruelty and intimidation.
    Those who dwell within a black dragon's reach live in fear. Black dragons
    tend to make their lairs in remote parts of the swamp, preferably in caves
    at the bottom of dark and fetid pools. Inside, they pile up their filthy
    treasure and sleep amid the roots and muck. Black dragons prefer their food
    a bit rotten and will often allow a meal to sit in a pool for days before
    consuming it. Black dragons prefer treasures that do not rot or decay,
    making their hoard, full of coins, gemstones, jewelry, and other objects
    made from stone or metal.
