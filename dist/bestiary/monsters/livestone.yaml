SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Engulf (Ex)
    description: >-
      A livestone that has engulfed an opponent can instantly solidify its form,
      dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage per round to the trapped victim
      (DC 17 Fort half). The save DC is Strength-based. An engulfed creature can
      be freed by killing the livestone or by casting stone to flesh on the
      livestone. This deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the
      livestone and automatically ejects an engulfed victim.
  - name: Solidify (Ex)
    description: >-
      A livestone can solidify all or part of itself into a material with the
      hardness and consistency of solid rock. A solidified part of a livestone
      has a hardness of 8 and a break DC of 50. A livestone can effect the
      solidification as a free action. An opponent attacking a livestone must
      succeed on a DC 19 Reflex save each time his attack hits. If the save is
      failed, the livestone actually solidifies the portion of its body at the
      instant it was hit, thus applying its hardness rating of 8 to any damage
      it takes. A livestone cannot attack if its entire form is solidified. The
      save DC is Strength-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Livestone is a strange species of ooze that can solidify itself into a
    consistency that very closely resembles that of stone. In its solidified
    form, a livestone is indistinguishable from a normal boulder or slab of
    rock. No one is quite sure from where livestones originated, but ancient
    legends say that the dwarves accidentally unleashed these horrors on the
    surface world by digging into their subterranean lairs. Eventually, some
    livestones found their way to the surface. Livestones are incredibly
    longlived, solidifying and entering a form of hibernation and remaining that
    way indefinitely until a food source wanders too near. Livestones have a
    simple chameleon-like ability to mimic local stone by ingesting a small
    sample and adjusting its own color and texture to match. A hibernating
    livestone can become covered in moss and lichens to further the deception.
  - >-
    Livestones generally attack from ambush, waiting for a potential meal to
    pass before flowing into their ooze form and rushing up to engulf the prey.
    If the surprise attack fails, a livestone resorts to hammering with a
    pseudopod. When attacking in this manner, a livestone will solidify the tip
    of the pseudopod and strike with a hammer-like blow. A livestone's usual
    tactic is to solidify the half of its body facing the prey and then send
    hard-tipped pseudopods out from behind this shield (see solidify above).
