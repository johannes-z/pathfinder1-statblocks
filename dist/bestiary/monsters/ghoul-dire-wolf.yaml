Description:
  - >-
    Ghoul wolves are carnivorous undead wolves that delight in hunting living
    creatures, catching them, and tearing them to shreds. These creatures are
    most often found haunting desolate moors and marshes. Ghoul wolves hunt in
    packs, surrounding their prey and circling as they move in for the kill.
