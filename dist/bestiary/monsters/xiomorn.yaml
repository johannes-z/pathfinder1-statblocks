Environment: any
Description_Visual: >-
  This towering, spindly, four-armed entity appears to be made of stone and
  crystal, yet it moves with a fluid grace.
Source: The Emerald Spire
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Command Stone (Sp)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as dominate monster, equivalent of a 9th-level
      spell, but only on creatures with the earth subtype or constructs made out
      of stone. When used against a construct, this ability overcomes any spell
      resistance, but the effects last for only 1 round per level.
  - name: Crystal Burst (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a xiomorn can create an
      explosion of razor-sharp crystals at a range of up to 120 feet. These
      crystals fill a 30-foot-radius burst and deal 12d6 points of piercing and
      slashing damage (Reflex DC 25 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Crystallization (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature struck by a xiomorn's claw must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude
      save or take 1 point of Dexterity drain. On a critical hit, the claw deals
      2 points of Dexterity drain on a failed save. As long as a creature
      suffers any of this drain, portions of its body appear as living green
      crystal and it gains the earth creature subtype. A creature drained to 0
      Dexterity in this manner transforms into a green crystal statue, as if
      affected by flesh to stone. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Item Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A xiomorn can always activate spell trigger and spell completion items as
      if the spell were on its class list. For the purposes of crafting magic
      items or constructs, it is treated as though it possessed all item
      creation feats.
Description:
  - >-
    Organization solitary, pair, or cabal (3-6 plus 4-12 pechs and 2-6 earth
    elementals)
  - Treasure double
  - >-
    The xiomorns consist of two castes: the mythic Vault Builders and the
    non-mythic Vault Keepers. The Vault Builders ruled over their less powerful
    counterparts, but both are among the most ancient forms of life-primeval
    elemental beings who travel to raw, new worlds upon the Material Plane,
    pursuing strange ecological experiments into the nature of life. The worlds
    these enigmatic beings have visited possess strange ruins in remote regions
    and immense, vault-like caverns deep underground where ecologies that
    shouldn't exist flourish. Xiomorns have little interest in protecting a
    world's indigenous life, except as necessary for their experiments' goals,
    and often war against such races when native empires encroach upon the
    xiomorns' experimental realms.
