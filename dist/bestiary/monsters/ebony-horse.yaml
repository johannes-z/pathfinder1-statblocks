    description: >-
      An ebony horse can remain on the Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water for
      up to 24 hours at a time. An ebony horse can extend this protection to its
      rider and up to four of the rider's allies in a 30 foot radius around
      itself. If the ebony and horse and any protected allies move more than 30
      feet apart, the protection ends for that individual and cannot be regained
      for 24 hours. If the ebony horse is killed, this protection ends
      immediately. Failure to return to the Material Plane before that time
      expires causes an ebony horse to take 1 point of damage per additional
      hour spent on the elemental plane, until it dies or returns to the
      Material Plane. Other creatures protected by elemental endurance suffer
      damage normally from the elemental plane when that time expires.
Description:
  - >-
    Ebony horses are massive stallions prized for their loyalty, running speed,
    their ability to fly, and their ability to enter the various elemental
    planes unharmed. These creatures are often used by genies, demons, devils,
    and others due to their innate ability to withstand the various planar
    atmospheres and survive unharmed while simultaneously extending this
    protection to others.
  - >-
    Ebony horses are generally solitary creatures but on very rare occasions a
    small herd of these creatures may be encountered. When not traveling the
    many planes of existence, ebony horses spend their time roaming vast
    grasslands on the Material Plane. They do not associate with normal horses
    or other steeds, preferring to keep company with their own.
  - >-
    Ebony horses kick with their front hooves and lash out with a nasty bite
    when forced into combat. They are strong-willed and brave creatures, rarely
    backing down when confronted. They are, however, smart enough to know when
    the battle is lost and take to the air in such times. An ebony horse is
    fiercely loyal creature to its rider and, if on a hostile plane and
    protecting a rider with its elemental endurance ability, it will not flee
    and end this protection, even fighting to its death if necessary. Ebony
    horses have no known enemies, but tend to show aggression around nightmares.
    While no known enmity exists between the two, combat is as likely to occur
    as is no confrontation at all.
  - >-
    Larger ebony horses (10 HD, Huge size) are known to exist and are used
    extensively by the seraphs (see the Genie, Seraph entry in this book) in
    their ongoing wars with the efreet.
