SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Corrupt Water (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a black dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water
      within 210 feet, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing
      life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic
      items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed
      at a Will save (DC 21) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of
      a 1st-level spell.
  - name: Swamp Stride (Ex)
    description: >-
      A black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its
      normal speed.
  - name: Water Breathing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its
      breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic black dragon eyes can pierce fog to find prey. Its very flesh and
    blood is infused with deadly acid, and like a snake it can gulp down an
    entire meal without chewing. A mythic black dragon enjoys regurgitating a
    swallowed opponent to let it rot for a few days before eating it as an
    actual meal, or repeats this cycle on a living creature as cruel torture.
