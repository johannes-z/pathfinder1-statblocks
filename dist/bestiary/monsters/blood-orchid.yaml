Description_Visual: >-
  This beast has three downward curving "petals" of flesh with a dark, pebbly
  outer hide and a pallid whitish underside. The petals end with split tip, and
  converge at the blood orchid's center. On its underside at the center dangle a
  swarm of writhing pallid tentacles: 16 manipulator arms and eight thinner
  tendrils with red eyes at the ends. At the center of these tentacles is a
  sphincter-shaped mouth at the end of a flexible trunk one foot long and six
  inches in diameter. At the apex of the creature there is another cluster of
  eye tendrils.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Around Vision (Ex)
    description: A blood orchid sees in all directions at once. It cannot be flanked.
  - name: Blood Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      On a successful grapple check with two or more tentacles against a single
      foe a blood orchid can pull the grappled creature to the mouth on its
      underside as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
      The mouth latches on and drains blood from the victim. Each round it
      maintains its grapple, the blood orchid automatically deals 1d4 points of
      bite damage and 1 point of Constitution damage as it drains its victim's
      blood.

  - name: Telepathic Bond (Ex)
    description: >-
      Blood orchids communicate through a non-magical telepathic bond. They can
      sense emotions in other blood orchids at a distance of 100 ft. or less,
      and emotions in other creatures at a range of five feet. They can
      communicate mentally with each other through full telepathy at a distance
      of 20 ft. or less, and can share knowledge very rapidly when touching each
      other.
Description:
  - >-
    Blood orchids are territorial, xenophobic, and possessive. They rarely form
    alliances with other creatures, as their alien mindset keeps them from
    forming any common ground. They regard other races as aberrant and not to be
    trusted, even other lawful creatures.
  - >-
    Communication for blood orchids is through a means of empathy/ telepathy.
    They have no sense of hearing, which helps render them immune to sonic
    effects. The blood orchid can close its outer petals downward and rest on
    the ground, where it resembles a rocky nodule or fungus of some kind.
  - >-
    Blood orchids occasionally develop sorcerous talents, and transform into
    savants. When their abilities have reached a certain level, they can evolve
    into a grand savant. Normally each colony of blood orchids is led by a
    single grand savant, and another cannot evolve while one is present.
    Typically, a blood orchid savant ready to become a grand savant leaves the
    colony with a few followers, and set out to establish a new brood elsewhere.
