SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      The digestive acid that covers a gray ooze dissolves metals and organic
      material, but not stone. Each slam and constrict attack deals 1d6
      additional acid damage. Armor or clothing worn by a creature grappled by a
      gray ooze takes the same amount of acid damage unless the wearer succeeds
      on a DC 20 Reflex saving throw. A wooden or metal weapon that strikes a
      gray ooze takes 1d6 acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a
      DC 20 Reflex save. The ooze's touch deals 12 points of acid damage per
      round to wooden or metal objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with
      the material for 1 full round in order to deal this damage. The save DCs
      are Constitution-based.
  - name: Transparent (Ex)
    description: >-
      Due to its lack of vivid coloration, a gray ooze is difficult to discern
      from its surroundings in most environments. A DC 15 Perception check is
      required to notice the gray ooze. Any creature that fails to notice a gray
      ooze and walks into it automatically suffers damage as if struck by the
      ooze's slam attack and is immediately subject to a grab attempt by the
      ooze.
Description:
  - >-
    Slinking their way through cold swamps and bleary marshlands, or sometimes
    even dungeons and caverns, gray oozes consume any organic materials they
    encounter. Despite its lack of intelligence, the gray ooze is a most
    problematic creature due to its transparency. While the ooze cannot easily
    climb walls or swim, its habit of lurking in the thick mud that lines the
    banks of marsh pools or lying in harmless-looking pools on dull-colored
    dungeon floors makes it dangerously easy to overlook and step on. Some sages
    believe that the gray ooze is the result of a failed alchemical experiment,
    while others postulate that the first gray oozes spontaneously arose from a
    cesspit of magical detritus. Of course, these theories that gray oozes are
    not living organisms, but rather the alchemical result of an unfortunate
    mixture of rare caustic fluids and magical waste, are derided by many who
    dwell in areas plagued by the creatures but which do not have a long history
    of magical pollution. Variant Gray Oozes The gray ooze adapts readily and
    swiftly to changes in environments, the simple structure of its primeval
    form and its method of using fission to reproduce all but ensuring that such
    changes occur. Listed below are two such variants that adventurers have
    encountered. Crystal Ooze (CR 4): The crystal ooze is an aquatic variant
    that dwells in deeper waters than most commonly found in the gray ooze's
    beloved swamps. A crystal ooze has the aquatic subtype and a swim speed of
    30 ft. The crystal ooze lacks the gray ooze's constrict ability, but it does
    secrete a paralytic toxin that causes those whom it strikes to become
    paralyzed for 3d6 rounds if they fail a Fortitude saving throw (the save DC
    is Constitution-based). Id Ooze (CR 6): Perhaps the strangest variant gray
    oozes are those that have developed a rudimentary intelligence, including
    the ability to communicate telepathically with other oozes, or even the
    ability to blast enemies with pulses of raw mental power. Id oozes are
    advanced gray oozes with an Intelligence score of 2 (and thus gain skill
    ranks and feats-typically 4 ranks in Stealth, Improved Initiative, and
    Toughness), can communicate basic empathic information with other id oozes
    within 100 feet via telepathy, and can use lesser confusion at will as a
    spell-like ability (CL equals the id ooze's HD).
