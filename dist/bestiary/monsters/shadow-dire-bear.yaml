Description_Visual: >-
  A looming shadow like that of a massive bear with claws like sickles rises
  before you.
Group: Shadow Dire
Source: Tome of Horrors 4
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any animal reduced to Strength 0 by a shadow dire bear becomes a shadow
      animal within 1d4 rounds. It is not under the control of its killer but
      attacks all living targets immediately.
  - name: Grab (Ex)
    description: >-
      While partially corporeal, a shadow dire bear that hits with a claw attack
      can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an
      attack of opportunity. The grapple is lost if the shadow dire bear becomes
      incorporeal again. If the shadow sire bear gains a hold, it automatically
      deals bite damage each round that the hold is maintained.
  - name: Partially Corporeal (Su)
    description: >-
      As a move action a shadow dire bear can become partially corporeal without
      provoking attacks of opportunity. It can likewise resume its incorporeal
      state as a move action without provoking attacks of opportunity. While in
      its partially corporeal state the shadow dire bear benefits from its
      natural armor and its Strength bonus for attacks and damage. In this state
      its attacks have a 20% chance to ignore natural armor, armor, and shields.
      Likewise, though attacks against it with magic weapons can hit normally,
      it can ignore damage from attacks with normal weapons from a corporeal
      source 50% of the time. It does not retain any of the other incorporeal
      traits while in this state.
  - name: Strength Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      The touch of a shadow dire bear while incorporeal deals 1d6 points of
      Strength damage to a living creature. This is a negative energy effect. A
      creature dies if this Strength damage equals or exceeds its actual
      Strength score.
Description:
  - >-
    A strange incarnation of sentient darkness and feral rage, this is an
    incorporeal form of a dire bear that resembles its earthly form in all other
    respects. Its origin lies in the strange result of a shadow's create spawn
    ability affecting an animal. How such an outcome occurred is anyone's guess,
    but sages in the lore of undeath have been unable to recreate it since. It
    is difficult to see in dark or gloomy places but is clearly visible in
    bright illumination.
  - >-
    Like a dire bear the shadow dire bear is over 12 feet long, but it is
    weightless except when partially corporeal when it weighs about 1,000 lb. A
    shadow dire bear attacks aggressively like its living counterparts with its
    incorporeal claws and bite alternating this with its grab and tearing claws
    as it becomes partially corporeal.
