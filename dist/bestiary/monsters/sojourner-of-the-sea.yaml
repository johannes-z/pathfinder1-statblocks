Description_Visual: >-
  This metallic construct appears as a crudely rendered statue of a human male,
  with fully articulated joints. Though its facial features are nothing more
  than vague shapes with little definition, its torso is carved with an
  intricate pattern of runes. Along the area of its left "thigh" is a long
  silvery abrasion, perhaps the result of some ancient battle.

    description: A sojourner suffers no penalties when fighting underwater.
  - name: Aquatic Entangle (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every four rounds, a sojourner can animate the local sea flora to
      entrap its opponents. This ability functions as an entangle spell (Reflex
      DC 20 partial; CL 20th).
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A sojourner is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell
      resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as
      noted below. A magic missile paralyzes a sojourner (as the hold person
      spell) for 1 minute, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals
      cold damage breaks any hold effect on the sojourner and heals 1 point of
      damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the
      amount of healing would cause the sojourner to exceed its full normal hit
      points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A sojourner gets no
      saving throw against cold effects. A sojourner is unaffected by rust
      attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.

    description: >-
      A sojourner deals one and a half times its Strength modifier and threatens
      a critical hit on a 19-20 with its slam attacks.
  - name: Resilient (Ex)
    description: >-
      A sojourner gains bonus hit points as a construct as if it were two sizes
      larger.
Description:
  - >-
    This metal construct, known as the sojourner of the sea, is believed to be
    one of a kind, and for that the civilized world is thankful. The sojourner
    is a man-shaped machine that constantly walks the ocean floor on an unknown
    quest, destroying anything that attempts to sway it from its inexorable
    path.
  - >-
    The sojourner was given its name by a maritime explorer who encountered it,
    fought it, and retreated with his life to tell the tale. No one knows the
    sojourner's real name, or even if it has one. The sojourner is fashioned
    from a special, highly resilient metal of unknown origin, its power source
    hidden somewhere deep inside its nearly impregnable frame. It continuously
    and unstoppably walks the lightless ocean floor, having traversed thousands
    of miles since it was first spotted years ago. So far it has proven
    indestructible. Its purpose remains a mystery. The symbols on its torso are
    as inscrutable as the sojourner itself.
  - >-
    During its endless trek along the sea bed, if the sojourner encounters an
    obstacle it cannot pass through or climb over, it walks around the
    obstacle's perimeter or burrows beneath it, regardless of the distance
    required. It descends into the deepest ocean trenches and slowly advances up
    the far side. If a living being attempts to impede its progress, the
    sojourner attacks without hesitation, though it never initiates combat until
    it is touched or attacked. The unrelenting sojourner of the sea cannot swim.
    The creature is immune to the corroding and rusting effects of water.
  - >-
    In combat the sojourner is mindless, fearless, and unremitting. Once battle
    commences, the sojourner does not relent until all opponents are eliminated
    or have fled.
