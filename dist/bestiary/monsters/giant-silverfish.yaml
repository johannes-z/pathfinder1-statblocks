Description:
  - >-
    These creatures are thought to be one of the oldest insects in the world.
    Silverfish live in and around dark, damp places replete with moisture but
    can wander into any environment when hunting. These nocturnal hunters
    consume just about anything they come across, including using their acid to
    break down bits of paper and small wooden objects to extract what nutrients
    they can from the material.
  - >-
    Giant silverfish appear as almost flattened insects tapered at one end,
    giving them a fish-like appearance. Their scales are grayish-silver in color
    and their tails are composed of equal-length bristles that trail behind them
    as they move. They use their long antennae to sense their environment. Giant
    silverfish can grow to lengths of 8 feet or so, though most are around 6
    feet long. Their typical lifespan is up to 8 years.
  - >-
    Giant silverfish avoid combat most of the time unless they are hunting. When
    attacking, they prefer to attack from ambush, either springing from a
    secluded location to attack or dropping on unsuspecting prey from above.
