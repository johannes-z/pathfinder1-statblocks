SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      A brown pudding secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material
      quickly, but does not affect metal or stone. Any melee hit or constriction
      attack deals acid damage, and the opponent's clothing and armor (nonmetal
      only) take the same amount of damage unless they succeed on DC 21 Reflex
      saves. A wooden weapon that strikes a brown pudding takes 2d6 acid damage
      unless it succeeds on a DC 21 Reflex save. If a brown pudding remains in
      contact with a wooden object for 1 full round, it inflicts 21 points of
      damage (no save) to the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Corrosion (Ex)
    description: >-
      An opponent that is being constricted by a brown pudding suffers a -4
      penalty on Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing
      and armor.
  - name: Suction (Ex)
    description: >-
      The brown pudding can create powerful suction against any surfaces as it
      climbs, allowing it to cling to inverted surfaces with ease. A brown
      pudding can establish or release suction as a swift action, and as long as
      it is using suction, it moves at half speed. Because of the suction, a
      brown pudding's CMD score gets a +10 circumstance bonus to resist bull
      rush, awesome blows, and other attacks and effects that attempt to
      physically move it from its location.
Description:
  - >-
    A variety of the black pudding, the brown pudding is found only in temperate
    and subtropical swamps. It is dark brown in color. Brown puddings have a
    tougher surface membrane than other puddings, giving them a natural armor
    bonus. They attack by grabbing and constricting their prey.
