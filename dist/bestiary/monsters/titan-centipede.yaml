    The largest of their kind, titan centipedes are thankfully also the rarest.
    They attack other living creatures fearlessly, and require constant
    sustenance to nourish their vast bulk. Humanoids are in most danger from
    titan centipedes when mounted rather than afoot-a good-sized horse makes a
    much more satisfying meal to the centipede than a few bites of human. Titan
    centipedes are solitary by nature and because of the demands of their
    appetite, though when food is plentiful, multiple centipedes sometimes lurk
    in the same area.
