Description:
  - >-
    Giant saw-toothed or serrated beetles are deadly predators that hide in
    their burrows and ambush creatures that come too close. They make their
    homes in deep burrows on the forest floor and usually cover the opening with
    sticks, leaves, branches, and whatever else they can find. It takes a
    successful Spot check (DC 20) to notice a giant saw-toothed beetle's hidden
    burrow.
  - >-
    These beetles form colonies of about ten creatures. They are highly
    aggressive creatures and actively seek sources of meat. Their usual diet
    consists of small forest animals such as rabbits, deer, or moles. They are
    even known to devour their own when food is short or when a member of the
    colony becomes sick or weak.
  - >-
    Giant saw-toothed beetles wait for their prey to come close to their burrow.
    Hiding at the edge of the burrow, the beetle sits motionless until its
    target is within range. It then charges out, grabs its target with its
    serrated mandibles and clamps down, holding on until the prey dies.
