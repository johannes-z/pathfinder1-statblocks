SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Stasis (Su)
    description: >-
      Ifestus can merge with the earth, typically under a volcano or near a
      magma vent or tectonic plate, and go dormant for an indeterminate amount
      of time. The titan doesn't have to breathe, eat, or drink during this
      time. He is aware of his immediate surroundings out to the range of his
      telepathy during this time, and may communicate with creatures within the
      range of his telepathy. Ifestus can end his stasis at any time as a free
      action. Entering status is a standard action.
Description:
  - >-
    Ifestus found his way to Golarion thousands of years ago. He separates his
    time between catastrophic destruction and millennia-long slumbers in the
    molten bowels of the planet. A patient being, he uses his special ability to
    seek solitude in magma chambers, in massive volcanoes, and along the edges
    of grinding tectonic plates. It's rumored that many of Golarion's greatest
    earthquakes and volcanic eruptions were either facilitated by or witnessed
    by Ifestus. He was slumbering in a great volcano in Casmaron when Earthfall
    struck, and wandered the surface of the planet for a decade thereafter
    before finally settling into Mount Keeba. Quiet for thousands of years,
    Ifestus now rumbles and stirs.
