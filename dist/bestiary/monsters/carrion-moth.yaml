Description_Visual: >-

  needle-like mandibles.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Drone (Ex)
    description: >-
      The flapping wings of a carrion moth emit a mind-numbing drone that
      affects all creatures within 80 feet that hear it. Affected creatures must
      succeed on a DC 15 Will save or become confused for 2d4 rounds. A creature
      that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same carrion moth's
      drone attack for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Stench (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a carrion moth dies, its carcass splits open and releases a
      foul-smelling gas. All living creatures (except other carrion moths)
      within 5 feet of the carcass must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be
      nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell
      removes the effect from the nauseated creature. This is a poison effect.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The carrion moth is believed by sages to be an advanced form of a slime
    crawler. Just as the caterpillar grows into a moth, sages believe the mature
    slime crawler eventually sheds its form and transforms into the carrion
    moth. No cocoon or evidence has been found to support this theory, but it is
    widely accepted among the more learned sages of the world.
  - >-
    The carrion moth is a large moth-like creature growing to a maximum length
    of 20 feet. Its wings are lined with tiny holes and veins that allow the
    carrion moth to emit a whining drone that affects all creatures that hear
    it. Carrion moths are attracted to the stench of decaying flesh and the
    light of anything larger than a torch or lantern.
  - >-
    A carrion moth attacks by biting with its mandibles and slapping with its
    tentacles. Paralyzed creatures are carried off and devoured.
