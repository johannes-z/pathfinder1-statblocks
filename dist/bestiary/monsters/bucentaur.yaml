      Although bucentaurs are not especially intelligent, they possess innate
      cunning and logical ability. This gives them immunity to maze spells and
      prevents them from ever becoming lost. Further, they are never caught
      flat-footed.
Description:
  - >-
    These beings, also known as mantaurs or bulltaurs are the progeny of a
    minotaur and a heifer, though rarely (1% chance) one is born to normal
    minotaurs. Bucentaurs are considered to be a blessing by many minotaur
    clans, and are often raised by minotaur priests to be kings and rulers of a
    minotaur tribe. Their battle prowess is legendary, the skulls of many heroes
    adorning the walls of their pen.
  - >-
    Bucentaurs make their home in desolate forests and ruins, generally away
    from civilized races. They are fiercely territorial, attacking any who
    trespass their realm, including other bucentaur clans on occasion. Hunts are
    a standard occasion and can see up to six or eight of these creatures strike
    out to capture and kill large game.
  - >-
    Bucentaurs stand almost 8 feet tall and weigh over 2,200 pounds. Skin colors
    vary widely, but most tend to be darker colors such as blacks or
    blackish-blue. Eyes are almost always dark. Bucentaurs typically live to 50
    years of age.
  - >-
    Bucentaurs are straightforward combatants, bull rushing and goring foes
    before cutting them down with their greataxes. They are savage creatures,
    and rarely flee from a fight, preferring to inflict as much damage as
    possible on their foes before the need to escape.
