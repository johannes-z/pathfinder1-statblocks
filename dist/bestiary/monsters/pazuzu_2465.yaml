SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aerial Passivism (Ex)
    description: >-
      No aerial creature (defined in his dominate aerial creatures special
      attack) of 10 HD or less willingly attacks Pazuzu (but can be forced to
      magically). If attacked by a magically compelled aerial creature, Pazuzu
      can make an Intelligence check (opposed by the spellcaster's caster level
      that compelled the aerial creature). If Pazuzu wins the opposed check, he
      automatically breaks the magical compulsion controlling the creature (as
      if by greater dispel magic).
  - name: Breath Weapons (Su)
    description: >-
      Pazuzu has three breath weapons, each detailed below. Regardless of which
      breath weapon he uses, he can't breathe more than once every 1d4 rounds.
      Each breath weapon is a 100-foot long cone. The save DC is
      Constitution-based and includes a +2 bonus for Pazuzu's Ability Focus
      feat. Creeping Doom: This works as the spell of the same name (CL 20th).
      Insect Plague: This works as the spell of the same name (CL 20th).
      Corrosive Gas: Damage 16d6 acid, DC 40 Reflex half.
  - name: Dominate Aerial Creatures (Su)
    description: >-
      Pazuzu can automatically dominate any aerial creature of 6 HD or less that
      is within sight as a free action. Targeted creatures do not get a save
      against this effect. This functions as a charm monster spell (CL 20th). At
      any one time, Pazuzu can have a total of 40 HD of creatures dominated.
      Affected creatures must remain with sight or the effect ends. Aerial
      creatures are defined as avians (including giant and dire versions),
      gargoyles, harpies, and creatures with the air subtype. Carriontooth:
      Pazuzu's unique weapon is a +5 anarchic keen greatsword.
Description:
  - >-
    Pazuzu is the demon prince of aerial creatures, and is revered as such on
    both the Abyssal plane and the Material Plane. Unlike other demon princes,
    his lair is not confined to a single plane or multiple adjoining planes;
    Pazuzu rules the sky realms above all layers of the Abyss. (No demon prince
    has contested his rulership of the skies thus far.) Pazuzu has a great many
    dealings with creatures on other planes, including devils. He seems to be on
    fairly good terms with several powerful dukes and arch-devils of Hell. He
    never enters that plane, but has been known to meet with such a duke on
    Acheron or Tarterus.
  - Pazuzu stands 8 feet tall and weighs 700 pounds.
  - >-
    Pazuzu prefers to use his spells and spell-like abilities, subjecting his
    opponents to a magical onslaught of great power. If cornered or forced into
    melee, he prefers to use his claws or weapon. If he is outclassed or
    overmatched, he summons aerial creatures and demons to his aid.
  - >-
    Servants of Pazuzu Followers of Pazuzu are evil humanoids that respect and
    revere the air and sky. Devout followers of Pazuzu are called Aerial Lords
    and must sign a pact of evil with Pazuzu. Aerial Lords can receive spells
    from Pazuzu and are granted access to two of the following domains: Air,
    Chaos, and Evil.
