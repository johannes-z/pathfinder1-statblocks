Description_Visual: >-
  The stone floor ripples and shakes as a toothy, gnashing maw opens in its
  center, and then the edges of the room curl up and inward to reveal an
  underside of wriggling tendrils and fetid digestive juices.

Description:
  - >-
    Female lurking rays, known as trappers, are the masterminds of their race.
    Too large to fly (and often gravid with wriggling young), the intelligent
    trappers scrape themselves out depressions in the floor of regularly
    traveled chambers and then lie in them, changing their coloration and
    texture perfectly to blend with the rest of the floor, and sometimes even
    creating protrusions in the shape of items they know to be valuable to their
    prey creatures. When a lulled individual steps onto the trapper's surface,
    the ray twists itself up around it, smothering and beating its victim
    senseless before drawing it into its maw for slow digestion. Though quite
    intelligent even by human standards, trappers devote almost all of their
    mental faculties to perfectly remembering every sensory detail about their
    surroundings in order to make their chameleon-like disguises all the more
    cunning and difficult for their prey to resist. Trappers can grow to be 15
    feet from tip to tip, and weigh nearly 2,000 pounds when fully fed.
