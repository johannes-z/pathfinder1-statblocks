SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hibernation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A pyropiscis can enter a state of hibernation for an indefinite period of
      time in order to survive longer periods away from a source of lava.
      Entering a state of hibernation takes 1 hour, during which the pyropiscis
      encases itself in a thick layer of igneous stone. While hibernating, a
      pyropiscis doesn't need to breathe, drink, or eat. The stone casing has
      hardness 8 and 90 hit points. As long as the casing remains intact, the
      pyropiscis within remains unharmed. The pyropiscis remains in a state of
      hibernation until it senses lava (or another source of extreme heat)
      nearby, at which point it breaks out of its case over the course of 1d4
      minutes.
  - name: Lava Bomb (Ex)
    description: >-
      Like an active volcano, a pyropiscis can spit a lava bomb-a blob of molten
      rock-as a ranged attack (range increment 30 feet). If a lava bomb hits, it
      deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of fire damage to
      its target.
  - name: Lava Dependency (Ex)
    description: >-
      A pyropiscis can breathe indefinitely while submerged in lava. It can
      survive out of lava for 1 hour per point of Constitution. Beyond this
      limit, the pyropiscis runs the risk of suffocation, as if it were
      drowning.
  - name: Searing Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A pyropiscis's searing-hot jaws are designed to bind readily to flesh,
      giving it a firm grasp on its prey. This functions as the constrict
      ability, except that a pyropiscis deals 2d6 points of fire damage when it
      makes a successful grapple check, rather than dealing bludgeoning damage.
  - name: Sprint (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per minute, a pyropiscis may sprint, increasing its land speed to 40
      feet for 1 round.
Description:
  - >-
    Few environments are more inhospitable to life than the depths of a volcano,
    where magma surges through the rock like blood through veins. Of the
    creatures that do live in this hellish landscape, few are better adapted
    than the pyropiscis. Pyropiscises depend on this deadly environment of
    extreme temperatures and choking gases for their very lives. While they have
    a fishlike appearance, pyropiscises do not swim-their bodies are far too
    dense to float in water or similar liquids. Instead, pyropiscises rely on
    their powerful muscles and sharp scales to burrow through molten rock.
  - >-
    A typical pyropiscis measures over 12 feet long, and weighs almost 4,000
    pounds. Brilliant red scales glow and pulse with terrible heat, protecting
    those portions of their bodies not covered in blackened iron plates.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    The unique physiology of pyropiscises allows them to derive sustenance
    directly from molten rock, leaching necessary minerals and volatiles from
    lava as it passes through their gills. A pyropiscis draws energy directly
    from the lava in which it dwells, using the intense heat to power its
    metabolic processes. While pyropiscises don't need to consume the flesh of
    other creatures to survive, they require nutrients from flesh to grow and to
    reproduce. A well-fed pyropiscis continues to grow throughout its lifetime
    and can reach an immense size.
  - >-
    Pyropiscises typically lurk close to the surface of active volcanoes, and
    ride eruptions like flowing tides to find prey. They burst forth from rivers
    of lava to snatch fleeing creatures with their jaws, and consume the charred
    corpses of those who can't outrun the volcano's fury. Once they have
    finished feeding, they swim back against the current of lava and into the
    volcano. Those pyropiscises that linger to gorge themselves, and those too
    weak to fight the downhill flow, become stranded on land. They then enter
    hibernation, awaiting the next eruption. A pyropiscis can hibernate for
    centuries at a time. Eventually, however, a stranded pyropiscis begins to
    starve, and will break out of its hibernation in search of food.
  - >-
    Pyropiscises reproduce by laying clutches of four to six eggs. They surround
    their eggs in fiercely guarded nests constructed of iron drawn from the
    surrounding stone. Newly hatched pyropiscises look like worms made of lava.
    Their scales are soft, and they lack the protective plating of their adult
    counterparts.
  - >-
    Sometimes, pyropiscises venture deep into the hearts of volcanoes that host
    portals to other planes, and wander through in search of sustenance. The
    Elemental Plane of Fire is their most common extraplanar hunting ground, but
    occasionally pyropiscises are found hunting in Hell. Lengthy sojourns into
    infernal realms sometimes grant pyropiscises fiendish traits.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Pyropiscises are found across Golarion, almost exclusively in areas of
    intense volcanic activity. They can reach many of the world's active
    volcanoes by navigating the interconnected series of magma chambers that
    worm their way through the depths of the earth, ranging from arctic hot
    springs to volcanic tropical islands.
  - >-
    These lava-dwelling fish rarely venture far onto the surface, preferring to
    remain belowground where rock remains molten for hundreds or thousands of
    years. The natural instability of their homes sometimes turns against
    pyropiscises, however, and particularly violent eruptions send angry
    pyropiscises raining down on nearby surface settlements, where they gorge
    themselves and cause even greater destruction.
  - >-
    Pyropiscises are social creatures. They live in schools of a dozen or more
    individuals, typically hunting alone or in smaller packs. They reproduce
    infrequently, and only ever after a successful hunt. Pyropiscises are
    intensely protective of all the young in their school regardless of
    parentage, and take turns guarding them. When a new crop of young reaches
    maturity, they form a school of their own, venturing to a different part of
    the same volcano. Even if a pyropiscis's hunts take it to other planes, it
    always strives to return to the volcano of its birth to spawn. Pyropiscis
    schools readily adopt stranded wanderers, but while welcoming to their own
    kind, these fiery beasts are hostile to all other creatures.
  - >-
    Some fire giants domesticate pyropiscises, overcoming their surly, willful
    nature through stubbornness. The giants' size and immunity to fire allow
    groups of them to handle an unruly pyropiscis throughout its training.
    Still, fire giants must continually placate their pets with charred flesh to
    prevent them from lashing out. This steady stream of food grows the
    pyropiscis to an enormous size, and some fire giants have been known to ride
    giant pyropiscises as mounts into battle. Pyropiscises also serve fire
    giants as fortress guardians, swimming in moats of magma at the entrances to
    their tunnels.
  - >-
    Pyropiscises are a recurring bane to miners and excavators. The rumble and
    activity of mining efforts can stir hibernating pyropiscises from their
    slumber, and the newly wakened pyropiscises spare few lives in their search
    for food and safety. The most unfortunate miners may even break directly
    into a pyropiscis's cocoon, as a hibernating pyropiscis encased in solid
    rock is indistinguishable from the surrounding stone. Those with the skill
    or unfortunate experience to recognize a sleeping pyropiscis for what it is
    can make a decent profit selling the monster to individuals in search of a
    guardian or owners of particularly opulent menageries, provided they can
    chisel the cocoon free and transport it to market without rousing the
    creature inside.
