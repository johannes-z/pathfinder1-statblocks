      A sheet fungus can hold itself completely still and resembles a rug or
      wall hanging. It takes a successful DC 20 Perception check to notice a
      sheet fungus before it attacks.

      A sheet fungus can try to wrap a creature of its size or smaller in its
      body as a standard action. The sheet fungus attempts a grapple check that
      does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check,
      it establishes a hold and squeezes the engulfed prey dealing automatic
      slam damage each round the grapple is held. Attacks that hit an engulfing
      sheet fungus deal half of their damage to the monster and half to the
      trapped victim.
Description:
  - >-
    Sheet funguses are flat, sheet-like plant creatures believed to be created
    by evil priests who experimented with various plants and funguses mixed with
    dark magic. They resemble tapestries or rugs and use this to their advantage
    when hunting for food. Sheet funguses are fond of blood and flesh,
    especially that of humans. Sheet funguses are sometimes found acting as
    guards in temples dedicated to foul fungus and ooze demons.

    A sheet fungus is a flat, sheet thin creature about 6 feet long and 2-1/2 or
    3 feet wide. It weighs about 3 pounds. Two small dark circles "sewn" into
    its design function as eyes.
  - >-
    Sheet funguses press themselves up against walls or floors so as to appear
    to be nothing more than a wall hanging or rug. When a potential meal wanders
    too close, the sheet fungus springs out and attempts to envelope the target
    in its body. A grabbed opponent is held until it dies or until the sheet
    fungus takes 3/4 or more of its hit points in damage at which time it
    usually releases its prey and flees. A hungry sheet fungus will fight to the
    death however. There is a 5% chance that any creature slain by a sheet
    fungus returns to life as a free-willed vegepygmy.
