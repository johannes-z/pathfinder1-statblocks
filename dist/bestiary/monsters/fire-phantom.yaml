Description_Visual: >-
  This humanoid has raging fire for hair and flame-encased fists.  Elemental
  fire plays across its body exposing patches of charred flesh.  Its eyes and
  tongue look like tiny balls of molten fire. Blackened teeth fill its mouth and
  flames dance in the back of its throat.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fire (Ex)
    description: >-
      A fire phantom's fists are swathed in elemental fire. Any melee hit deals
      fire damage. Creatures attacking a fire phantom unarmed or with natural
      weapons take fire damage each time their attacks hit.
  - name: Fire Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, a fire phantom can hurl a
      small globe of elemental fire to a range of 30 feet (no range increment).
      By making a successful ranged touch attack, it deals 2d6 points of fire
      damage. A creature hit must make a successful DC 15 Reflex save to avoid
      catching on fire. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Immolation (Su)
    description: >-
      Normally used as a last resort, a fire phantom can detonate itself in an
      inferno of elemental fire that deals 6d6 points of fire damage to all
      creatures within a 10-foot radius. A successful DC 15 Reflex save halves
      the damage. The save DC is Charisma-based. This instantly kills the fire
      phantom if it fails a DC 20 Will save. Even if the fire phantom survives,
      its flames are extinguished for 1 minute. During this time the fire
      phantom cannot use its fire blast ability and cannot deal fire damage with
      its slam attack. It retains the fire subtype. After 1 minute, its fires
      relight and it may deal fire damage normally and use its fire blast
      ability. If the fire phantom survives the immolation it may not use it
      again for one day.
  - name: Rage (Ex)
    description: >-
      A fire phantom is in a constant state of agony from the elemental fire
      that consumes its body. Therefore, it is always in a berserk rage and
      gains Str +4 and -2 AC (both already included in the statistics block
      above). The fire phantom cannot end this rage voluntarily and it cannot be
      suppressed or negated.
Description:
  - >-
    When a creature dies on the Elemental Plane of Fire, its soul often melds
    with part of the fiery plane and reforms as a fire phantom; a humanoid
    creature composed of rotted and burned flesh and elemental fire. Fire
    phantoms desire nothing more than to return to the Material Plane and
    destroy as many living creatures as possible by consuming them in the same
    flames that now house their spirit.
  - >-
    Fire phantoms are encountered in areas where fires are already burning
    (campfires, pyres, vigils, etc). They step through a portal from the Plane
    of Fire into a fire on the Material Plane. This fire must be at least Small
    or larger; else any attempt by the fire phantom to enter the Material Plane
    through that fire automatically fails. Once it enters the plane, it often
    lies in wait in the fire for potential victims to come near it. A fire
    phantom hiding inside a fire is difficult to see requiring DC 25 Perception
    check.
  - >-
    A fire phantom waits inside its fire until it spots a living creature. It
    then rushes out, shrieking and hurling globes of fire. If faced with
    overwhelming odds or facing certain destruction, the fire phantom either
    moves as close as possible to as many foes as possible or attempts to draw
    in as many of its opponents as possible and uses it immolation ability.
  - >-
    In normal melee, the fire phantom alternates between hurling globes of fire
    and pummeling a foe with its burning fists. When a fire phantom is wounded,
    flames dance and play around the wound. Fire phantoms fight until destroyed
    or all opponents are dead or flee.
