  This creature resembles a giant gray or brown ant with leathery skin covered
  in coarse, black bristles. Its deep, inset eyes are black and its mouth is
  filled with rows of jagged teeth. Two large silver mandibles protrude just
  above its mouth. Each mandible has a barb on its inside midway between the
  creature's mouth and the end point of the mandible.

Description:
  - >-
    The ant lion is a vicious insect-like creature that lurks in the bottom of
    pits and holes feeding on those unfortunates that fall in.
  - An ant lion is about 9 feet long and weighs nearly 700 pounds.
  - >-
    Ant lions dig deep, funnel-shaped pits in which to trap their prey. An ant
    lion pit is about 60 feet across and about 20 feet deep. A creature that
    steps on the pit must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or slip and fall down
    into the center of the funnel. It is there the ant lion waits, buried just
    under the surface of the ground. When prey falls to the center of the
    funnel, the ant lion surfaces and attacks, using its mandibles to grab and
    tear its prey.
  - >-
    An ant lion that gets a hold does not release its prey until either it or
    the prey is dead or the hold is broken.
