      As a standard action, a tsaalgrend can release a cloud of toxic spores in
      a 10-foot-radius spread. Each living creature within this area must
      succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or become paralyzed with fear as the
      victim vividly hallucinates for 1d4 rounds. A creature that successfully
      saves against this effect is immune to the same tsaalgrend's spores for 24
      hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A tsaalgrend is a predatory creature resembling a tangle of sturdy vines
    with jagged purple thorns. Its coloration is mottled with brown, green, and
    yellow mold patches that flake and fall as the creature writhes through the
    air. The tsaalgrend's vines barely conceal two translucent, gas-filled sacks
    that act as balloons, enabling it to float along above the ground.
    Stretching from the creature's center are two longer vines that the
    tsaalgrend uses to capture its prey. An opening filled with rows of spiky
    thorns serves as the creature's mouth and is positioned on the creature's
    underside, where it constantly emits a wet, rancid stench. A tsaalgrend
    typically grows to be over 3 feet long, and weighs about 40 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Strange and sentient plants, tsaalgrends float up to the surface from their
    underground habitats in a constant search for prey. Growing in the darkened
    depths, these fungal creatures shun light, only hunting at night near the
    cave openings from which they emerge. Tsaalgrends can fly, albeit awkwardly,
    by forcing air into and out of their gas bladders. This helps them not only
    get around in the difficult conditions found underground, but also avoid
    becoming snacks for enterprising predators. When not flying, the creatures
    constrict and relax their tangle of vines to provide a roiling form of
    locomotion. They can move slowly across the ground and even climb vertical
    surfaces. Tsaalgrends are often found clinging to the walls in subterranean
    chambers, and sometimes whole colonies can fill a cave with the airy sounds
    of rustling vines and the ventilation of their gas bladders.
  - >-
    Tsaalgrends are carnivorous hunters that paralyze prey by hovering above
    their victims and raining toxic spores. They then use their thorny vines to
    wrap up their prey and transfer it to their mouths. Since tsaalgrends are
    small and relatively weak, larger prey often eludes these creatures' grasp.
    Instead, tsaalgrends feed on insects, rodents, snakes, and other similar
    creatures they find crawling around in caverns. A tsaalgrend's mouth is
    lined with crisscrossed rows of jagged thorns, layered in rings, appearing
    like a shark's teeth. Inside its mouth, quick-moving tendrils covered in
    tiny barbed spines wrap around food and pull it to the creature's stomach,
    rasping its meal against its rows of teeth to help break down the body into
    more easily digestible chunks before finally allowing stomach acid to
    complete the digestion process.
  - >-
    Tsaalgrends not only produce their own fungus, but also play host to a
    multitude of other molds, fungi, mosses, and epiphytes. The most powerful
    mold growing within a tsaalgrend is the fine, dustlike black spores it
    generates. Used for hunting, these spores can be released in a wide area.
    Any creature breathing them in is immediately subject to an overwhelming
    fear response as its mind is flooded with the most frightening things
    imaginable. The victim's breathing becomes quick and shallow, the heart rate
    rises dramatically, and nearby sounds become dull over the rush of blood in
    the ears. The mind screams to run away, but the muscles simply cannot react.
  - >-
    Opportunistic alchemists have been known to hunt and trap tsaalgrends with
    the intention of painstakingly harvesting the black spores from living
    specimens and using them to fabricate new and potent inhaled poisons.
    Securing a living tsaalgrend is important to the process, as the spores lose
    potency soon after they are released, making storage for later utilization
    impractical. Such alchemists often run afoul of druids with an affinity for
  - >-
    fungal creatures who have an interest in communing with and protecting
    tsaalgrends.
  - >-
    Though tsaalgrends display only limited intelligence, they seem to be
    capable of communicating with each other through the deliberate transfer of
    spores. These bouts of communication involve bursts of various colors and
    types of spores in quick succession. This behavior has been observed just
    prior to coordinated hunting efforts. Some creatures that have spent time
    around tsaalgrends claim that the plants also respond to spoken language.
    Critics of this theory say that the plant creatures are simply responding to
    the noise and the presence of a potential meal. Several distinct patches of
    stubby 1- or 2-inch growths found along the creature's sides are believed to
    serve as eyes.
  - >-
    Though tsaalgrends favor damp environments, they have extremely dry
    exteriors which make them especially vulnerable to fire and fire-based
    attacks. Tsaalgrends exposed to fire can be reduced to piles of ash in just
    a few moments. As such, tsaalgrends avoid open flame, and creatures that
    share environments with these floating plants use this knowledge to their
    advantage to keep their caves free of floating predators.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Tsaalgrends live and breed in underground caverns and other dark, damp
    places, but it's strongly suspected that they didn't evolve naturally on
    Golarion. Even though the creatures live almost exclusively in underground
    environments, those who explore the Darklands rarely report the creatures
    too far afield from caverns directly below Numeria, suggesting that
    tsaalgrends may have come to Golarion during the Rain of Stars. The plants
    also tend to share environments with vegepygmies and the russet mold that
    spawns them, however, leading other scholars to claim that tsaalgrends are
    somehow magically manipulated offshoots of those creatures, if not the
    direct product of drow sporecrafting. Still others believe that the plant
    creatures must stem from a subterranean portal to the First World, perhaps a
    breach broken open by the immense impact of the crashing Silver Mount. Only
    further study will reveal the truth.
  - >-
    Tsaalgrends bloom infrequently, producing offspring only when certain
    conditions are met. Environmental conditions linked to moisture levels,
    available food, and the presence of other fungal creatures trigger the
    growth of sacs that produce vegetative spores. These spores are
  - >-
    distributed safely on damp ledges covered with slimes, fungi, or other
    fertile organic matter like guano. These spores develop over the course of a
    few weeks, forming the young tsaalgrends' spore sacs first. As they mature,
    the spore sacs lift developing tsaalgrends into the air, making them
    vulnerable to predators as they lack the ability to control their flight
    until they sprout their thorny tendrils. It takes a full month for
    tsaalgrends to reach maturity. On average, tsaalgrends live for about 4
    years, though larger specimen have been reported, suggesting that their
    lifespan can be extended under ideal conditions.
  - >-
    While most sentient, underground races treat tsaalgrends like nuisances and
    avoid these creatures, a tribe of derro living in the Darklands beneath
    Numeria corrals dozens of tsaalgrends in caves secured with iron grates.
    Eager to breed larger tsaalgrends or those with even more potent fungal
    poison, these derro explore the Darklands in order to seek out new and
    unusual tsaalgrends to capture and add to their corrals as spore stock.
    Rumor has it that the derro have bred a massive tsaalgrend that fills an
    entire cavern room by itself.
