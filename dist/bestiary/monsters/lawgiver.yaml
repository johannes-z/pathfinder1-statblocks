Description:
  - >-
    Abadar's herald is the Lawgiver, a golem-like creature of gold and
    consecrated steel. Massive and powerful, the divine emissary appears as a
    giant in elaborate golden armor bearing a titanic warhammer. Standing still,
    the Lawgiver seems to be a fantastic statue crafted in honor of the god of
    law. When it's active, its steps shake the earth and the blows of its
    legendary hammer-the god-forged Gavel of Abadar-can shatter castle walls.
    Stoic, infinitely patient, and entirely dedicated to the Keeper of the First
    Vault, the Lawgiver is righteous, relentless in its cause, and capable of
    exacting incredible destruction. This sentinel of civilization appears where
    the forces of chaos threaten to undo the works of lawful communities and
    hinder the inexorable march of progress.

    Although it knows several languages, the herald of Abadar restricts its
    communication to an unusual degree. It has only ever been heard speaking in
    numbers, measurements, and-most frequently-direct quotes from Abadar's holy
    writings, the Order of Numbers and the Manual of City Building.
  - >-
    Over the past century, followers of Abadar have reported seeing the Lawgiver
    wandering in remote places, from ancient caves to underwater trenches,
    seemingly searching for something. These travels have lead to widespread
    conjecture and debate among the faithful.
  - The Herald of Abadar stands exactly 25 feet tall and weighs 30 tons.
