Description_Visual: >-
  This unnaturally pale woman is dressed in the somber garb of a mourner, her
  countenance covered by a lengthy black veil.
Group: Psychopomp
Source: AP 64
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Grave Dependent (Su)
    description: >-
      A kere is mystically bonded to a single gravestone-typically the most
      impressive or oldest in a graveyard-and must never stray more than 300
      yards from it. A kere who moves 300 yards beyond her bonded grave
      immediately becomes visible and unable to use any of her spell-like
      abilities. A kere who is out of range of her bonded grave for 24 hours
      takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage, and another 1d6 points of
      Constitution damage every day of separation that follows-eventually, this
      separation kills the kere. A kere can break this bond or forge a new bond
      with a new grave by performing a 24-hour ritual and making a successful DC
      20 Will save. If a kere is not bonded with a grave, she must either
      actively try to forge a new bond or attempt to return to the Boneyard
      (where she takes no penalties from not being bonded).
  - name: Grave Meld (Su)
    description: >-
      A kere can meld with any gravestone or funerary sculpture, similarly to
      how the spell meld into stone functions. She can remain melded with such a
      structure as long as she wishes.
  - name: Grave Tell (Sp)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as the spell stone tell, but only affects stone
      funerary structures, like gravestones, cemetery monuments, lych-gates,
      mausoleums, and similar constructions.
  - name: Infectious Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature struck by a kere's shroud must succeed at a DC 20 Will save
      or become frightened for 2d4 rounds. Any creature that physically touches
      a creature frightened by this effect must succeed at a DC 20 Will save as
      well or also be frightened for 2d4 rounds (though the fear of the creature
      touched is not contagious). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Shroud (Ex)
    description: >-
      A kere's shroud is an insubstantial thing that only a kere can touch.
      Creatures that come into contact with this shroud find it to be as
      insubstantial as mist-though they often do feel the terror it inspires. A
      creature that is unaware of a kere and is struck by her shroud is not
      aware that a weapon has struck it. A kere's shroud vaporizes upon its
      owner's death.
  - name: Spiritsense (Su)
    description: >-
      A psychopomp notices, locates, and can distinguish between living and
      undead creatures within 60 feet, just as if she possessed the blindsight
      ability.
  - name: Spirit Touch (Ex)
    description: >-
      A psychopomp's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are
      treated as though they had the ghost touch weapon special ability.
  - name: Veil of Tears (Su)
    description: >-
      Any graveyard that hosts a kere is gloomier and more solemn. All exterior
      areas within such a graveyard are perpetually affected by darkness and
      mind fog (Will DC 20). Additionally, any undead creature that enters the
      area is also affected as per the spell slow (Will DC 20). Those who save
      against these effects are immune to the graveyard's veil of tears for the
      next 24 hours. Those who fail are affected by these penalties for as long
      as they remain in the graveyard. A veil of tears can be raised or lowered
      by the resident kere as a free action. The veil disperses if a kere leaves
      the graveyard or is destroyed, and rises upon her return. The veil can
      also be dispelled for 1 day by casting dispel magic or a similar spell
      upon the kere's bonded gravestone. The spell effects are cast at the
      kere's caster level (usually 11th). The saving throw DCs are based on the
      resident kere's Charisma.
Description:
  - >-
    Certain places are sacred, settings meant to remain free of the raucous
    sounds and defiling touch of the living. Graveyards number among some of the
    most obvious of such places, where stone guardians and the buried weight of
    the dead bear on visitors with undeniable gravity. But certain forces
    disregard the fundamental sanctity of such ground-mortal and deathless
    heretics who use such places to hunt, feed, or cloak fouler deeds. Yet not
    all cemeteries are unguarded, and the vaporous shadows and palpable dread of
    some burial grounds suggest not corruption, but the custody of an ominous
    otherworldly guardian. Keres, like all psychopomps, are emissaries of the
    Boneyard, the necropolis that all mortals must traverse at the end of life.
    While most psychopomps concern themselves with the souls of the recently
    deceased, keres mind the resting places of the dead. Their stewardship
    derives not from any otherworldly care for the deteriorating dust left in
    the wake of mortal life, but rather from an interest in those who come
    seeking the dead where they lie. Such creatures often engage in perversions
    keres seek to oppose. To this end, keres take up lonely residences amid the
    tombs and monuments of graveyards, spreading an ominous air and giving rise
    to tales of hauntings and strange encounters to deter even the boldest
    intruders from trespassing upon the fields they tend. Keres appear as pale,
    sickly women standing about 5 feet tall and weighing less than 100 pounds.
    Ecology As otherworldly natives, keres have little direct impact on the
    world of the living, but the atmosphere they intentionally create is
    undeniable. To deter the living from treading upon the cemeteries they mind,
    keres employ tactics similar to those of mournful ghosts and mythical beings
    from storytellers' tales of spirits and haunts. Their presence fills the
    area they guard with a palpable dread, and they fill these cemeteries with
    baleful howling, somber illusions, and glimpses of their own ghastly forms.
    While they rarely create phantasmagoric images of the undead- out of a
    loathing for such perverse creatures-their unsettling displays of dangerous
    animals, lost children, whispering plants, shuddering gravestones, living
    statuary, pale doppelgangers, unnatural weather, and other eerie phenomena
    are typically more than enough to give a graveyard a haunted reputation.
    Habitat & Society A kere's exact methods usually matter little, as they tend
    to keep to more vulnerable, remote cemeteries, and prove most active when
    night cloaks the dark deeds of trespassers. But, occasionally, overzealous
    keres come into opposition with a fearful community and those sent to deal
    with the supposed haunting. Since their aloof nature causes them to avoid
    speaking directly with mortals, keres usually deal with would-be exorcists
    in the same manner they deal with other trespassers-by trying to frighten
    them away. Those who refuse to be frightened might be attacked, or faced
    with inquisitive illusions as a kere attempts to divine whether the
    interlopers are threats to her graveyard or not.
  - >-
    More than once, a kere has been known to grow bored in her vigil and
    actively attempt to attract mortal visitants, but such attention-seeking
    psychopomps often find the added excitement isn't worth the bother.
  - >-
    For all of the ambiance and grim reputations cultivated by keres, their
    primary objective upon the Material Plane is to preemptively thwart the
    deeds of necromancers and undead. To this end they terrorize grave robbers,
    harry the work of dark cultists, and openly attack the unliving. Any undead
    beings who enter or manifest in a cemetery under a kere's care find the
    weight of eternity crushing down upon them, making the most common sorts
    easy prey for these sentinel psychopomps. In some cases, though, more
    powerful undead might find ways to undermine a kere's defenses, or even
    drive her off. Such desperate keres have been known to grudgingly seek out
    aid, typically from the church of Pharasma or fringe-dwelling magic-users,
    in countering the taint of undeath.
