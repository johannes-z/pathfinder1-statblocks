    description: >-
      A witherstench constantly emits a putrid stench that nearly every form of
      animal life finds offensive. All living creatures (except witherstenches)
      within 30 feet of a witherstench must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or
      be nauseated (unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do
      anything else requiring attention; can only take a single move action per
      turn) for as long as they remain within 30 feet of the creature. Moving
      out of the affected area leaves the character sickened (-2 penalty on all
      attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and
      ability checks) for 1 round after which time he recovers immediately. The
      save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures that successfully save cannot be
      affected by the same witherstench's stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or
      neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature.
      Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant
      to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.
Description:
  - >-
    A witherstench (also called skunk beast) is a mutated relative of the common
    skunk. It is about 4 feet long and weighs around 50 pounds. Its diet
    consists of carrion, and the creature is always found in areas where such
    "food" is plentiful.
  - >-
    Witherstenches shuns combat, but attacks if cornered, raking at their
    opponents with their filthy claws.
