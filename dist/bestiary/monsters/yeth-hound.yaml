SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bay (Su)
    description: >-
      When a yeth hound howls or barks, all creatures except other evil
      outsiders within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or
      become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic mindaffecting fear effect.
      Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to
      the same hound's bay for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Flight (Su)
    description: A yeth hound can cease or resume its flight as a free action.
  - name: Sinister Bite (Su)
    description: >-
      A yeth hound's bite is treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of
      overcoming damage reduction. In addition, a good-aligned creature bitten
      by a yeth hound must make a DC 14 Will save or be shaken for 1 round. If
      the victim is already suffering from a fear effect (such as the hound's
      bay attack), the victim is instead completely overcome with fear and can
      do nothing but cower for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Yeth hounds are evil outsiders that delight in hunting intelligent prey.
    They lope through the night skies, relentlessly pursuing their chosen quarry
    for miles, and harrying them with their frightful baying. Yeth hounds hunt
    only at night.
  - >-
    They fear the sun and never venture out in daylight, even if their lives
    depend on it. A yeth hound stands 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs
    about 400 pounds.
  - >-
    Yeth hounds do not collect treasure, having no use for such baubles. The
    thrill of the hunt and the sweet tang of fear in their prey is all they
    value. However, some items of worth may occasionally be found in a yeth
    hound den, the discarded remnants of prey dragged back to the lair.
  - >-
    Despite their bestial appearance, the yeth hound is rather intelligent, even
    if it does little with its intellect but devise and carry out ingenious,
    hateful plans to torment and horrify its prey before it finally strikes.
  - >-
    Yeth hounds can often be found in the company of night hags or evil hunters.
    Yeth hounds hate other canine monsters such as barghests and worgs, and
    attack them on sight if they have the advantage of numbers. They are often
    associated with particularly bestial demons, and can be found serving demon
    cults as guardians and trackers. A gift of a yeth hound companion to a
    particularly successful cult is sure sign of favor in the eyes of a demonic
    patron. A cult with yeth hounds granted to them in this manner must take
    care to retain this favor, for if they displease their demonic patron, the
    hounds could turn on them.
  - >-
    Yeth hounds inhabit secluded dens in remote wilderness areas far from
    bothersome civilization. These dens are always subterranean, far removed
    from the hated sunlight. Yeth hounds range great distances from their dens
    during their nightly hunts, and have been known to carry kills for miles
    just for the comfort of consuming a fresh meal in their lair.
  - >-
    The sight of a yeth hound loping through the sky with a body clenched in its
    jaws is unsettling indeed.
