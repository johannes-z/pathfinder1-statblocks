  This dried-out clump of thorny brush has torn free of its roots and seems to
  move not with the wind, but of its own volition.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Barbs (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature that strikes a bloodbrush with a melee weapon, an unarmed
      strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d4 points of piercing damage and 1
      point of bleed damage, and is exposed to the bloodbrush's poison. Any
      creature that attempts a combat maneuver or Escape Artist check against a
      bloodbrush also takes this barb damage, regardless of success. Melee
      weapons with reach do not endanger an attacker in this way. A grappled
      creature takes barb damage at the start of the bloodbrush's turn.
  - name: Flammable (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a bloodbrush takes fire damage, it catches fire (Pathfinder RPG Core
      Rulebook 444), but does not take damage for catching fire in the round it
      ignites. It takes 1d6 points of fire damage at the start of each turn
      unless it succeeds at a DC 15 Reflex save to extinguish the flame. A
      burning bloodbrush inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage with its barbs and
      slam attacks and to any creature that strikes it with a melee attack as
      its barbs ability.

      dazed; cure 1 save; no effect on creatures immune to mind-affecting
      effects.
Description:
  - >-
    Though they resemble humble tumbleweed, bloodbrushes are animate and
    aggressive. Movement draws its attention, especially when accompanied by
    warmth and moisture.
  - >-
    When it strikes prey, it latches on and delivers a sedating toxin through
    its barbs. Victims that succumb to this poison experience vivid
    hallucinations as the bloodbrush finishes them off. As much a drug as a
    poison, refined bloodbrush toxin commands a high price in the right circles.
    A single bloodbrush provides sufficient poison to refine 1d4 doses of
    bloodbrush extract (see page 23), and counts as the raw materials for the
    process.
  - >-
    Bloodbrush thorns deposit seeds, though the seeds germinate only in dead
    flesh. A single corpse sprouts 2d4 seedlings. After 3 months of growth, the
    now-mature and animate bloodbrush breaks free of its roots and rolls off in
    search of prey. Prior to this, an immature bloodbrush is neither animate nor
    toxic. A bloodbrush lives for up to 6 months after tearing free, and can
    survive 2 weeks between feedings. Despite its size, a mature bloodbrush
    plant weighs 5 pounds at most.
  - Kellids harvest the thorns of immature bloodbrushes.
  - >-
    They grind the dried thorns, and brew the resulting powder as a tea with
    mild euphoric and fever-reducing properties.
  - >-
    Harvesting the thorns and preparing the tea requires a successful DC 15
    Survival check. Drinking this tea grants a +1 circumstance bonus on saves
    against an ongoing disease for 24 hours.
  - >-
    Particularly ingenious tribes, and even some members of the Technic League,
    cultivate bloodbrush in the shallowly buried corpses of their fallen
    enemies. When a farmed bloodbrush is near maturity, the grower places a
    sturdy wicker cage about it to prevent it from escaping.
  - >-
    Such cages can be completely sealed and carried into battle or covertly
    placed in a rival settlement. When released, the captive bloodbrush tends to
    attack the nearest target, so using one as a weapon presents significant
    risks to the one who releases it.
