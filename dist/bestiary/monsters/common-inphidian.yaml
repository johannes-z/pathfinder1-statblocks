  - name: Blinding Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a common inphidian can spew forth a 20-foot line of
      milky-white liquid that causes blindness (as the blindness spell) for 6
      rounds to any creature struck. A DC 14 Reflex save negates the effect. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.

    Common inphidians make up the bulk of the population in inphidian
    communities. They serve as the laborers, craftsmen, workers, citizens,
    guards, and militia. They initiate combat using their blinding spray to gain
    the advantage. Afterwards, the creatures move in and attack with their
    snake-hands or weapons (if they happen to be wielding any). Common Inphidian
    Characters Special Attacks: blinding spray, poison. Copyright Notice Author
