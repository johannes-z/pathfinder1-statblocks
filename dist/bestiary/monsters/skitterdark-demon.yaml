      fit in the same 5-foot space and function normally.

      Any good-aligned creature hit by a skitterdark's claw attack takes normal
      damage plus 1d6 points of profane damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Skitterdarks are tiny demons that relish in the destruction of others,
    especially good-aligned outsiders (in this case outsiders mean those not
    native to the Abyss). Not normally found in large numbers within the
    rank-and-file of demonic armies, some lords do employ these creatures as
    watch patrols around their palaces or along their borders. What these
    creatures lack in size and strength, they make up for in ferocity and
    determination.
  - >-
    Skitterdarks roam their home planes harassing other demons and creatures not
    native to their Abyssal planes. They have a fondness for the flesh of
    mortals, particularly goblins and halflings, often capturing the latter and
    cooking it over a slow-burning fire using an iron spit. Some skitterdarks
    wear the flayed skin of goblins and halflings as trophies, weaving arm
    bands, bracelets, or necklaces from the dried out flesh.
  - >-
    Skitterdarks stand 1 foot tall and weigh about 15 pounds. Its wings are
    crimson, its body red, and its claws blackened and usually filthy.
  - >-
    Skitterdarks are aggressive demons that attack using their tiny sickles or
    claws and bite. They rarely touch the ground during combat, preferring to
    attack from the air. Against good-aligned creatures they always forego
    weapons so they can use their profane claws. When encountered in great
    numbers, skitterdarks form clusters and swarm over their opponents, raking
    with their claws or slashing with their tiny weapons. Some skitterdarks
    carry poisons extracted from various abyssal plants in order to coat their
    weapons.
