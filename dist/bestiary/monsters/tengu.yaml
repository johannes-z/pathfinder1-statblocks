  - name: Swordtrained (Ex)
    description: >-
      Tengus are trained from birth in swordplay, and as a result are
      automatically proficient with sword-like weapons (including bastard
      swords, daggers, elven curve blades, falchions, greatswords, kukris,
      longswords, punching daggers, rapiers, scimitars, short swords, and
      two-bladed swords).
Description:
  - >-
    Tengus are a race of avian humanoids that resemble crows or ravens, and
    often bear much of the same stigma. Though they frequently choose to live
    among other races in densely populated cities, their society is tight and
    closed, and they rarely allow others to see its inner workings. Tengus often
    band together in small groups to create roosts in vacant warehouses or
    condemned buildings, and these raucous gathering places are generally
    assumed to be thieves' guilds by outsiders-an assumption that's correct
    roughly half the time. Like the crows they share physical traits with,
    tengus are naturally covetous, especially of shiny or colorful items, and
    prone to bouts of good-natured kleptomania if they don't carefully keep
    themselves in check. Vain and prideful creatures, they are easily persuaded
    with flattery. Tengu Characters Tengus are defined by their class
    levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All tengus have the following
    racial traits. +2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom: Tengus are fast and
    observant, but relatively fragile and delicate. Senses: Tengus have
    low-light vision. Sneaky: Tengus gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception and
    Stealth. Gifted Linguist: See above. Swordtrained: See above. Natural
    Weapon: Tengus possess a bite natural attack that inflicts 1d3 points of
    damage on a hit. This is a primary attack, or a secondary attack if the
    tengu wields a manufactured weapon. Languages: Tengus begin play speaking
    Common and their own dialect of Tengu. Tengus with high Intelligence scores
    can choose any language as a bonus language.
