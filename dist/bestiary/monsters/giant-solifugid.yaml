Description:
  - >-
    Solifugids are sometimes called "camel spiders," "wind scorpions," or "sun
    spiders," despite the fact that they are neither spiders nor scorpions but
    rather their own unique species. They have large pedipalps near their heads,
    used to grab and hold prey while they feed with their twin sets of
    vertically aligned mandibles. When hunting in groups, they prefer to attack
    targets already grappled by other solifugids. The various species of
    enormous solifugids generally have eight legs, although the front two
    appendages are large enough that they can easily be mistaken for an
    additional pair of legs. Some species, like the albino cave solifugid, have
    fewer legs, but all solifugids are aggressive vermin. The following table
    lists the most common variants beyond the two presented above. Many of these
    species have additional unique abilities, such as the razormouth's ability
    to cause hideous, bleeding wounds in those it attacks. Species CR Size HD
