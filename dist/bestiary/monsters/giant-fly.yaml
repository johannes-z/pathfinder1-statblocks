Description:
  - >-
    Giant flies are larger relatives of normal flies. Like their lesser cousins,
    they are most often found in areas of garbage, litter, and refuse. A giant
    fly resembles a normal fly and can grow to a length of 12 feet, though most
    average about 6 feet long.
  - Giant flies attack by biting their opponents.
