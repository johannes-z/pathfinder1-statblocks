Description:
  - >-
    Upasundas, also called beatific ones, are asuras who devote themselves to
    martial meditations and physical perfection. Upasundas seek monklike poise
    and skill, and through it, the ability to deal flawless destruction wherever
    they go. Their nickname suggests purity, and indeed, each beatific one is an
    expression of asura purity through devotion to the ideal of annihilation. It
    is believed that the first upasundas were created from the jealous followers
    of a man who achieved divinity through his own force of will. Those of his
    followers who felt abandoned when this new deity ascended to the Great
    Beyond sought other ways to achieve immortality, and fell pray to one of the
    asura ranas, who granted them their desire by transforming them into
    beatific ones.
  - >-
    Upasundas never surrender to foes in combat and rarely flee from battle.
    They hope to increase in skill and wisdom or to die in battle. On either
    path lies evolution toward a greater understanding of destruction in its
    countless forms.
  - An upasunda is 7 feet tall and weighs 240 pounds.
