SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Unholy Burst (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a flayer devil can release a burst of hellish black
      vapor in a 30-foot radius. Those caught within the area must succeed at a
      DC 25 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. Additionally,
      good-aligned creatures suffer 3d6 points of unholy damage from the vapors
      if they fail their save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Flensing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A flayer devil that scores a critical hit with a claw attack rips the
      flesh from its opponent's body. This attack deals 1d3 points of
      Constitution damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Flayer devils are employed by several arch-devils as trackers and hunters
    because of their brutal and sadistic mindset. These nightmarish creatures
    delight in catching their prey and ripping the flesh from their bones. The
    flesh is devoured and the bones cast aside. Many of these brutes served
    under Lucifer and were ousted with him when Asmodeus cast him out of Hell.
    They now reside in Infernus where they perfect their craft against those
    that stumble into the fiery realm. Others can still be found roaming the
    Hells. Flayer devils sometimes hunt weaker devils, such as bearded devils,
    hellstokers (see their entry in this book), and lemures, the latter of whose
    flesh they thoroughly enjoy.
  - >-
    The typical flayer devil stands 13 feet tall and weighs in excess of 800
    pounds.
  - Flayer devils are ferocious in battle, employing simple, brutal tactics.
  - >-
    Given the chance, they always make a full attack, striking with both claws
    and a bite attempting to rip an opponent's flesh from its bones. On rounds
    they do not attack with their natural weapons, they release an unholy burst
    to sicken those around them before striking again with claws and bite.
