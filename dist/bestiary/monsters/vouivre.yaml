Description:
  - >-
    A vouivre is a deceptive and monstrous predator that looks like a humanoid
    woman from the waist up and the front end of a green-scaled dragon from the
    waist down. It shuns the company of its own kind, preferring evil fey
    (particularly water-dwelling ones such as nixies) for intelligent
    conversation and mundane snakes for companionship. A vouivre is 12 feet long
    from head to head, weighs 500 pounds, and can live 200 years. Vouivres make
    their homes in small caves near calm waters. They like to decorate their
    lairs with shiny coins, jewelry, and bright silks. One might place some of
    its treasure in the water outside to lure in curious humanoids, and bathe in
    these waters as a further enticement, hiding its reptilian half until prey
    is within striking distance. Because a vouivre can breathe water or air
    (from either head), it often grabs a creature, then retreats underwater to
    wait for the opponent to drown. It prefers humanoid flesh, but will feed on
    any available warm-blooded prey. Vouivres have an affinity for music, and
    their magic is often accompanied by singing or subtle musical vibrations
    from their scales. When a vouivre dies, its dragon head disgorges a
    2-foot-diameter glassy egg. After around 6 weeks, the egg hatches into one
    or two vouivres, which take 7 years to reach maturity. These offspring
    resemble humanoids the mother has eaten, so it prefers to feast on
    attractive and strong victims. The young also adapt to the appearance of
    nearby reptilian creatures.
