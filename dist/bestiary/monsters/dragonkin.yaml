    description: >-
      A dragonkin can form a permanent bond with its rider. Once this bond is
      made, a dragonkin cannot form another rider bond until its current rider
      dies. A dragonkin and its rider can communicate with each other as if they
      both had telepathy 100 ft. In combat, when a rider is mounted on his
      dragonkin, both creatures roll initiative separately and treat the highest
      result as their single result.
Description:
  - >-
    Somewhere between true dragons and brute drakes lie the dragonkin.
    Intelligent, even-tempered, and deadly in combat, dragonkin get along well
    with humanoids. Unlike many other dragons, dragonkin have enough dexterity
    in their front limbs to have adopted weapons, favoring huge glaives and long
    lances.

    The most unique aspect of dragonkin is their bond with other races.
    Dragonkin opposed to the depredations of evil dragons in the Drakelands
    recognize other cultures' potential, and such individuals often adopt
    humanoid riders. After it comes of age, a dragonkin may form an unbreakable
    partnership with a rider, who acts as a trusted comrade. In battle, a rider
    and her dragon are inseparable, in such constant telepathic communication
    that they almost seem to be one entity. When not fighting, the humanoids are
    responsible for caring and providing for their draconic companions, though
    this domestic role is more a social dynamic than outright servitude.

    Built for speed, dragonkin are long and sleek. Many adopt mannerisms from
    humanoid races, even going so far as to wear armor, and this, combined with
    the fact that dragonkin have thrown in their lot with humanoids, sometimes
    disgusts true dragons. A typical dragonkin is 15 to 20 feet long and roughly
    2,000 pounds.
