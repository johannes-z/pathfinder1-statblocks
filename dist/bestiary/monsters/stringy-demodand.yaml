  This lanky humanoid is covered in layers of long, ropy skin growths that sway
  wildly from its body with each move.

  - name: Entangling Folds (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although the disgusting growths on a stringy demodand are technically part
      of its skin, the demodand has a small measure of control over these ropy
      appendages. As a standard action, a stringy demodand can use its growths
      to entangle any adjacent creatures of its size or smaller. To resist being
      entangled, a target must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save. As long as the
      stringy demodand is entangling one or more creatures, any creature that
      moves adjacent to the demodand must successfully save or likewise be
      entangled. Entangled creatures can't move farther than 5 feet from the
      stringy demodand until they break free from its growths. An entangled
      creature can break free as a move action by succeeding at a DC 25 Strength
      or Escape Artist check. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Like all demodands, stringy demodands are devoted to serving their
    thanatotic titan masters in the Abyss. Stringy demodands fulfill this duty
    by serving as kidnappers, slavers, and slave masters throughout the Abyssal
    realms. Stringy demodands are physically well suited to this charge, being
    lankier, scrappier, and more agile than other demodands. Such agility allows
    a stringy demodand to quickly snatch up slaves-to-be and prevent slave
    revolts before they start. Taut muscles, wicked teeth, and sharp claws also
    make a stringy demodand a formidable fighter in the event of a struggle, and
    it should go without saying that a stringy demodand's defining feature-its
    hundreds of long, obscene ropes of skin-are ideal tools for easily binding
    and restricting its quarry.
  - >-
    It's the stringy demodands' long, obsidian-colored skin growths that give
    the abhorrent outsiders their name. These growths resemble nothing so much
    as elongated skin tags the girth of a human finger and roughly 4 feet in
    length. The fibrous outgrowths stretch from stringy demodands' heads to the
    tips of their batlike wings to their shins. These ropy villi bob and sway
    wildly as a stringy demodand moves, creating a truly disturbing image for
    those victims who dare to look back at their Abyssal pursuer.
  - >-
    Because these rubbery growths cover most of the creatures' bodies, they
    provide greater natural protection than the hides of other kinds of
    demodands and allow stringy demodands to eschew armor. Stringy demodands are
    typically 6 feet tall and weigh almost 300 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Although all demodands are disgusting creatures, stringy demodands are among
    the most unnerving in terms of appearance. It's thought that when the
    thanatotic titans were sculpting the first stringy demodand, its waxen image
    drooped and melted from head to toe, forming the foul, stringy growths that
    now define these misbegotten monsters. Like the hairs of a human, these
    growths don't contain nerves yet grow at an incredible rate. When a stringy
    demodand loses these growths through carelessness or from wounds in battle,
    the fleshy strands rapidly regenerate. When at rest, stringy demodands wrap
    their ropy growths around their bodies like grotesque shawls. Some twist
    them around their lean torsos and intertwine the growths to produce
    elaborate headdresses of braided black skin.
  - >-
    Stringy demodands arise from fertilized demodand eggs just like all others
    of their kind. Since a given demodand's clutch produces a random
    distribution of different types of demodands, a stringy demodand's emergence
    cannot be planned. When a stringy demodand does happen to hatch from a
    demodand egg, it quickly savages the other eggs in the clutch to eliminate
    its competition. If it cannot ruin or consume the other eggs in its clutch
    before they hatch, a stringy demodand swiftly bullies its brethren into
    submission and proves itself to be the dominant sibling, establishing from
    birth its natural instinct to coerce and enslave.
  - >-
    A stringy demodand's horrific appearance is often cause enough for potential
    victims to quake in their boots, but its unsightly aspect is far from the
    only feature that makes this being a formidable intimidator. In addition to
    its grotesque appendages and distasteful visage, a stringy demodand has a
    grating, alien voice that is simultaneously guttural and nasal. So terrible
    is its call that when it roars, a stringy demodand sends humans and demons
    alike scurrying for safety. Some say that when the thanatotic titans
    accidentally created the demodands and beheld their monstrous progeny for
    the first time, one of the titans let out a cry of anger and shock that
    shook the whole of the Abyssal realm. It's said that the stringy demodand
    heard his creator's shout and swallowed it hungrily, learning to scream like
    a god in so doing.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Though they prefer to work alone, stringy demodands grudgingly accept the
    company of other demodands when their thanatotic titan masters demand it.
    Stringy demodands' devotion to the titans is as fervent as that of any other
    among their kind, but these beings have the unusual tendency to take their
    masters' orders to the extreme, justifying any and all obscenities and
    collateral damage in the name of their Abyssal overlords. Such devotion can
    sometimes even lead stringy demodands to obliterate their demodand kin
    during missions should they see their brethren's efforts as lacking. Only
    shaggy demodands can deter stringy demodands' bloodlust with any
    consistency, as the latter realize that to attack their commanding brethren
    would be very foolish.
  - >-
    Always striving to please their masters, stringy demodands can be found on
    nearly every Abyssal realm capturing and enslaving future minions and
    playthings for thanatotic titans. When at rest, stringy demodands gather
    alongside other demodands to form enclaves of like-minded fiends so they can
    plot their next moves and calculate the most prime specimens to subjugate.
    In the Abyss, these victims are typically demons, the enslaved prisoners of
    these demons, and wandering mortals who happened into the Abyss at the wrong
    time. Though rarely encountered on the Material Plane, stringy demodands can
    sometimes be found as part of larger hunting parties tasked with capturing
    valuable mortals to bring back to their Abyssal realm.
  - >-
    Stringy demodands' loyalty and rashness make them well suited to serving as
    solitary slave masters, roles the thanatotic titans delight in having them
    serve. The demodands embrace this task with their typical overzealous fervor
    and happily bully, abuse, and torture their charges, often shattering
    slaves' minds as well as their bodies in the process. Although they
    understand that their thanatotic titan masters want as many mortal recruits
    as possible, it's sometimes difficult for the reckless stringy demodands to
    bring slaves to the titans without irreversibly breaking them first. Stringy
    demodands kill or violently maim more slaves than they successfully convert
    into the titans' faithful. This predilection for violence explains why, when
    stringy demodands take part in Abyssal slaving parties, they are usually
    accompanied by enough slimy and tarry demodands to keep their violent urges
    in check.
