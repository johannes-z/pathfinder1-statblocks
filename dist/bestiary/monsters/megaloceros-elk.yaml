    Powerful and swift land mammals, elk range through the plains, hills, and
    forests of many wildernesses, in great herds. Related to deer, elk prove
    important parts of many ecologies, being able to fend off or flee many
    threats while feeding greater predators. Their size, strength, and
    antlers-reaching up to 10 feet wide on some males- allow them to contend
    with most of their environment's dangers, though herds generally favor
    flight to combat. Elk also prove exceptionably adaptable and remarkable
    survivors, capable of living through severe changes in weather and in a
    variety of environments without concern. Many humanoid cultures rely on elk
    herds, using them as valued food sources, work animals, and companions. Most
    breeds of elk stand between 3 and 5 feet tall and weigh between 350 and 550
    pounds, with females being far slighter than males. Heartier stock, such as
    the river elk seen throughout the River Kingdoms, Brevoy, and much of
    northern Avistan and Iobaria, grow to approximately 6 feet tall and weigh
    between 700 and 1,100 pounds. In some secluded wilds, primeval
    megaloceros-massive ancestors of the elk-still flourish, standing up to 9
    feet tall, with bulks of 1,500 pounds and antlers growing over 12 feet wide.
    In all species, only male elk grow antlers. Female elk have the same
    statistics as males, but lack the gore or powerful charge attacks. Ecology
    Elk live relatively long lives for herd animals, with some bulls living for
    over 15 years. Physiologically, they're similar to deer and other grazing
    animals with their patterns of travel and interaction with other creatures.
    Because of their size, though, they can damage an ecosystem, eating great
    amounts of food and sometimes competing with other herbivores for resources.
    Bull elk keep their antlers for about 7 to 8 months of the year, maintaining
    them as a primary form of defense. The antlers of common elk stand 4 feet
    tall and spread about 6 feet wide. Both bulls and cows are quite strong,
    their kicks proving deadly deterrents against many would-be attackers. Most
    breeds of elk stay in herds with upwards of 50 members. Herd members
    actively protect each other, doing what they can to defend those incapable
    of fleeing, yet also recognizing hopeless causes. Very few predators can
    stand up to a group of defensive elk, though wolves, bears, boars, and
    hunting cats often attack the young, sick, or unwary who venture away from
    the herd. While most natural predators steer clear of elk herds, many
    humanoid or monstrous hunters manage to pick off elk by relying on ranged
    weapons or great physical prowess. Habitat & Society During most of the
    year, elk maintain large groups of their own genders. Cows and the young
    tend to stick near dens, so bulls are more likely to be found wandering
    their wide territories. During mating season, a dominant bull maintains a
    harem of as many as 20 cows. Any threat to that establishment is met with
    violent force, with battles between rivals often resulting in fierce
    clashing of antlers and contests of strength-though such rarely prove
    deadly. During mating season, cows don't always produce offspring, though
    when they do, typically only one or two elk are born. After mating season,
    cows care for calves for only a short time. Most are only nursed for a
    couple of months before they join with the rest of the herd. Elk are
    hibernating creatures, being almost unheard of during the winter season.
    During the remainder of the year, they roam and graze widely. When they make
    their tell-tale noise (called bugling,) it booms and echoes for miles, and
    females often consider the loudest males the most suitable as mates. Elk
    migrate throughout the year, typically to avoid the snow. They move from low
    to high ground, where tree bark is an abundant food source. During the
    summer months, they graze on the grasses they can find. During dry seasons,
    elk often make great trips to find abundant food sources, which can
    sometimes force out lesser creatures from a habitat. Elk are also know to
    vary widely from region to region. Common in Brevoy, the River Kingdoms, and
    secluded spots of Numeria, river elks prove larger and heartier than most of
    their brethren. Named for their tendencies to travel along rivers and the
    comfort with which they enter water, these elk exhibit a daring unknown to
    most other breeds, the bulls willingly fighting to defend their herds from
    any perceived threats. Megaloceros Similar in form to the elk but far
    superior in size is the megaloceros. The average male is a towering,
    dangerous creature with antlers that can alone weigh nearly 100 pounds.
    Unlike elk, megaloceros antlers are decidedly enormous and sometimes wider
    than their bodies are long. This leads to common misconceptions and
    exaggerations about the creature's monstrous size. Conveniently for those
    pursued, megaloceros males have difficultly navigating thickly forested
    areas, making them natives of plains and the woods' edge. Elk/Megaloceros
