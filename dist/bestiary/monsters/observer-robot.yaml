  from the front of its body.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    description: >-
      An observer robot's outer shell contains color-shifting screens that allow
      the creature to blend into any background. Though not truly invisible,
      they are hard to pinpoint. While using this ability, an observer robot
      gains a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks and has concealment from
      creatures more than 5 feet away.
  - name: Integrated Laser Torch (Ex)
    description: >-
      An observer robot is outfitted with an integrated laser torch used to
      bypass barriers or restraints. When activated, the torch emits a beam of
      highly focused light, cutting and burning through surfaces up to 6 inches
      away. Attacks from a laser torch resolve as touch attacks and deal 1d10
      points of fire damage. This damage is not modified further by Strength. An
      observer robot's integrated laser torch is mounted on an extending arm
      that allows it greater reach. When the laser torch is used as a tool or as
      a weapon to sunder, its damage bypasses hardness up to 20 points, and
      damage is not halved (as is normally the case for energy damage applied to
      objects) unless the object is particularly fire-resistant. A laser torch's
      cutting beam passes through force fields and force effects without
      damaging the field. Invisible objects and creatures can't be harmed by a
      laser torch.
  - name: Integrated Stun Gun (Ex)
    description: >-
      An observer robot has an integrated stun gun built into its head. This
      weapon uses a sonic amplifier to produce powerful low-frequency blasts of
      energy that can pummel targets. This weapon has a range increment of 20
      feet, and it deals 1d8 points of nonlethal damage. When it scores a
      critical hit, the robot can attempt a free trip combat maneuver (CMB +13)
      against the target, which does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
  - name: Transmit Senses (Ex)
    description: >-
      An observer robot is outfitted with a number of sensors, cameras, and
      microphones that allow it to record events and transmit them to another
      location. An observer robot can record up to 12 hours of audio and video.
      An observer robot's communications can be keyed to a commsetTG or other
      similar device, and it can broadcast everything it can see or hear to this
      device as long as it is within 1 mile. The signal strength can be enhanced
      with a signal boosterTG. An observer robot can also transmit its senses to
      another observer robot. A signal has difficulty penetrating solid
      barriers. A signal is blocked by 1 foot of metal, 5 feet of stone, or 20
      feet of organic matter. Force fields do not block signals. Broadcasting
      functions like a scrying sensor, allowing the viewer to hear and see what
      the observer robot is experiencing. The viewer gains the benefits of any
      nonmagical special abilities the observer robot has tied to its senses
      (such as low-light vision), but the viewer uses her own Perception skill.
      This ability doesn't allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to
      work through it, even if both the observer robot and the viewer possess
      them.
Description:
  - >-
    Designed for reconnaissance, observer robots are deployed to serve as the
    eyes and ears of their controllers. Because they're intelligent and able to
    make their own decisions, observer robots are suited for exploring without
    supervision, recording their observations so that they can relay the images
    and sounds to their creators. The outer hull of an observer robot and its
    wings are covered in a network of tiny screens that can display images of
    the robots' surroundings, which grants the observer robot a form of camouf
    lage that allows it to clandestinely observe its subjects.
  - >-
    The statistics above represent the most common observer robots, but some
    models have enhanced senses that allow them to see in darkness or see
    invisible creatures. Some even have olfactory sensors that effectively smell
    their environment and test the surrounding air for impurities that would
    harm their creators. Observer robots deployed in hostile environments might
    be outfitted with more formidable weaponry than the standard stun gun and
    laser torch.
  - An observer robot is approximately 20 inches long and weighs 8 pounds.
