Description:
  - >-
    Skum are the most prolific and successful of the countless races created by
    the aboleths to serve as slaves. At the height of the aboleth empire, skum
    were legion and their armies waged many wars upon the land, yet now that the
    aboleths are in decline, skum have been set loose to manage on their own.
    For the most part, the skum have been less than successful at this endeavor,
    and today they exist in a shadow of their previous multitude, most of them
    dwelling deep underground in slowly crumbling ruins left standing only
    because their enemies have lost interest in pursuing the now-won war against
    these fish-like humanoids. Skum have even lost their own name-only the most
    erudite and wise of their kind remember that they were once known as the
    ulat-kini. Today, most identify themselves with the racial epithet applied
    to them by surface-dwellers-"skum." Skum do not age, and barring death by
    violence or disease, they can live forever. Unfortunately, this near
    immortality is crippled by the fact that skum are incapable of reproducing
    among themselves, for all skum are male. The aboleths did not want their
    slave race to prosper without their permission. Yet terribly, this does not
    mean that skum cannot breed. Originally created from human stock, skum can
    impregnate humans, and the children issued from such unholy unions are
    invariably deformed. Those who are not born skum undergo gradual
    transformations throughout their lives, and when they would normally die of
    old age, such hybrids instead go through "the change," shedding their
    wrinkled flesh and transforming into one of the ulat-kini. While most skum
    tribes lack the drive to perpetuate their race and would prefer to languish
    in their hideous sunken ruins, tribes settling offshore of remotely
    populated coastlines seem to be on the rise. Some such communities raid
    villages for breeding stock, but a few more insidious tribes form alliances
    with these desperate folk, providing protection and bounty from the sea in
    return for wives.
