Description:
  - >-
    Ponies are smaller breeds of horses better suited to half lings, gnomes, and
    dwarves, but they also make fond pets for humans as well. They stand 3 to 4
    feet tall and weigh about 600 pounds. A light load for a pony is up to 100
    pounds, a medium load is 101-200 pounds, and a heavy load is 201-300 pounds.
    A pony can drag 1,500 pounds. The statistics presented above are for a
    typical pony. Tougher ponies with the advanced simple template exist, but
    are relatively uncommon and, unlike horses, these creatures are not
    generally called "heavy ponies." Like horses, ponies can be trained for
    combat with the Handle Animal skill, and such mounts often serve half lings,
    gnomes, and other small races as steeds in combat.
