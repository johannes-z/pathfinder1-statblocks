SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Absorb Blood (Su)
    description: >-
      If a creature dies while under the effects of Shax's ability to command
      blood, all of the victim's blood slithers out of its body and moves at a
      speed of 60 feet toward Shax. If the slithering blood reaches Shax, it
      flows up onto his body and is absorbed, affecting Shax as a heal spell (CL
      28th). A slithering pool of blood can be destroyed by any amount of fire
      damage applied to it before it reaches its goal, or by the application of
      an effect that transmutes liquid to something other than blood.
  - name: Aura of Bleeding Wounds (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a creature takes piercing or slashing damage within 30 feet of
      Shax, it takes an additional 1d6 points of bleed damage. This bleed damage
      stacks with itself, up to a maximum of 10d6 points. As a free action, Shax
      may designate any number of creatures within the aura to be exempt from
      this effect.
  - name: Command Blood (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, Shax can command the blood of any creature that is
      currently suffering from bleed damage to do his bidding. The target must
      be within 60 feet of Shax for him to use this ability. The target can
      resist this ability with a successful DC 36 Fortitude save. If the target
      fails the save, Shax can command the victim's blood to behave in one of
      the manners listed below. Once commanded, the blood continues to function
      in this way for as long as the victim continues to bleed. Shax can change
      the effect in a subsequent round by using this ability again, but no more
      than one of the following effects can be in effect at any one time. The
      save DC is Charisma-based. Blinding Blood: The victim's blood runs up into
      its eyes and blinds it at the start of its turn unless the victim takes a
      move action to wipe away the blood. Once a victim is blinded in this way,
      it remains blinded as long as the bleed effect continues. Bloody Mess: The
      victim's blood spreads out across its body, making it slippery. This
      grants a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and all attempts
      to resist being grappled, but the victim must succeed at a DC 36 Reflex
      save at the start of each round or drop objects it holds. These effects
      last as long as the bleed effect continues. Choking Blood: The target's
      blood runs up into its nostrils and mouth unless the creature uses a free
      hand to pinch its nose shut and holds its breath. If the target doesn't do
      so, the blood runs into its lungs and the creature must succeed at a
      Constitution check each round or it begins to drown. Once a victim begins
      to drown, it continues to do so as long as the bleed effect persists.
      Gruesome Tendrils: This effect automatically ends any bleed effects the
      victim is currently suffering as it causes the blood coating the victim to
      solidify into thin, whiplike tendrils that lash out at any creature within
      5 feet. Any creature that begins its turn in this area automatically takes
      1d6 points of slashing damage and 1d6 points of bleed damage; a successful
      DC 36 Reflex save prevents this damage.
  - name: Frightful Weapon Prowess (Ex)
    description: >-
      When an opponent observes Shax's attacks, the frightening display of the
      demon lord's grace makes the victim take additional damage from those
      attacks, as if simply imagining the damage were enough to cause injury.
      Shax gains a profane bonus equal to his Charisma modifier on damage rolls
      (+10 damage) with all weapon attacks and ranged attacks made against a
      victim who can observe him. This damage is negated if the victim closes
      its eyes, but doing so puts the opponent in greater danger from Shax's
      sneak attacks. This is a visual fear effect.
  - name: Master of Lies (Ex)
    description: >-
      Shax is immune to any magical effect that discerns lies or forces him to
      speak the truth.
  - name: Painful Cuts (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever Shax threatens a critical hit with a slashing weapon, the victim
      must succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save or be staggered by the pain for 1
      round. If the hit was a critical hit, the staggered effect lasts for 1d4
      rounds on a failed saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Shax is the demon lord of envy, lies, and-above all else-murder. He rules an
    Abyssal realm known as Charnelhome, an immense mansion the size of a city
    perched atop a slanted bluff surrounded by a bog of thorny, blood-drinking
    plants. He is fond of inviting his captured enemies as well as his greatest
    worshipers into the chambers of this building, for those who survive his
    deathtraps often serve as lessons as to how he can improve his methods of
    mayhem.
  - >-
    Shax is particularly skilled at blinding foes with critical hits-when he
    does so, he likes to pluck the eyes from his victim's face as part of the
    attack and swiftly gobble them down whole. He can hurl the countless
    surgical tools he carries on his body as deadly weapons, but prefers to
    slaughter foes in melee.
  - Shax'sCult
  - >-
    Babaus, chokers, derros, drow, evil nobles, serial killers, and torturers
    worship Shax by inf licting grisly torments on other conscious and living
    souls. The subjects of these tortures aren't always unwilling or innocent
    victims, although his cultists prefer tormenting enemies of the faith over
    allies or members. The cult's holy places are narrow alleyways in violent
    parts of large cities, hidden rooms in grand estates, and secret dungeons
    filled with deathtraps and torture chambers. These unholy temples are often
    guarded by fiendish animals (particularly large, predatory birds) and shadow
    demons, but are usually watched over by a number of babau demons as well.
    Enhanced versions of these demons, called the Sons of Shax, and can be found
    serving his greatest cults (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Demons Revisited
    7).
  - >-
    Shax's unholy symbol is a curved white feather sitting in a pool of blood.
    His favored weapon is the dagger. He grants access to the domains of Chaos,
    Destruction, Evil, and Nobility, and to the subdomains of Demon, Leadership,
    Martyr, and Rage. For more rules about demon lords, including the full rules
    of Shax's Abyssal resurrection and summon demons abilities, see Pathfinder
    Adventure Path #73 page 81 or Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4.
