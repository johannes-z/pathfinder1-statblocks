  This small whale lacks a dorsal fin and has pale, mottled skin, but its most
  notable feature is the single tusk protruding from its nose, easily as long as
  a human.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hold Breath (Ex)
    description: >-
      Narwhals are expert deep divers, and a narwhal can hold its breath a
      number of minutes equal to 2 times its Constitution score before it risks
      drowning.
  - name: Tusk (Ex)
    description: >-
      A charging narwhal can make a single gore attack with its tusk in place of
      its normal bite attack. If it hits, the tusk deals 2d6+14 points of damage
      with a x3 critical multiplier.
Description:
  - >-
    The narwhal is a skilled hunter in arctic waters, and has been known to dive
    deeper than even much larger cetaceans both in open water and beneath thick
    sheets of waterborne ice. Male narwhals possess a single, 6-foot-long tusk
    extending from just above the mouth that serves to impress females during
    mating season, though in times of need the tusks may be used to break
    through thick ice or even in self-defense. A typical narwhal is 14 feet long
    (not including the tusk) and weighs 3,200 pounds.
