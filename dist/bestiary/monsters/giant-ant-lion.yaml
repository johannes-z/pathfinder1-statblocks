    description: >-
      A giant ant lion can create a 60-foot-diameter, 20-foot-deep pit in any
      sand or soft earth surface. Creating a sand trap takes 1 hour. A DC 15
      Perception check allows a creature to realize such a depression in the
      sand is in fact a trap. Any creature that steps into the trap slides to
      the center if it fails a DC 14 Reflex save-such victims take no damage,
      but they do fall prone. A giant ant lion can make an attack of opportunity
      against any creature that falls to the bottom of its sand trap. These
      creatures can move across sand traps at their normal speed and are immune
      to the trap's effects. Other creatures can navigate the trap's walls with
      a DC 20 Climb check.
Description:
  - >-
    Perils of the desert depths, giant ant lions construct traps from the
    shifting sands. These beasts lurk at the base of these pits, half buried and
    patiently awaiting unwary prey.
