SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Piercing Howl (Su)
    description: >-
      When an ubashki lynx howls, all creatures except other undead within a
      300-foot spread must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become frightened for
      1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. Whether or not the
      save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same ubashki
      lynx's piercing howl for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Ubashki Rot (Su)
    description: >-
      Curse and disease-bite; save Fort DC 16; onset 1 hour; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d6 Str and 1d6 Wis; cure -. Ubashki rot is both a curse and a
      disease and can only be cured if the curse is first removed, at which
      point the disease can be magically removed. Even after the curse element
      of ubashki rot is lifted, a creature suffering from it cannot recover
      naturally over time. Anyone casting a conjuration (healing) spell on the
      afflicted creature must succeed at a DC 20 caster level check, or the
      spell is wasted and the healing has no effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Perhaps no beasts were trusted into the afterlife so much as felines,
    however, who were almost without exception buried alongside deceased
    pharaohs or at the very least inscribed into their burial chamber walls.
    Those cats that rose from the dead- either because of the foul magical
    energies of a pharaoh's crypt or thanks to the necromantic magic of a
    restless undead pharaoh herself-were known as ubashki.
  - >-
    Ubashki were prized for being stealthy, agile, and preternaturally
    perceptive sentries that made for effective spies and watch guards for the
    tombs of Osirian god-kings. Emperors often filled their crypts with the
    bodies of strangled and mutilated cats before they themselves were entombed,
    believing that a feline's suffering in life would translate to strength in
    undeath.
  - >-
    Whether or not such theories were true is up for debate, but those felid
    creatures that did rise from death with their masters were indeed beasts to
    be reckoned with, and a sizeable pack of the mummified things could very
    well spell the end for would-be tomb raiders. Ranging from tiny housecats to
    desert-roaming mountain lions, the feline enshrined with a deceased pharaoh
    varied in type depending on the predilections of its master, but all were
    known to be signif icantly more powerful than their living iterations.
