    description: >-
      The golem lets out a piercing howl that lasts for 6 rounds when anyone
      other than its creator enters the area it is guarding (or comes within 50
      feet of the golem). This functions similar to the audible version of the
      alarm spell and can be heard to a range of 100 feet.
Description:
  - >-
    Arcane spellcasters used several ancient texts to arrive at a process to
    create inexpensive yet still quite powerful golems. They had master
    craftsmen create wood statues with articulating limbs and then performed the
    proper spells to animate and control them. The statues vary in shape and
    form and usually have weapons of some sort held in each hand. The wood
    golems were designed to act both as an alarm and a protection against
    intruders. Wood golems are usually programmed to close doors and avoid
    ranged weapons and spells but do not break off melee combat to avoid missile
    fire from other sources. They attack with their fists. Construction The
    pieces of a wood golem are assembled from blocks of fine wood and sprinkled
    with rare powders and crushed herbs worth at least 300 gp. WOOD GOLEM CL
