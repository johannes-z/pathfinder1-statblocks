SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Wisdom Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A phasma feeds on the mental strength of its enemies. Its incorporeal
      touch deals 1d6 points of Wisdom drain each time one of its attacks hits.
      On each successful attack, a phasma gains 5 temporary hit points.
Description:
  - >-
    A phasma is an undead creature spawned when a humanoid or monstrous humanoid
    fails its Fortitude saving throw against a phantasmal killer spell and dies
    as a result. Phasmas are extremely evil and highly aggressive with a hatred
    for living creatures (especially arcane spellcasters) that knows no bounds.
    A phasma is usually found haunting an area within 500 feet of where it was
    slain when it was alive. It is not bound to this area and may travel or move
    wherever it pleases, though for some reason, a phasma rarely leaves the area
    where it died. A phasma feeds on the mental strength of living creatures. By
    sapping a foe's mental strength it weakens its mind, thereby opening it up
    to the true power of the phasma, the ability to kill an opponent the same
    way it died-by a phantasmal killer effect. Creatures slain are left where
    they fall: the phasma has no use for the opponent anymore. A phasma appears
    as a 6-foot tall incorporeal humanoid dressed in gray robes. A translucent
    and pale white light surrounds its entire body. A phasma speaks the same
    languages it did in life and Common (though it rarely engages in
    communication with living creatures, other than perhaps to hurl insults and
    curses at its opponents). A phasma engages any living foe it encounters. It
    begins melee using its incorporeal touch in order to feed on an opponent's
    mental strength, often focusing its incorporeal touch on a different
    opponent each round. Once it feels it has weakened the will of its foes
    enough, it uses its phantasmagoria ability to try and kill its foes
    immediately. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
