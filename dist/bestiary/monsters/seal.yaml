Description:
  - >-
    Sleek-bodied aquatic mammals, seals spend the majority of their lives in the
    water, whether in the harbors of tropical ports or amid wandering icebergs.
    They prefer rocky beaches, upon which they rest, raise their young, and dive
    to hunt fish, squid, sea birds, and other small aquatic creatures. They are
    well known for their vocal communications consisting of barks, grunts, and
    flipper slaps, traits that cause many humanoids to remark on their
    intelligence and the ease with which they can be trained.
