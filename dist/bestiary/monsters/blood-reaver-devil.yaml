Description_Visual: >-
  This tall reddish-bronze colored humanoid has leathery flesh and gleaming,
  gold eyes. Its hands end in blood-stained claws, and a long snake-like and
  forked tail trails behind it. The smell of fresh blood hangs in the air. It
  wields a wicked dual-headed flail.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Siphoning Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Blood reavers can radiate an aura in a 20-foot radius as a free action
      that causes a creature to bleed from its mouth, nose, eyes, and ears.
      Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save each round or
      take 1 point of Constitution damage from blood loss. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Stun (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a blood reaver hits with a dire flail attack, the opponent must
      succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC
      is Strength-based. This ability is a function of the blood reaver, not the
      dire flail.
Description:
  - >-
    Blood reavers, also known as garugins, are dangerous and vile creatures that
    stalk the Hells searching for mortal plane jumpers. They believe no living
    mortal has the right to step into Hell; the only mortals that should be in
    Hell are the ones whose souls are corrupted in the afterlife or evil mortals
    that deserve to be there through actions and sins committed while still
    alive. All other mortals are trespassers and should be dealt with
    accordingly.
  - >-
    Blood reavers have a neutral relationship with most other devils; they can
    take them or leave them. They do seem to have a good rapport with bone
    devils, perhaps because the wicked bone devil is just as evil and corrupt as
    they are or perhaps because the bone devil shows no mercy when dispatching
    an enemy.
  - >-
    A blood reaver stands 8 feet tall and is never without its special barbed
    dire flail. The heads are wickedly crafted with oversized and strongly
    curved barbs so they do as much tissue damage as possible when they hit.
  - >-
    Blood reavers despise mortals and attack them on sight. They prefer to hide
    or stand nearby while invisible and let their siphoning aura drain a person
    of its blood, though the telltale sign that something is wrong is when the
    victim's eyes, ears, nose, and mouth begin to bleed for no apparent reason.
  - >-
    In combat, they attack with their barbed flails, relentlessly hammering away
    at their enemies and freely unloading with walls of fire to separate allies
    from one another. Being immune to fire, the blood reaver simply walks
    through the wall and attacks the creature standing on the other side.
