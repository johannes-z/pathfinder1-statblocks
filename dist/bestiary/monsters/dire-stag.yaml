Description:
  - >-
    Dire stags are impressive creatures found in all but the warmest regions.
    Most inhabit forests and plains, though some often roam more rugged
    territory. Dire stags are aggressive giant versions of male deer.
  - >-
    Dire stag are nocturnal creatures and exist on a diet of leaves, vines, ivy,
    and meat, the latter consisting of rodents and small animals (rabbits,
    moles, pigs, and wolves). A typical male's territory covers a range of 5
    square miles. Dire stags mark territorial boundaries by digging holes with
    their antlers. Such holes can measure up to 6 feet wide and 3 feet deep.
    They often thrash the ground throughout their territory, stirring up the
    leaves and underbrush, to further define their territory.
  - >-
    Dire stags are solitary creatures, but sometimes band together, usually
    during mating or rutting season. During rutting season, a dire stag gathers
    up to 12 female deer in its territory. Mating season is usually late fall
    and gestation typically lasts 8 months. Newborn are nursed by the females
    and are dependent on their mother for the first few months of their lives.
    Young are slowly weaned over a period of 6 months and reach maturity by 18
    months.

    A dire stag stands 6 feet at the shoulder and about 12 feet long with its
    weight exceeding 1,000 pounds. Its antlers average up to 8 feet wide, though
    some of the largest dire stag have antlers reaching up to 12 feet wide. Its
    coat varies in color from brown to brownish-white to black, with its
    underbelly being lighter, and usually white. Its antlers are brown or black.
    Dire stags are hunted for their meat as well as their tough hides. A
    reasonably intact dire stag hide is worth 500 gp or more.
  - >-
    Dire stags are aggressive animals and rarely back down from a challenge.
    They unleash a guttural, blood-curdling bleat before attacking. This serves
    to warn the females and young as well as potential aggressors. Dire stags
    almost never retreat, preferring to fight to the death against a foe.
  - >-
    A dire stag attacks with its antlers, goring its opponent, or it rears onto
    its hind legs and slashes with its hooves. Most dire stags fight to the
    death to protect their young.
