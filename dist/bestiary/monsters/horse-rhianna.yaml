      Unless specifically trained for combat (see the Handle Animal skill), a
      Rhianna's hooves are treated as secondary attacks.
  - name: Encumbrance Penalty (Ex)
    description: >-
      Rhiannas lose the benefits of the Run feat whenever they are encumbered.
      They may still run at 4 times their speed with light encumbrance (up to
      228 lbs.), and 3 times their speed with medium (459 lbs.) or heavy (690
      lbs.) encumbrance.
  - name: Hardy (Ex)
    description: >-
      Rhiannas are extremely durable creatures. Unlike with other mounts,
      anytime a hustle, forced march or spurred movement would do damage to
      these horses, they are allowed a Constitution save to negate the damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Domesticated Rhiannas retain the notable traits of their wild ancestors:
    small size, endurance and sure-footedness. They are especially popular with
    woodsmen - those who opt for mounted travels - due to their hardiness,
    dexterity an companionship. Most homesteaders choose the Rhianna breed as
    well, as they are equally suited to long-distance rides over varied terrain
    and drawing a market cart over rutted roads. Only the heaviest farm labors,
    such as breaking sod, spring plowing and pulling stumps, are reserved for
    larger draft horses, and many of the farmers of the valley make do with
    Rhiannas alone.
  - >-
    Rhianna horses differ from other light warhorses in several ways. Although
    they are similar in build to warhorses, they cannot fight with a rider.
    While their speed is the same, they do not perform as well when heavily
    loaded. Due to their evolution in a valley littered with obstacles such as
    trees, streams, boulders and scrub growth, they are extremely agile and
    adept at negotiating obstacles. They are resistant to damage incurred by
    fatigue, and may be pushed harder and for longer periods of time without the
    risk of injury. Because of their intolerance for encumbrance, Rhiannas make
    ideal mounts for lightly armed and armored heroes. Even encumbered, their
    ability to increase their speed for short distances gives them an advantage
    over common riding horses. This is especially useful when difficult terrain
    disallows running and charging.
