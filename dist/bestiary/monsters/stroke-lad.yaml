Description:
  - >-
    Stroke lads are a wicked race of fey who make their homes in abandoned manor
    houses and castles, where they have cursed the masters and chased them from
    their lands. Stroke lads are vicious in their disdain for mortals showing a
    special dislike for humans who are often held as serfs to work their newly
    acquired fiefdom. Stroke lads exact their punishments on servants and
    enemies who displease them with a touch of their long fingers, withering
    arms and legs to make one lame, and permanently disfiguring faces of those
    deemed more handsome than themselves. The slap of a stroke lad is like the
    kick of a mule. Cowards at heart, they surrender if threatened with death
    and attempt to negotiate their way out of danger to themselves. Of course
    they never keep to a bargain and should not be trusted. Copyright Notice
