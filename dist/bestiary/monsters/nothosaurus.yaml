    A nothosaurus is about 13 feet long and grayish-blue in color. When
    swimming, its uses its webbed feet, fin-like tail, and powerful legs to
    propel it through the water. It sustains itself on a diet of fish, seals,
    walruses, and other marine animals. The nothosaurus breathes air and moves
    slowly on land, rarely venturing far away from the shoreline. When not
    hunting, a nothosaurus often suns itself on large rocks.

    surge to close rapidly and grab the prey with its powerful jaws.
