    description: >-
      Each Set guardian is immune to a specific energy type, and can absorb
      damage of this type and then discharge it in an intense burst. When a Set
      guardian would be damaged by the specified energy type, it is instead
      unharmed. As a free action on the following round, it discharges this
      energy in a 20-foot radius dealing half again as much damage (150%) as it
      would have taken from the effect. This discharge occurs even if the Set
      guardian was destroyed on the previous round. A successful DC 21 Reflex
      save halves this damage. The gemstones in the eye sockets of the Set
      guardian's headpiece determine the energy type. Emerald: Set guardians
      with emerald gemstones are immune to and absorb electricity damage. Ruby:
      Set guardians with ruby gemstones are immune to and absorb fire damage.
      Sapphire: Set guardians with sapphire gemstones are immune to and absorb
      cold damage. Topaz: Set guardians with topaz gemstones are immune to and
      absorb acid damage. Another Set guardian that has the same energy type
      keyed to this ability is unharmed by the damage from this burst, but also
      doesn't absorb the energy. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Mighty Blows (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Set guardian's slam attacks score a critical threat on a natural 18-20,
      and deal double damage on a critical hit. If both slam attacks
      successfully hit in a single round, the target is staggered for 1d4+1
      rounds unless the target makes a successful DC 21 Fortitude save. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Trumpet of Doom (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 3 rounds as a free action, a Set guardian can emit a sonic
      blast from its headpiece that deals 2d8+2 points of damage and stuns all
      creatures within 20 feet of the construct for a single round. A successful
      DC 21 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stunned condition.
      Other Set guardians are immune to this effect. This is a sonic effect, and
      the save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Unholy Weaknesses (Ex)
    description: >-
      Due to the necromantic techniques used in its creation, certain spells and
      effects affect a Set guardian differently than they otherwise would. A Set
      guardian is treated as undead for the purposes of spells or effects that
      deal more damage to undead, like searing light, sunbeam, or sunburst. A
      Set guardian in the area of effect of positive energy channeled to damage
      undead is slowed 1 round for every 3d6 points of damage channeled (minimum
      1 round). A raise dead spell cast on a Set guardian paralyzes it for 1d4
      rounds.

  - >-
    In the days of Ancient Osirion, when temples to the old gods still stood
    throughout the nation, worshipers of Set protected their places of worship
    with imposing constructs. To allow the priests of these old gods to devote
    their time and energy to ecclesiastical duties, Set's clerics designed these
    foul sentinels to be self-sufficient by using a combination of necromantic
    techniques and golem crafting.
  - >-
    The clerics and crafters preparing the constructs would begin with the body
    of an evil desert giant-preferably one who, like them, revered Set. The
    crafters would then fashion headpieces out of brass, bronze, or iron that
    were sculpted in the likeness of the god of darkness, deserts, murder, and
    storms. The headpiece would then be lacquered a glossy black, and set with
    expensive gemstones indicative of the type of elemental spirit used to
    animate the construct. After the headpiece was crafted, the preserved desert
    giant would be decapitated and the headpiece affixed to its shoulders.
  - >-
    The towering constructs stood within the sanctuaries of Set's great temples
    across the empire, and were often posted at the temple's exterior doors when
    the faithful were called to worship. The laity always assumed that the
    constructs were undead servants crowned with metal helms of their god, and
    the clergy did nothing to disabuse them of this conceit. Indeed, adventurers
    often make the same mistake. Opponents can use Knowledge (religion) to
    identify a Set guardian's true nature and learn about the construct's unholy
    weaknesses.
  - >-
    During the dark decades of Hakotep's reign, the guardians were a common-and
    for many, terrifying-sight, for the pharaoh used them as tools to threaten
    and cow the priesthoods of cults opposed to his religious reforms favoring
    Set. Today, these constructs have fallen out of favor in ecclesiastical
    circles-few of the modern cults employ them, though a couple of the
    surviving temples formerly dedicated to Set still boast one of these giant
    wardens. Most encounters with Set guardians today are reported by
    archaeological parties exploring lost temples or the tombs of long-buried
    nobles who had some devotion to the god in life. Once frightening attendants
    in temples across the land, they now wait in darkness for those unwisely
    disturbing ancient burial sites.

    Set guardians stand a towering 18 feet tall and weigh approximately 12,000
    pounds.

    The process begins with the recently deceased body of an evil desert giant.
    The body must undergo a painstaking embalming process. This preparation
    keeps the body from rotting and hardens its flesh, making it as tough as
    stone. During this time, a headpiece made from 1,500 pounds of bronze,
    brass, or iron must be cast using special, cursed elixirs in the process.
    The head of the preserved giant must be severed cleanly at the shoulders and
    the headpiece then bolted on. At this point, two gems (each worth at least
    2,000 gp) of the appropriate type are fitted into the headpiece's eye
    sockets before the construct is animated with an elemental spirit.

  - ELEVATED SET GUARDIANS
  - >-
    Clerics of Set wishing to create more powerful constructs to guard their
    temples experimented with many different methods and finally came upon a
    process that resulted in the creation of an elevated Set guardian. These
    constructs went through a preservation process that utilized more expensive
    materials than those of the standard guardian, and were animated with two
    separate elemental spirits. Such constructs can be identified by two
    different gems (matching the two spirits that animate them) fitted into
    their headpieces. An elevated Set guardian can also be animated with two
    elemental spirits of the same type, though the construct is easily mistaken
    for a standard Set guardian because its gemstone eyes are the same color.
  - >-
    Elevated Set guardians are at least CR 15, have the advanced creature simple
    template, and their elemental conduit ability is keyed to two different
    energy types. Elevated Set guardians imbued with two elemental spirits of
    the same type discharge double the amount of energy damage they would have
    taken instead of half again as much.
  - Construction
  - >-
    The process of creating an elevated Set guardian is nearly identical to
    creating a regular Set guardian except for the cost of the required
    materials. The gemstones fitted into the construct's eye sockets each must
    be worth at least 5,000 gp.
