Description_Visual: >-
  A dog-sized crab with a square-shaped reddish-brown carapace covered with dark
  red and yellow markings scuttles forth, pincers raised. Tiny flames lick its
  body, erupting at irregular intervals from its underbelly. Its eyes are
  perched on the end of two large eyestalks that protrude from the center of the
  carapace.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Heat (Ex)
    description: >-
      The body of a lesser fire crab generates intense heat, dealing 1d4 points
      of fire damage with its touch. Creatures attacking a fire crab unarmed or
      with natural weapons take fire damage each time their attacks hit. Any
      melee hit by a fire crab deals fire damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Fire crabs are invertebrates found roaming the fiery shores of the Elemental
    Plane of Fire and the Plane of Molten Skies (see the City of Brass by
    Necromancer Games).
  - >-
    Fire crabs can be found crawling the shores or swimming in pools and lakes
    of liquid flame. They are generally non-aggressive creatures and spend their
    time eating the heated rocks and plants found in the abovementioned planes.
    Food not eaten is carried and stored in their lair, which takes the form of
    a large burrow under the fiery waters or on the shores near their "water
    source." Such burrows are sometimes very large and can contain up to 20 of
    these creatures. On the Material Plane, fire crabs lair in volcanoes and
    near hot springs.
  - >-
    Fire crabs have large claws and in males, one claw is always larger (at
    least three times larger) than the other. Fire crabs have six segmented and
    spindly legs, blackish-red in color.
  - Fire crabs are highly territorial and defend their lair with great ferocity.
  - >-
    Normally non-aggressive creatures, if their lair is threatened, they fight
    to the death. Against weaker prey, fire crabs usually just slash with their
    claws. Stronger foes are grabbed and squeezed by the fire crab. Once they
    grab an opponent, they hold on, allowing their fires to engulf the foe.
