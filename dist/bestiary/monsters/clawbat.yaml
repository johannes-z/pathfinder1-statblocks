Description_Visual: >-
  A leathery piece of skin stretched across a frame of joints and bony knobs
  beats awkwardly through the air. Eyes glare from the folds of its thick wings,
  writhing tentacles surround its sucker-like maw, and a long, thin tongue darts
  forth seemingly at random to lash the air around it.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Scent (Ex)
    description: >-
      A clawbat can detect any creature at less than maximum hit points as if it
      had scent. Those at full hit points cannot be detected by the blood scent
      ability.
  - name: Distraction (Ex)
    description: >-
      A clawbat's lengthy tongue whips around its body as it feeds, lapping up
      the blood from wounded creatures nearby. Every round a clawbat may choose
      either a creature it attacks or any creature it passes adjacent to as it
      moves. If the target is at less than full hit points, it must make a DC 11
      Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Clawbats, or einchadu, as they're known to the tribes of greater Iobaria,
    haunt the desolate expanses of northeastern Avistan and the rugged lands
    beyond. Swarming forth from their shadowy dens to hunt by night, these
    strange predators thirst for blood, scavenging from the victims of greater
    nocturnal hunters and stalking those foolish enough not to fear dangers in
    the dark. Drawn by the scent of spilled blood, clawbats fearlessly follow
    deadly beasts, and more than one traveler has narrowly escaped a predator's
    nearly lethal ambush only to find his luck change as a swarm of wings and
    eyes descend upon him. The span of an average clawbat's dual pairs of wings
    stretches 3 feet wide, lifting aloft rubbery bodies weighing 2 to 4 pounds.
    Tales of more monstrous clawbats, with wings that blot out the stars as they
    swoop away with children and small animals, also pass through the civilized
    lands of Iobaria. Such overgrown clawbats might be constructed by making use
    of the giant creature simple template. Ecology Clawbats are scavengers and
    opportunistic hunters. They rarely attack creatures larger than rodents or
    birds unless the creatures-or those traveling with them-have been weakened
    by a stronger attacker. Even the presence of such a hunter is not enough to
    deter an ever-hungry clawbat, which is drawn to attack bloodied creatures in
    the thick of battle. Clawbats are poor fighters; they prefer to fly past
    victims, strike quickly to draw blood, and then make pass after pass,
    aggravating their victims' existing wounds with their ribbon-like tongues.
    This tactic rarely wins the scavengers more than a drop or two of
    nourishment per attack, driving them to harass a victim until it drops. When
    the wounds of clawbats' prey prove too insignificant to fell it, clawbats
    attack more directly, circling to peel away strip after strip of flesh in
    wet grabs of their tentacular maws. After their prey has fallen to the pain
    of a dozen such wounds, clawbats land and vigorously lap up their meal until
    their bellies are bloated with gore. Aiding clawbats in their hunts is their
    acrid saliva, a stinging milky-white fluid that possesses an anticoagulant
    quality, causing their bites to leave messy wounds that bleed until treated.
    This effect allows clawbats to surprise attack most Small creatures and wait
    safely out of reach until the prey collapses. Healthy larger prey can
    typically withstand the assault of a lone clawbat, but a whole clutch of the
    creatures might easily throw even a sturdy beast into panicked, bleeding
    terror. The freedom with which clawbat wounds bleed also serves to attract
    other clawbats in the vicinity, and a few scratches might potentially bring
    an entire clutch down upon even a slightly wounded creature. Clawbat eyes
    are exceedingly abnormal, being nearly flat, yet still functional. As the
    creatures' eyes are set upon their wings, the constant flapping gives the
    clawbats a constantly shifting view of the area around them, but
    particularly the land below-an experience which would seem terribly jarring
    to any creature not used to the experience. The eyes are one-sided,
    occupying only the inner part of their thick, fleshy wings, and are lidless,
    being constantly watered by ducts surrounding each eye. The profuse watering
    of these organs causes clawbats to fling a fine spray as they move, which
    often serves as a victim's first warning of impending danger. Other flying
    creatures, such as hawks, eagles, and owls, make up the clawbats' natural
    predators. The sounds of these raptors can dissuade clawbats from attacking,
    even in the midst of a feeding frenzy, and will send them winging straight
    for their roost to avoid attack. Giant centipedes occasionally invade
    clawbat lairs, crawling up the wall or waiting for their prey at the exit.
    Clawbats have little natural defense against creatures with thick
    exoskeletons and avoid them when it is possible to attack an easier source
    of food. Clawbats can live up to 20 years, though most die earlier due to
    predation, accidents, or infighting. Habitat & Society Clawbats are found
    far from heavily civilized lands, though whether this is due to civilized
    efforts to stamp them out or because they prefer distant, half-wild places
    is open to debate. They live in clutches of up to 15 members, favoring dark
    places that offer easy aerial access to the outside world. Each of these
    places must have a roost that allows the creatures to drop the 15 feet
    necessary to begin flying; if a stationary clawbat attempts to start flying
    without sufficient drop, it glides to the ground and must mount to a higher
    point before it can launch again. This makes them skittish in claustrophobic
    spaces, for they do not like to be at a disadvantage, and this in turn leads
    them to infest places such as ruined structures, large, open caves, and
    fissures. New clutches of clawbats contain 4 to 6 young members, which
    depart a clutch once it has grown to exceed 15 members. The young fly 10 to
    15 miles away, searching for a suitable structure or crag to shield them
    during the day. Once a group of clawbats leaves its original home, the
    members feel no loyalty to their former family and compete fiercely for
    resources. On numerous occasions, mages, druids, and barbarians shamans have
    attempted to capture and train clawbats. While the creatures' awkwardness
    once they are brought to ground makes them relatively easy to capture-though
    frustratingly difficult to restrain given their flexibility and many
    squirming limbs- no documented attempt to train the beasts has ever
    succeeded. Even efforts paired with steady diets of blood typically end in
    the clawbat attacking its keeper just as often as availing themselves of the
    easier food source. This, and their regular attempts to feed even when
    critically wounded, have won the creatures a reputation for being dumbly
    vicious, a reputation that leads most thinking creatures to curse and move
    quickly to exterminate any clawbats that appear in their lands.
