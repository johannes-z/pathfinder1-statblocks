Source: Inner Sea Gods
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Chainstorm (Ex)
    description: >-
      Chains and flesh tendrils constantly lash at anything that approaches the
      herald. A creature that enters the area or begins its turn within it takes
      1d12 points of bludgeoning and slashing damage. The chains entangle any
      creature so long as it's in the area (Reflex DC 25 negates). The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Exaction (Ex)
    description: >-
      The herald is healed of 10 points of damage in any round it deals damage,
      as if it had fast healing 10.
  - name: Howl of Despair (Su)
    description: >-
      The Prince in Chains can loose a howl of immortal agony once every 1d4
      rounds. All nonevil creatures within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 22 Will
      saving throw or take 6d6 points of sonic damage. Any within 10 feet who
      fail their saves are also affected as per the insanity spell. This is a
      sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Unnerving Gaze (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature that fails its save against the herald's unnerving gaze is
      staggered for 1 round.
  - name: Vicious Critical (Ex)
    description: >-
      If the herald confirms a critical hit, the attack also deals 2 points of
      Constitution damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Zon-Kuthon has stripped the flesh from this spirit-wolf and replaced it with
    haphazard layers of metal, leather, and necrotic tissue to create a
    terrifying herald. The Prince in Chains stands 18 feet tall and weighs
    nearly 3 tons.
