Description:
  - >-
    Elven wasps build their lairs deep within the ground in temperate forests,
    plains, and hills. A rare species is believed to inhabit warm and tropical
    forests and hills as well. A typical lair is a spiraling tunnel that empties
    into a large open chamber. The entrance to the lair is usually well-hidden
  - >-
    and difficult to locate (Search DC 20). The wasps also build a special
    incubating nest nearby (usually within 500 feet of the main nest); another
    large spiraling tunnel that empties into a large main chamber. It is in this
    incubating nest where they store their victims and the female lays her eggs.
  - >-
    Elven wasps are hunters; their favorite food being elves. Though not
    particularly picky with their elven diet, they prefer surface elves to drow
    or aquatic elves.
  - >-
    Elves that fall prey to these wasps are used not only as food, but also as
    "incubators" for the young. A paralyzed elf is dragged back to the wasp's
    incubating lair and dropped into the main chamber. While still alive and
    paralyzed, the elf's abdomen is slit open and the female elven wasp lays a
    single large egg in the wound. The female then leaves the chamber and seals
    the entrance. In a short time the egg hatches and the elven wasp larvae
    begin devouring the still living elf. After devouring the majority of the
    elf, the larvae spin cocoons and pupate, hatching several months later as
    elven wasps-they then dig their way out of the lair and fly off on their own
    into the world.
  - >-
    Elven wasps are large 6-foot long wasps, though they can grow to be up to 10
    feet in length. Females tend to be slightly larger and more aggressive than
    males.
  - >-
    An elven wasp attacks with a vicious stinger that can paralyze its victim. A
    paralyzed victim, if it's an elf, is dragged back to the wasp's lair where
    it is used as food and an incubator for the queen's eggs. Non-elf victims
    are stung to death or left to other predators and scavengers. Some elven
    wasps, seemingly aware that their paralyzed victims occasionally shake off
    the effects of their venom, break an elven victim's legs to prevent or
    hamper any chance a recovered victim has of escaping the lair.
