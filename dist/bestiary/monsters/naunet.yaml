  Tentacles tipped with snapping jaws emerge from this serpentine creature's
  back, complementing the vicious maw in its reptilian face.
Group: Protean
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 2
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adaptive Strike (Su)
    description: >-
      A naunet's natural weapons count as magical and chaotic for the purposes
      of overcoming damage reduction. As a free action once per round, a naunet
      may infuse all of its natural attacks with adamantine, silver, or cold
      iron, thereby allowing it to overcome damage reduction of those types as
      well.
  - name: Coalesce Chaos (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, three or more naunets working together
      can create a roiling cloud of multicolored chaos matter. This effect is
      identical to solid fog (CL 12th) and lasts for 2d6 rounds. If six or more
      naunets are present, the coalesced chaos instead functions as acid fog (CL
      12th).
  - name: Confusion (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature struck by a naunet's tentacle attack is infused with raw chaos,
      and must make a DC 19 Will save or be confused for 1 round. Rounds of
      confusion dealt in this manner stack. A creature with a chaotic component
      to its alignment gains a +4 bonus on saves against this effect, and
      creatures with the chaotic subtype are immune. This is a mind-affecting
      effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Far more bestial than their kin, naunets are the lowest caste of the true
    proteans, the shock troops of their race and roving marauders in the cause
    of chaos. Primarily found in the shifting borderlands between Limbo and
    other planes, naunets are driven half-insane by the stability and stasis of
    such areas, and frequently rampage through the edges of other planes,
    tearing up the very fabric of reality itself and returning vast swaths of
    land to the beautiful, formless potentiality of their home.
  - A naunet is 12 feet long and weighs 900 pounds.
