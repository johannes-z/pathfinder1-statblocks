Source: PFRPG Bestiary
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Drench (Ex)
    description: >-
      The elemental's touch puts out nonmagical flames of Large size or smaller.
      The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic (caster
      level equals elemental's HD).
  - name: Vortex (Su)
    description: >-
      A water elemental can create a whirlpool as a standard action, at will.
      This ability functions identically to the whirlwind special attack (see
      page 306), but can only form underwater and cannot leave the water.
  - name: Water Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A water elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it
      and its opponent are touching water. If the opponent or the elemental is
      touching the ground, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage
      rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether
      the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.
Description:

    Water elementals are patient, relentless creatures made of living fresh or
    salt water. They prefer to hide or drag their opponents into the water to
    gain an advantage. As with other elementals, all water elementals have their
    own unique shapes and appearances. Most appear as wave-like creatures with
    vaguely humanoid faces and smaller wave "arms" to either side. Another
    common form is that of any aquatic creature, such as a shark or octopus, but
    made entirely out of water. Elemental Height Weight Vortex Save DC Vortex
