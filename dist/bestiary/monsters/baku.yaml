SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dream Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      A baku's claws are treated as cold iron and magic for purposes of
      overcoming damage reduction.
  - name: Dream Eating (Su)
    description: >-
      A baku can feed upon the dreams of any single sleeping creature within 100
      feet. Alternatively, the baku can feed upon the dreams of a creature that
      it manages to contact with its dream spell-like ability. A creature can
      resist this effect with a DC 22 Will save. When a baku feeds in this way,
      it can elect to consume only nightmares or all dreams. If it only consumes
      nightmares, the target creature is immune to the effects of the nightmare
      spell, the dream haunting ability of the night hag, and other similar
      attacks for that period of sleep. If the baku instead feeds on all of the
      creature's dreams, that creature is fatigued upon waking and does not gain
      any benefits it would have received from sleep, such as natural healing or
      the ability to regain spells after resting. This is a mind-affecting sleep
      effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Mental Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      When a baku attacks with a claw, it can choose, as a swift action, to deal
      1d4 points of Intelligence damage on that attack. A DC 22 Will save
      negates this ability damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Bizarre creatures that feed on thoughts, bakus stay hidden from humanoids
    and feed on their creativity and dreams as well as their fears and
    nightmares. Bakus rarely encounter others of their kind, living largely
    solitary lives. Some sages speculate the creatures are not born, but rather
    spontaneously manifest as if spun from dreams, nightmares, and creative
    thoughts. Bakus are about 5 feet long and weigh 100 pounds.
  - >-
    Bakus dislike feeding on thoughts concerning themselves, and tend to cease
    when their target begins thinking of the baku. For this reason, bakus keep
    hidden in settlements, floating in the evening air above bedrooms and
    boarding houses, siphoning sustenance from the dreaming populace. Bakus
    themselves do not sleep.
  - >-
    Given their connection to dreams and nightmares, bakus are mortal enemies of
    night hags. Though usually calm and gentle creatures, bakus that encounter
    night hags dedicate themselves to hunting them down and ridding the world of
    their dark inf luence. A baku uses its ethereal jaunt spell-like ability to
    fight night hags as they inf lict nightmares on their victims.
