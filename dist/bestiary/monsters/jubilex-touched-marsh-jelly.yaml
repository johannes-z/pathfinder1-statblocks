SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Jubilex-touched marsh jelly deals 3d6 points of acid damage and 3d6
      points of profane damage to anything within 10 feet when it is killed. A
      successful DC 22 Reflex save reduces the acid damage by half (but does not
      reduce the profane damage).
Description:
  - >-
    Jubilex-touched marsh jellies are advanced jellies that have been "blessed"
    by Jubilex, The Faceless Lord, Lord of the Underpits. They are found
    floating throughout the slime pits and bogs of his Abyssal plane.
  - >-
    Jubilex sometimes sends these creatures to the material planes to aid his
    worshipers, avenge those who have wronged him, or to simply wreak as much
    havoc as possible.
  - >-
    A Jubilex-touched marsh jelly's natural weapons are treated as
    chaoticaligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage
    reduction.
