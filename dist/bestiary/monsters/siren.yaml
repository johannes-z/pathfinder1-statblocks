SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bardic Performance (Su)
    description: >-
      A siren may use bardic performance as a 4th-level bard (9 rounds/day), and
      can use countersong, distraction, fascinate, inspire competence, and
      inspire courage. Levels in the bard class stack with this ability.
  - name: Siren Song (Su)
    description: >-
      When a siren sings, all non-sirens within a 300-foot spread must succeed
      on a DC 19 Will save or become enthralled (see below). The effect depends
      on the type of song the siren chooses, and continues for as long as the
      siren sings and for 1 round thereafter. A creature that successfully saves
      cannot be affected again by any of that siren's songs for 1 hour. These
      are sonic, mind-affecting effects. The save DC is Charisma-based.
      Enthralled creatures behave in one of the following four ways, which the
      siren chooses when she begins singing. • Captivation: This functions
      exactly like a harpy's captivating song (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 172). •
      Fascination: Affected creatures are fascinated. • Obsession: An obsessed
      victim becomes defensive of the siren and does all he can to prevent harm
      from coming to her, going so far as attacking his allies in her defense.
      The victim is not controlled by the siren, but views her as a cherished
      ally. This is a charm effect. • Slumber: The victim immediately falls
      asleep, rendering the creature helpless. While the siren is singing, no
      noise will wake the sleeping creature, though slapping or wounding him
      does. The creature continues sleeping for 1d4 minutes after the siren
      stops singing, but can be awakened by loud noises or any other normal
      method.
Description:
  - >-
    These bizarre beings have the bodies of hawks, owls, or eagles, but the
    heads of beautiful human women. Their faces typically ref lect the human
    ethnicity dominant in the area in which they lair, and they almost always
    bear a vibrant and youthful countenance.
  - >-
    All sirens are female and long-lived. The oldest known sirens haunt their
    territories for nearly a millennium, although most only live for a few
    hundred years. Sirens require male humanoids to mate, and several times per
    decade either capture or rescue bold or comely sailors who enter their
    territories. Stories abound of sirens dying- either through heartache or
    suicide-when sailors they attempted to lure overcame their compelling powers
    and escaped their grasps. Sirens always live near the sea, where their
    powerful voices can carry over the waves and attract the attention of unwary
    sailors who trespass near their isles.
  - A typical siren has a wing span of 8 feet, and weighs 120 pounds.
