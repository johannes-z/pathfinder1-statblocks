Description:
  - >-
    Giant forest lizards are carnivorous animals that dwell in overgrown
    forests, making their lairs in hidden caves and passages. These creatures
    are highly territorial, nocturnal and spend most of the day sleeping in
    their lair or sunning themselves on large tree limbs where the sun breaks
    through the treetops. Giant forest lizards dine on other forest animals,
    consuming almost anything they find. When food is scarce, they scavenge as
    well. A typical giant forest lizard's territory covers several square miles.

    A giant forest lizard is 9 feet long and weighs nearly 2,000 pounds. Its
    coloration and markings are browns and greens, allowing it to adapt and hide
    in the forests. These creatures mate but once a year with the female
    depositing up to four eggs in the lair. Eggs hatch within 3 months and young
    reach maturity within 10 months. Forest lizards can live to be 20 years old.

    When hunting, a giant forest lizard perches within the trees on strong,
    overhanging limbs. When potential prey passes beneath it, it drops to the
    ground and attacks. Prey that is killed is carried back to its lair and
    eaten or saved for later consumption. In combat, or when warning other
    creatures that have entered its territory, the giant forest lizard
    vocalizes, emitting a deep, rolling hissing sound.
