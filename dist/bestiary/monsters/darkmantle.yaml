  As this creature falls from the cavern roof, it opens like a hideous octopus,
  its thin, hook-lined tentacles connected by a fleshy web.

Description:
  - >-
    A darkmantle's tentacle-span measures just under 5 feet- when attached to a
    cave roof and disguised as a stalactite, its length varies from 2 to 3 feet.
    A typical darkmantle weighs 40 pounds. The creatures' heads and bodies are
    usually the color of basalt or dark granite, but their webbed tentacles can
    change color to match their surroundings. The darkmantle isn't a
    particularly good climber, but it can cling to a cave roof like a bat,
    hanging by the hooks at the ends of its tentacles so that its dangling body
    looks nearly indistinguishable from a stalactite. In this hidden position,
    the darkmantle waits for prey to pass beneath, at which point it drops and
    swoops down to attack its victim, slamming its body against the foe and
    attempting to wrap its webbed tentacles around the target. If the darkmantle
    misses its prey, it swoops back up and drops again until its prey is
    vanquished or the darkmantle is grievously injured (in which case the
    creature flutters back up to the roof to hide and hope its "prey" leaves it
    alone). The darkmantle's inborn ability to cloak the area around it in
    magical darkness gives it an additional advantage over foes that rely upon
    light to see. Darkmantles prefer to dwell and hunt in the caves and
    passageways that are closest to the surface, as these tend to possess more
    traffic for the monsters to feed upon. Yet they do not confine themselves to
    these dark caverns, and can sometimes be found dwelling in ruined fortresses
    or even in the sewers of bustling cities. Anywhere food is plentiful and
    there's a ceiling to cling to is a possible den for a darkmantle. A
    darkmantle's life cycle is swift-young grow to maturity in a matter of
    months, and most die of old age after only a few years. As a result,
    generations of darkmantles quickly accrue, and over the years the evolution
    of these creatures is similarly swift. In this manner, a cavern's ecosystem
    can have a signif icant effect on a group of darkmantles' appearance,
    abilities, and tactics. Aquatic caverns might develop darkmantles that can
    swim, while those beset with volcanism might generate darkmantles with a
    resistance to fire. Other darkmantle variants might develop much stonier
    hides, and instead of swooping down to crush prey might simply drop and
    pierce them through with their stalactite-like lengths. The deepest, darkest
    caverns are rumored to host darkmantles of incredible size, capable of
    smothering multiple human-sized foes at once in their leathery folds.
