Description:
  - >-
    Though related to raptors and other birds of prey, vultures mainly feed on
    carrion they spot or scent from on high. Vultures have weak claws compared
    to predatory birds, but their sharp and wickedly hooked beaks tear living
    flesh as readily as the sharpest blade.
  - >-
    Despite dining on carrion, vultures prefer their corpses newly dead rather
    than rotten. Some even hunt smaller prey when food is scarce.
