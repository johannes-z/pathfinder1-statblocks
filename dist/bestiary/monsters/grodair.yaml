  while long fins protrude from its back.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Flood (Su)
    description: >-
      When a grodair is killed, it immediately explodes in a 15-foot-radius
      burst of highly pressurized water that deals 5d6 points of bludgeoning
      damage (Reflex DC 17 half ). After the explosion, a successful DC 25
      Survival check allows a creature to recover a cluster of strange organs
      from the remains. This cluster functions as a decanter of endless water
      for 2d6 hours, but can only produce a "stream" or "fountain" effect.
      Failing this Survival check by 5 or more causes the cluster to burst,
      dealing an additional 2d6 points of damage to that creature (no save) and
      destroying the organs entirely. The save DC is Constitution-based.

    description: >-
      As a standard action when on sand, soil, or other types of loose earth, a
      grodair can gush standing water into the area surrounding it. Upon doing
      so, the land within 15 feet of the grodair is treated as a shallow bog
      (Core Rulebook 427). This water remains as long as the grodair is within
      15 feet and wishes to maintain the water. The bog instantly disperses as
      soon as the grodair is killed or moves out of the area.
  - name: Water Blast (Ex)
    description: >-
      The grodair's ranged attack is a pressurized blast of water. This attack
      has a range of 60 feet with no range increment.
Description:
  - >-
    A grodair is a bloated aquatic creature from the primal world of the fey.
    The bulbous sac on its spine is an extradimensional space that can contain
    thousands of gallons of water. The creature drains water (including small
    bits of debris and even very small creatures) from one place and releases it
    in another, typically creating boggy areas as it moves so it can travel more
    quickly than its tentacles can carry it. A grodair can rise up to 6 feet on
    its tentacles, measures 7 feet long, and weighs about 400 pounds.
  - >-
    A grodair is intelligent, but extremely absentminded and careless. Its
    memory is poor, and it has difficulty remembering things it was told even 5
    minutes prior- though it can recall some events of the distant past with
    perfect (and often frustrating) clarity.
