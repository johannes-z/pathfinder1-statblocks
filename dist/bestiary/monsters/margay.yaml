    description: >-
      A margay can see three times as far as a human in starlight, moonlight,
      torchlight, and similar conditions of shadowy illumination. It retains the
      ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
Description:
  - >-
    Margays are jungle-dwelling cats similar in makeup and build to the ocelot.
    They favor dense forests with thick foliage and spend their days basking in
    the sun or hunting for food.
  - >-
    A margay's diet includes small mammals, birds, bird eggs, small reptiles and
    amphibians, and fruits and nuts. They are active during both the night and
    day, having no set hunting or feeding time.
  - >-
    Margays generally mate early in their life (usually within the first year)
    and gestation lasts about 80 days. Young are born live and a litter consists
    of one or two young. Young margays are dependent on their mother for about 8
    weeks before being able to forage and hunt on their own.
  - >-
    A margay looks like a small, slender, spotted cat. Its fur ranges in color
    from tan to brown or cinnamon. Its spots are darker and run in longitudinal
    rows along its body. Margays generally average about two feet long and weigh
    about eight pounds.
  - >-
    Margays attack with stealth and surprise but avoid conflict with creatures
    much larger than themselves unless cornered. When engaged, they attempt to
    pounce upon their prey and wrap their claws around the victims head, sinking
    their needle-like teeth into its throat.
