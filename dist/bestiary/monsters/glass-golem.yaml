SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dazzling Brightness (Ex)
    description: >-
      A glass golem in an area of bright light dazzles any creature within 30
      feet that sees it for 1 round (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Once a creature
      makes its save against this ability, it is immune to that golem's
      brightness for 24 hours. The DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Immune to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A glass golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against a glass golem, as noted below. • A shatter spell
      damages a glass golem as if it were a crystalline creature. • A keen edge
      spell affects all of a glass golem's slam attacks as if they were slashing
      weapons. • A magical attack that deals cold damage slows a glass golem (as
      the slow spell) for 3 rounds (no saving throw). • A magical attack that
      deals fire damage ends any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of
      damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the
      amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit
      points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A glass golem gets no
      saving throw against fire effects.
  - name: Reflect Spells (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a free action once every 1d4 rounds, a glass golem can align its
      internal structure to enhance its resistance to magic for 1 round. During
      this time, the golem reflects spells (even spells that function
      differently against the golem as described in its immune to magic ability)
      as if under the effect of a spell turning spell.
Description:
  - >-
    A glass golem is a sizable guardian constructed by a powerful caster,
    usually in the shape of an armored humanoid. They are more common in desert
    lands where quartz-based sand is readily available, or in urban centers
    where glassblowing is commonplace.
  - A typical glass golem is 10 feet tall and weighs 2,500 pounds.
  - >-
    Stained Glass Golems (+0 CR): Divine casters sometimes build glass golems
    that resemble the windowpanes commonly found in temples. Thin and agile,
    these colorful beings often act as spies, wielding powers of stealth that
    their other counterparts do not possess. A stained glass golem has a +8
    racial bonus on Stealth checks.
  - Construction
  - >-
    A glass golem's body is made from 2,500 pounds of glass mixed with special
    salts and rare minerals worth 1,000 gp.
