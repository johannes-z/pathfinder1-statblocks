Description_Visual: >-
  This ebon-skinned monstrosity has a gaping maw with boarlike tusks and a wide
  nose beneath a furrowed brow that lacks any sort of eyes or visible visual
  organs. Its corded muscles twist and writhe beneath its smooth, hairless jet
  hide, giving its frame a gnarled, unbalanced asymmetry. It moves with a loping
  gait, however, and wears its armor, composed of thick, welded plates,
  effortlessly.
Group: Abyss

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Planar Empowerment (Su)
    description: >-
      While on the plane of the Abyss, an Abyss gigas gains access to blasphemy
      (DC 24), cloak of chaos (DC 25), and earthquake (DC 25) as spell-like
      abilities, each usable once per day. If the gigas ventures onto another
      plane, it cannot make use of these abilities (though its other spelllike
      abilities remain available). The save DC for the spell-like abilities is
      Charisma-based and includes a +5 racial bonus.
  - name: Wrenching Spasms (Su)
    description: >-
      When an Abyss gigas hits an opponent with its bite attack, the opponent
      must make a DC 29 Fort save or be overcome by wrenching spasms that wrack
      its body. These spasms cause the victim to be nauseated and deal 1d6
      points of damage to Strength and Dexterity due to the painful contortion
      of bones, muscles, and limbs. The spasms continue for 1d6 hours or until
      healed with heal, regenerate, or greater restoration. The effects of this
      ability do not stack, but once a creature has recovered from or been cured
      of the effect, it can be affected again. Once a creature has made a
      successful saving throw against this effect, it cannot be affected by the
      wrenching spasms from that particular gigas for 24 hours. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Spawned from titans who took refuge in the rifts of the Abyss, the Abyss
    gigas roam the wastes between the oncemighty titan fortresses. These
    powerful beings do not typically dwell among their own kind, preferring
    instead to enslave lesser beings-demons and captured planar travelers-and
    rule over them as despotic tyrants. Many Abyss gigas serve more powerful
    demon lords in turn. When more than one of the thankfully rare Abyss gigas
    live near each other, they exist in a state of perpetual warfare, sending
    forth wave after wave of their minions in battle. In these situations, only
    rarely do the gigas masters ever face each other and come to blows, and even
    then never to the death, as they are aware of the fragile existence of their
    nearly extinct race. When facing other opponents, however, an Abyss gigas is
    a fearsome foe, battling to the death to prove the superiority of its
    ancient line. When encountered on the Material Plane, Abyss gigas are fond
    of taking control of companies of giants and compelling them to do their
    bidding, feeling at once both a distant kinship and a sense of domineering
    superiority. Frost giant cults of Kostchtchie are frequent recipients of
    this sort of attention. Abyss gigas stand over 50 feet tall and weigh 25
    tons or more, not including the weight of their Abyss-forged armor and
    weapons of adamantine. Abyss gigas usually favor the weapons of their
    demonic patrons. For example, followers of Kostchtchie often wield giant
    warhammers in both hands, servants of Lamashtu carry falchions, and those
    serving Urxehl use spiked greatclubs.
