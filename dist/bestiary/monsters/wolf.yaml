Description:
  - >-
    Wandering alone or in packs, wolves sit at the top of the food chain.
    Ferociously territorial and exceptionally wideranging in their hunting, wolf
    packs cover broad areas. A wolf 's wide paws contain slight webbing between
    the toes that assists in moving over snow, and its fur is a thick,
    water-resistant coat ranging in color from gray to brown and even black in
    some species. Its paws contain scent glands that mark the ground as it
    travels, assisting in navigation as well as broadcasting its whereabouts to
    fellow pack members. Generally, a wolf stands from 2-1/2 to 3 feet tall at
    the shoulder and weighs between 45 and 150 pounds, with females being
    slightly smaller.
