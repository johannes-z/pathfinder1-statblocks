SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A mantidrake's breath weapon depends on what type of dragon parent it had,
      as summarized on the table below. Regardless of its type, a mantidrake's
      breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds, deals 5d8 points of damage,
      and allows a DC 19 Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. To determine a mantidrake's draconic parent and breath
      weapon randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below. 1d10 Draconic
      Parent Breath Weapon 1-2 Black 60-foot line of acid 3-4 Blue 60-foot line
      of lightning 5-6 Green 30-foot cone of gas (acid) 7-8 Red 30-foot cone of
      fire 9-10 White 30-foot
  - name: cone of cold Spikes (Ex)
    description: >-
      With a snap of its tail, a mantidrake can loose a volley of six spikes as
      a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike). This attack has a
      range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30
      feet of each other. The creature can launch only twenty-four spikes in a
      single day.
  - name: Immunity to Energy (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mantidrake is immune to one type of energy based on its draconic
      heritage: black, immunity to acid; blue, immunity to electricity; green,
      immunity to acid; red, immunity to fire; white, immunity to cold.
Description:
  - >-
    Mantidrakes were born from fell experiments and dark rituals that crossed
    evil dragons with manticores. The result: a creature that combines the best
    and worst traits of both of its parents. From a distance, a mantidrake is
    often mistaken for a normal manticore. Only when opponents close against it
    do they see that the creature is something different. Mantidrakes like
    dragons are territorial predators and often claim a wide expanse of land as
    their hunting ground. Creatures that wander into a mantidrake's territory
    rarely go unnoticed, especially during the daylight hours when the
    mantidrake spends most of its time hunting. Slain prey is either devoured on
    the spot (if the mantidrake is hungry) or carried back to its lair and
    stored for later (or fed to the young if such creatures are present).
    Mantidrakes are generally solitary creatures though sometimes a pair may be
    encountered. Such an encounter is with a mated pair. Female mantidrakes are
    just as common (or rare depending on how you classify this creature) as
    males and are just as likely to be encountered as both sexes are skilled
    hunters. When gestating, a female curtails the time she spends hunting to
    spend it in the lair preparing both herself and the lair for her young.
    Young are born live and by 2 years of age they are independent enough to go
    out hunting on their own. A typical mantidrake is about 10 to 12 feet long
    and weighs about 1,100 to 1,300 pounds. Its draconic head is scaled and is
    the same color as its dragon parent. The color slowly fades and meshes with
    the mantidrake's leonine body which is covered in dull tan fur, except for
    its underbelly which is scaled like a true dragon's. Its wings are of the
    same color as its dragon parent, dark, almost black (and in the case of a
    black dragon parent, the wings are actually black in color). A mantidrake's
    environment varies based on its dragon heritage: black mantidrakes can be
    found in warm marshes, deserts, or underground; blue mantidrakes favor warm
    hills and mountains, rarely being found underground; green mantidrake s
    favor temperate or warm forests and underground settings; red mantidrakes
    favor warm mountains and underground settings; and white mantidrakes favor
    cold mountains, cold deserts, and underground environments. Mantidrakes are
    aggressive combatants and begin most attacks with a blast from their deadly
    breath weapon. This is followed next by a volley of spikes or a
    claw/claw/bite routine against the closest opponent. Mantidrakes prefer to
    use their powerful wings to stay aloft and fight from the air where it can
    rain a combination of its breath weapon and deadly spikes down on its
    opponents. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
