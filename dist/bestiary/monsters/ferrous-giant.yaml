Description:
  - >-
    The great ferrous giant stands over 20 feet tall and appears as a humanoid
    composed of flexible and bendable iron. Though it is often mistaken for a
    construct, it is in fact a very intelligent giant. A ferrous giant makes its
    home deep within a secluded mountain range. Its lair is often a deep cave or
    cavern or a gigantic castle constructed of iron and built into the face of a
    mountain. Ferrous giants are generally solitary creatures rarely interacting
    or dealing with other races, including other giants. Though not on bad terms
    with other giants, they simply have no interest in dealing with them.
    Ferrous giants spend most of their days hunting (deer, moose, boar, elk) and
    foraging or crafting exquisite weapons of iron. Some particularly sociable
    ferrous giants (a rare occurrence to be assured) set up a trading operation
    with a nearby town or city, exchanging weapons for whatever might interest
    the giant (food, iron, money, etc.). In melee, the ferrous giant uses its
    Huge iron battleaxe or longsword to bash or cleave its opponents. If
    disarmed, or if it is feeling particularly vile, a ferrous giant can pummel
    a foe with its massive fists. When fighting smaller foes, the ferrous giant
    often opens combat by trampling its foes or grabbing them and flinging them
    aside. Particularly noisome opponents are scooped up and pounded into the
    ground. The ferrous giant uses its heat metal ability in combat to heat the
    armor of its opponents and burn its foes. Ferrous Giants Characters Ferrous
    giants are extremely strong, have hardy constitutions and remain versatile
    all other facets. Ferrous giant shamans are usually adepts or druids.
