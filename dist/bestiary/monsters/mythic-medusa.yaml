Description:
  - >-
    A mythic medusa is one of the near-immortal progenitors of the medusa race,
    who mate with humanoids in order to produce weaker (but still deadly)
    offspring. With deadly poison, power over snakes, and the ability to animate
    and command those she has turned to stone, a mythic medusa is a dangerous
    foe who can't be easily overcome by mirrored shields and blindfolds; she
    waits, strikes, and retreats, allowing her minions and venom to weaken her
    foes before she is ready to take their lives.
