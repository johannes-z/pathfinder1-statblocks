SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Petrifying Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Turn to stone permanently, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 18 negates. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Snake bite; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4
      Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mythic medusa can spend a standard action to apply her snake poison to
      her sword or to two arrows, and normally poisons her weapons in advance.
  - name: Summon Snake (Sp)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a mythic medusa can summon an emperor cobra
      (Bestiary 2 252) or 1d3 amphisbaenas (Bestiary 2 25) as if using a summon
      monster spell. The summoned snakes are immune to the medusa's gaze attack
      and remain for 8 rounds before disappearing.
  - name: Unpetrify (Su)
    description: >-
      A mythic medusa can expend one use of mythic power to return a petrified
      creature to life (as if using stone to flesh) for 1 minute. The creature
      is under the medusa's control (as if using dominate monster) and reverts
      to a statue at the end of this time. If the medusa expends three uses of
      mythic power, the creature remains unpetrified for 24 hours instead of 1
      minute. A typical petrified victim in a mythic medusa's lair is a half-elf
      fighter 6 (Pathfinder RPG NPC Codex 82) or human warrior 6 (NPC Codex
      268).
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic medusa is one of the near-immortal progenitors of the medusa race,
    who mate with humanoids in order to produce weaker (but still deadly)
    offspring. With deadly poison, power over snakes, and the ability to animate
    and command those she has turned to stone, a mythic medusa is a dangerous
    foe who can't be easily overcome by mirrored shields and blindfolds; she
    waits, strikes, and retreats, allowing her minions and venom to weaken her
    foes before she is ready to take their lives.
