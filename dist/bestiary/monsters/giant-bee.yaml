  - name: Vulnerable to Smoke (Ex)
    description: >-
      Smoke from particularly smoky fires or effects (such as that created by a
      pyrotechnics spell) causes a giant bee to become nauseated if it fails a
      DC 14 Fortitude save. This condition persists as long as the giant bee
      remains in the smoke, plus 1d4 rounds.
Description:
  - >-
    Like their smaller cousins, giant bees fill their ecological niche by
    playing matchmaker for a vast array of flowering plant life. As a giant bee
    feeds on plant nectars, clumps of pollen attach to the coarse hairs covering
    its body and legs.
  - >-
    Giant bees grow to approximately 5 feet in length, with a similar wingspan.
    These creatures weigh 60 pounds and live in their adult form for nearly 10
    years. Giant bees' stingers are not barbed like those of their diminutive
    counterparts, so these creatures can sting foes repeatedly and do not die
    after one sting.
  - >-
    Giant Bumblebee (CR 2) These bulky and aggressive giant bees have the
    advanced creature simple template. Their venom is deadly, and deals
    Constitution damage rather than Strength damage.
