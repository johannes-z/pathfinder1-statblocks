SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cold (Su)
    description: >-
      A shae's touch saps heat from living creatures, leaving patches of
      colorless flesh rather than physical wounds. A shae can deal 1d6 points of
      cold damage with a touch. It adds +1d6 points of cold damage to any melee
      weapon damage it deals.
  - name: Lesser Shadow Evocation (Sp)
    description: >-
      This spell-like ability functions identically to the spell shadow
      evocation, but it can only create quasi-real versions of sorcerer or
      wizard evocation spells of 2nd level or lower. This spell-like ability is
      the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.
Description:
  - >-
    The mysterious people known as the shaes are natives of the Shadow Plane. In
    their own language, their name means "unbound" or "unfettered." According to
    shae history, they were once humanoids who through tireless study and
    self-perfection managed to transcend the bonds of a definite form. Though
    they still bear roughly humanoid shapes, shaes' outlines are perpetually
    wispy and impossible for any non-shaes to focus directly on.
  - >-
    Though shaes may engage in all the same pursuits and professions as other
    humanoids, their overwhelming racial pride often leads them to see all other
    humanoids- especially humans-as lesser beings. Ironically, this casual
    disdain sometimes leads individual shaes to gather harems of worshipful
    human consorts, and it is from these unions that fetchlings often issue.
    Humans involved in such relationships often hope to learn the secret of the
    shaes' power over shadows, and claim that only in sacred union with the
    creatures can one glimpse their true features.
  - >-
    Shaes are roughly 6 feet tall and weigh 100 pounds. They often wear masks
    and form-fitting clothing when around other creatures in order to give the
    lesser beings something to focus on (such garments do not impede their blur
    ability).
