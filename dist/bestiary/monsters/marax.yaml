  Dense, bony growths line the back of this bipedal predator. Between its
  gnashing, toothy underbite, scythe-like claws, and spiked tail, no part of
  this beast offers mercy.

      Tail barbs-injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect
      1d4 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves. Cunning and brutal, maraxes are
      far-ranging predators from Castrovel's mist-shrouded landscape. Gifted
      with vicious weapons, dense armor, and a paralytic venom, a single marax
      is a match for even the greatest hunter. A pack can easily bring down
      Castrovel's largest creatures and defend their territory against the
      planet's most fearsome competitors. Variations of maraxes dot Castrovel's
      different regions just as big cats stalk Golarion's. Different subspecies
      can be identified by their varying fur colors and patterns and the
      arrangement of ridges on their dorsal plates. Maraxes typically stand 9 to
      10 feet tall and weigh up to 900 pounds. Ecology While they are far from
      the most dangerous predators on their homeworld, maraxes stand among the
      planet's more successful hunters thanks to their inherent adaptability.
      Perfectly suited to the forests and plains of Castrovel, they roam
      enormous territories as lone hunters or in small packs.
Description:
  - >-
    Their seasonal migrations create famine in their wakes as they drain a
    region of fauna, and entire lashunta (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea
    Bestiary 25) villages may relocate seasonally to avoid starvation. Maraxes
    possess only a single lung, and those introduced to alien environments often
    become extremely irritable due to shortness of breath.
  - >-
    Maraxes are overwhelmingly carnivorous. The larger, more aggressive females
    dominate their packs, bringing down prey and eating first. Maraxes have
    voracious appetites, and will make a meal of almost anything-in lean times
    the animals turn to carrion, fruit, and in rare cases even soil and stones
    to sate their voracious appetites.
  - >-
    Straddling the line between mammal and reptile, maraxes are warm-blooded
    creatures with resilient bodies. Soft fur covers tough scales across much of
    a marax's body, while bony knobs protect the head, back, thighs, and tail. A
    marax's most identifiable feature is its tough dorsal osteoderms that offer
    protection. They lack forelimbs, and balance instead on a single pair of
    legs tipped with vicious, scythe-like claws. Their oversized jaws can crush
    both bone and stone, and larger specimens can even tear through metal armor.
    A cluster of venomous barbs sprout from the end of a marax's tail, which can
    inject enough paralytic venom to bring down prey twice the creature's size.
  - >-
    These statistics represent a typical marax. Various subspecies may be larger
    or smaller (use the giant creature or young creature simple templates
    accordingly) and possess a variety of different special abilities. The
    arctic-dwelling tundrax is smaller, but can hibernate for months beneath the
    snow and reawaken in moments to pounce upon unsuspecting prey, while females
    of the bioluminescent ghostback marax possess a resin-producing gland that
    grants them an ability similar to the web special ability.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Maraxes are found all across Castrovel, but exist primarily in its primeval
    forests and vast savannas. Dozens of subspecies fill the planet's various
    ecological niches, and maraxes range from the polar tundra to steaming
    tropical jungles. Thanks to Castrovel's dramatic tides and powerful weather
    systems, regular migration is a way of life, and packs can cover hundreds of
    miles between seasonal hunting grounds. Some subspecies follow staple herds,
    while others alternate between a variety of environments and diets
    throughout the year. Most maraxes spend dry seasons stalking small prey in
    wooded areas or deep in Castrovel's countless hidden valleys, then during
    wet seasons move onto open savanna to take down larger prey. Wherever they
    settle for a time, packs use their powerful claws to dig out shallow nests,
    which shelter a complex Ecology of scavengers and opportunistic mammals once
    the beasts move on.
  - >-
    Most breeds of maraxes are social animals that form complex hierarchies.
    They vocalize a variety of chirps,
  - >-
    growls, and rasping grunts, and establish relative status with bellowing
    exchanges that lashunta call "debates." The largest female typically leads
    the pack, and surrounds herself with the other breeding-age females for
    hunting and territorial defense. Males and females not of breeding age rely
    on this matriarch's circle for food, and are expected to groom the hunters
    and one another for parasites. All members of a pack contribute to marking
    and defending territory and to scavenging during lean times. The social
    bonds are knit tight, and packs are more likely to move on to new hunting
    grounds than drive out members in hard times. An alpha female remains
    fertile so long as she is well fed, and especially successful matriarchs can
    grow to enormous sizes and dominate packs of fifty or more, cultivating
    legends and nicknames among lashunta hunters.
  - >-
    Non-alpha females breed only two or three litters in a lifetime. Females
    attract the attention of males using their tail barbs, and engage other
    females in mock combat to claim the healthiest mates. If a male shows
    interest, the female bonds her clutch of two to four eggs to his underbelly
    with a sticky resin. The father becomes incubator and guardian for the next
    16 months. Hatchlings are born with soft, flexible back plates, and adults
    claw and nip at a pup's back to transform the soft cartilage into thick,
    sturdy osteoderms. The venom both males and females produce in their tails
    is a complex array of proteins and enzymes that the hatchlings suckle for
    nourishment during their vulnerable first few days. As one would expect,
    maraxes are very protective parents; packs will chase kidnappers for miles
    and tear them apart with an almost gleeful cruelty.
  - >-
    Thanks to Castrovel's numerous planetary portals, maraxes occasionally
    migrate to other worlds. A smaller, wheezing variety prowls Akiton's
    equator, riding the planet's massive dust storms from hunting ground to
    hunting ground. On Golarion, a few small packs roam Numeria and southern
    Garund, preying on the megafauna in these locations.
  - >-
    Among Castrovel's civilizations, capturing or slaying a marax is an
    impressive achievement. As maraxes' natural weapons can be used to craft
    vicious daggers, spears, and terbutje, those capable of reliably trapping or
    hunting the creatures earn impressive fortunes and high prestige.
  - >-
    Near rural settlements, maraxes stalk domesticated herds for easy meals, and
    even pick off careless hunters and shepherds without fear. Their hunting
    tactics are so effective that some lashunta have bred a loyal domesticated
    subspecies to guard their wilderness settlements from predation. Though
    ravenous and ill tempered, these tame maraxes are unf laggingly loyal.
    Druidic sects see the creature as a powerful totem, crafting fetishes from
    the animal's bones and plates and divining prophecies from packs' seasonal
    migrations.
