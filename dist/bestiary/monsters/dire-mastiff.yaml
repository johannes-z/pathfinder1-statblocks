Description:
  - >-
    Dire mastiffs are the domestic equivalent of dire wolves. They are large,
    vicious canines highly prized for their ability to track and kill opponents
    much larger than themselves. Domesticated dire mastiffs are often trained
    and outfitted for war in spiked, studded leather armor. Orcs often use
    trained dire mastiffs in warfare.
  - >-
    Dire mastiffs are much like wolves, and in the wild, they commingle in packs
    of up to twelve. The dominant male is always the leader, though other males
    frequently challenge for the position. Such exchanges, while violent, rarely
    result in death. The loser of the contest simply submits to the victor and
    acknowledges it as the new pack leader.
  - >-
    Dire mastiffs are carnivores and their diet consists of just about any
    animal or creature they can catch and kill. Favorite meals include leopards,
    skunks, horses, and rodents. They rarely devour humanoid flesh, but will do
    so if food is scarce. Kills are often carried back to the lair and
    distributed among the pups and females.
  - >-
    Dire mastiffs breed twice a year, usually every 6 months. The actual month
    or time varies depending on climate, terrain, and other environmental
    factors. Gestation lasts about 4 months after which time the female gives
    birth to 1d3+3 pups. Pups depend on their mother or the hunters of a pack to
    feed them and rarely journey out on their own until they reach 4 months of
    age. Dire mastiffs reach maturity around 8 months after birth.

    Before attacking, the hair on the neck of a dire mastiff rises, its ears
    fold back, its tail stiffens, and it bears its sharpened teeth, through
    which a low growl is often heard. A dire mastiff rushes its opponent and
    bites ferociously with its powerful jaws.
