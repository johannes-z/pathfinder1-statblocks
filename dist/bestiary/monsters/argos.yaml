Description:
  - >-
    Believed by some to be far-distant relatives of the sahuagin, the argos are
    an aggressive race of aquatic creature that dwell in the depths of the River
    Styx living in great underwater castles and cities. Argosian cities and
    strongholds are constructed of stone and coral. The argos are a highly
    superstitious race, not really trusting arcane magic, but reveling in the
    miracles of divine magic and what it can do. Most argosian towns, cities,
    and strongholds have a temple at the center. Some have several temples; one
    larger one dedicated to the Drowning Lord and several smaller temples
    dedicated to the lesser aquatic deities. Rulers in argosian society are
    known as priest-kings, and all are mid- to high-level clerics. These
    individuals are revered by all argos and many consider them to be the living
    embodiment of their deity. To kill an argosian priest or priestess is
    punishable by death. In some argosian societies, even merely offending a
    priest or priestess brings swift and harsh punishment.

    The typical argos stand 6 feet tall and weigh just over 200 pounds. Its hide
    is scaly grayish-blue shading to light colors on its chest. A long dark gray
    fin runs from the crown of its head to its lower back. Its clawed hands and
    feet are both webbed, and its eyes are the color of soot. Females stand just
    less than 6 feet tall and are usually lighter in color. Argos mate once
    every few years generally, and gestation lasts about 6 months. Young are
    born live and are light gray in color, reaching maturity within 15 months.
    An argos typically lives to about 40 years of age. The typical argos diet
    consists of shark, small fish, seaweed and undersea plants and humanoid
    flesh.

    Argos are particularly fond of humans, elves, aquatic elves, and merfolk;
    the latter being considered a delicacy. Squid is never eaten by an argos;
    the animal being considered sacred and the favored animal of the Drowning
    Lord.

    In combat, an argos prefers to fight with a spear and its vicious bite. If
    disarmed or simply by choice, an argos can fight with its webbed claws to
    rend and slash its foes. When battling, an argos prefers to fight in the
    water where it has the advantage. Favored tactics include swooping down on
    prey from above or swimming up beneath prey and attacking from surprise.
    When attacking seaside towns civilizations, argos raiding bands attack at
    night and can number up to 80 individuals. They prefer to swarm their
    opponents and attack using their great numbers to overwhelm their opponents.
    They use the same general tactics when attacking seagoing vessels as well,
    swarming their targets and crushing them under the onslaught. Prisoners are
    rarely taken in such raids as most land-based life cannot breathe underwater
    or survive the memory-draining power of the River Styx. Some argosian cities
    do use magic however to sustain air breathing slaves and prisoners. These
    are rare, as most prisoners are slain and devoured within a few hours.
