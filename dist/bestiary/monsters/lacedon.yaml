Description:

    A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the next midnight. A
    humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none of the abilities it
    possessed in life. It is not under the control of any other ghouls, but it
    hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like a normal ghoul in all
    respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as a ghast.
