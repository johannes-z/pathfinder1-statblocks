    description: A spawn of Jubilex's acid does not harm metal or stone.
  - name: Death Throes (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a spawn of Jubilex is slain, it melts into a pool of caustic acid
      that quickly covers a 10-foot by 10-foot square area. Creatures within or
      entering the area must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 2d6
      points of acid damage each round they remain in the area. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Spawn of Jubilex were once human creatures corrupted by foul and dark
    rituals at the hands of Jubilex the Faceless Lord. The first known sighting
    of these creatures was in the Citadel (see G5 Chaos Rising, by Necromancer
    Games) when Jubilex used his power to corrupt a group of dwarves (known now
    as The Corrupted). Using his dark magic, Jubilex slayed the dwarves,
    liquefied their remains, and reanimated them as his spawn.
  - >-
    Spawn are not mindless, but do not retain much of their former lives.
    Fleeting memories perhaps, but nothing else seems to remain. These creatures
    are hateful and attack anything they encounter.
  - >-
    Spawn look as they did in their former lives, save they are covered in a
    thick, black slime that constantly weeps from their bodies.
  - >-
    Spawn attack with weapons, favoring weapons they used in their former life.
    These creatures rarely retreat from battle, their ever-consuming hatred
    driving them to their own destruction.
