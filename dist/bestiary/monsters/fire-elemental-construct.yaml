      Anyone within 10 feet of a fire elemental construct must succeed on a DC
      25 Fortitude save or take 2d8 points of fire damage each round. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A fire elemental construct is immune to any spell or spell-like ability
      that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects
      function differently against the creature, as noted below. A cold effect
      slows a fire elemental construct (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds with
      no saving throw. This is in addition to any damage it takes because of its
      vulnerability to cold. A quench spell negates the fire elemental
      construct's damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 round. Any
      water-based spell of 5th level or higher deals 1d6 points of damage per
      caster level to the fire elemental construct. The construct can attempt a
      Fortitude save (DC 10 + spell level + caster's relevant ability score
      modifier) to half the damage. Any fire-based spell or effect heals 1 point
      of damage on the fire elemental construct for each 3 points of damage the
      attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the
      construct to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as
      temporary hit points.
Description:
  - >-
    Fire elemental constructs are perhaps the rarest of the elemental constructs
    (perhaps because their very makeup poses a danger to many spellcasters).
    Favored by efreeti sorcerers and salamander wizards, these constructs are
    often found guarding an ancient efreeti treasure cache or hoard. A fire
    elemental construct is a humanoid, 9 feet tall, composed of yellow-orange
    fire and flame. Its face lacks any discernable features, though sometimes,
    two pinpoints of white-hot fire seem to appear on its head, perhaps
    functioning as eyes. Its arms and legs end in tormented elemental faces,
    each howling and screaming (in an indecipherable tongue) at its
    imprisonment. A fire elemental construct batters and pummels its foes with
    its flaming fists. Occasionally, the elemental grapples a foe and pulls it
    into its burning form. Elemental constructs are used by powerful mages as
    servants, bodyguards, and assassins. An elemental construct, like any other
    automaton follows any order or command given to it to the best of its
    ability. An elemental construct's creator can command it if the construct is
    within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If not commanded, an
    elemental construct usually follows its last instruction to the best of its
    ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the
    elemental construct a simple command to govern its actions in his or her
    absence. The elemental construct's creator can order the construct to obey
    the commands of another person (who might in turn place the elemental
    construct under someone else's control, and so on), but the elemental
    construct's creator can always resume control over his creation by
    commanding the elemental construct to obey him alone. Each elemental
    construct appears as a humanoid creature about 9 feet tall and is composed
    entirely of its native element. Construction An elemental construct's body
    is formed completely of one of the four elements air, earth, fire, or water.
