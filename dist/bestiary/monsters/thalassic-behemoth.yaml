Description_Visual: >-
  Two massive limbs drag the bulk of this whale-like beast's body from the
  churning waters of the sea.
Group: Behemoth
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 3
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Water Jet (Su)
    description: >-
      A thalassic behemoth can blast water from its blowhole with surprising
      force and accuracy. This water jet has a range of 240 feet with no range
      increment. A target hit by the water jet is subject to the behemoth's push
      ability and must succeed at a DC 34 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4+1
      rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Sent by the gods to punish those who dwell near the sea, thalassic behemoths
    scourge ships and other vessels from the waters before turning their
    attention toward structures and survivors on land. Despite their massive
    bulk, thalassic behemoths swim incredibly fast and can easily outpace all
    but the fleetest of ships. On land, they can be more readily escaped, at
    least by those willing and able to leave homes and belongings behind. Though
    capable of surviving indefinitely on land and employing a clumsy, seal-like
    locomotion, thalassic behemoths soon weary of gravity's never-ending drag.
    They rarely venture more than a mile or two from shore before returning to
    the comforting buoyancy of the seas.
  - >-
    Thalassic behemoths resemble immense sperm whales in the water, but they can
    quickly haul themselves ashore using their mighty forelimbs. Tail and limb
    alike shatter wood and stone with but a single blow, while their jaws gape
    wide enough to swallow smaller boats whole.
  - >-
    The coming of a thalassic behemoth is foreshadowed by a dramatic increase in
    missing ships and sea life purposefully beaching upon shores. These
    behemoths spend much of their time lurking a few hundred feet below the
    surface-but legends hold that even greater behemoths, the dread leviathans,
    dwell in the deepest oceanic reaches.
