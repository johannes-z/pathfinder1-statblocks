SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Returning Weapons (Su)
    description: >-
      Any throwing weapon wielded by a yamah gains the returning weapon special
      ability as long as the yamah wields it.
  - name: Steal Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a yamah can make a touch attack against a creature
      under the effect of a spell or spells and attempt to dispel the effect as
      per the dispel magic spell (CL 6th). If the attempt is successful, the
      yamah absorbs the magical energy and converts it into a bolt of force. A
      yamah can use a force bolt to make a ranged touch attack that deals 1d6
      points of force damage for every spell level of the effect dispelled by
      the yamah (for example, if a yamah dispels a 2nd-level spell with its
      steal magic ability, the resulting force bolt deals 2d6 points of force
      damage; 0-level spells count as being 1st-level for the purpose of this
      ability). These force bolts have a range of 100 feet with no range
      increment. A yamah can only carry a number of force bolts equal to its
      Charisma bonus (5 for most yamahs), and any force bolts not used within 24
      hours of obtaining them disappear and are wasted.
Description:
  - >-
    Yamahs travel the planes promoting the ideals of freedom and fairness, using
    their unique talents to rob evildoers of their magic and turn it into a
    weapon for good. Yamahs harbor ill will toward anyone who would use magic
    for cruel or evil purposes, especially necromancers and creatures that use
    magic to trap souls and pervert life.
  - >-
    Though yamahs often bear a stern countenance, they nonetheless enjoy
    lighthearted pranks and cheery jokes when appropriate. The white markings
    that cover yamahs' bodies may at first appear to be tattoos, but are in fact
    natural sigils that are unique to each individual. The average yamah stands
    just over 6 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds.
  - >-
    Because of the presence of the mystery cults in Magnimar and the open
    worship of empyreal lords-especially Ashava-yamahs can often be seen in this
    city during lunar eclipses and other significant celestial events. Legends
    among these mystery cults claim that yamahs sometimes accompany good
    spellcasters on crusades against otherworldly fiends, though every story
    inevitably ends with the yamah mysteriously departing after the deed is
    done, abandoning its mortal partner without a word.
