      grapple checks rather than the normal +4 bonus most creatures with grab
      possess.
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Red ache: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 13; onset 1d3 days; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d6 Str damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    In areas where large creatures like megafauna or dinosaurs dwell, the giant
    tick behaves much like its smaller kin-it lies in wait in the undergrowth,
    and when a suitable host passes by, it drops onto the body to feed. In other
    areas, these vermin are much more aggressive, and actively hunt smaller prey
    like dogs, livestock, or even humanoids. A giant tick drains blood quickly,
    but once it has caused 6 points of Constitution damage, it drops off, sated,
    to crawl away to digest. A giant tick is 3 feet long and weighs 50 pounds.
