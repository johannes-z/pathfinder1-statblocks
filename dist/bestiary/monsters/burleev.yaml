      A burleev is surrounded by either cold or fire energy. The burleev can
      change the energy type as a swift action. When surrounded by fire, the
      burleev has the fire subtype, it adds fire damage to its attacks, and
      creatures striking it with melee weapons, natural attacks, or unarmed
      strikes take 1d6 points of fire damage; when surrounded by cold, it
      instead gains the cold subtype and deals cold damage rather than fire
      damage. It can also completely dampen its aura for 1d6 rounds, but cannot
      reactivate it until this time has passed. Spells A burleev cast spells as
      a 5th-level sorcerer.
Description:
  - >-
    A burleev is a planar explorer created by the power of Nethys. Some are his
    mortal petitioners assigned to this role after their death by a deliberate
    act of the god, whereas others are hapless visitors who were transformed by
    proximity to Nethys or certain parts of his realm. They serve as his eyes
    and ears on many planes, using their power to adapt to hostile environments
    and report their discoveries to his greater servitors. Each has a unique
    allotment of spells suited for its current task, and a burleev that has
    completed its service in one inhospitable location might be destroyed and
    recreated with a different array of arcane talents that suit it better for
    its next duty.
  - The spells shown above represent those of a typical burleev.
  - >-
    A burleev's supernatural nimbus burns brightly with cold or heat, making it
    painfully cold or hot to the touch. As a burleev discovers information
    useful to the god of magic, the color of its aura increases in intensity.
    The eldest of these creatures, or those that have travelled far from
    Nethys's realm in the Maelstrom for the longest, often burn like living
    pyres. These burleevs sometimes take sorcerer class levels as their magical
    power grows to match their ever-increasing knowledge. Should it later be
    crushed and reformed as part of its continuing duties, such a burleev
    retains much of its brightness and arcane might.
  - >-
    A spellcaster whose research interests mirror those of a burleev can keep
    such an outsider's attention for days, weeks, or longer so long as the
    mortal continues to make new and exciting discoveries.
  - Burleevs stand around 6 feet tall and weigh roughly 80 pounds.
