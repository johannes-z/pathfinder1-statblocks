Description_Visual: >-
  A massively built satyr-like creature with blackish-brown flesh, this monster
  tightens its grip on its fiery falchion. Small horns jut from its forehead,
  just above its golden eyes. Its hair is long and black, and tied back in a
  braided ponytail. Two, large bat wings protrude from its back.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fiery Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, Xaphan can cause his entire body to erupt in unholy fire
      (the same fires he uses to stoke his furnaces). Creatures within 5 feet of
      or grappling Xaphan take 1d6 points of fire damage and 1d6 points of
      unholy damage each round. There is no save against either effect, but
      resistance to or immunity to fire reduces or negates the fire damage.
  - name: Fiery Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that meets Xaphan's gaze must succeed on a DC 36 Will save or
      be affected as follows: 1st-round: The victim's blood begins to boil,
      dealing 3d6 points of fire damage this round; the victim takes a -2
      circumstance penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, ability and
      skill checks, and saves. A DC 37 Fortitude save halves the fire damage but
      does not negate the penalties. 2nd-round: The victim's blood reaches
      searing temperatures and begins to burn away muscle and flesh; the
      circumstance penalty increases to -4. Smoke rises from the victim's flesh.
      The victim takes 6d6 points of fire damage this round. A DC 37 Fortitude
      save halves the fire damage but does not negate the penalties. 3rd-round:
      The victim's blood erupts into an inferno and explodes from its body
      dealing 12d6 points of fire damage; the victim is stunned for 3 rounds. A
      DC 37 Fortitude save halves the fire damage but the victim is still
      stunned. A successful Will save renders a creature immune to Xaphan's gaze
      for one day. The save DC against the gaze is Charisma-based and the
      Fortitude saves are Constitution-based. Hellstorm: Xaphan's unique weapon,
      Hellstorm, is a Large +4 unholy flaming burst falchion.
Description:
  - >-
    "The Unholy Schism was the beginning of what is to come. Every angelic
    being, every creature of good, and all that oppose Great Lucifer shall be
    consumed in eternal and everlasting fire." Xaphan. Xaphan, the Burning Duke,
    serves Lucifer, leading 15 companies of pit fiends in his service. He is
    completely loyal to the Prince of Darkness and was with Lucifer during the
    Unholy Schism. It was Xaphan that, during the Unholy Schism, attempted to
    set the heavens on fire and consume each and every angel and celestial in a
    blazing inferno. Xaphan was cast down along with Lucifer and the other
    angels for their sacrilege and it is said he helped Lucifer construct Hell
    itself. It is known among scholars that Xaphan was the one that stoked
    Hell's furnaces in Lucifer's great basalt palace, powering the furnaces with
    unholy fire fed by tortured souls. When Asmodeus and the other devils rose
    against Lucifer, Xaphan fought against the uprising and slew many devils,
    even inflicting a near-fatal wound on Asmodeus himself. (The intervention of
    a devil named Mephistopheles saved Asmodeus from ultimate destruction.) In
    the end however, Xaphan was cast out of Hell along with Lucifer and now
    resides in Infernus, a pocket-plane of infernal and everlasting fires
    located somewhere in the great configuration. From Lucifer's great palace,
    Malefacta, Xaphan aids Lucifer in replenishing his forces and increasing his
    power with the ultimate goal being the reclaiming of Hell's Throne. And when
    the battle for Hell does come, Xaphan will be beside Lucifer once again-and
    this time, Mephistopheles won't be able to stop Xaphan from finishing off
    Asmodeus. Xaphan spends his days in Malefacta where he keeps a legion of
    hellstoker devils busy stoking the furnaces and a retinue of barbed devils
    forging weapons for the eventual war to reclaim Hell. Xaphan stands 13 feet
    tall and weighs 800 pounds. Xaphan is a deadly adversary in battle and
    rarely, if ever, backs down from a fight. He is not stupid however, and
    should the battle go against him, he either flees (via greater teleport) or
    summons a troupe of pit fiends to cover his escape. In battle, Xaphan
    unleashes his full fury against a foe; starting with his fiery gaze. Those
    that survive are then witness to his fiery aura power. If within range, he
    likes to grab a foe and hold on while using his fiery aura power. The rest
    of the battle alternates between Xaphan using his great falchion and his
    spells and spell-like abilities. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
