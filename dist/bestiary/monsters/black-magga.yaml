SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath of Madness (Su)
    description: >-
      Black Magga can exhale a cloud of foul-smelling, poisonous breath as a
      standard action once every minute. This cloud of black smoke fills a
      60-foot cone. All creatures in the area take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage
      and become confused for 1d6 rounds (a DC 27 Will save halves the Wisdom
      damage and negates the confusion effect). This is a mind-affecting poison
      effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. This breath weapon cannot be
      used while underwater.
  - name: Transdimensional Tentacles (Su)
    description: >-
      Black Magga's tentacles allow her to see into and infiltrate the Ethereal
      Plane and the Plane of Shadow while she is on the Material Plane. This
      allows her not only to be aware of these planes and the creatures there,
      but also to shift her tentacles through these planes to attack their
      inhabitants. She can even phase her tentacles in and out of existence,
      effectively reaching through walls and other solid barriers to attack foes
      on the other side, provided that area is not warded by a dimensional lock
      or similar effect. She can grapple foes with her tentacles normally, but
      cannot pull grappled foes or objects through planes as her tentacles shift
      between them.
  - name: Warp Dimensions (Su)
    description: >-
      Black Magga's presence distorts the dimensions. Any creature that attempts
      to utilize a teleportation effect while within 300 feet of Black Magga
      must succeed at a DC 21 caster level check or the teleport effect fails.
      If the effect fails, the creature that attempted to create that effect
      must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d6 rounds. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Black Magga is one of the favored servants of Lamashtu and an embodiment of
    the goddess's reign over beasts, monsters, and madness. As an unholy auger
    of her will, Black Magga originally sought to confound the works of the
    civilized world, spread fear of monsters and the wilds, and direct
    Lamashtu's lesser servants in acts of depravity and bloodshed. Black Magga
    arrived in the Storval Deep not long after Karzoug flooded the immense
    quarry, and her presence in the newly formed lake brought much misery and
    dread to the Thassilonians who dwelt on the lake's shores or sailed its
    surface. Karzoug's interest in the region waned quickly, and he never
    bothered to take steps against the monster, prompting many to whisper that
    the runelord made a bargain with Lamashtu to place the monster in the
    Storval Deep, perhaps to hide some sort of great secret he had sunk beneath
    the waters. In any event, it was said that the goddess spoke directly to
    Black Magga, and for many, the words of the monster were equal to the
    commands of Lamashtu herself.
  - >-
    Bearing a head like a plesiosaur atop a thrashing mass of tentacles and
    eyes, Black Magga is an immense creature indeed. Although she is effectively
    immortal until slain, she has spent many of the more than 10,000 years since
    she first came to Varisia in deep hibernation. These slumbers could last for
    a dozen centuries or more at a time, and are punctuated by relatively short
    periods of activity that generally last for only a few decades. These long
    periods of sleep have had something of a debilitating effect on Black Magga,
    for with each century of slumber, she grows weaker. She is now but a shadow
    of her original power. That she remains as powerful as she does today speaks
    volumes to the terrible wrath she must have possessed back during the height
    of Thassilon, before the advent of Earthfall changed everything.
  - The Myth of Black Magga
  - >-
    Fisherfolk and woodsmen who have ventured near the Storval Deep have long
    told tales of a fell monster rising from the depths. Below are a few
    commonly held but mistaken beliefs about Black Magga-although they may well
    have been true during the times of ancient Thassilon, when she was at the
    height of her power.
  - >-
    BLOOD TONGUE: Many who have seen Black Magga and lived can never speak of
    their experiences. Supposedly, when they attempt to tell the tale, black
    blood wells from their throats and into their mouths, choking their words.
    Thus, far fewer claim to have seen Black Magga than actually have.
  - >-
    GOD-PROOF: Black Magga is older than many gods. Divine magic is said to have
    little effect whatsoever on her abominable form. Anyone who cuts Magga's
    black heart from her vile chest and bathes in its putrescent blood will
    likewise become invulnerable to the power of the gods.
  - >-
    STORM BRINGER: Sightings of Black Magga often herald powerful storms and
    hurricanes. It is said that the beast summons these storms to pull victims
    into her watery domain, whereupon she captures them, consumes them, and
    transforms them into monstrous, vermicular horrors.
  - Mothers of Oblivion
  - >-
    Lesser versions of Black Magga are said to dwell in deep lakes in other
    parts of the world. Known as Mothers of Oblivion, these creatures have the
    same basic statistics as Black Magga, except that they have only 10 Hit Dice
    and are Huge rather than Gargantuan.
  - >-
    Monstrous creatures of chaos and madness, the abominable Mothers of Oblivion
    are said to have been created by the goddess of monsters to serve as
    mouthpieces and leaders among her savage minions. Some esoteric
    texts-sacrilegious even to Lamashtu's profane church-claim that the Mothers
    of Oblivion are actually sisters of Lamashtu, subjugated by the goddess,
    robbed of their divinity, and cast down to Golarion as her twisted
    servitors. Whatever their heritage, for uncounted centuries the Mothers of
    Oblivion have been among the favored servants of Lamashtu and throughout
    history have risen to mete out her unholy wrath. Rare in the extreme-and
    despite what the fearful mortal races call them-these monstrosities seem to
    have no ability to reproduce, though some whisper that a select few are
    capable of biting off their own tongues to produce strange, wormlike spawn.
  - >-
    Mothers of Oblivion slink in the darkest, deepest reaches of the world,
    shunning the light of day as well as the gaze of insectlike mortals, who
    would gawk and abandon their pathetic minds at the merest glimpse of such
    unknowable horrors. The deepest reaches of oceans and the oldest lakes serve
    as redoubts for these forsaken queens of madness. From these depths, they
    sate themselves on sea creatures, the offerings of their servants, and the
    occasional unwary victim dragged screaming from the surface. They are
    careful to keep their presence secret from those of the world above. From
    the depths, Mothers of Oblivion form intricate hierarchies of servants and
    go-betweens, reaching their black tentacles through the societies of
    amphibious intermediaries into the demesnes of greater monstrosities and
    larger cities and civilizations alike.
