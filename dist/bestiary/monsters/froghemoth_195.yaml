Description:
  - >-
    Thankfully rare, the froghemoth is one of the deep swampland's most
    ferocious and monstrous predators. Capable of catching and eating dinosaurs
    and even dragons, the froghemoth is a frighteningly effective ambush hunter.
    When lying in wait for prey, the immense creature secrets itself in deep
    marsh pools and mud so that only the top of its eyestalk emerges from the
    surface. The froghemoth's eyes are incredibly keen, but even more impressive
    is the monster's tongue. Like a snake, a froghemoth can "taste" its
    surroundings with extraordinary accuracy. Scholars have long debated the
    origin of this strangely immense predator, arguing that its unusual senses,
    physiology, and resistances make it something more than an animal. Druids
    and other servants of the natural world agree-the froghemoth may act like an
    animal, but it never seems fully "comfortable" in its environs. Perpetually
    illtempered, a froghemoth often seems to kill simply for the sake of
    killing-vomiting up partially digested meals in favor of new prey when it
    encounters such. It's not unheard of to find these strange creatures far
    from their normal habitations, as if the marsh didn't agree with them and
    sent them wandering in search of a new home. Some sages argue that the
    froghemoth isn't from this world at all, and that these wanderings are
    instinctual urges to seek out its true home-a home not represented by the
    strange world in which the beast finds itself trapped. A froghemoth is 22
    feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 16,000 pounds.
