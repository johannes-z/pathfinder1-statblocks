Description_Visual: >-
  A 6-foot tall muscular humanoid with black, rubbery flesh stretches two large,
  leathery wings in place of its arms. Rigid plates of razor-sharp bone jut from
  the wing's outer edge. It perches on long, muscular legs that end in
  three-toed clawed feet. Peers menacingly through golden pupil slits, its wide,
  snarling grimace exposes rows of sharp teeth.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Lasting Wound (Su)
    description: >-
      A wound caused by a sabrewing's wing slash does not heal naturally and
      resists healing spells. A creature attempting to cast a cure spell or heal
      spell on a creature damaged by the sabrewing's wing slash must make a
      successful caster level check (DC 18), or the spell has no effect on the
      injured character. The check DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: See Invisible (Sp)
    description: >-
      A sabrewing can see invisible creatures as if using the see invisibility
      spell. This ability is always active. It can be negated, but the sabrewing
      can restart it as a free action on its next turn.
Description:
  - >-
    Sabrewings are winged humanoids from an unknown outer plane believed to be
    formed of rock and lined with razor-sharp blades of all shapes and sizes.
    These creatures delight in killing those weaker than themselves and often
    travel the outer planes preying on such creatures when they encounter them.
    Evil spellcasters and powerful outsiders (demon lords, arch-devils, lesser
    dukes, and so on) sometimes employ these creatures as assassins because of
    the sabrewing's skill at killing and the creature's desire to do nothing
    else. They are not averse to venturing to the Material Plane to answer an
    evil summons, and often do so, usually with the intent of fulfilling the
    bargain and then killing the summoner (if possible). If called by a powerful
    outsider, a sabrewing will not attempt to kill its summoner, as it's smart
    enough to know when it's outmatched. In such cases, they simply do their job
    and then return to their native plane.
  - >-
    Little is known of their native plane, but one adventurer that has
    supposedly seen this place speaks of huge citadels and fortresses
    constructed of iron and earth surrounded by "forests of steel blades." This
    information has never been substantiated and plane jumpers have been unable
    to locate such a plane. (Perhaps the sabrewings do not actually have their
    own native plane but implanted such false information to detour those that
    would seek them out.) Sabrewings prefer to attack from the air, using speed
    to their advantage while also staying out of the reach of their opponents.
    Before combat, sabrewings usually cast magic weapon or greater magic weapon
    on their wings before engaging in combat so they can use their wings to the
    utmost advantage Multiple sabrewings work in concert with one another to
    bring down foes; one draws an opponent's attention while another swoops in
    from behind and slashes with its deadly wings.
