SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      A land lamprey drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage in
      any round when it begins its turn attached to a victim. Once it has dealt
      4 points of Constitution damage, it detaches and slithers off to digest
      the meal. If its victim dies before the land lamprey's appetite has been
      sated, the land lamprey detaches and seeks a new target.
Description:
  - >-
    Land lampreys can be found in all but the hottest and the coldest
    environments. They prefer the dark and dampness of the subterranean world
    and so are most often encountered there. A land lamprey attacks by attaching
    to a victim and draining blood. An application of fire causes the land
    lamprey to releases its hold and move away from the source of the flame.
