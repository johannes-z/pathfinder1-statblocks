    description: >-
      Burning dervishes can survive on the Elemental Planes of Air or Earth for
      up to 48 hours and on the Elemental Plane of Water for up to 12 hours.
      Failure to return to the Elemental Plane of Fire or Plane of Molten Skies
      after that time deals 1 point of damage per hour to a burning dervish
      until it dies or returns to the Elemental Plane of Fire.
  - name: Flame Form (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, as a standard action, a burning dervish can change
      its form to that of a column of fire. In this form it gains two slam
      attacks. The transformation lasts indefinitely; changing back requires
      another standard action.
Description:
  - >-
    Burning dervishes are the fanatical minions of the Sultan of Efreet (see the
    City of Brass by Necromancer Games). It is said that the burning dervishes
    were once a noble tribe of jann who sold their souls to the Sultan of Efreet
    in exchange for greater power over the Elemental Plane of Fire.
  - >-
    Burning dervishes are virtually indistinguishable from human beings, and
    indeed spend a great amount of time in the Material Plane as agents of the
    Sultan of Efreet, seeking to spread worship of the Sultan as true God of
    Elemental Fire. Other tasks of the burning dervishes are as assassins and
    spies, often leading daring sneak attacks against foes of the Sultan or
    procuring powerful relics for his pleasure.
  - >-
    The burning dervishes have a citadel atop the Great Ziggurat of the City of
    Brass which serves as the central temple to their zealous faith.
  - >-
    It is from this ziggurat that the Sultan communes with his worshippers,
    sending them out on jihads throughout the planes to further his name and
    power.
  - >-
    Burning dervishes usually turn themselves invisible before attacking in an
    attempt to catch their foes by surprise. In combat, the burning dervish
    attacks with its falchion. Depending on the power of its opponent, a burning
    dervish either uses enlarge person on itself or reduce person on its
    opponent. A burning dervish that is outclassed or overmatched either takes
    to the air and flees or attempts to plane shift to escape.
