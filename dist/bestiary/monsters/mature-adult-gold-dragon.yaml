SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A very young or older gold dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form
      three times per day as if using polymorph.
  - name: Detect Gems (Sp)
    description: >-
      A young or older gold dragon can detect gems three times per day. This
      functions as locate object, but can only be used to locate gemstones.
  - name: Fast Flight (Ex)
    description: >-
      A young or older gold dragon is treated as one size category larger when
      determining his fly speed.
  - name: Luck (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can touch a gem, usually one
      embedded in the dragon's hide, and enspell it to bring good luck. As long
      as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature within a given
      radius of it (10 ft. per age category) receives a +1 luck bonus on all
      saving throws. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature,
      only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours
      per age category of the dragon. This ability is the equivalent of a
      2nd-level spell.
  - name: Weakening Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Instead of a cone of fire, a gold dragon can breathe a cone of weakening
      gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1
      point of Strength damage per age category (Will save half).
Description:
  - >-
    Gold dragons are the epitome of virtue. Other metallic dragons revere their
    gold cousins as the agents of divine forces and the paragons of dragonkind,
    and often seek them for advice or aid.
