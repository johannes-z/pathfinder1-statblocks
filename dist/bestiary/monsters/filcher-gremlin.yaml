      restraints it ties using ropes.

      A gremlin can take only other gremlins through the passage and it cannot
      set triggering conditions to allow others to use the passage.
Description:
  - >-
    Gremlin filchers are a force to be reckoned with (when it comes to securing
    your valuables or hiring one to secure someone else's valuables). Their
    small size and high Stealth bonus allows them to easily slip unnoticed into
    most places. Their knack with ropes not only aids them in climbing into hard
    to reach spaces (which could be several given their small size), but also
    allows them to bind any person(s) who would stop them from their task at
    hand. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
