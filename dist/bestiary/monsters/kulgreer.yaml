  - name: Vortex (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a kulgreer can create a powerful, self-contained
      whirlpool within its conical frame. This lasts for 1d6+6 rounds. Huge and
      smaller creatures within 20 feet of the kulgreer must succeed on a DC 34
      Swim check or be yanked into the 30-foot diameter mouth of the whirlpool.
      As the whirlpool spirals through the kulgreer's frame, creatures inside
      are thrashed violently about taking 2d6+18 points of damage each round. A
      successful DC 34 Reflex save or DC 34 Swim check negates the damage for
      that round and allows the trapped creature to escape. The save DCs are
      Strength-based. During the final round of the vortex's duration, any
      creatures still trapped are pulled through the sphere of dim, white light
      in the kulgreer's tapered outlet. Such creatures must succeed on a DC 28
      Fortitude save or take 12d6 points of damage. Those succeeding on their
      save take only half damage and are forcibly ejected from the kulgreer and
      flung 40 feet away. There is a 5% chance that any ejected creature is
      instead sent to a random plane of existence (GM's choice as to which one).
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The kulgreer is a massive, abominable being of the deep sea that creates
    powerful whirlpools inside its funnel-like body. It has a 30 foot long,
    conical body resembling a funnel, beginning in a wide mouth 30 feet in
    diameter, and tapering into a 5 foot diameter outlet of dim, white light.
  - >-
    The kulgreer navigates the depths in a non-cognizant state, pointed-end
    first; its conical body gradually rotates and propels itself forward
    subconsciously, amassing various creatures into its frame as it passes
    through. If awakened from this state, the kulgreer is generally violent. It
    is popular belief that creatures sucked into the kulgreer's funnel-like body
    are teleported to another plane of existence.
  - >-
    Though not consciously aggressive, the circumstances presented through a
    kulgreer's presence inevitably lead to conflict. If provoked, the kulgreer
    typically tramples its opponent in a fit of sudden sentience and conclude in
    the use of its supernatural ability.
