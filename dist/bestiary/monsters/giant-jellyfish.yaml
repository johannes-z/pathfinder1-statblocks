Description:
  - >-
    Unlike its smaller cousins, the giant jellyfish is an active predator that
    seeks out prey. Capable of slithering through narrow cracks, a giant
    jellyfish is a horrifying beast to encounter lurking in the hold of a
    flooded or sunken ship. Other species of these vermin exist, as summarized
    on the following table-these variants often have different types of poison
    or other abilities like translucency or constriction. Species CR Size HD
