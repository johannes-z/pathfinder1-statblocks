      A giant tick drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage in
      any round when it begins its turn attached to a victim. Once it has dealt
      8 points of Constitution damage, it detaches crawls off to digest the

      the giant tick detaches and seeks a new target.

    Giant ticks attack by dropping on their prey from above and stabbing with a
    hollow mouth tube. If subjected to fire or immersed in water, a giant tick
    detaches from its victim. Credit The Giant Tick originally appeared in the
