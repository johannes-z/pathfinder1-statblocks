SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bone Eruption (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a mythic bone devil can expend two uses of mythic
      power to call to the bones of all enemies within a 20-foot-radius burst.
      The bones shudder and twist within each creature, dealing 10d6 points of
      damage and giving each creature the sickened condition for 1d6 rounds. A
      successful DC 20 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the sickened
      condition. If this damage kills a creature, some of its bones tear free
      from its body and fuse with the bone devil, healing it for 1d6 points of
      damage per Hit Die of the slain creature. Creatures immune to critical
      hits are immune to this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Pain Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round as a free action, a bone devil can stimulate extreme pain
      in one creature within its reach. The creature takes a -4 penalty on
      attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks until the start of the
      devil's next turn or until it moves at least 60 feet away from the devil.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sting-injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3
      Str damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Forged from the souls of the first heretics and blasphemers, mythic devils
    have an ancient legacy of torture and using secrets to lure mortal
    diabolists into temptation. A mythic bone devil leads Hell's inquisitors in
    the efforts to root out disobedience among other devils. The authority it
    wields is even more powerful than its formidable magic, and it commands
    respect and fear from even pit fiends and dukes of Hell.
