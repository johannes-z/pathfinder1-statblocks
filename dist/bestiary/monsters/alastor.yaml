Description:
  - >-
    Alastor is thought to be related to, or in fact be, a pit fiend. Legends and
    stories told by the various rulers of Hell say he is in fact the first pit
    fiend; the one from which all others were spawned. Alastor has always
    existed as far as the arch-devils know; none can remember a time before he
    was there. Though stories say he was thrown down from Heaven when Lucifer
    and his court were cast down, Lucifer himself has denied such tales. Alastor
    serves as Hell's Executioner. He makes his lair deep within the confines of
    Asmodeus's palace on the nethermost circle of Hell. He is loyal to none but
    Asmodeus, and his loyalty has never been in question. Those who have
    questioned his loyalty to Hell's arch ruler usually find themselves on the
    wrong end of his axe. Alastor takes great pride in his job and his blade
    never falters. When tasked with the execution of a traitor, prisoner, or
    simply someone Asmodeus has grown weary of, Alastor does the job, neat and
    clean every time. A mortal killed by his hands finds Hell to be a rather
    pleasant place compared to the eternal torture most endure once they fall to
    Alastor's axe. Alastor resembles a pit fiend in appearance and stands 16
    feet tall. He weighs roughly 1,000 pounds. Alastor rarely engages in combat;
    not because he cannot, but because most such encounters are trivial to him
    and he becomes bored with it very easily. If pressed into battle, he uses
    his power word kill ability immediately against his closest opponent. Next,
    he unleashes a meteor storm, followed by a fireball, before finishing his
    spell-like abilities with a mass hold monster against as many foes as
    possible. Next he wades into battle with Grimfang and his array of natural
    attacks. When he finally becomes bored with the battle, he seeks to quickly
    end it by calling in other devils to finish off any remaining opponents.
    Should Alastor be in danger at any time, he uses his greater teleport to
    escape, remembering his foes for a later time, which he will invariably hunt
    down with a retinue of pit fiends and kill. Copyright Notice Author Scott
