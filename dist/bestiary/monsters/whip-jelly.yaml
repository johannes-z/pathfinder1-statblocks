    description: >-
      A whip jelly secretes a deadly acid that quickly dissolves organic matter
      but does not harm metal or stone. Any melee hit deals acid damage.
      Non-metal armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately
      unless it succeeds on a DC 14 Reflex save. A wooden weapon that strikes a
      whip jelly dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 14 Reflex
      save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A whip jelly, like most oozes, is a mindless hunter that spends its time
    prowling the subterranean world for food. Rarely encountered near the
    surface, the deeper one goes in the Under Realms, the more likely an
    encounter with one of these creatures is to occur.
  - >-
    Whip jellies lair in darkened dry areas. They have a natural disdain for
    water (though it does not harm them in any way). Their lairs contain the
    remains of past meals and possibly any treasure or belongings (of a metallic
    nature) that the meal happened to be carrying at the time of its demise.
  - >-
    A whip jelly looks like a bluish-gray quivering pile of goo with four long
    slimy tendrils jutting from its form. The creature's body is rather thick
    and resilient (hence the natural armor bonus, usually unheard of for ooze
    creatures). Its tendrils are a bit darker in color than its main body.
  - Shoots of dark blue and black through its body give the appearance of veins.
  - >-
    A whip jelly attacks by whipping and striking its foes with its long slimy
    tentacles. A slain creature is slowly digested by the jelly over a period of
    days or weeks (ultimately depending on how hungry the creature is at the
    time).
