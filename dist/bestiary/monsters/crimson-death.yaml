Description_Visual: >-
  Seemingly made of red vapor, the crimson mist is an outstanding stealth
  hunter. The crimson death is vaguely humanoid in appearance, with arms, torso
  and a head being discernible. The creature has no distinct facial features,
  other than 2 glowing points where eyes should be.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Engulf (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a crimson death strikes a target with one of its tentacles, it can
      immediately make an engulf attack, including moving into the opponent's
      square. Targeted creatures can make attacks of opportunity against the
      crimson death, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw
      against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity
      can attempt a Reflex (DC 18) save to avoid being engulfed-on a success,
      they are pushed back or aside (target's choice) as the crimson death moves
      forward. Engulfed opponents gain the pinned condition, are in danger of
      suffocating, are trapped within the crimson death's body until they are no
      longer pinned, and suffer 1d6 points of damage and 1d6 points of
      Constitution damage every round. A victim reduced to 0 Constitution dies.
      The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Susceptibility (Ex)
    description: >-
      After draining its victim's Constitution, the crimson death, sated from
      its feeding, moves at half its normal speed, loses its racial bonus to
      Stealth checks (because it flushes crimson, hence the name), and suffers a
      -4 circumstance penalty to AC. These effects last for 1 hour.
Description:
  - >-
    A crimson death attacks from ambush, usually hiding in naturally occurring
    fog and waiting for potential prey to wander close. Often times, a crimson
    death uses sound (imitating cries for help, for example) in an attempt to
    lure a victim into its grasp.
  - A crimson death can understand Aklo, although it does not speak.
