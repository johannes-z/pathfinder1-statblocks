  clutches a translucent spear-like pole.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Impale Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      An impaled spirit carries an incorporeal version of the spike that caused
      its death, a 10-foot long spear-like instrument. On a successful melee
      attack with this spike, the target must succeed on a DC 21 Will save or
      have its soul impaled on the ghostly implement. A ghostly duplicate of the
      impaling instrument and its victim now impaled on the spike appear planted
      in the ground within 5 feet of the target. A thin silvery cord connects
      the translucent, impaled creature with its corporeal self. Another thin
      silvery cord connects the ghostly impalement back to the impaled spirit.
      This attack deals 1d6 points of Constitution drain initially and 1 point
      of Constitution drain each round thereafter until the creature dies or is
      freed. Each round an impaled victim takes Constitution drain, the impaled
      spirit connected to it gains 5 temporary hit points. An impaled creature
      cannot move more than 10 feet from the spot where its soul is impaled, and
      takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, checks, and saves from the pain
      until freed. An impaled creature can be freed if the ghostly spike holding
      the victim is destroyed or pulled from the ground. The ghostly spike is AC
      20, hp 20, hardness 10. Corporeal creatures cannot pull the spike from the
      ground but can attack it with magic weapons. Normal weapons have no
      effect. Ethereal creatures can attack the spike with normal weapons or
      remove it from the ground with a successful DC 21 Strength check. A heal,
      holy word, wish, or miracle spell destroys the ghostly spike instantly.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.

    description: >-
      An impaled spirit notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet,
      just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of an impaled spirit,
      unless a master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check.
Description:
  - >-
    Shattered souls are the ghostly spirits of living beings executed through
    brutal torture: impalement, disembowelment, or worse. Their souls having not
    entirely departed the Material Plane, they have risen to seek vengeance on
    the living, particularly clerics or other divine spellcasters whom they
    blame for having forsaken them and allowed them to die in such a ghastly
    manner.
  - >-
    Impaled spirits are the ghostly remains of living beings executed through
    impalement; a brutally slow and extremely painful form of execution.
  - >-
    Impaled spirits are most often encountered above ground in or near the place
    of their execution; rarely are they found anywhere else. They are completely
    oblivious to everything but pain, and seek to inflict as much on a living
    creature as is inhumanly possible. They hold no memories of their former
    life, save the pain and suffering they endured at their time of execution.
  - >-
    Am impaled spirit appears as a translucent humanoid floating a few feet
    above the ground carrying a 10-foot long ghostly spike or spear. It makes no
    noise, though it almost seems to be trying to cry out in agony; a silent
    reminder of the pain endured as the impalement spike pierced its internal
    organs while it was dying. Its eyes are glossy white.
  - >-
    An impaled spirit hates all living creatures and attacks any it encounters.
    Though it can use its incorporeal touch attack, it prefers to attack with
    its incorporeal spike, attempting to impale its foes. An impaled creature is
    left to die an agonizing death. The impaled spirit turns its attention to
    another foe, attempting to repeat the process. Much like other shattered
    souls, an impaled spirit hates clerics and attacks them first.
