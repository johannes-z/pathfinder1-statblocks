Description:
  - >-
    A typical antelope stands a bit less than 3 feet at the shoulder, measures 4
    feet in length, and weighs 60 pounds. In some species, both males and
    females have horns; in others, only males. Females that lack horns have the
    same statistics but lack an effective attack.
  - >-
    Antelopes graze in large herds, ever on the watch for predators. Even the
    hint of a threat can send the whole herd springing away toward safer
    pastures. Antelopes rarely fight except among themselves during mating
    season or when cornered by a predator.
  - >-
    The statistics presented above work well not only for numerous species of
    antelope, but also for smaller-sized, deerlike herbivores found throughout
    the world.
  - >-
    Of course, not all antelopes are Small. You can generate statistics for
    larger antelope species, such as elands or kudus, by advancing the antelope
    presented above by 2 Hit Dice and increasing its size category to Medium.
    All antelopes of this size are CR 1 creatures.
