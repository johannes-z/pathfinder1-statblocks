Description:
  - >-
    The grimstalker or banaan (as they prefer to call themselves) is a fey
    creature that does not share the beauty and goodness of its kin. Whereas
    other fey creatures have come to represent the beautiful or mischievous side
    of nature, the grimstalker most certainly reflects nature at its worst.
  - They are dark creatures, their hearts tainted with the foulest of evil.
  - >-
    Unfortunate souls that wander into a forest guarded by grimstalkers are
    never seen again-except for their skulls, which the grimstalkers hang from
    the trees as a warning to those that would dare trespass into their domain.
  - >-
    Long thought to be a form of intelligent plant because of their many
    plant-like features, grimstalkers skulk among the trees of the darkest
    forests. Even among sylvan communities of elves the grimstalkers are
    legendary as natural born assassins.
  - >-
    Grimstalkers sometimes work with other evil fey such as redcaps (see their
    entry in this book); though such alliances are short and very rare,
    especially with the malevolent and untrustworthy redcap.
  - >-
    It is rumored that powerful evil druids often summon grimstalkers for
    nefarious purposes.
  - >-
    Grimstalkers strike from ambush if possible, hiding among the trees and
    dropping on interlopers into their forest. A troupe of grimstalkers that set
    up an ambush make ample use of the terrain, as well as nets woven from
    living vines, snares, and pit traps. Grimstalkers also employ trained plant
    creatures such as assassin vines and scythe trees. In melee they are capable
    of fighting with their claws or with weapons-their favorite weapons being a
    sort of spiked quarterstaff and longbows knocked with poisoned arrows.
