SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fleshwarping (Su)
    description: >-
      A warped one's body constantly shifts and changes as raw Abyssal energies
      course through it, reshaping and rebuilding it in minor but hideous ways.
      Once a warped one enters combat, these growing energies begin to alter its
      statistics in small ways. At the start of a warped one's turn, roll on the
      following table to see what additional effect its fleshwarping has on it
      for that round-all of the following mutations have a duration of 1 round
      unless otherwise noted. d8 Result 1 Infusion of Chaos: The warped one's
      body ripples and shifts rapidly as it grows and absorbs fingers, tendrils,
      sightless eyes, toothless mouths, tumors, and other mostly useless organs
      out of its body. The warped one gains DR 10/lawful. 2 Enhanced
      Musculature: The warped one grows much more muscular. It gains a +2
      enhancement bonus on melee attack rolls, melee weapon damage, CMB checks,
      Strength-based checks, and to its CMD. 3 Lean and Swift: The warped one
      grows lean and agile, with longer legs and additional joints in its limbs.
      It gains a +2 dodge bonus to its AC, a +2 enhancement bonus on Reflex
      saves, and its speed increases by 10 feet. 4 Prismatic Scales:
      Multicolored scales grow from the warped one's flesh. It gains resistance
      to acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10. 5 Razor-Sharp Talons: The warped one's
      claws grow additional, sharper talons. Its claw attacks gain bleed 1d6. 6
      Multiple Eyes: The warped one grows additional eyes and other sensory
      organs. It gains a +8 bonus on Perception checks and gains all-around
      vision. 7 Accelerated Metabolism: The warped one sheds its claws and teeth
      and immediately grows new ones, its wounds heal, and its colors grow
      brighter. It gains a +2 enhancement bonus on Fortitude saves and
      immediately heals 3d8+10 points of damage (if it's currently unwounded, it
      gains these hit points as temporary hit points that last for 1 hour or
      until depleted). 8 Armor Plating: The warped one grows a thick hide and
      dark scaly plates granting it DR 5/, and its natural armor bonus increases
      by +4.
  - name: Insanity (Ex)
    description: >-
      A warped one's mind is completely unhinged, a raw chaos of madness. It
      uses its Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of its Wisdom modifier,
      and it is immune to mind-affecting effects. Any attempt to contact a
      warped one telepathically (including using spells like detect thoughts)
      produces a backlash effect, dealing 1d4 points of Charisma damage to the
      one attempting the contact. A DC 17 Will save negates this effect. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Unstable Summoning (Sp)
    description: >-
      A warped one can rend the boundaries between worlds to summon creatures to
      aid it in combat, but it has little control over what sorts of monsters or
      demons respond to its summonings. When a warped one uses its unstable
      summoning, there's a 50% chance that a creature (or a group of creatures)
      arrives to aid the warped one. Creatures summoned in this way are immune
      to that particular warped one's warp field. To determine the nature of the
      summoned aid, roll on the table below. This is a 5th-level spell effect.
      d8 Result 1 1d4+1 mephits (determine type randomly) 2 1d4+1 Medium
      elementals (determine type randomly) 3 1d3 salamanders 4 1d3 Large
      elementals (determine type randomly) 5 1d3 babaus 6 1 shadow demon 7 1
      succubus 8 1
  - name: warped one  Warp Field (Su)
    description: >-
      A warped one exudes a field of mental and physical entropic energy to a
      radius of 30 feet that twists and warps the minds and bodies of all other
      living creatures. Creatures who begin their turn inside of a warp field
      must succeed at a DC 17 Will save. Failure indicates that the creature is
      confused for 1 round and suffers one mutation from the table below. These
      mutations emerge swiftly and painfully, causing the victim to become
      sickened for 1 round and to gain one random mutation from the following
      table for 1 round. Once a creature succeeds at its saving throw against a
      warp field, it is immune to further effects from that specific warped
      one's warp field for 24 hours. This is a polymorph effect. The save DCs
      are Charisma-based. d8 Result 1 Club Foot: One of your feet becomes badly
      deformed. Rreduce your speed by 10 feet. 2 Cataracts: Your eyes film over
      with cataracts. You are blinded. 3 Demonic Horns: You grow several bony
      horns from your skull. You must succeed at a DC 17 Reflex save or any
      headband or hat you wear becomes broken. 4 Boneless Mass: You fall prone
      and your movement rate is reduced to 0 feet. You must succeed at a DC 17
      Fortitude save to avoid being stunned for 1 round. 5 Twisted Hands: Your
      hands twist and deform. You drop all held objects and worn rings and
      cannot use your hands to make attacks or cast spells for 1 round. 6
      Twisted Visage: Your face deforms into a hideous mockery. You cannot speak
      or cast spells with verbal components. 7 Malnourished: You become
      skeletally thin. All worn items (save boots, head, and headband items)
      drop from your body, and you must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save to
      avoid being entangled in your gear. When you return to your normal shape 1
      round later, dropped items remain on the ground in your square. 8 Obesity:
      You become monstrously obese. Your land speed is reduced to 5 feet. In
      addition, if you fail a DC 17 Reflex save, any items you have equipped in
      the armor, belt, body, chest, neck, shoulders, or wrist slots become
      broken.
Description:
  - >-
    Demons form from the interaction of sinful human souls upon the fecundity of
    the Abyss itself, but this is not the only way the demonic plane creates
    life. In certain parts of this blasphemous realm, non-sinful souls or even
    living humanoids can be overwhelmed and transformed into demon-like
    creatures. So powerful are the energies corrupting and warping these
    humanoids that chaotic force continues to leak from their creations and
    continuously affect the creatures' flesh-forever twisting and mutating them
    in endless agony. These poor victims have been transformed into warped ones.
  - >-
    No two warped ones look exactly alike, although they all share certain
    common features. They always appear as two to four demonic humanoids
    awkwardly fused together into a single human-sized monstrosity. While they
    can have several limbs, they always have four that sport particularly sharp
    talons. Once a warped one enters combat, the excitement of imminent
    bloodshed (both that of its victims and of itself ) causes the entropic
    energies within it to change and mutate. A fight against a warped one is a
    harrowing experience, for not only do the warped one's physical traits
    change continuously, these mutations affect and cripple those nearby in
    devastating ways.
  - >-
    As using a warped one in combat adds lots of additional dice rolls to
    encounters, you may want to "synchronize" their fleshwarping and warp-field
    abilities when using multiple warped ones in battles, so each round they all
    exhibit the same trait and their warp fields all have the same effect.
  - A warped one is 7 feet tall and weighs 350 pounds.
