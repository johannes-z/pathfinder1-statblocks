Description:
  - >-
    As swift and agile as it is deadly, the deinonychus is a pack hunter,
    running with several of its kind to take down prey and rip it apart with
    their gutting talons. You can apply the young simple template to create
    statistics for smaller, more agile velociraptors. Conversely, you can either
    increase the deinonychus to Large size and its Hit Dice to 8 or simply apply
    the giant and advanced simple templates to create a formidable megaraptor.
