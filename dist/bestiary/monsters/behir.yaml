SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Grab (Ex)
    description: >-
      A behir's grab attack works against creatures of any size category. It can
      constrict the same round it establishes a hold. On any round thereafter
      that it maintains its hold, the behir can choose to rake the grappled
      target or swallow it whole.
Description:
  - >-
    Temperamental and avaricious, the behir spends most of its time slithering
    through the sandy hills and desert cliffs that make up its territory,
    preying upon all creatures who dare to enter its hunting grounds. The
    creature's six pairs of powerful, clawed legs remain folded against its
    sides most of the time, only extending in combat to grapple foes or carry
    the behir forward in a terrifying, low-slung gallop, or else when climbing
    the sheer cliff faces common to behir lairs. The average behir is 40 feet
    long and weighs 4,000 pounds. In addition to the two prominent horns on its
    head, many have additional decorative spines at regular intervals along the
    central ridges of their backs. While territorial and bestial in its fury,
    the behir is neither stupid nor necessarily evil, though its
    selfcenteredness and tendency to lay claim to everything visible from its
    high lairs frequently bring it into conf lict with other races. As such, a
    behir can often be bought off or reasoned with by those brave negotiators
    willing to get close enough to make their pitch. In these cases, a behir's
    tendency to attack first and ask questions later (or not at all) means that
    anyone seeking to strike a deal must bring powerful incentives and impress
    the behir immediately with his offer. It's often been speculated that behirs
    are somehow related to blue dragons, but the exact nature of this link
    remains unknown. Most dragons deny any such association and look down on the
    behir for its relative lack of intelligence-a snubbing that infuriates the
    already short-tempered behir. Thanks to this casual disparagement, many
    behirs carry deep grudges against dragons, and attack without pause any who
    cross into their territories.
