Description_Visual: >-
  Winglessly flying forth, a monstrously sized anaconda-like serpent descends
  from the sky. Its 30-foot body is nearly two-feet thick and covered in muddy
  brown scales with strange patterns and symbols on its dorsal side. Large
  glowing yellow orbs set in its wide, triangular head emit a haunting glare and
  arching its tail aggressively, it exposes a vicious-looking barbed stinger.

    description: >-
      Three times per day, a sepia snake can fire a line of webbing to a range
      of 20 feet. A creature caught in the path can make a successful DC 20
      Reflex save to avoid the web. On a failed save, the opponent is wrapped in
      the snake's webbing. When a foe is completely covered in webbing, it must
      make a successful DC 20 Fortitude save or be placed in a state of
      suspended animation as per the sepia snake sigil spell for 1d4+12 days.
      The save DCs are Constitution-based. In one round, the sepia snake can
      spit enough webbing to cover one Medium or smaller creature. For each size
      category larger than Medium, the snake must fire another line of webbing
      to completely encase an opponent. Victims hit by the webbing, but not
      completely covered, can break free in one round by making a successful DC
      24 Strength check or DC 20 Escape Artist check. Each 5-foot section of
      webbing has 10 hit points. The check DCs are Constitution-based and the
      Strength check includes a +4 racial bonus. A foe completely wrapped cannot
      break the webs and must rely on others to get free.
  - name: Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      The gaze of a sepia snake crushes the will of an opponent and induces
      despair if it fails a DC 20 Will save. On a failed save, the opponent
      suffers a -4 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and ability and
      skill checks. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Tail Sting-Injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds;
      effect paralysis and 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Wizards and other sages well-versed in arcane lore agree that the sepia
    snake was the inspiration for the spell sepia snake sigil. The similarities
    between the creature and the spell are simply too great to be coincidental.
  - >-
    Though a sepia snake can be found just about anywhere, it usually makes its
    lair deep underground in abandoned mines, dungeons, or subterranean caverns.
    It has been said that to look into the eyes of the sepia snake is to look
    into one's own doom.
  - >-
    A sepia snake begins combat by using its gaze on what it believes to be its
    most dangerous opponents so it can safely deal with them later.
  - >-
    In melee a sepia snake tries to avoid direct combat, and will rely on its
    Flyby Attack feat to keep it out of danger. A sepia snake can emit a brown,
    web-like substance from its throat that immobilizes its opponent. Held,
    cocooned, or otherwise incapacitated foes are poisoned to soften them up for
    consumption.
