  and salamander. Its smooth skin erupts here and there with hideous lesions,

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Tongue (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Stygian spawn's tongue is a primary attack with a reach equal to twice
      the spawn's normal reach. A Stygian spawn's tongue is covered in sharpened
      barbs and any attempt to break free of a grapple with it, whether
      successful or not, deals an extra 1d6 points of piercing damage to the
      target. A Stygian spawn does not gain the grappled condition while using
      its tongue in this manner.
Description:
  - >-
    A Stygian spawn is a creature that lurks along the banks of the River Styx.
    Unlike amphibians on the Material Plane, Stygian spawn spend very little
    time in the water. Most of the time, these vile creatures reside deep in the
    mud in a self-induced state of hibernation. Stygian spawns only eat
    creatures not native to the lower planes; such creatures are the spawns'
    only source of food. Travelers in the realms of the lower planes quickly
    learn to fear the horrid Stygian spawn, which awaken from their hibernation
    and erupt from the mud of the River Styx with surprising speed. A Stygian
    spawn summoned to another plane is dangerous to all life there, since it can
    eat any organic substance that fits in its mouth. Occasionally, Stygian
    spawn are awakened on purpose by bored charonadaemons who hunt the creatures
    for sport. Stygian spawn tadpoles are harmless, and resemble pale, boneless
    fish that swim mindlessly in the River Styx. These tadpoles are a frequent
    source of food for hungry hydrodaemons.
  - A fully-grown Stygian spawn is 20 feet long and weigh 3,000 pounds.
  - >-
    Since their only source of food-extraplanar travelers-are so rare, Stygian
    spawn attack with their barbed tongue, trying to grapple and swallow their
    opponents as quickly as possible. In extended combats, however, a Stygian
    spawn blasts at opponents with its breath weapon.
