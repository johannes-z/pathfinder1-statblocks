    description: >-
      By collecting water in its mouth, a giant archerfish can fire a powerful
      jet of water as a standard action. The attack has a range of 30 feet with
      no range increment. If the giant archerfish scores a hit, the target is
      knocked prone.
Description:
  - >-
    Giant archerfish are peaceful, surface-dwelling aquatic animals that shoot a
    powerful stream of water at land- or airborne creatures in an attempt to
    fell it into the giant archer's body of water where the fish quickly swims
    in and devours it. These creatures exist mainly on a diet of insects and
    small animals such as birds, shrimp, worms, and snails though some of the
    larger ones occasionally target small humanoids as prey. Giant archerfish
    are typically solitary creatures and rarely travel in schools. Schools of
    these fish, when encountered, do not work in concert with one another; every
    fish is on its own.
  - >-
    Giant archerfish are three feet long and have silver-colored bodies with
    vertical black stripes that begin just behind the head and fade as they near
    the tail. Their eyes are either cloudy blue or silver and its fins are
    slightly darker than its body. Some species of giant archerfish are
    yellowishgray with dark-colored eyes, but all have the vertical black
    stripes. Giant archerfish can grow to be five feet long.
  - >-
    The giant archerfish spends most of its time near the surface where it uses
    its water spray to dislodge potential prey from their land-based perch and
    knock them into the water. The archerfish then darts in and bites. This
    fish's eyes are formed in such a way that allows it to see perfectly into
    the air or on land from a depth of six feet without any distortion or
    refraction.
