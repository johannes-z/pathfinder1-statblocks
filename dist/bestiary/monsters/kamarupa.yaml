SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures hit by a kamarupa's incorporeal touch must make a DC 17 Fort
      save or die as the touch stops the heart. Even if the save is successful,
      the creature suffers 2d6 points of damage as the kamarupa clutches its
      heart. Often, a creature surviving a touch attack acquires a harmless
      trait or characteristic for 2d4 months. Traits can be a white streak of
      hair, a nervous twitch, pale complexion or dilated eyes. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Frightful Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      A kamarupa's glance creates dread in living beings, at a range of up to 30
      feet. Creatures meeting the gaze must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or
      become panicked for 3d4 rounds. Even if successful, the subject becomes
      shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Nightmare (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per night, a kamarupa places a nightmare on one creature it has
      encountered. They prefer to send the nightmare to particularly powerful
      opponents or priests night after night until the opponent dies. The target
      can resist the attack with a DC 17 Will save. A creature that drops any
      possession (while panicked) near the kamarupa suffers a -4 penalty to the
      save until the item is recovered. A creature that successfully saves is
      immune to the nightmare for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Powerless in Sunlight (Ex)
    description: >-
      Kamarupas are powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell)
      and fl ee before it. A kamarupa caught in sunlight cannot attack and can
      take only a single move action each round. Kamarupas lose one-third of
      their hit points each round spent in direct sunlight.
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Animals sense the kamarupa's unnatural presence at 30 feet. They panic if
      forced to get closer and remain panicked while within range.
Description:
  - >-
    A kamarupa appears as a mockery of its former fleshbound life. Its hollow
    eyes and mouth are black voids, and its facial features twist and stretch
    into a nightmarish appearance. Kamarupa are the distorted souls of evil
    priests betrayed and sacrificed to their deity.
  - >-
    Kamarupas are highly intelligent and communicate in voices similar to the
    screaming wind. They hate life and light. A kamarupa is roughly human-sized
    and weightless. A kamarupa attacks with its heart-stopping touch. It uses
    its incorporeal nature to move through walls, ceilings and floors to attack.
