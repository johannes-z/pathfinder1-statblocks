      A ghirru can assume the shape of a Large flame-spawned dire wolf. A
      flame-spawned dire wolf is an 8 HD dire wolf with the following abilities:
      immunity to fire, vulnerability to cold, deals 1d6 points of fire damage
      with its bite attack. Genie-kin (Ex) For all race-related effects (such as
      a ranger's favored enemy), a ghirru is considered a genie even though its
      type is undead.
Description:
  - >-
    Ghirru are undead efreet, returned to the land of the living by efreeti
    necromancers through foul and dark magic. A ghirru closely resembles its
    original efreeti form, save its flesh is charred and hangs loosely about it,
    sometimes falling off in pieces as the creature moves.
  - >-
    Ghirru haunt cemeteries, ruins, ancient temples to the efreet gods, and
    other such places. Legend speaks of a large lair of these creatures led by a
    sorcerer of vast power hidden somewhere beneath the fabled City of Brass.
    None have found this secret lair thus far. And few go looking for it.
  - >-
    Ghirru have a taste for genie flesh, particularly djinn and marid, though
    the latter is often hard to come by on the Plane of Fire. When hunting on
    the Material Plane, ghirru are found in warmer lands, often near extinct
    volcanoes and other such warm places.
  - >-
    A ghirru stands 12 feet tall and weighs around 1,500 pounds. Its skin is
    charred and burned, though in a few places the original crimson color shines
    through. Its body constantly emanates small wisps of smoke, and the smell of
    burnt flesh lingers in the air around the creature.
  - >-
    A ghirru attacks with its claws and bite, attempting to grab its prey and
    set it on fire. A grappled creature is held and incinerated, then promptly
    devoured by the ghirru.
