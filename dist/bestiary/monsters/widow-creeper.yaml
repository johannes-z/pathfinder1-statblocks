  This creature resembles a monstrous spider about twice the size of a human
  constructed of weeds, vines, and leaves. Two writhing tentacles sprout from
  its spider-like body, each ending in a sharpened point. An hourglass-shaped
  pattern of leaves and brush can be seen on its back.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Control Plants (Su)
    description: A widow creeper can use control plants, as the spell (caster level 17th).
  - name: Entangle (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, up to a number of times per day equal to its
      Constitution modifier (minimum 1), a widow creeper can fire a mass of
      sticky, clinging vines and weeds to a range of 60 feet at a single target.
      This requires the widow creeper to succeed on a ranged touch attack with a
      +11 bonus to hit. A creature hit by the vines is entangled. An entangled
      creature can break free and move half its normal speed by using a
      full-round action to make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength
      check. The check DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Fluid Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      A widow creeper can suck brain fluids from a living creature by making a
      successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains brain fluid,
      dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage and 1 point of Intelligence
      damage each round that it maintains the hold.
  - name: Improved Woodland Stride (Su)
    description: >-
      A widow creeper can move through any sort of undergrowth (natural thorns,
      briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its normal speed without
      taking damage or suffering other impairment. This includes thorns, briars,
      and overgrown areas that are magically manipulated to impede motion.
  - name: Plantsense (Ex)
    description: >-
      A widow creeper can automatically pinpoint the location of anything within
      120 feet that is in contact with vegetation.
Description:
  - >-
    Widow creepers are spider-like plant creatures that make their lairs deep in
    tangled forests. They constantly harass woodsmen, foresters, and denizens of
    the forests from their weed-like webs which they spin high in the tree tops.
    Widow creepers spend much of their time in their nests, venturing forth only
    to feed, and even then, they rarely venture far from their lair. They prefer
    to lure potential prey to them by rustling nearby leaves or underbrush. A
    widow creeper sustains itself on a diet of brain fluid and blood. Corpses
    drained of blood and fluids are left where they fall; the widow creeper does
    not devour the flesh, bones, or muscle of its prey. A widow creeper is 8
    feet tall and looks like a giant black widow formed from leaves, weeds, and
    tangled brush. It is dark greenish-brown in color. Two long, sinewy
    vine-like tentacles protrude from its body and aid the creature in capturing
    and securing its prey. A widow creeper utters no sounds and cannot speak any
    known languages. Widow creepers are ambush hunters, waiting in their
    vine-like webs for a creature to pass nearby. When a potential meal comes
    close to its nest the widow creeper leaps from hiding and attacks. It uses
    its tentacles to either slash its foe or grapple it. Against a grappled foe,
    a widow creeper stabs one of its long tentacles into the opponent's head and
    attempts to drain its brain fluids. While grappling a foe, the widow creeper
    uses its control plants and entangle attacks to keep any other opponents at
    bay. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
