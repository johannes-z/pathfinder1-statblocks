SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Grave Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      The claws of a necro-phantom deal 1d4 points of Constitution damage (DC 14
      Will save negates). A successful critical hit causes 1d4 points of
      Constitution damage and 1 point of Constitution drain (instead of double
      Constitution damage). With each successful attack, a necro-phantom gains 5
      temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Resist the Grave (Ex)
    description: >-
      A necro-phantom gains a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against spells
      and spell-like abilities from the school of Necromancy.
  - name: Sense Necromancy (Su)
    description: >-
      A necro-phantom can attempt a Spellcraft check to identify a spell being
      cast within a 60- foot radius (DC 15 + spell level). The necro-phantom
      gains a +4 racial bonus on its check if the spell is from the school of
      Necromancy.
Description:
  - >-
    A creature that dies (either of its own accord or one that is killed) in an
    area poisoned by necromantic magic sometimes returns to the land of the
    living as a necro-phantom, an evil undead creature with a hatred for all
    things living, especially those who dabble in necromancy. Necro-phantoms are
    found haunting cemeteries, temples, mausoleums, and any other place
    necromantic magic is or was once prevalent. Often more than one
    necro-phantom is encountered; some strange effect of the magic that created
    them seems to draw these creatures to one another.
  - >-
    A necro-phantom appears as a rotting desiccated corpse still dressed in the
    clothing it wore in life (though it is now tattered and worn). Its nails are
    filthy and long and its teeth are broken. Each necro-phantom varies in
    height from 5 feet to almost 7 feet tall and weighs anywhere from 100 pounds
    to over 200 pounds. Necro-phantoms can speak Common, but seldom bother
    unless they are cursing a necromancy-wielding opponent.
  - >-
    Necro-phantoms attack their opponents by raking and slashing with their
    claws. A necro-phantom engaged in battle with a spellcaster uses its sense
    magic ability to attempt to identify any spell being cast. If it detects a
    necromancy spell, it focuses its attention on that spellcaster, ignoring all
    other opponents until the necromancy-wielding caster flees or is dead. If
    one necro-phantom out of a group successfully identifies a necromancy spell,
    it signals to the others of its kind and all move to attack the spellcaster.
