SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A royal naga can use this ability to take one of five specific humanoid
      forms. Each of these forms has a unique appearance (such as a female dwarf
      with red hair, an elderly male human, and so on) and the naga can only use
      this ability to assume these five forms. The naga can still use its dual
      gaze in humanoid form.
  - name: Dual Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      A royal naga has a piercing stare capable of crippling those that meet its
      gazes. The creature has two gaze attacks and can switch between them as a
      move action. One gaze causes those that succumb to it to become
      permanently blinded, while the other causes those that succumb to be
      permanently deafened. A DC 21 Fortitude save negates the effects of either
      gaze; otherwise, the effects are permanent until cured. Royal nagas
      generally prefer to keep their deafening gaze active, switching to the
      blindness gaze once combat begins and some of their foes have already been
      deafened, since those who are blinded can no longer be harmed by gaze
      attacks. The save DC is Charisma-based. Spells A royal naga casts spells
      as a 9th-level sorcerer.
Description:
  - >-
    Regal and proud, royal nagas haunt lost cities and forgotten kingdoms,
    guarding ancient treasures for their own inscrutable reasons. A royal naga's
    five faces are sharp and fierce, taking on a terrifying countenance when it
    becomes angered. Bespeaking their innate pride and vanity, royal nagas adorn
    their serpentine hoods and faces with elaborate and valuable piercings,
    crowns, or other precious accessories. Royal nagas are 18 feet long, and
    often weigh more than 750 pounds.
  - >-
    Royal nagas tend to be stern in nature and commanding in speech. Although
    naturally sociable, they are distrustful of strangers and seem to have great
    difficulty speaking to other creatures as equals.
