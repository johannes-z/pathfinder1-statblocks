Description_Visual: >-
  This skull is as large as an ogre and surrounded by buzzing flies. Its bat
  wings are too small to actually carry it, yet it moves through the air as
  easily as a bird. It is surrounded by the stink of rotting meat, spice, and
  perfume.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Constitution Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures that are hit by the Maw's bite must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude
      save or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain. On each successful attack,
      the herald gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature slain by the Maw (including those that die from any of its
      special attacks or disease) rises 1 round later as a bloody skeleton loyal
      to the herald.
  - name: Desecrate (Sp)
    description: >-
      The bonuses from the Maw's constant desecrate spell-like ability (always
      centered on it) are calculated into the stats above.
  - name: Devour Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      By using its swallow whole ability, the herald can deal 12d6+18 points of
      damage to a swallowed creature as if using a slay living spell. A DC 21
      Fortitude save reduces this damage to 3d6+18. A swallowed creature must
      make this save every round on the herald's turn. The soul of a creature
      slain by this attack becomes trapped within the herald's skull (the
      creature's body is regurgitated immediately as a mangled wreck of
      shattered bone and chewed meat). The creature cannot be brought back to
      life until the herald's destruction (or a spell deflection-see below)
      releases its soul. The Maw can hold only one soul at a time. The trapped
      essence provides the Maw with fast healing 20, lasting 1 round for every
      Hit Die of the devoured soul. The trapped soul gains one permanent
      negative level for every round it spends within the Maw-these negative
      levels remain if the creature is brought back to life (but they do not
      stack with any negative levels imparted by being brought back to life). A
      soul that is completely consumed may only be restored to life by a miracle
      or wish spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Spell Deflection (Su)
    description: >-
      If any of the following spells is cast at the Maw and overcomes its spell
      resistance, it instead affects the devoured soul: banishment, chaos
      hammer, confusion, crushing despair, detect thoughts, dispel evil,
      dominate person, fear, geas/quest, holy word, hypnotism, imprisonment,
      magic jar, maze, suggestion, trap the soul, or any form of charm or
      compulsion. While none of these effects harms the soul, the caster makes a
      DC 25 caster level check when a spell is deflected-success indicates that
      the trapped soul is released from its prison and the creature whose body
      it belonged to can now be restored to life as normal.
  - name: Swallow Whole (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a creature cuts its way out of the Maw after being swallowed, the Maw
      can use swallow whole once its fast healing repairs the damage caused by
      its prey cutting itself free. True Herald Despite its type and Hit Dice,
      Mother's Maw is the herald of Urgathoa. Despite its type and Hit Dice, it
      can be conjured using the spell greater planar binding.
  - name: Vomit Swarm (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round as a free action, the Maw can vomit forth a swarm of
      maggots (use the statistics for army ants on page 16 of the Pathfinder RPG
      Bestiary) into a square adjacent to it, after which the swarm moves in a
      direction of the Maw's choosing. These swarms persist for 10 rounds.
Description:
  - >-
    The Mother's Maw is the herald of Urgathoa. A disgusting undead creature
    that comes to the mortal realm at the command of the Pallid Princess, it is
    an unsubtle thing of ravenous hunger, with little purpose but to kill, eat,
    and animate corpses as undead. Though it is as brilliant as a lich, its only
    interests are in satisfy its cravings for sensation. The Maw has little
    interest in the desires of mortals (or of undead in the mortal world) except
    for how they intersect with Urgathoa's orders. If it is necessary to eat a
    hundred members of her cult, or to drive an entire city of ghouls into a
    lava pit, the Maw does it. It can speak but finds little worth talking
    about, so many assume it is as mindless as an animated skeleton. However,
    when not on a mission of death, disease, or gluttony, it is a font of
    knowledge about food, wine, exotic scents, and other strange experiences
    only an undead creature can understand, and is quite willing to speak on
    these matters to an interested party-assuming the sight of the enormous
    talking, winged skull isn't a distraction to listeners. Although the Maw
    normally appears as a bare skull, it sometimes covers itself with its
    swarms. Whether this is out of a morbid sense of humor or an attempt to
    remember an old sensation from its life is unknown. It has confirmed that it
    was once a devourer, and before that a living creature, but it does not give
    further details Ecology The Mother's Maw is an immortal undead, able to
    recover from almost any attack and lacking the need to eat or drink.
    However, it still enjoys these things and is driven by a desire to
    experience sensation like the worst mortal hedonist. It has been known to
    eat and spit out entire herds of cattle (one steer at a time), to crash into
    winery casks to soak itself for hours in fine and mediocre vintages alike,
    to roll in exotic spices, or to wrap itself in fine cloth until it looks
    like a giant mummy skull. Worshipers of the Pallid Princess who wish to
    curry the herald's favor know to have large amounts of food, drink, or other
    luxuries for it to experience, consume, or defile. Sometimes the goddess
    commands the Maw to be quiet, and it finds a resting place such as a large
    temple where it can wait for days or weeks, using only its power to animate
    the dead to create servants for the faithful, or in an old battlefield or
    graveyard, casually creating dozens of undead that lurk about it like
    cultists around a gross idol. When the Herald leaves, the undead are left
    behind, either for the worshipers to maintain or turned loose to attack the
    living. It has no respect for life, and if left to its own devices, it
    casually kills things as a distraction, often reanimating them and killing
    them again. Habitat & Society Because of its innate ability to create
    undead, the herald is sometimes accompanied by skeletons, zombies, and
    ghouls, which caper about it, endlessly adoring the emissary of the goddess
    of undeath. It has been known to ferry allies into battle, or (rarely) to
    rescue a powerful undead creature, spiriting its passenger away to safety
    within its bony gullet, relying on its own defenses to keep its passenger
    safe. It is particularly fond of raveners and vampires, and has gone out of
    its way to aid them when given the choice of several allies.
