    Bog beasts make their homes in bogs and swamps and feed on creatures that
    dwell there. They are avid hunters and a bog beast's hunting area usually
    covers a large expanse of ground several miles around its lair. A bog beast
    stands over 9 feet tall and weighs around 1,100 pounds. It makes its lair
    amid overgrown swamplands and attacks just about any creature that travels
    too close to its lair. They seem to be able to communicate with one another
    through a series of guttural grunts and growls, but do not speak any known
    language. Bog beasts attack with their claws and always fight to the death.
