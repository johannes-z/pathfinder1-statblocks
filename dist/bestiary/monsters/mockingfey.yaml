      As a standard action, a mockingfey can magically take on the appearance of
      any creature it can see. This functions like disguise self, but with no
      restrictions on duration, creature type, or size. The mockingfey does not
      change size, and if the creature it's mimicking is larger than it, the
      mockingfey simply appears to be a miniature version. Anyone interacting
      with this effect can attempt a DC 12 Will save to see through the ruse. A
      mockingfey can maintain a given form indefinitely, but cannot change to
      any form other than its own without visual reference-once a given disguise
      has ended, the fey must see the subject again to resume that form. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Mockingfey originally stem from the First World, where they're regarded as
    entertainment by locals and nuisances by visitors, who are the usual butt of
    the creatures' pranks. The pint-sized fey often congregate in large colonies
    called japes or mockingdells, inhabiting the trees near a commonly traversed
    path or meadow. When an intelligent creature enters the grove, one of the
    bird-sprites flies down to perch on the traveler's shoulder or some nearby
    vantage. It then promptly shifts shape to become a perfect, miniature
    doppelganger of the creature in question, proceeding to cavort and imitate
    the newcomer in a most convincing and unf lattering manner, mimicking the
    creature's tone but chattering only gibberish.
  - >-
    This gibberish is not solely for comic effect, as while mockingfey are eager
    (if distractible) students in most matters, they refuse to use verbal
    language of any sort, believing that words unnecessarily constrain the
    things they describe. Instead, they communicate through gestures, pantomime,
    and elaborate dances. Those who think them mere beasts, however, are quickly
    set straight, as enemies of mockingfey are confronted with disorienting
    magic and the mockingfey's capricious allies from the First World.
  - >-
    While many people find mockingfeys' antics irritating, the little creatures
    are surprisingly useful allies, with a loyal, friendly nature toward those
    who treat them well, and an insatiable curiosity that makes them
    surprisingly well informed about their surroundings. This same curiosity
    extends to things most folks would leave alone, such as the portal-like
    breach scars between the Material Plane and the First World. When such
    planar rifts occur, mockingfey are often some of the first creatures
    through, with colonies found in Kyonin, the River Kingdoms, and sylvan
    groves around the Inner Sea. Those illusionists and other spellcasters who
    seek such puckish familiars (and take the Improved Familiar feat) often find
    them worth the resulting hassle-if just barely. A typical mockingfey is 8
    inches tall and weighs 2 pounds.
