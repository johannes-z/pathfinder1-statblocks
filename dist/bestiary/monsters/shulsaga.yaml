SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Astral Recoil (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a shulsaga that touches a silver cord (such as
      that created by the spell astral projection) can cause the cord to recoil.
      The astral projecting creature must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw
      or be snapped back to its body, ending the spell effect but not harming
      the spellcaster. The save DC is Wisdom-based.
  - name: Disk Rider (Su)
    description: >-
      A shulsaga can only use its fly speed in tandem with its floating disk
      spell-like ability. A shulsaga that casts floating disk can use the spell
      to its normal effect, or step upon it and use it to fly for the duration
      of the spell. The disk can support its creator and the creator's equipment
      (even if this exceeds the load a floating disk can normally bear), but
      nothing else. Only the disk's caster can ride it in this way. A floating
      disk cast by a shulsaga is dismissible.
  - name: Sense Rift (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a shulsaga can detect any planar rift within 20
      miles, automatically learning its direction and distance. This includes
      natural portals, non-instantaneous planar spells such as gate, and other
      tears in reality.
Description:
  - >-
    Natives of the Astral Plane, shulsagas wish only to be left in peace to ride
    and hunt the wild voids. Life is rarely so easy, though, as predatory
    outsiders, mortal travelers, and souls making their passage to the Outer
    Planes constantly trespass upon the shulsagas' home plane. Proud and
    territorial, the disk-riders use their intimate understanding of astral
    forces to drive interlopers from their territory. Shulsagas live in a simple
    but far from primitive hunter society, based around drifting villages that
    float upon stray chunks of elemental detritus and astral protomatter. They
    often train the massive beasts of their native plane (such as astral
    leviathans) to pull and defend their unfettered homes. Because shulsagas
    endlessly face the deadly beings that travel the Astral Plane, most
    communities attack strangers rather than risking their lives trying to
    distinguish friends from foes. Shulsagas speak a raspy dialect of Auran. A
    shulsaga is born genderless. It reaches maturity when it's a century old,
    and can then will its body toward a gender it will have for the rest of its
    life. Shulsagas can live to be over 500 years old, but most die earlier in
    hunts or planar upheavals. They average 7 feet in height and weigh about 240
    pounds. Many have levels in ranger or summoner.
