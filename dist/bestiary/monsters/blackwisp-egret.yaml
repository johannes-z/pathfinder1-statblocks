  - name: Deceptive Target (Ex)
    description: >-
      A blackwisp egret's glowing eyes belie its true position at night. In
      areas of dim light or darkness, ranged attacks against a blackwisp egret
      suffer a 20% miss chance.
Description:
  - >-
    Blackwisp egrets are relatively harmless during the day, but at night, their
    glowing eyes are often mistaken for the deadly will-o'-wisps that plague
    Belkzen's Ghostlight Marsh. Many people flee in terror upon seeing flocks of
    glowing orbs in the night and wind up twisting an ankle on a gnarled tree
    root or falling into a sinkhole as they bolt. These misfortunes have led
    many who travel through Ghostlight Marsh to consider blackwisp egrets
    unlucky omens.
  - >-
    Blackwisp egrets are hunters and scavengers, living on anything from frogs
    to fish to carrion left by other denizens of the marsh. Their long, serrated
    beaks are excellent for cutting through the clothing of deceased travelers,
    and flocks of egrets on the edge of starvation sometimes even attack living
    travelers.
  - >-
    Almost invisible at night thanks to their jet-black feathers, the birds are
    well adapted to hunting by stealth in their environment. They flock together
    for protection, as even the most dangerous predators avoid such groups when
    encountered in darkness, fearing that they may actually be a group of
    will-o'-wisps. The few swamp druids who still make their homes in the marsh
    have been known to domesticate these birds, encouraging them to slowly
    circle the druids' homes at night to ward away unwanted visitors.
