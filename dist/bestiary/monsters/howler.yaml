SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Howl (Su)
    description: >-
      A howler's constant howling is a grating, exhausting baying that can drive
      listeners insane. All beings other than outsiders within 120 feet of a
      howling howler must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or become cursed by the
      creature's howl. Once a creature becomes cursed in this way, she takes no
      additional penalty for being exposed to additional howlers' howls until
      the current howler curse is lifted. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect.
      The save DC is Charisma-based. Howler Howl: Curse-howl; save Will DC 12
      negates; frequency 1/hour; effect 1 Wis damage; cure 1 save.
  - name: Pain (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a creature takes damage from a howler's quill attack or its quill
      defense, that creature must make a successful DC 14 Reflex save or one
      quill breaks off in its flesh, causing the target to become sickened until
      all embedded quills are removed. Removing one quill requires a DC 15 Heal
      check made as a full-round action. For every 5 by which the check is
      exceeded, one additional quill can be removed. On a failed check, a quill
      is still removed, but the process deals 1d4+1 points of damage to the
      victim. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Quill Defense (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature that strikes a howler with a non-reach melee weapon, unarmed
      strike, or natural weapon takes 1d4+1 points of piercing damage from the
      howler's quills and suffers from the howler's pain attack.
Description:
  - >-
    The howler is a native to the Abyss, an Outer Plane where madness is the
    norm and cruelty is expected and often rewarded. The howler prowls these
    Abyssal realms, serving the role of a hungry predator like a lion or tiger,
    save for the fact that the typical howler is much more intelligent than a
    big cat. Worse, howlers have little interest in eating their prey-they need
    not feed to live, but rather enjoy the process of stalking, mauling, and
    killing living creatures. In a way, the act of inflicting intense pain and
    madness upon mortal life is what fills a howler's life instead of the desire
    to feed.
  - >-
    The howler's mane of razor-sharp quills makes it a poor choice of mount for
    most creatures, but it serves quite well as a guardian or
    sentinel-especially for outsiders, who may not enjoy the creature's constant
    howling, but aren't adversely affected by the supernatural sounds. When a
    howler sees prey, the tenor of its howls changes- howlers cannot speak, but
    they can use their howls to communicate quite a bit of information if
    required. They understand the Abyssal tongue, and when serving demons as
    guardians, their howls can not only alert their masters to the presence of
    intruders, but also to their number, appearance, and weaknesses.
  - >-
    A howler is about the size of a tiger-12 feet from snout to tail and
    weighing 6,000 pounds. They are normally pale in color, with darker quills
    and milky eyes.
