SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Beast Form (Su)
    description: >-
      When angered or intoxicated, a baccae takes on a beast-like visage,
      growing sharpened fangs and claws. This transformation cannot be ended
      voluntarily and lasts for up to 1 hour.
  - name: Charming Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      In human form, a baccae's gaze can charm any creature meeting her gaze and
      within 30 feet. An affected creature can attempt a DC 14 Will save to
      resist the effects. If the save fails, the opponent acts as if affected by
      a charm person spell (caster level equals the baccae's HD). A baccae can
      suppress this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Rage (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a baccae in beast form can fly into berserk frenzy. This
      frenzy lasts for 1 minute (10 rounds). In this rage, she gains temporary
      bonuses to her ability scores: +4 Strength, +4 Constitution. She likewise
      gains a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but takes a -2 penalty to Armor
      Class. A baccae cannot voluntarily end her rage.
Description:
  - >-
    The handmaidens of Baccus-Dionysus are known as the baccae. Some say they
    were once his priestesses who succumbed to the madness of the grape. Others
    say they were a race of fey created by him who reflects his ever-changing
    emotions. When in peaceful playful moods, these women are comely and
    attractive with long hair the color of red wine. Baccae carry jugs of wine
    which quickly make the imbiber become complacent around them as if under the
    influence of a calm emotions spell (caster level 8th).
  - >-
    Baccae are a reclusive race of fairy who spend their time in their forested
    lair away from humankind. While friendly toward humans and humanoids that
    share their alignment, they spend most of their time associating with others
    of their race and other fey creatures of the same or similar alignment.
  - >-
    Though chaotic by nature, evil baccae are a rare sight as most lean toward a
    neutral disposition. Those with evil tendencies are shunned by others of
    their own race and often attacked on sight. (Evil baccae are known to
    associate with quicklings on occasion, if the agreement mutually benefits
    both parties involved). Good-aligned baccae, while rare, often associate
    with druids, elves, and other good-aligned fey creatures.
  - >-
    A baccae stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs around 120 to 130
    pounds. Her hair is always long and free flowing (baccae never pull it back)
    and always red. Eye color is either green or commonly blue. Baccae dress in
    loose-fitting robes of greens, browns, and tans.
  - >-
    Baccae Society The baccae are a fey race known for their wild indulgences
    and extremes of emotion. The baccae brew their own wine which is used in
    their baccanals. This wine, called the Wine of Baccus-Dionysus is the center
    of their worship to these strange fey.
  - >-
    The wine has the effect of a calm emotions spell and requires the drinker to
    succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save that increases by +1 for every cup of wine
    consumed. The baccae themselves have a 5% chance per cup imbibed of
    unleashing their bestial form and falling into a rage, attacking any
    non-baccae in their midst, starting with males.
