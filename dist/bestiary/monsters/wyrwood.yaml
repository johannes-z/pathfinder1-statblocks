Description:
  - >-
    This relatively young race was created by a cabal of wizards who needed
    nimble and skilled construct servants to do their dirty work. This cabal was
    interested in creating magical machines, so they built their tools to be
    small, agile, and clever. Over time, the cabal pushed the limits too far and
    created minions with free will, and these first wyrwoods began to question
    why they were involved in their masters' petty intrigues. When the wizards
    forced the wyrwoods to fight each other as proxies for the wizards
    themselves, the constructs instead killed their creators and stole the notes
    on how to create more of their kind, allowing them to perpetuate their race.
    Wyrwoods are secretive and somewhat xenophobic, and can seem cold and
    calculating to others-a trait that could earn respect or enmity, depending
    on the audience. Purely rational and unemotional, wyrwoods see the survival
    of their race as their primary goal. Even the rare wyrwood who understands
    the point of empathy and altruism sees such concepts as mere tools to help
    ensure its own survival or that of its people. All wyrwoods know how to
    create more of their kind, and they keep the details of their construction
    process secret from other creatures to make sure their race is never again
    enslaved. Most wyrwoods are wizards or rogues. The few who are inclined to
    worship tend to revere lawful deities with strict codes of behavior, which
    they follow to the letter rather than the spirit.
