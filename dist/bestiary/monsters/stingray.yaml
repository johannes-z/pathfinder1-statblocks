Description:
  - >-
    Often found buried in mud, sand, or sea grass, this normally passive
    creature raises its tail above its body like a scorpion when cornered or
    injured. Its stinger is a barbed spine with two grooves allowing the toxin
    to enter the wound. While often found in bays and estuaries, some breeds of
    stingray can make their home in rivers far upstream from salt water.
    Stingrays, like their larger manta ray cousins, use a form of
    electrolocation to find prey in the silt-laden waters.
  - >-
    The stingray presented here is a relatively large member of the species; for
