      Craftsman as a bonus feat even if they do not have the normal

      when creating magic items if they have access to a kuah-lij production
      facility. Magic Item Use (EX) Kuah-lij can use magic items as if they have
      1 level of wizard. This innate ability does not increase with level unless
      the kuah-lij gains levels in the wizard class.
Description:
  - >-
    The kuah-lij are a race of humanoids that inhabit a distant world orbiting a
    great red sun. They are lawful and organized, but a dying people due to a
    series of disasters on their home world, and now search for aid. For several
    millennia, the kuah-lij lived in relative peace on an old world in an
    advanced civilization, though much of the technology was magic-based. This
    changed with a series of plagues that devastated the population, followed by
    a gradual, inexplicable advancement of the size of their oceans. Huge floods
    resulted. These cataclysms were followed by the invasion of a ferocious
    aquatic race resembling the aboleths. The aboleth-like creatures lurked in
    the deepest ocean trenches of the kuah-lij planet, and attacked by coming up
    from the depths. The kuah-lij, accomplished artisans, retaliated by building
    a series of magically enhanced sea craft to travel the deeps and attack
    these beings. Thus far they have arrived at a stalemate, and the kuah-lij
    now seek aid from other worlds and planes in their battle against their
    deepwater adversaries. Individual kuah-lij commoners rely upon their
    military and combat specialists to protect them. With their focus on magical
    technology, they have easy access to a great many magical devices which they
    can use to defend themselves with as well. The Kuah-lij were at one time a
    peaceful race of explorers, living in an organized society on a distant
    planet orbiting a great red sun. Though the course of their lives was
    regimented, their culture allowed them scope for individuality, and in fact
    encouraged it. This, and the natural propensity of the kuah-lij for order,
    resulted in a society that had remained fresh and vigorous for over 10,000
    years. Kuah-lij young are placed into a public crèche to be raised within
    days of birth, to be raised by child care specialists. As they grow and are
    educated, their affinities and talents are assessed, and at age 15 they are
    assigned a vocation, based on their talents, and an avocation, based on
    their preferences. They then study more intensely in these two areas, until
    they reach maturity at age 25. Kuah-lij youths have the option of changing
    vocation or avocation if they insist upon it, though this almost never
    occurs. Upon reaching maturity, they fully enter society, where they spend
    10 months of the year working at their vocation 10 hours per day, and the
    final two months on sabbatical, traveling, exploring, or doing whatever else
    strikes them as interesting. Their culture is based on a complex system of
    credit, with currency reserved only for dealing with non-kuahlij, and
    medicine, vacation time, and other services are all socialized, but due to
    their innately organized, cooperative mindset, there is remarkably little
    corruption within their culture. The kuah-lij had civilized their planet
    millennia ago, and had settlements across its lands and beneath its seas.
    Many areas they deliberately kept undeveloped, and they took great pleasure
    in long sea voyages and extended exploration of back country. Their innate
    tendency to organized society also helped them immeasurably with mass
    production and technology, in particular a merging of science and magic.
    Though it never reached the pinnacles seen in other exotic cross-planar
    cultures, it was highly polished, with many of their technological marvels
    being as much works of art as useful items. This idyllic existence came to
    an end over 300 years ago, when a strange darkness crept into the deepest
    places of their oceans. Kuah-lij explorers that investigated did not return,
    or came back reporting nothing amiss-but with a strange gleam in their eyes.
    They merged back into the kuah-lij culture, and immediately set about
    sabotaging it, destroying it from within. Despite their placid lives, the
    kuah-lij had many thousands of years of history to draw upon, and were able
    to take this in stride. Yet even as they isolated the tainted members of
    their society and set about investigating the cause of this in detail, the
    invaders of the deeps began to strike, poisoning food supplies, then
    attacking Kuah-lij undersea cities, often overwhelming them without warning
    or survivors. As the years passed, the kuah-lij culture became more
    militant, fighting a war against a race they had almost no information
    about. The battle has entered a kind of stalemate: the Kuah-lij have many
    sea-based vessels and devices to use against their foes, but the enemies of
    the deep, which resemble aboleths, are surmised to have secret aid from an
    extraplanar source, and also apparently limitless numbers. The kuah-lij have
    turned some of their efforts to exploring distant worlds, in this plane and
    beyond, for answers to the origins of their attackers, and how to deal with
    them. This is their single, overriding concern. Kuah-lij Characters Kuah-lij
    are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All
    kuah-lij possess the following racial traits. +2 Intelligence, -4 Charisma
