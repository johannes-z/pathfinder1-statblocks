Description:
  - >-
    Though the word gorgon is often associated with the deadly bull-like
    creature that turns a victim to stone with its breath weapon, the true
    gorgons are three sisters; Euryale, Sthenno, and Medusa. They are the
    daughters of the god Phorcys and the goddess Ceto. Euryale and Sthenno were
    born immortal and are hideous creatures with writing snakes for hair, brass
    claws, wings, and a gaze that can turn any living creature into stone.
    Phorcys tasked them with guarding the entrance to the Underworld.
  - >-
    Medusa was born mortal and was very beautiful. Phorcys sent her to the
    Material Plane so all could gaze upon the beauty of his daughter.
  - >-
    Medusa's beauty rivaled that of some of the goddesses, and some of them grew
    jealous of Medusa, particularly the goddess Athena. Her beauty also turned
    the heads of some of the gods, and when Poseidon seduced her in a temple to
    Athena, the goddess became enraged and changed the beautiful Medusa into a
    creature as hideous as her sisters. Poseidon turned from his love, never to
    return again. Medusa, enraged, fled into the desert and never came back to
    civilization.
  - >-
    The hero Perseus was tasked with killing the gorgon known as Medusa and
    bringing her head to King Polydectes as a wedding present. Using a magic
    shield given to him by the gods, he avoided Medusa's deadly gaze and severed
    her head. From her serpentine body sprang the children of Poseidon,
    creatures similar in appearance to their mother. These creatures escaped
    into the world and are called medusa.
  - >-
    Sthenno and Euryale long for their sister's return or their meeting with her
    in the Underworld. Yet being immortal, they cannot enter the Realm of the
    Dead. Thus, both know they will never see their beloved sibling again. Their
    cries are said to be audible on the wind as a high-pitched shrill akin to a
    bird's cry.
  - >-
    Both Sthenno and Euryale are 10 feet tall and weigh around 600 pounds or
    more. Sthenno's eyes are blue; Euryale's eyes are copper.
  - Sthenno and Euryale rarely enter combat unless pressed or provoked.
  - >-
    They are both deadly combatants and use their claws, bite, snakes, and
    petrifying gaze with precision force. Sthenno enjoys "collecting" those she
    has turned to stone and even has a room in her lair where she displays them.
    Euryale simply smashes to rubble those she has petrified.
