SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Size (Sp)
    description: >-
      Twice per day, an efreeti can magically change a creature's size. This
      works just like an enlarge person or reduce person spell (the efreeti
      chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the
      efreeti. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
  - name: Heat (Ex)
    description: >-
      An efreeti's body deals 1d6 points of fire damage whenever it hits in
      melee, or in each round it grapples.
Description:
  - >-
    The efreet (singular efreeti) are genies from the Plane of Fire. An efreeti
    stands about 12 feet tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds. Efreet have few
    allies among geniekind. They certainly hate djinn, and attack them on sight.
    They hold an equally strong enmity for marids, and view the jann as frail
    and weak. Efreet often work closely with shaitans, yet even then alliances
    are temporary at best. A small percentage of efreet are noble. Noble efreet,
    often called maliks, have 13 Hit Dice and gain the following spell-like
    abilities: 3/day-fireball, heat metal; 1/day-greater invisibility,
    pyroclastic storm (as ice storm, with fire instead of cold damage). A noble
    efreeti's caster level for its spell-like abilities is 15th. Noble efreet
    are CR 10.
