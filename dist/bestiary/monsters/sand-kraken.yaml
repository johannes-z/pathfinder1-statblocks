    description: >-
      Because it remains buried until it attacks, it takes a successful DC 20
      Perception check to detect the presence of a sand kraken before it
      attacks. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one
      of those skills instead of Perception to notice the sand kraken.
  - name: Tentacles (Ex)
    description: >-
      The only part of a sand kraken that is normally exposed is its tentacles.
      For combat purposes, the creature's tentacles are treated as separate
      weapons. A single tentacle has an AC 20 (touch 14) and 15 hit points. Once
      a tentacle takes more than 15 hit points of damage, it is destroyed. A
      sand kraken can no longer use the destroyed tentacle to make attacks,
      however the loss of a tentacle cause the creature no other penalties.
      Furthermore, damage dealt to a tentacle does not count against the
      creature's total hit points. Lost tentacles regrow in 1d4 days.
Description:
  - >-
    The sand krakens are dangerous creatures encountered only in remote
    wastelands. A sand kraken keeps its body well concealed, buried deep in sand
    or loose rock, and inaccessible to most attacks. The creature never moves
    from the place where it digs its first burrow and once it settles in, will
    never again see the light of day. The only parts of a sand kraken that are
    usually seen are its tentacles, and by then it is often too late.
  - >-
    Sand krakens are omnivores, but prefer meat to any other food. Once it
    captures and kills its prey, it pulls the carcass down into its sandy lair,
    and devours it with its great central maw. For this reason, a number of
    scholars speculate a biological relationship between sand krakens and
    dustdiggers.
  - >-
    For most of its life, a sand kraken remains dormant and silent, buried
    several feet below the surface of the ground. When it senses prey its
    tentacles swiftly rise to the surface. A sand kraken uses its initial
    attacks to immobilize its prey by constriction. Each tentacle has its own
    secondary brain, and can attack independently. While tentacles can be harmed
    and severed, the only true way to kill a sand kraken is to dig it up and
    destroy its body.
