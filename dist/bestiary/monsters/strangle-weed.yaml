      Since a strangle weed looks like normal seaweed when at rest, it takes a
      DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks
      in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of
      Perception to notice the plant.
  - name: Fronds (Ex)
    description: >-
      Strangle weed attacks with fronds that can extend up to 20 feet from its
      central mass. Each strangle weed has 3-12 fronds. A strangle weed attacks
      with these fronds as a slam attack; although it can make only one attack
      per round, if it grapples a foe it is not denied its Dexterity bonus
      against non-grappled foes and can still make attacks of opportunity if it
      has any free fronds. Once a foe is grappled, the strangle weed can attempt
      to latch on 1-4 additional fronds each round as a standard action by means
      of a separate grapple check. Additional fronds attached to a foe do not do
      increased damage, but they do add a cumulative +2 bonus to the strangle
      weed's CMB on subsequent grapple checks against that foe. To free itself,
      the foe must succeed on a grapple check against every frond grappling it.
Description:
  - The strangle weed is a large plant that resembles a patch of seaweed.
  - >-
    Strangle weed is an ambush predator, relying on its similarity to seaweed to
    remain inconspicuous until prey wanders near, whereupon it lashes out with
    its fronds, attempting to grapple its foes, then pull them beneath the water
    and crush them.
  - >-
    A subterranean version of the strangle weed is believed to exist, though
    encounters with it are very rare. It is dark blackish-green and is found in
    underground pools, stagnant water, and the like.
  - >-
    A typical strangle weed is 12 feet in diameter, dark green and slightly
    slimy, with long, ropy fronds, each about ten feet long, radiating from its
    central mass. The strangle weed keeps these fronds concealed within its main
    mass when hiding from potential prey.
