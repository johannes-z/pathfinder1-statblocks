Description_Visual: >-
  Barely thicker than hempen rope, this orange-banded worm stretches many feet
  in length.

IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blindness (Ex)
    description: >-
      A zhen worm perceives solely through its tremorsense ability. It is immune
      to all sight-based effects and attacks, including gaze attacks.
  - name: Dissolve Flesh (Ex)
    description: >-
      Though too dilute to cause damage in combat, a zhen worm's acidic mucus
      reduces a Mediumsized corpse to bones and a pool of foul-smelling slurry
      in 1d4 days. Each size category above Medium doubles the amount of time
      required, and each size category smaller than Medium halves it.
  - name: Protective Mucus (Ex)
    description: >-
      Weapons slip off the slick slime that coats a zhen worm, and fire has
      difficulty burning it away. Zhen worms take half damage from weapons and
      fire. This ability does not reduce damage from confirmed critical hits.
Description:
  - >-
    The blind and mindless zhen worms thrive in warm, wet environments such as
    the Gorum Pots of Numeria.
  - >-
    Cold disrupts their tremorsense, and they cannot burrow through rocky soil,
    so the worms do not roam far from their geothermal baths.
  - >-
    Though rarely thicker than an inch in diameter, zhen worms reach up to 10
    feet in length and weigh up to 20 pounds. The orange bands along their sides
    react to tremors and vibration, providing their only means of perceiving the
    environment around them. Zhen worms hunt by lying unseen beneath mud or
    water, waiting for prey to approach close enough to attack. Zhen worms
    normally restrict themselves to modest prey such as rodents and lizards, but
    a hungry worm may attack Small or even Medium prey.
  - >-
    A zhen worm has no mouth or digestive tract. Instead, it absorbs nutrients
    and secretes waste through thousands of tiny orifices along its body. The
    mucus coating its body slowly dissolves organic matter. Over a matter of
    days, a zhen worm wrapped around a corpse reduces it to nothing but bones
    and a foul-smelling slurry.
