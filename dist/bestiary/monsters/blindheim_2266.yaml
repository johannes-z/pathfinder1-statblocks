Description:
  - >-
    Blindheims dwell in underground caverns and sustain themselves on a diet of
    funguses, molds, and small rodents. An extra eyelid allows the blindheim to
    "turn off" its eyes when it is sleeping or resting. A dead blindheim's eyes
    are dull gold in color. Blindheims are 4 feet tall and weigh about 150
    pounds. A blindheim attacks by first blinding a foe with its gaze and then
    rushing in to use its bite attack. It can turn its eyes on and off as it
    wishes, but always leaves them on during combat. If overmatched, a blindheim
    flees. Credit The Blindheim originally appeared in the First Edition Fiend
    Folio (Â© TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission.
