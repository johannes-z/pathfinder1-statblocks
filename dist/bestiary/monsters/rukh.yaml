    Rukhs are foul-tempered creatures related to rocs, except they resemble
    two-headed vultures instead of raptors. They hunt live prey and carrion,
    typically gliding high above the desert in search of things to eat. They
    avoid creatures of their size or larger, preferring easier prey-horses,
    camels, and humanoids for adult rukhs, or Medium and Small creatures for
    juveniles. They nest on mountains and in cliffside caves, as they are too
    large to roost in trees. Few young rukhs reach adulthood, as many tribes and
    caravans hunt them for meat, often using a lone, weak-looking scout to lure
    a hungry juvenile into striking distance for an ambush. A typical adult rukh
    stands nearly 35 feet tall and has a wingspan of more than 60 feet. Most are
    scrawny due to hunger. Coupled with their lightweight bones for easier
    flying, they rarely top 800 pounds. Juvenile rukhs usually stand about 10
    feet tall, with a relatively small wingspan of nearly 18 feet, and weigh
    about 200 pounds.
