SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hallucinatory Spores (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a hangman tree can release a cloud of
      spores in a 50-foot-radius spread. Creatures in the area must make a DC 20
      Will save or believe the hangman tree to be a perfectly ordinary tree- or
      at worst, a treant or some other friendly tree-like creature. An affected
      creature becomes passive for 2d6 minutes and refuses to attack the hangman
      tree during this time. An affected creature can attempt a new Will save
      each round that the tree attacks an ally-if a hallucinating creature is
      attacked by the tree, it gains a +4 bonus on its Will save to see through
      the hallucination. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Vines (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hangman tree's vines are primary attacks that deal bludgeoning damage.
      When a hangman tree grapples a foe with its vines, the tree does not gain
      the grappled condition. A hangman tree that uses swallow whole transfers a
      pinned creature from a vine to inside its trunk.
Description:
  - >-
    The hangman tree prefers to lie in wait near remote forest tracks and game
    trails, waiting for victims to wander by. These carnivorous plants are
    incredibly patient, and can wait for months in a single location for food to
    approach. When prey does draw near, the tree's vines lash like striking
    snakes. The tree often uses its pull ability to hoist grappled foes 10 to 15
    feet in the air so that they are out of reach of allies while they slowly
    strangle. The tree generally only swallows one foe whole at a time, letting
    its other captured victims dangle and ripen until it is ready to feed on
    them.
  - A hangman tree is 30 feet tall and weighs 12,000 pounds.
