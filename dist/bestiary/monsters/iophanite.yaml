    description: >-
      An iophanite usually glows with a golden light equivalent to that of a
      candle. In battle, its glow increases, filling the area within 5 feet. An
      iophanite can suppress or resume this glow as a free action. Additionally,
      as a standard action at will an iophanite can intensify its glow to
      reproduce the effects of the spell flare. A creature can resist this
      effect with a DC 14 Fortitude save, though evil creatures take a -4
      penalty on their saves. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Shield Form (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, an iophanite can transform into a +1 spiked light steel
      shield sized for a Small or Medium creature. An iophanite cannot
      communicate or use any of its other abilities while in this form. Once it
      transforms, it cannot change back for 24 hours, though the spell break
      enchantment can end the transformation early. An iophanite regains its
      full hit points when it shifts back into its normal form. If the shield is
      destroyed, the iophanite is killed.
Description:
  - >-
    Iophanites comprise a unique classification of messenger angel in service to
    Iomedae. Energetic, enthusiastic, impulsive, and outgoing, it constantly
    looks for ways to aid the forces of righteousness in the wars against fiends
    and villainy. As a being of pure righteous spirit in a burning physical
    form, an iophanite is often confused for an exotic form of harbinger or
    lantern archon. Its form is slightly mutable, and it can deform itself into
    an oval curved like a shield, or manifest simple tendrils to manipulate
    objects or lash out at opponents. When interacting with mortals, an
    iophanite usually manifests ripples of flames or pulses of light that thrum
    in time with its speaking. Most creatures have a difficult time telling
    iophanites apart, but these angels can always recognize each other.
  - >-
    Iophanites are talkative and have excellent memories, making them naturally
    inclined to carry news, battle orders, and other critical information. Their
    bodies are hot to the touch, but do not ignite combustibles unless the
    iophanite wishes it, allowing it to carry scrolls or other flammable goods
    without risk of destroying them. Of the lawful angels, they tend to be the
    most creative in terms of working around rules and the most forgiving of
    others' failures. They are also inclined to serve as the guardians of
    mortals, being mindful of virtuous and selfsacrificing heroes who might be
    destined for greatness in much the same way Iomedae herself was.
  - Iophanites measure exactly 5 feet in diameter and weigh 200 pounds.
