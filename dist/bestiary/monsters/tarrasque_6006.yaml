Source: Inner Sea Gods
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Carapace (Su)
    description: >-
      The tarrasque's scales deflect cones, lines, rays, and magic missile
      spells, rendering the tarrasque immune to such effects. There is a 30%
      chance a deflected effect reflects back in full force at the caster;
      otherwise it is simply negated.
  - name: Powerful Leaper (Ex)
    description: >-
      The tarrasque uses its Strength to modify Acrobatics checks made to jump,
      and has a +24 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump.
  - name: Rush (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per minute, for 1 round, the tarrasque's speed increases to 150 feet,
      and its Acrobatics bonus on checks made to jump increases to +87.
  - name: Spines (Ex)
    description: >-
      The tarrasque can loose a volley of six spear-like spines from its body as
      a standard action with a toss of its head or a lash of its tail. Make an
      attack roll for each spine- all targets must be within 30 feet of each
      other. The spines have a range increment of 120 ft.
Description:
  - >-
    The Tarrasque, referred to in ancient texts as the "Armageddon Engine," is
    the greatest of Rovagug's spawn. Its previously recorded devastation of
    Ninshabur and Avistan occurred in -632 AR, and culminated in the destruction
    of the flying Shory city of Kho. It was sealed away in a cavern somewhere in
    the Inner Sea region. Although the location of this cavern has been lost,
    rumors of possible locations include nearly every mountainous region, the
    Mwangi Expanse, and even under the Isle of Kortos itself.
  - >-
    The statistics presented here for the Tarrasque differ slightly from those
    in the Bestiary-this version more accurately represents the Tarrasque as the
    mightiest of Rovagug's spawn.
