Description:
  - >-
    Related to pseudodragons, faerie dragons are whimsical, playful pranksters
    that spend most of their time either relaxing in cool forest glades or
    engaged in some sort of prank. Although such mischief is usually
    spontaneous, some faerie dragons have been known to spend months
  - >-
    or even years in preparation of one truly spectacular joke. Travelers making
    their way through lands known to be inhabited by these good-natured-but
    sometimes annoying-tricksters are advised to keep up their guard lest they
    face all manner of creative annoyances (horses painted with berry juice,
    squirrels placed inside bedrolls, and clothing decorating high branches
    being a few examples).
  - >-
    Unlike true dragons, faerie dragons do not grow larger with age, but their
    scales do change color, starting with red and moving through the rainbow to
    reach dark violet at old age. Faerie dragons grow in power as spellcasters
    as they age (typically gaining levels in sorcerer), learning more powerful
    spells to complement their innate abilities. The spells of faerie dragons
    tend to focus on tools that can be used to create or enhance pranks, and
    illusion and enchantment spells are particularly popular.
  - >-
    Faerie dragons avoid combat unless there is no other option. If forced to
    fight, faerie dragons attempt to confound enemies rather than kill them,
    using both spells and breath weapon to weaken and scatter foes before
    fleeing. The only exception to this is when a faerie dragon's clan or allies
    are in danger. As capricious as these tiny dragons can be, many prove quick
    to bond with goodly creatures, especially fey and others they find
    interesting or hilarious-adventurers often fall into this latter camp,
    particularly those most outraged by a faerie dragon's tricks.
  - >-
    Faerie dragons sometimes ally with spellcasters, serving as curious,
    occasionally reckless, but always true familiars. An arcane spellcaster of
    at least 7th level with an alignment within 1 step of chaotic good who has
    the Improved Familiar feat may select a faerie dragon as a familiar.
