Description:
  - >-
    Hyenas are pack hunters infamous for their cunning and their unnerving,
    laughter-like vocalizations. They are largely scavengers, but aren't above
    supplementing their diet of carrion with fresh prey. Hyenas tend to hunt
    alone, but when hunting as a pack they typically send one or two members
    against a foe's front while the rest of the pack circles and attacks from
    behind. Many of the savage humanoid races, particularly gnolls, use hyenas
    as guard dogs. Such hyenas typically wear leather barding and are trained
    from birth to be vicious and savage-many such creatures are advanced hyenas.
