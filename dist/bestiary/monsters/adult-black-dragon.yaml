  dragon.
Group: Chromatic Dragon
Source: PFRPG Bestiary
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid Pool (Su)
    description: >-
      An ancient or older black dragon can use its breath weapon to create an
      acid pool as a standard action. This acid pool has a radius of 5 feet per
      age category of the dragon. When an acid pool is created, anyone inside
      its area takes an amount of damage equal to the dragon's breath weapon
      (Reflex half). Any creature that starts its turn touching this pool takes
      damage, but can make a Reflex save for half. Each round, the total damage
      dice of the pool is halved until the result would be less than 1d6. The
      acid pool floats on water, and deals damage to anything on the surface.
  - name: Acidic Bite (Su)
    description: >-
      At old age, a black dragon's bite deals an additional 2d6 points of acid
      damage. An ancient dragon's damage increases to 4d6, and a great wrym's to
      6d6.
  - name: Charm Reptiles (Sp)
    description: >-
      A great wyrm black dragon can use this ability three times per day. It
      works as a mass charm monster spell that affects only reptilian animals.
      This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.
  - name: Corrupt Water (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day an adult or older black dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of
      still water, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life.
      The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items
      (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a
      Will save (DC equal to the dragon's frightful presence) or become ruined.
      This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to
      that of the dragon's frightful presence.
  - name: Speak with Reptiles (Sp)
    description: >-
      A young or older black dragon gains the constant spell-like ability to
      speak with reptiles. This functions as speak with animals, but only with
      reptilian animals. Spell-Like
  - name: Abilities (Sp)
    description: >-
      A black dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will
      upon reaching the listed age category. Juvenile-darkness (radius 10 feet
      per age category); Old-plant growth; Ancient-insect plague.
  - name: Swamp Stride (Ex)
    description: >-
      A very young or older black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand
      without penalty at its normal speed.
  - name: Water Breathing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its
      breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.
Description:
  - >-
    Lording over the darkest swamps and marshes, black dragons are the
    undisputed masters of their domain, ruling through cruelty and intimidation.
    Those who dwell within a black dragon's reach live in fear. Black dragons
    tend to make their lairs in remote parts of the swamp, preferably in caves
    at the bottom of dark and fetid pools. Inside, they pile up their filthy
    treasure and sleep amid the roots and muck. Black dragons prefer their food
    a bit rotten and will often allow a meal to sit in a pool for days before
    consuming it. Black dragons prefer treasures that do not rot or decay,
    making their hoard, full of coins, gemstones, jewelry, and other objects
    made from stone or metal.
