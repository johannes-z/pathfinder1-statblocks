Description:
  - >-
    Servitors of Asmodeus, hesperians-also known as accomplice devils-come to
    the Material Plane to help guide inf luential individuals and their
    followers into Hell's grasp. Once a hesperian finds a suitable target for
    his clever wiles, he tells his victims that the greatest of Hell's devils
    sent him, and that his diabolical masters have recognized the individual's
    talents and potential. The hesperian goes on to claim that he has come to
    the mortal world in order to guide the creature as a chosen prodigy of Hell,
    and promises to carry the individual past the threshold of greatness. It's
    all a tangled lie, of course, but the best lies are the ones that at some
    point can be made into truths. A hesperian encourages envy, overreaching,
    pride, and ultimately hubris in his targets, urging his victims to strive
    toward ever bolder and more grandiose destinies. A hesperian dedicates
    himself to a mortal's service, assisting his victim in amassing power,
    wealth, prestige-all the while inf lating her ego and cultivating her belief
    in her own worthiness and infallibility. Once fully convinced of her own
    incontrovertible position, a hesperian's victim is usually only a gentle
    push from Hell's threshold. Always serving themselves and their dark god,
    hesperians are careful to not show too much of their hand, preferring to
    beguile and manipulate from the shadows. They cunningly alter their inhuman
    features to resemble attractive humanoids to mingle with mortals, appear
    more convincing in negotiations, and to not draw too much attention to their
    devilish natures. A hesperian often establishes Asmodean cults, then
    elevates one chosen mortal to a position of leadership within the group. He
    advises this leader, all the while manipulating other cultists-even
    sacrificing them if necessary-to help this mortal leader's ascendance
    without her having any direct accountability. A single hesperian typically
    has several mortals whom he calls master and advises in this way. Rotating
    his attention between these masters, the hesperian enjoys appearing for a
    while and then unexpectedly vanishing for periods like some dark muse. In
    his true form, a hesperian looks like a devilishly handsome human male with
    devilish horns, a forked tongue, and eyes reminiscent of snake's, but he can
    make himself a perfect imitation of any humanoid or even take the form of a
    long snake with a head on each end. Hesperians stand just under 7 feet tall
    and weigh approximately 180 pounds.
