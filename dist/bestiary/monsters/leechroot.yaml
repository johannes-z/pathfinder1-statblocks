Description_Visual: >-
  This tangle of rotten, lifeless roots resembles a mess of bodily organs, its
  visceral tendrils grasping for sustenance.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bloodthirst (Su)
    description: >-
      A leechroot can absorb blood directly from its victims' cuts. The
      leechroot gains fast healing equal to the number of creatures with the
      bleed condition it is grappling (if any).
  - name: Bloody Sap (Su)
    description: >-
      The viscous resin that exudes from a leechroot's tentacles is infused with
      negative energy, preventing both natural and magical healing. The DC of
      any Heal check to stop the bleeding caused by a leechroot's attacks is
      increased by 2. Casting a cure spell on a creature bleeding because of a
      leechroot's attacks requires a successful caster level check (DC 15 + the
      spell's level) or the spell has no effect on the bleeding creature.
  - name: Drag Under (Ex)
    description: >-
      As part of an action to maintain a grapple, a leechroot can move the
      grappled creature up to 5 feet (within the leechroot's reach) and bury it
      partway into the ground. The buried creature is pinned and can't receive
      help to break free from the grapple. A buried opponent that escapes the
      grapple remains pinned unless it spends a move action to dig itself free
      and it succeeds at a DC 10 Strength check.
  - name: Earth Barrier (Ex)
    description: >-
      A leechroot burrowing 5 feet below the surface is partially visible, can
      make attacks using its normal reach, and gains concealment and partial
      cover. It can be uprooted with a successful drag maneuver. It can burrow
      back under the earth as a move action that provokes attacks of
      opportunity.
Description:
  - >-
    The brutal Goblinblood Wars created the first leechroot, which emerged from
    the remains of plants drowned in the blood-drenched soils of Chitterwood. A
    chaotic intertwining of rotten roots, this monstrosity quickly spread its
    curse by soaking other dead plants in its sap. Moving underground,
    leechroots dispersed to forests all over Avistan, reaching as far as the
    Shudderwood in Ustalav.
  - >-
    A leechroot is driven solely by its thirst for blood. It hides below the
    earth while waiting for prey and snatches victims with its razor-sharp
    tentacles, feeding directly from their wounds. The absorbed blood mutates
    into a thick red sap that runs through the leechroot's body.
  - >-
    An adult leechroot averages 12 feet across (not including its root
    appendages) and weighs 700 pounds.
