SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Gallows Tree Zombie (Su)
    description: >-
      When a creature dies within 15 feet of a gallows tree, it uses a sharpened
      tendril to slice open the creature's abdomen, thereby spilling the
      corpse's innards on the ground. The organs and fluids are then absorbed by
      the tree's roots. Corpses of a size other than Medium or Large are simply
      left to rot. Medium or Large corpses are filled with a greenish pollen
      fired from one of the tree's branches. The abdominal wound heals over the
      next 1d4 days, at which time the slain creature rises as a gallows tree
      zombie connected by a tether-vine to the gallows tree that created it.
      Gallows tree zombies possess none of their former abilities.

    description: >-
      Each gallows tree has several gallows tree zombies connected to it. A Huge
      gallows tree may have no more than 7 gallows tree zombies connected to it
      at one time. A Gargantuan gallows tree can have a maximum of 11 zombies
      connected to it at any given time. See the gallows tree zombie entry in
      this book for details on that monster.

      Gallows trees can automatically sense the location of anything within 60
      feet that is in contact with the same vegetation the tree is touching.
Description:
  - >-
    Gallows trees are sentient plants that sustain themselves on the internal
    organs and body fluids of living creatures. They use deception to lure
    potential prey into range at which time they unleash the gallows tree
    zombies attached to their branches to kill or capture the prey.
  - >-
    While mobile, a gallows tree prefers to remain in one spot for an extended
    length of time (usually until its food supply in the area runs out). From
    this location, it simply waits for prey and then attacks when such beings
    come into view. Gallows trees do not collect treasure but occasionally such
    items (the remnants of devoured prey) are found in the vicinity of a gallows
    tree.
  - >-
    A gallows tree normally stands idle, lowering its zombies to the ground when
    living prey come within 100 feet of the tree. If a foe comes within 15 feet
    of the tree itself, it lashes out with its sharpened branches and pummels
    the creature or attempts to wrap a branch around the foe. A grabbed foe is
    subjected to additional damage as the gallows tree pummels it with its other
    branches. Occasionally the tree works in concert with its zombies, grabbing
    a foe and holding it while its zombies pound it into goop. Slain creatures
    are dragged close to the tree, sliced open, and their innards devoured by
    the tree's roots.
