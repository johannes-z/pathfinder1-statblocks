Description:
  - >-
    Half-elves stand taller than humans but shorter than elves. They inherit the
    lean build and comely features of their elven lineage, but their skin color
    is dictated by their human side. While half-elves retain the pointed ears of
    elves, theirs are more rounded and less pronounced. A half-elf's human-like
    eyes tend to range a spectrum of exotic colors running from amber or violet
    to emerald green and deep blue.
