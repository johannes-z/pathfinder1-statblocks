  - name: Freeze (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gargoyle guardian can hold itself so still that it appears to be a
      statue. A gargoyle guardian that uses freeze can take 20 on Stealth checks
      to hide in plain sight as a stone statue.
  - name: Snatch (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gargoyle guardian can start a grapple when it hits with both claw
      attacks, as though it had the grab ability. If it grapples a creature of
      size Medium or smaller, it squeezes each round for automatic claw damage
      with a successful grapple check. A gargoyle guardian can fly while holding
      a creature that weighs 350 pounds or less. It cannot throw creatures it is
      carrying, but can drop them as a free action.
Description:
  - >-
    Many races adorn their buildings and structures with carved gargoyles to
    make them look more fearsome, to ward off evil spirits, or in the hope of
    making real gargoyles think another tribe is already occupying the area.
    Many magic-users also create constructs in the shapes and forms of
    gargoyles, emulating those creatures' ability to blend in with stone
    structures and taking advantage of the pervasiveness of sculpted gargoyles
    to create stealthy protectors and watchdogs.
  - >-
    Many spellcasters construct gargoyle guardians that have special abilities,
    making them even more capable and vigilant sentinels.
  - >-
    Gargoyle Sentry (+0 CR): These gargoyle guardians are created with eyes of
    citrine linked to a 1-foot-diameter orb of the same stone. The orb always
    displays what the gargoyle guardian sees, though without the construct's
    darkvision or low-light vision. If the gargoyle sentry is destroyed, its
    eyes and the linked orb shatter into worthless dust.
  - >-
    Construction A gargoyle guardian's body is made from 1,000 pounds of dense
    stone-typically of the colors and designs of the structure or memorial it is
    meant to guard-and treated with 1,000 gp worth of rare minerals and precious
    filigree.
