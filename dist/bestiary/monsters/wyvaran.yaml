Description:
  - >-
    These creatures are the result of magical draconic experiments at
    crossbreeding wyverns and kobolds. Wyvarans are fiercely territorial
    creatures loyal to their kin and tribe, and allow no interlopers into their
    lands without good reason or proper tribute. Each defends its personal
    property, and seeks revenge on any who dare steal from it. Most evil and
    neutral wyvarans primarily concern themselves with expanding their territory
    and wealth. Many civilized races dismiss wyvarans as fast, dumb, selfish
    brutes. However, a creature who respects the wyvarans' rules about their
    property finds that they make steadfast and loyal allies. Adventuring
    wyvarans often view their companions as clutchmates, and are willing to take
    great risks to protect them.
