SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Multispell (Ex)
    description: >-
      An arach spellcaster (one that has taken levels in a spellcasting class)
      can cast multiple spells in a given round. If each spell is 3rd-level or
      less, an arach can cast up to three spells per round; 4th- or 5th-level
      spells, two per round. An arach cannot multispell spells higher than
      5th-level.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Arach Venom: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds;
      effect 1d4 Str; cure 1 save. An arach can also coat a single weapon it
      wields with this poison as a move action. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Spider Passivism (Ex)
    description: >-
      No spiders, monstrous spiders, phase spiders, temporal crawlers, sand
      stalkers, arachnid werecreatures (such as werespiders) or other
      spider-like creatures with an Intelligence of 8 or less willingly attack
      an arach. They can be forced to do so through magical means however. If
      the arach or one of its allies attacks the creature first, this passivism
      is negated for that creature for 24 hours.
Description:
  - >-
    Arachs are a strange union of sentient arachnids and humanoids. With the
    exception of their heads, they are completely hairless, and their skin
    ranges from glossy brown to grey and pitch black with white plates on the
    males and red plates on the females. Many believe they were once worshippers
    of the spider god who long ago were granted this horrid transformation.
    Arachs live in small colonies (called nests among their own kind) in caves
    and caverns deep underground. They generally shun other subterranean races
    preferring to keep company with their own kind. Occasionally an arach nest
    makes an alliance with a band of driders though such a union is usually
    short-lived (the races get along, but don't particularly like each other for
    unknown reasons). A nest is led by the most powerful spellcaster among the
    members, usually a sorcerer or wizard of at least 7th level. Arach nests
    include an equal number of male and female members. Both forage and hunt for
    the nest, and in times of battle, both fight to defend the lair. During
    mating season, females are less active as they await the birth of their
    young. Young are always born live and a typical female spawns 1d4 young at
    one time. Young arachs reach maturity after 6 years. An arach stands about 6
    to 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds. Arach spellcasters open with
    a whirlwind of blows from their swordwielding arms. Arach fighters either
    opt for multiple blows from their short swords, or wield two large weapons
    or pole arms with no penalty for off handed attacks due to their use of
    three arms to balance and attack. An arach spellbinder opens combat with a
    lightning bolt or touch of idiocy (if an opponent is within range). It
    follows this with a magic missile assault and then continues the battle
    mixing sword attacks and spell attacks. All arachs summon spiders in the
    first round of combat if possible to absorb larger numbers of enemies or
    quickly overwhelm smaller numbers of foes. Arach Characters Arachs have
    racial Hit Dice and can have class levels. Most arachs are sorcerers or
    wizards. Arach clerics tend to worship gods of magic and spiders, and can
