Description:
  - >-
    Most often found in urban environments, this gremlin lives among humanity,
    taunting religious and scholarly organizations with its pranks. Monaciello
    gremlins are most commonly found in monasteries and cathedrals where they
    wriggle their way up from the sewers and catacombs to play tricks on the
    devout. These tricksters pull blankets off sleeping clergy members, harass
    servants, spoil food, and hide valuables from their owners. Enamored with
    gold, they often overinf late the value of things with illusions, and even
    throw handfuls of gold coins (or illusions of gold coins if they are feeling
    especially stingy) to distract creatures on their trail. They pull these
    coins from their ever-present magical bags, confident they can always pilfer
    more. A monaciello stands 2-1/2 feet tall and weighs approximately 20
    pounds.
