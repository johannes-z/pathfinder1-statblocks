SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Magic Bag (Su)
    description: >-
      A monaciello always carries its pouch with it. This pouch contains an
      extradimensional space and operates like a bag of holding (type I). If
      this pouch is separated from the monaciello, all of its former contents
      are lost, and it becomes a normal bag that contains a number of coins
      equal to double the treasure value of a creature of the gremlin's CR. A
      monaciello that loses its pouch must create a new one, a process that
      takes 1d4 days. Until the new pouch is finished, it remains a non-magical
      bag, only becoming a fully functional extradimensional space once
      completed.

    description: >-
      A monaciello gremlin is surrounded by an aura of blasphemy. Any creatures
      channeling energy within 20 feet of a monaciello must succeed at a DC 12
      Will save or be unable to channel for that round. The use is not lost, but
      the action is wasted.
Description:
  - >-
    Most often found in urban environments, this gremlin lives among humanity,
    taunting religious and scholarly organizations with its pranks. Monaciello
    gremlins are most commonly found in monasteries and cathedrals where they
    wriggle their way up from the sewers and catacombs to play tricks on the
    devout. These tricksters pull blankets off sleeping clergy members, harass
    servants, spoil food, and hide valuables from their owners. Enamored with
    gold, they often overinf late the value of things with illusions, and even
    throw handfuls of gold coins (or illusions of gold coins if they are feeling
    especially stingy) to distract creatures on their trail. They pull these
    coins from their ever-present magical bags, confident they can always pilfer
    more. A monaciello stands 2-1/2 feet tall and weighs approximately 20
    pounds.
