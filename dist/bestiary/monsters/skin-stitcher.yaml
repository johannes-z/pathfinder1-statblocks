SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Augmented Critical (Ex)
    description: >-
      If the skin stitcher scores a critical hit with a chain rake, it deals
      triple normal damage to an opponent.
  - name: Rage (Ex)
    description: >-
      A skin stitcher that takes damage in combat has a 50% chance of flying
      into a berserk rage the following round, attacking its foe until either it
      or its opponent is dead. It gains +4 Strength and -4 AC while raging. The
      skin stitcher cannot end its rage voluntarily. Note that the skin stitcher
      does not drop its chains while raging.
  - name: Skin Scent (Ex)
    description: >-
      The skin stitcher can detect any living creature that possesses natural
      skin to a distance of one-half mile. This includes all creature types, in
      most cases, except plants, elementals, oozes, constructs, vermin, and many
      undead (undead with flesh, such as zombies, can be detected by a skin
      stitcher, but skeletons cannot).
Description:
  - >-
    A skin stitcher is a malevolent and violent creature that kills for food,
    pleasure, and the skin of humanoids (which it keeps and collects). While it
    is known to eat just about anything it kills, it only keeps the skin and
    flesh of humanoid creatures. Other creatures are devoured, flesh and all.
  - Skin stitchers collect the flesh and skin of any humanoid creature slain.
  - >-
    From this, they weave intricate clothes and coverings that they wear over
    their entire body. At a distance, the skin stitcher can pass for a normal
    humanoid when wearing one of these "skin suits" (Perception check DC 20 to
    reveal its true identity). Up close, the skin stitcher's disguise becomes
    much less effective, making it appear as a humanoid with a heavily scarred
    and stitched together body.
  - >-
    The skin stitcher stands about 6 feet tall and (in its true form) appears as
    a skinless humanoid. Its natural body appears to be bone wrapped tightly
    with corded muscle and covered with a dark red-purplish slime. Its eye
    sockets are deep and contain large bulbous eyes with blue irises. The skin
    stitcher's long, lanky arms end in claws as do its thick, muscled legs. It
    carries two large chains covered with many sharpened barbs.
  - >-
    Though their hands are clawed, skin stitchers prefer to attack using large
    chains covered with razor-sharp barbs. These not only aid in killing a foe,
    but also help strip the flesh from a victim. Skin stitchers often attack
    from ambush, attempting to gain the upper hand over their prey as quickly as
    possible. Slain opponents are skinned and then eaten or carried to the skin
    stitcher's lair and devoured later.
