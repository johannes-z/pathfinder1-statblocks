Description:
  - >-
    Night adders are nocturnal inphidians who often serve as assassin-priests,
    monks or sorcerers in an inphidian nest. They act as advisors, counselors,
    and magistrates to the rulers and leaders while simultaneously serving as
    healers, lorekeepers, and sages to the common inphidian populace. A night
    adder, much alike all inphidians, is a snake-like humanoid whose hands have
    been replaced with the head of a snake; in the case of a night adder, its
    snake-hands resemble a black mamba. Its body is black and its eyes are a
    pale rose. A night adder stands 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs 190 pounds. Night
    adders attack with their multiple bites seeking to inflict as many venomous
    bites on a single foe as possible before moving on to the next target. Night
    adder clerics and sorcerers use area and ranged attack spells, then power up
    with defensive and offensive personal effect magic before entering melee.
