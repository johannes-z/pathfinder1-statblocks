Description:
  - >-
    Morrignas are Purgatory's investigators, bounty hunters, and assassins,
    tracking down those who flout the natural cycle of death and judgment. They
    stand 7 to 8 feet tall and weigh 200 to 250 pounds. Many morrignas prefer to
    assume the appearances of those who have died. They ensure the smooth
    operation of death's bureaucratic machine by eliminating complications,
    dedicating their existence to wiping out any forces that circumvent or
    corrupt the natural cycle of death and judgment.
