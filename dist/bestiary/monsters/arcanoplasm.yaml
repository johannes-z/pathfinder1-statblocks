SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Absorb Arcane Energy (Su)
    description: >-
      Any arcane spell targeted at an arcanoplasm is automatically absorbed into
      its body. This cures 1 point of damage per 3 points of damage the spell
      would otherwise deal (non-damaging spells cure 1 point of damage per spell
      level). Spells that affect an area are not absorbed, but neither do they
      affect the arcanoplasm. The arcanoplasm cannot absorb divine magic and is
      affected normally by such magic.
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: An arcanoplasm secretes a highly corrosive acid that dissolves only flesh.
  - name: Arcane Spell Mimicry (Su)
    description: >-
      An arcanoplasm can mimic any arcane spell cast within 30 feet of it on its
      next turn. The spell takes effect as if cast by a 7th-level sorcerer (save
      DC 14 + spell level) and does not require any components. The arcanoplasm
      cannot mimic spells a 7th-level arcane caster could not normally cast
      (i.e., it cannot mimic divine spells, or arcane spells of 5th level or
      higher). The save DC is Charisma-based. Due to their innately magical
      nature, an arcanoplasm adds its Constitution modifier in addition to its
      Charisma modifier to all concentration checks to cast a spell using arcane
      spell mimicry.
  - name: Arcanesense (Su)
    description: >-
      An arcanoplasm can automatically detect the location of any arcane
      spellcaster within 100 feet. This functions like blindsense but is not
      blocked by stone, lead, or other material, and can only sense the location
      of arcane spellcasters Thought to be the result of a failed magic
      experiment, wizards and sorcerers alike have tried for years to gather
      information on this alien creature, but thus far such information has
      eluded even the most resourceful of casters.
Description:
  - >-
    Arcanoplasms are found in areas where the residual energies of arcane magic
    linger. Such areas include ruined wizard towers, keeps, dungeons, and so
    forth. Here they feed and remain until disturbed. Most encounters with these
    monsters are take place in such locations as the arcanoplasm rarely travels
    far from its lair. And since it lairs in ruins and other such
    adventurer-attracting places, it rarely has to wait long between meals.
    Arcanoplasms always target arcane spellcasting creatures first. Their innate
    ability to detect such creatures allows them to do so with precision
    accuracy. Because of its ability to replicate spells cast near it, the
    arcanoplasm always tries to stay within 30 feet of an arcane caster.
    Mimicked spells are cast at the foe deemed most threatening. Note that
    because an arcanoplasm's arcane spell mimicry is a supernatural ability and
    not actual spellcasting, it cannot absorb arcane energy from spells it casts
    itself. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
