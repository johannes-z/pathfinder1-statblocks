SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bury Alive (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Gravedragger can telekinetically pull a target
      within 100 feet into a grave (or a similar physical hole in the ground
      that is an appropriate size for burying the target) and bury it.
      Gravedragger must be adjacent to the grave he intends to drag his target
      into. Treat this as a special drag combat maneuver. The target takes 4d6
      points of damage (Reflex DC 22 half) and is buried alive (see Cave-Ins and
      Collapses on page 415 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Long Arm of the Reaper (Ex)
    description: >-
      Gravedragger can throw his heavy pick up to 100 feet away as a ranged
      attack with no range increment. The weapon automatically returns just
      before the herald's next turn, as if it had the returning weapon quality.
  - name: Unearthly Luck (Su)
    description: >-
      Gravedragger adds his Charisma bonus as a luck bonus on all his saving
      throws and to his Armor Class.
  - name: Unluck Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Gravedragger radiates an aura of unluck to a radius of 30 feet. Any
      creature in this area must roll two d20s whenever a situation calls for a
      d20 roll (such as an attack roll, a skill check, or a saving throw) and
      must use the lower of the two results. This is a mind-affecting effect
      that doesn't work on worshipers of Zyphus. Any creature that gains any
      sort of luck bonus (such as that granted by a luckstone or divine favor)
      is immune to Gravedragger's unluck aura.
Description:
  - >-
    Gravedragger is a cruel prankster who enjoys murdering innocents in
    unexpected, horrid, ironic, and tragic ways. In the same way that children
    fear the mysterious bogeymen, adults cower at the thought of Gravedragger
    bringing them to a painful end. Unlike Pharasma, who enforces fated and
    inevitable death, the herald of Zyphus is a break from destiny's plan-a
    sudden deviation that leads to danger and ruin. Gravedragger appears as a
    vaguely humanoid mass of grave dirt and bones, and wields a heavy pick made
    of a rib bone punched through a giant's skull. He also takes the form of an
    old, thin human man with shifty eyes and a sickening, toothy smile. In this
    form he is known as "Grinning Jack," often shortened to "Grinjack."
    Gravedragger speaks in a high, mad voice, and is prone to outbursts of
    cackling even when cloaked by invisibility.
  - >-
    Divinations by the faithful show that Gravedragger was once a mortal farmer.
    When his wife and family fell ill with a sickness, he traveled to the
    nearest village to get aid from the healer. When he returned with a curative
    potion, he found that his home had been struck by lightning and burned to
    the ground; his family, too sick to crawl out, had perished in the fire. The
    man's mind snapped, broken by the idea that he could have prevented his
    loved ones' random and pointless deaths if he hadn't been away from home. He
    embraced the cult of Zyphus and began studying magic, using his abilities to
    stalk and kill clerics of rival faiths as well as to ambush adventurers to
    slay them in their sleep or after difficult battles. After a long,
    successful life at this morbid career, he died in his sleep, and in Zyphus's
    realm he was infused with divine power and became the god's herald.
    Remorseless and vindictive, Gravedigger now enjoys his role as the bringer
    of bad luck and the foil of fate, and every
  - >-
    death he causes buries a little bit deeper the guilt he feels for his
    family's deaths.
  - >-
    Although Gravedragger enjoys lurking in graveyards, where he can easily use
    his bury alive ability, he isn't a harbinger of deserved deaths and is bored
    by the idea of dispatching wounded soldiers-something he feels is the job of
    psychopomps. Instead, Gravedragger revels in unexpected methods of murder,
    such as causing a fallen armored knight to drown in a couple inches of mud
    after being pulled from his horse.
  - >-
    The herald uses invisibility and greater invisibility to sneak up on his
    targets and aff lict them with curses or blindness, blow them off cliffs
    (with gust of wind or telekinesis), call sudden bolts of lightning, or
    create symptomless deaths (using slay living). He might attack from
    invisibility for 1 or 2 rounds, then leave if he fails to kill anyone
    quickly-his interest is in spontaneity and sudden death, not extended
    battle. He usually employs these tactics even if tasked with slaying a
    specific person, as it's more entertaining to him to set up an elaborate
    ambush than to confront his opponent directly. Sometimes he's content to
    just follow his prey unobserved, creepily breaking the silence with his
    tittering laugh and unnerving the victim so much that it stumbles into a
    natural trap or flees in terror toward a wild creature's lair.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Created from a mortal soul and raised to his station by a god, Gravedragger
    is sustained by divine power and like other outsiders has no need to eat or
    drink. However, he has often been seen hovering over a dead or dying victim,
    inhaling deeply as if sucking out remnants of the mortal's soul. He claims
    these breaths sustain him in place of food or air, but there's no evidence
    that he actually needs to do this; the habit is probably just some perverse
    torture intended to unnerve his victims in their last moments. When in his
    Grinjack form, he often pretends to be a Pharasmin priest, administering
    false last rites to doomed mortals just to enjoy the sound of their death
    rattles.
  - >-
    While Gravedragger's physical body appears to be composed of nonliving
    materials, he's a living creature and this appearance is only his outer
    "skin." When damaged, he bleeds red blood, pungent yellow bile, and-if the
    wound is large enough-dismembered humanoid body parts such as hands, limbs,
    and heads. As he doesn't eat, these parts are probably physical
    manifestations of the countless lives he has taken in the name of Zyphus.
    Immortal and able to recover from severe wounds, he would rather escape a
    fight than allow himself to die, for he has felt death as a mortal and has
    no desire to repeat the experience.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Gravedragger spends most of his time in Zyphus' realm in Abaddon, exchanging
    grisly stories with the souls of Zyphus's faithful and other divine
    servitors. Left unsupervised to perform whatever murderous mischief he
    pleases, Gravedragger visits Golarion to enact petty revenge, blasphemous
    murders, and countless "accidental" deaths.
  - >-
    The herald sometimes associates with various daemons who help him effect
    these structured accidents, particularly hydrodaemons (death by drowning),
    leukodaemons (death by plague), meladaemons (death by starvation and
    thirst), and crucidaemons (death by traps). In the mortal world,
    Gravedragger has a fondness for pugwampis and trickster fey, especially
    bogeymen, and has been known to guide their efforts or even transport them
    over long distances to save them from extermination or help them to find new
    victims. He sometimes sneaks into a city in his Grinjack form carrying a
    sack of pugwampis and releases them upon an unsuspecting urban population,
    cackling glee as he watches the aftermath.
