Description_Visual: >-
  This tiny hunting spider is about the size of a man's fist. It is pallid
  white, often with irregular light brown blotches on its abdomen, which helps
  it blend in with the toadstools and fungus which is its home. The albino cave
  spider normally feeds on normal and dire rats, but it attacks anything that
  comes within range.

Description:
  - >-
    Albino cave spiders hunt rats in caves or in deep underground regions where
    the sun never reaches. These tiny killers are extremely sensitive to
    movement, and despite their unique coloring, are highly adept at hiding and
    stealthy stalking.
  - >-
    The albino cave spider is mildly toxic, as some of the other Under Realm
    predators have discovered. They use their poisonous bite to sicken prey and
    follow until they can feast on the remains.
  - >-
    Male and female cave spiders are roughly the same size, with females being
    slightly larger. The females are the predominant hunters, with the males
    tending to the web-nest when an eggsack is present. Both sexes are extremely
    protective of the eggsack, and attack larger foes when it is threatened.
