Description:
  - >-
    The hairs on a sea spider's legs trap air bubbles, which aid in floatation
    and mobility. With its long, strong legs a sea spider can propel itself
    underwater as easily as it can glide upon the surface. Sea spiders make
    their lairs in shallow underwater caverns in secluded lagoons of uninhabited
    islands. They never leave the sea as they cannot long stand the stillness of
    dry land.
  - >-
    Sea spiders survive on a diet of plants, coral, and undersea denizens,
    preferring shark and eel to other aquatic life. A meal is devoured
    immediately, though not necessarily digested immediately. A sea spider has
    an extra stomach in which it stores food for later digestion. This allows
    the spider to go long periods of time between meals.
  - >-
    A sea spider is about 16 feet long and resembles a monstrous spider with fur
    of varying hues of blues and greens.
  - >-
    Sea spiders never venture on land, confining their attacks to ships. They
    usually attach themselves to the ship with the sticky hairs of their hind
    legs. This brings their mouth to the level of the deck where they may bite
    the ship, trying to disable it, or any person in close range. Their forelegs
    are free to swing at opponents. If no one is in range, the sea spider
    relocates to another area of the ship and attack again. Their primary tactic
    is to grapple opponents and draw them to the mouth, attempting to swallow
    them whole.
