    description: A dvorovoi can wield weapons sized for Medium creatures without penalty.
  - name: Wild Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability works like the druid ability of the same name. The dvorovoi's
      total bonus includes a +8 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Just as the domovoi protect the home, the dvorovoi protect a villager's yard
    and pasture. Some farmers try to lure dvorovoi to their farmsteads by
    leaving an offering of bread, sheep's wool, or shiny trinkets. When the
    owner of a farmstead with a dvorovoi purchases a new animal, he leads it
    through the yard to introduce it to the dvorovoi, hoping to gain the fey
    creature's approval of the new livestock.
  - >-
    Though undeniably useful to have around for feeding the cattle and keeping
    predators away from flocks, dvorovoi can be capricious. Dvorovoi despise any
    white animal, and will never tolerate a white-furred horse or cow in their
    presence. For unknown reasons, dvorovoi doesn't hold this same grudge toward
    white chickens.
