SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Detonate (Su)
    description: >-
      A blood hag in fiery form can explode in a 30-foot-radius burst that deals
      8d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 18 for half). Using this ability
      returns a blood hag to her normal form. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Mask Evil (Su)
    description: >-
      During the day, a blood hag "wears her skin," giving her the appearance of
      a young woman. When so disguised, the blood hag can't use her bite, claws,
      or fiery form ability. At night, she bursts out of her skin and returns to
      her monstrous form. The hag regrows her skin each dawn. While a blood hag
      is wearing her skin, her alignment is masked as though by a constant
      undetectable alignment spell.
Description:
  - >-
    Blood hags, known to some as soucouyants, prefer to live near isolated human
    communities or on the edge of civilized lands. A blood hag takes the
    appearance of a young woman by day. At night, she assumes her true form, as
    her skin peels back and sloughs off to reveal the monstrosity beneath. A
    hunting blood hag preys on unsuspecting neighbors during the night, sneaking
    into their homes and feeding off their blood or burning them alive. When a
    blood hag finds a particularly choice victim, she forgoes simply feeding on
    her, and instead abducts her, spiriting her away to the hag's hidden lair,
    where she'll be tortured and drained dry of blood over the course of days or
    weeks. Once the hag has properly prepared the victim's skin, she wears it.
    Bold and particularly clever blood hags attempt to masquerade as their
    victims for a time. Blood hags of exceptional talent typically gain levels
    in the witch class.
  - BLOOD HAG COVENS
  - >-
    A hag coven containing a blood hag loses access to the control weather and
    speak with dead spell-like abilities. Instead, the coven gains access to
    death ward, fire storm, and nightmare. When all three hags of the coven are
    within 10 feet of one another, the other hags gain the fire immunity and
    spell resistance of the blood hag. Blood hags absolutely loathe submitting
    to the authority of others, and rarely form covens with other blood hags or
    with any hags of power comparable to or greater than their own.
