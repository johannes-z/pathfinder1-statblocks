  with metal.

  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A lead skeleton is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. A magical attack that
      deals sonic damage slows a lead skeleton (as the slow spell) for 1d4
      rounds, with no saving throw.
Description:
  - >-
    Lead skeletons appear simply to be skeletons coated with metal. Despite
    their outward appearance, they are actually golem-like constructs and not
    undead. Therefore, they cannot be turned.
  - Lead skeletons appear as 6-foot tall skeletons constructed of metal.
  - >-
    Some have gemstones encrusted in the body and eye sockets. A lead skeleton
    is expensive to create. Those who choose to create such creatures prefer the
    added fear and awe the skeletons tend to receive, and have a great deal of
    additional wealth and time.
  - >-
    Lead skeletons can be programmed to attack only certain creatures or be
    programmed to accept certain passwords or types of clothing. More complex
    programming tends to fail. While lead skeletons might not have the same
    abilities as other golems, their immunities and speed make them
    extraordinarily dangerous. They use their fists to inflict large amounts of
    damage and attack a single target until it is dead.
  - >-
    Construction Bones from a full humanoid skeleton are carefully sheathed in
    an alloy of lead and iron and rejoined with iron or steel hinges. The total
    cost of the body must be at least 2,000 gp. An elemental spirit is summoned
    during the creation and bound to the body. To bind the elemental spirit, the
    creator must summon and confine an elemental using any of the planar binding
    spells.
