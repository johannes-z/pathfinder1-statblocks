SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Item Use (Su)
    description: >-
      The amalgamation can use any of the items contained within its bulk. When
      activating magic items, it is considered to be using them as if a person
      of the required class, with a 20 in any relevant ability scores (or its
      natural scores, whichever are better). Furthermore, because of its innate
      magical nature, the save DC against any effects produced by magic items is
      2 greater than normal. Finally, it can wield weapons and items as if it
      were of the appropriate size class for their type, so it suffers no hit
      penalties for being a Gargantuan construct with such items. Unless
      instructed otherwise, the amalgamation uses items at random from its bulk.
      However, it does not target them randomly-it uses them with care and
      precision, as if it had 18 Intelligence. Items with limited uses, such as
      scrolls and wands, are expended normally.
  - name: Multiple Attacks (Ex)
    description: >-
      The amalgamation can activate and use up to five items per round. It can
      therefore attack with weapons, activate magic items, hurl alchemical items
      like thunderstones, or slam random objects against opponents.
  - name: Swarm Attack (Ex)
    description: >-
      The amalgamation can move over enemies and damage them with the flying
      weapons and objects composing its bulk. It does this simply by moving over
      its victims, who are allowed either a DC 34 Reflex save or an attack of
      opportunity against the amalgamation, at their option. Anyone who begins
      their turn engulfed by the amalgamation takes 10d6 points of damage per
      round, with a DC 34 Reflex save allowed for half. This is not considered
      an area effect for the purposes of evasion and similar abilities. The
      damage inflicted by the amalgamation overcomes all forms of damage
      reduction except epic. The save DC for both Reflex saves is
      Dexterity-based. Further, this damage is considered continuous for the
      purposes of determining if it disrupts spellcasting, concentration and the
      like.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      The amalgamation is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted: Dispel magic and greater
      dispel magic can be used to deactivate magic items, as per a targeted item
      dispel. Mage's disjunction causes it to subside into quiescence for 1d4+1
      rounds, during which time it is considered helpless.
Description:
  - >-
    The amalgamation is a special creation used by certain ancient spellcasters
    to defend their hordes and treasure vaults-for even should the guardian
    fall, most of the items being guarded would be destroyed, and hence not fall
    into enemy hands. The creature is composed of a large number of magical and
    mundane items, and it can use any of them to attack. Because of its magical
    nature, the amalgamation can even wield magic items such as wands without
    penalty. The amalgamation resembles a vortex or cloud of items 20 ft. in
    diameter, swirling within a shimmering field of energy. The precise
    appearance of the construct depends on the items that comprise its bulk.
