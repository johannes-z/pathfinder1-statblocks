SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Conductivity (Ex)
    description: >-
      A magical attack that deals electricity damage speeds up a golden guardian
      (as the haste spell) for 1d4 rounds. A golden guardian gets no saving
      throw against electricity effects.
  - name: Heat (Ex)
    description: >-
      A golden guardian's body generates intense heat, dealing 1d6 points of
      fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it grapples.
      Creatures attacking a golden guardian with unarmed strikes or natural
      weapons are also subject to the golden guardian's heat.
  - name: Molten Destruction (Ex)
    description: >-
      When reduced to 0 hit points, a golden guardian superheats and instantly
      melts into a pile of molten gold. All creatures within a 10-foot-radius
      spread take 6d6 points of fire damage; a DC 14 Reflex save halves the
      damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Heat Shimmer (Ex)
    description: >-
      The intense heat radiating from a golden guardian's body creates a
      wavering shimmer in the air that makes the construct difficult to see
      clearly. This functions as a blur spell (CL 8th), except it cannot be
      dispelled.
Description:
  - >-
    Golden guardians are humanoid automatons formed of iron, steel, and most of
    all, gold. Their appearance can range from rough, lumpy humanoid shapes to
    statue-shaped conglomerations of gold coins to exquisitely detailed gilded
    statues with eerily accurate human faces. Golden guardians are powered by a
    fiery, molten core of pure gold, which radiates a shimmering heat. Golden
    guardians cannot speak, and move with the sound of metal scraping on metal.
    A golden guardian stands 7 feet tall and weighs 1,500 pounds. Construction
    The framework of a golden guardian is built from 1,200 pounds of steel rods
    and pins and then covered in 100 pounds of gold plating. Its insides are
    filled with 200 pounds of molten gold before the entire construct is sealed.
    Once assembled, the gold plating is sprinkled with rare powders and herbs
    worth at least 300 gp. A golden guardian uses 15,000 gp of raw gold in its
    construction. Golden Guardian CL 12th; Price 33,300 gp Construction
    Requirements Craft Construct, blur, fabricate, fire shield, geas/quest, wall
    of fire, creator must be caster level 12th; Skill Craft (goldsmith) DC 17;
