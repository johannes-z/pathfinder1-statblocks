Description_Visual: >-
  These great masses of floating amorphous flesh appear to be covered in
  bloodshot, weeping eyes and disgustingly vile mouths. The gibbering orb is a
  pulsing mass of sickly greyish-green flesh, roughly 20 ft. in diameter. The
  orb distends and undulates as it flies, seeming to spasm through the air
  rather than fly. The creature does not seem to have a top or bottom, nor does
  it have any form of appendages for handling objects.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Eye Rays (Su)
    description: >-
      Two dozen of the eyes can each produce a magical ray each round, with each
      eye emulating a spell from among the list of spells below (CL 27th). The
      save DCs, where applicable, are 16 + spell level. A gibbering orb has no
      directional limitations on where it can point its eye rays, because the
      eyes orbiting around its body drift and float wherever needed. However, a
      gibbering orb can never aim more than five rays at any single target, due
      to limitations of aiming. All rays have a range of 150 ft. Each of these
      effects functions as a ray, regardless of the normal parameters of the
      spell it resembles. That is, each is usable against a single target and
      requires a ranged touch attack. The eye rays are: cone of cold,
      disintegrate, dominate monster, energy drain, feeblemind, finger of death,
      flesh to stone, greater dispel magic, harm, hold monster, horrid wilting,
      implosion, inflict critical wounds, lightning bolt, magic missile, mage's
      disjunction, irresistible dance, baleful polymorph, power word blind,
      power word kill, power word stun, prismatic spray, slay living, and
      temporal stasis.
  - name: Flight (Ex)
    description: >-
      The gibbering orb's body is naturally buoyant. This buoyancy allows it to
      fly as the spell, as a free action, at a speed of 20 ft. This buoyancy
      also grants it a permanent feather fall effect with personal range.
  - name: Gibbering (Su)
    description: >-
      The cacophony of speech emanating from the scores of mouths that make up
      the orb forces all within 60 ft. of the creature to succeed at a DC 29
      Will save each round or suffer the effects of an insanity spell. Steal
      Spell/Steal Spell-Like
  - name: Ability (Su)
    description: >-
      When a creature dies by being swallowed whole (or when a creature killed
      by the gibbering orb in some other fashion is eaten by it), the gibbering
      orb absorbs the creature's known spells, prepared spells, and spell-like
      abilities. The orb can use any two of those abilities per round as a free
      action. Each originates from an eye that is not producing an eye ray (see
      above) that round. Stolen spells and spell-like abilities are lost after
      24 hours.
Description:
  - >-
    These great harbingers of insanity and chaos are fortunately very rare
    indeed. Locked away by whatever powers preserve order and sanity, the
    gibbering orbs occasionally make their way to the civilized world to satiate
    its ravenous hunger for sentient beings. While the
  - >-
    gibbering orb looks like a mass of chaotic, insanely impossible flesh, it is
    a clever and very intelligent adversary. If any being is so foolish as to
    attack a gibbering orb, it hurls itself at its foes with complete abandon,
    somehow making tactical decisions despite its completely random approach to
    destruction.
  - >-
    Gibbering orbs speak all languages, and frequently speak in several tongues
    at once to disorient their opponents. Gibbering orbs are incapable of
    speaking in a non-dominant role, their egos are too vast.
  - >-
    Gibbering orbs are 20 feet or more in diameter, weighing at least 8,000
    pounds. Their coloration varies from a sickly, mottled gray to luminescent
    green or deep magenta at random intervals. The orbs flesh spasms and
    twitches constantly, and the entire surface is covered in eyes, mouths and
    other incomprehensible appendages. The orb has no obvious top or bottom; as
    it hovers, the entire mass continuously rotates so no one side is ever in
    direct contact with opponents for longer than a few seconds.
  - >-
    Gibbering orbs are planar travelers; fortunately, they grow bored of one
    place quickly. The only time gibbering orbs maintain a residence for long in
    any one place is if they are guarding some location for their own amusement,
    or if they are stranded or bound to a location. Woe to those who stumble
    upon an orb that cannot leave of its own free will!
  - >-
    Gibbering orbs in combat are forces of nature. They attack with seeming
    abandon, although they are incredibly intelligent, their ego does not allow
    them to comprehend the concept other being are as powerful as they are.
    Gibbering orbs consume there foes fully, drawing them into their various
    mouths; thus, any treasure found with a gibbering orb is one the inside of
    the creature.
  - >-
    Gibbering orbs are never found together. It is unknown how they reproduce,
    and such an event would most likely take place in a very secluded lair.
