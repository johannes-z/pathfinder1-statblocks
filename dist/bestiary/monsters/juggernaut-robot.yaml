SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Atomizer (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action once every 3 rounds, a juggernaut robot can fire a
      ray from its eye as a ranged touch attack. On a hit, the ray deals 15d6
      points of damage. When used against an object, the atomizer disintegrates
      as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. A creature or object that
      succeeds at a DC 21 Fortitude save instead takes only 5d6 points of
      damage. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this attack is
      entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A
      disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected. The save DC is
      Intelligence-based.
  - name: Charge Fist (Ex)
    description: >-
      A juggernaut robot can charge its oversized fists with electricity as a
      free action, causing its slam attacks to deal 1d6 points of electricity
      damage. On a critical hit, a charged strike explodes with electric energy,
      dealing an additional 1d10 points of electricity damage. This electricity
      doesn't harm the juggernaut.
  - name: Combined Arms (Ex)
    description: >-
      When taking a full-attack action, a juggernaut robot can attack with its
      melee and ranged integrated weapons simultaneously.
  - name: Electromagnetic Pulse (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a juggernaut robot can unleash an
      electromagnetic pulse in a 20- foot radius that bypasses any active force
      fields (or similar effects) and deals 6d6 points of electricity damage to
      any robots or creatures with cybernetic implants. This effect doesn't harm
      the juggernaut robot itself or other living creatures. Creatures affected
      by this attack that succeed at a DC 21 Reflex save take only half the
      normal amount of damage. Any technological item within this radius is
      drained of 1d6 charges unless the item succeeds at a DC 21 Reflex save.
      The save DCs are Intelligence-based.
  - name: Force Field (Ex)
    description: >-
      A juggernaut robot is sheathed in a thin layer of shimmering energy that
      grants it 75 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a juggernaut with an
      active force field is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the
      force field is active, the juggernaut is immune to critical hits. A
      juggernaut's force field has fast healing 10, but once these bonus hit
      points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not
      reactivate for 24 hours.
  - name: Integrated Heavy Lasers (Ex)
    description: >-
      A juggernaut robot has a heavy laser rifle built into each of its arms.
      Each weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 4d10 points of fire damage.
      Each can fire once per round in a burst of shots that attacks all
      creatures in a line. This line starts from any corner of the robot's space
      and extends to the limit of the weapon's range or until it strikes a
      barrier it can't penetrate. The robot must make a separate attack roll
      against each creature in the line, and each creature in the line can be
      attacked with only one shot from each burst. Each attack roll takes a -2
      penalty, and its damage can't be modified by precision damage or
      damage-increasing feats such as Vital Strike. Invisible creatures are
      immune to damage caused by a laser weapon. Fog, smoke, and other clouds
      provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Darkness
      (magical or otherwise) has no effect on lasers other than providing
      concealment. Roll to confirm each attack roll that threatens a critical
      hit separately.
  - name: Targeting Array (Ex)
    description: >-
      Juggernaut robots see invisible creatures or objects as if they were
      visible. In addition, because of their complex array of sensors,
      juggernauts suffer no miss chance if a target has concealment, and reduce
      the miss chance from total concealment to 20%.
  - name: Vicious Trample (Ex)
    description: >-
      A juggernaut robot's massive steel feet deal 6d6+19 points of damage on a
      successful trample attack.
Description:
  - >-
    Easily the rarest of all robots in Numeria, these metallic monstrosities
    wreak havoc upon those who trespass upon the remnants of the strange vessel
    that crashed into Golarion's crust eons ago. The original reasons behind the
    creation of such titanic constructs remains a mystery. However, the Technic
    League quickly surmised that these metal giants excelled at rendering other
    Numerian technology inert, which may give clues to the constructs' purpose.
    Wrought from a strange metallic alloy similar to iron and containing bizarre
    electronics and delicate sensors, the juggernaut rises to a height of 50
    feet and weighs well over 100 tons.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    To all but a select few, the juggernaut's inner workings are an inscrutable
    tangle of wires, circuits, and strange metallic widgets. Its crude humanoid
    silhouette, complete with dangling simian-like forearms, belies its alien
    visage: a sleek dome with a single, unblinking ovoid eye, behind which lies
    a dazzling array of multihued sensors. Thick cords twist over the robot's
    forearms before feeding into
  - >-
    cannon-like barrels that pulse with energy. Oversized fists crackle with
    lightning and explode with thunderous force upon impact. However terrible
    these weapons are, nothing in the juggernaut's arsenal is feared more than
    the ray of death that its central orb emits-a sickly hued beam that reduces
    all materials to a fine green dust. Luckily, this devastating attack is
    heralded by a series of swirling lights and high-pitched whines that mimic a
    colossal teapot about to explode.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    These goliaths serve as sentinels to the larger shards of their shattered
    starship. Occasionally mistaken for enormous statuary or tributes left
    behind from a forgotten age, these humongous robots lie inert until the
    location they guard is breached. At that point, they come to life amid the
    loud whir of alien machinery, the stench of ozone, and the terrified screams
    of the intruders. Luckily, the sites these brutes guard often lie deep
    within Silver Mount, out of reach of all but the most determined scavengers.
  - >-
    Strangely, these massive constructs seem to have a close, almost
    paternalistic, relationship towards the more common gearsmen of Numeria.
    Most attempts by the Technic League to get a juggernaut to attack a
    functioning gearsman prove ineffective, and much like their smaller
    counterparts, juggernauts respond to both threats and censure with
    inscrutable silence.
  - >-
    Known Juggernaut Robots Though the Technic League has spent decades
    excavating technological wonders from the wreckage of the spacecraft that
    crashed to Golarion so long ago, only a few of the juggernauts that have
    been reclaimed still have any semblance of functionality. Descriptions of
    the most intensively studied specimens follow.

    The Living Monument: Straddling a deep crater and polished to a blinding
    sheen, this robot is worshiped by an indigenous tribe of Kellid warriors.
    Having calculated that the Kellids harbor no desire to unearth the cosmic
    shard that it has guarded for millennia, this juggernaut impassively
    tolerates the veneration it receives. The fact that its Kellid worshipers
    zealously oppose the Technic League's attempts to access the juggernaut
    causes the automaton to regard them as lesser guardians, almost as though
    they were gearsmen.
  - >-
    Specimen One: Unearthed deep beneath Silver Mount, this juggernaut was found
    inert within a colossal chamber. The debased arcanists of the Technic League
    disassembled the dormant hulk and catalogued its every wire, circuit, and
    cog. When they finished, they began the long, arduous process of reassembly.
    Unfortunately, their efforts were only partially successful. Now, only the
    juggernaut's massive robotic head remains "alive," forever calculating how
    it might escape from this pathetic existence amid a labyrinth of frayed
    wires, pitted alien alloys, and strange flickering bulbs.
