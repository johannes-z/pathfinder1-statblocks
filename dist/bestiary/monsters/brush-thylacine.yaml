Description_Visual: >-
  This odd creature is about the size of a dog, but it has the slender build of
  a cat, heavy whiskers, and dark stripes down its back. Its long tail flips
  about, smacking the ground as it scans the woods. It yips and bays in a
  complex pattern, offering warning to anything that may cross its path.

Description:
  - >-
    Thylacines are large marsupial carnivores. They typically hunt alone, only
    occasionally forming small packs. Thylacines hunt at night, and rest during
    the day in nests hidden away from the world in hollowed trees or bushes.
    Farmers fear the creatures, blaming all manner of problems on them. However,
    thylacines are quite shy and antisocial, and usually avoid human
    settlements. Because of their odd, almost hybrid appearance, thylacines have
    a far harsher reputation than they probably should, playing a sort of
    bogeyman role in farming communities. Ecology At a distance, thylacines are
    sometimes mistaken for dogs or jackals, but can be easily identified by the
    defining stripes on their gold-hued backs. Thylacines usually have between
    13 and 21 dark stripes. Their muscular jaws, filled with teeth, can gape
    open to an impressive 120 degrees. While thylacines may appear rather quick,
    they are far from proficient runners. Due to their oddly shaped legs, their
    run is awkward and slow. However, the animals can stand on their haunches
    for short periods, helping them to fend off other predators and kill larger
    prey. Thylacines are also capable jumpers, not dissimilar to kangaroos, and
    often surprise opponents with this ability. By most standards, a thylacine's
    senses aren't impressive. They can see and hear well enough to hunt prey,
    but their olfactory senses, while competent, do not approach canine levels.
    Thylacines hunt in a manner similar to wolves, focusing on wearing down prey
    by chasing and harrying instead of direct attacks. Their stomachs are able
    to greatly distend, enabling thylacines to eat vast amounts of food in a
    single sitting, devouring larger animals to compensate for long periods of
    drought or poor hunting. Thylacines are quite cowardly, avoiding
    confrontation whenever possible. If cornered, a thylacine tries to frighten
    off attackers with growls, hisses, and threat-yawns, in which it displays
    its teeth and the full extent of its wide jaws. If these threat displays are
    ineffective, however, a thylacine does not hesitate to attack. Their
    powerful jaws may not snap bones, but they can still make quick work of an
    unprepared traveler. In addition, thylacines are not picky eaters. If driven
    to starvation, they aren't afraid to hunt humans, in which case their
    nocturnal hunting cycles tend to lead them to attack sleeping travelers or
    outlying farms. Thylacines are fiercely independent. While wolves and other
    canines can be tamed and domesticated, thylacines are wild without
    exception. If captured, they become territorial and mark everything they can
    in their territories with strong-smelling odors from their scent glands.
    Many a farmer has made the sad mistake of attempting to domesticate a
    thylacine, only to find his farm smelling atrocious and his livestock killed
    in the night. An adult thylacine stands 2 feet tall at the shoulder, is 4
    feet long (not counting an additional 2 feet of tail), and weighs roughly 50
    pounds. The larger and more aggressive brush thylacine breed can reach
    almost 8 feet long from nose to tail-tip, though still only weighing 100
    pounds. Habitat & Society Thylacines breed year-round, but like most
    marsupials, they don't maintain strong family ties. Females keep their young
    in pouches. Unlike many marsupials, males also have pouches, but these are
    to protect their genitals, not their young. Females produce about 10 viable
    joeys in a given breeding season, but only about four can expect to see more
    than a year of life. The average thylacine lives between 4 and 10 years.
    Thylacines keep dens similar to those of plains mammals such as foxes and
    cougars. Dens are often very hard to find, in trees, caves, or other
    inconvenient locations out of the way of most predators, and in natural
    shade. Thylacine young reside in the den for only a short period, as joeys
    stay in their mothers' pouches for most of their development. During periods
    when a mother is incubating her young, she can be downright violent to
    trespassers or any other potential threats. Regional Variants Several breeds
    of thylacine are known to exist, hunting plains and woodlands in regions of
    Avistan, Garund, and beyond. Three of the most common are noted here. Blood
    Cougar: Not actually related to the big cats, Tian thylacines are known as
    blood cougars for their vivid red coloring. Surprisingly, they are often
    kept as pets by Tian-La leaders, as blood cougars are more easily
    domesticated and tamed, and serve as far better companions and hunting aids.
    Although they are slightly smaller than normal thylacines, they make up for
    it in ferocity and cunning. These red beasts have the advanced creature
    template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 294). Casmar Thylacine: In Casmaron, most
    thylacines are smaller than the typical beast. For this reason, they tend to
    form larger packs, often twice the size of an average thylacine pack. These
    smaller beasts stand 6 inches to a foot shorter at the shoulders. Casmar
    thylacines are normal thylacines with the young creature template added
    (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 295), and gather in packs of 2-10. Sarusan Wolf:
    The Sarusan wolf is a slightly bigger and more doglike form of the normal
    thylacine. Whereas indigenous people refer to the thylacine as a lion or
    other great cat, the Sarusan wolf has an unmistakable canine jaw. While they
    are physically larger, Sarusan wolves are actually less hardy than their
    traditional cousins, due to poor weight allocation. Prone to tiring quickly
    and falling down, Sarusan wolves focus more on rapid takedowns of their
    prey. Sarusan wolves have a Constitution score of 12 and gain Power Attack
    as a bonus feat. Thylacine Companions Starting Statistics: Size Small; Speed
