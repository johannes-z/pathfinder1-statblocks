    Poisonous frogs are a bright green color, with additional bright yellow,
    red, or blue markings. They are just over a foot long and weigh 10 pounds.
    The poison of poisonous frogs is often gathered by primitive tribes and used
    to coat darts and arrows for hunting. You can make a larger poison frog
    either by applying the giant simple template or by giving a normal giant
    frog a poison frog's venomous bite.
