SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Baboon Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      A baboonwere can communicate and empathize with baboons, and can use Bluff
      as if it were Diplomacy to change a baboon's attitude, receiving a +4
      racial bonus to do so.
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A baboonwere has three forms. Its natural form is that of a baboon, but it
      can also take the form of a human or human-baboon hybrid. A baboonwere's
      human form is fixed-it cannot assume different human forms. A baboonwere
      can only use its diseased bite in hybrid or baboon form. In baboon form,
      it functions as a baboon. In its hybrid form, a baboonwere can make a bite
      attack as a secondary attack, while in human form it lacks its bite
      entirely. A baboonwere can shift into any of its three alternate forms as
      a move action. Equipment does not meld with the new form between human and
      hybrid forms but does between those forms and its baboon form.

Description:
  - >-
    Baboonweres are evil baboons born with the ability to assume human or hybrid
    human form. Baboonweres are most often found among normal baboons, though
    some prefer to maintain their human form and live amongst ordinary people in
    small towns and villages. Usually when the livestock and cattle begin
    turning up missing or slain is when the baboonwere moves on, before the
    finger of suspicion is pointed its way.
  - >-
    In its hybrid form, a baboonwere stands just over 5 feet tall and weighs
    roughly 130 pounds. Its hair tends to be either light brown or dark brown.
    Eyes are always brown.
  - >-
    Baboonweres fight with weapons, usually longswords, short swords, and spears
    or crossbows and a diseased bite. Slain foes are dragged back to their lairs
    and eaten at the baboonwere's leisure.
  - >-
    Baboonweres are frequently found among normal baboons and are
    indistinguishable from them when in animal form. The statistics for a
    standard baboon may be found in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary 2.
