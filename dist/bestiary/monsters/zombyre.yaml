SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Nausea (Ex)
    description: >-
      A zombyre exudes a sickly stench of death and decay in a 10-foot radius.
      Creatures entering or within the area must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude
      save or become nauseated for as long as they remain in the area plus 1d4
      rounds after. Creatures succeeding on their save are immune to the effects
      of the aura for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Stygian Sickness: Bite; save DC 14 Fort; onset 1day; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d4 Intelligence and 1d2 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive
      saves. Anyone who dies while infected rises as a zombyre in 2d6 hours. The
      save is Charisma-based.
  - name: Staggered (Ex)
    description: >-
      Zombyres have poor reflexes and can only perform a single move action or
      standard action each round. A zombyre can move up to its speed and attack
      in the same round as a charge action. This flaw only affects zombyres when
      on land; while underwater, in combat, a zombyre loses this flaw.
  - name: Stygian Healing (Su)
    description: >-
      A zombyre regains 1 hit point each hour when fully submerged in the River
      Styx. This healing cannot restore more hit points than the maximum the
      zombyre possesses and it does not restore any lost limbs.
Description:
  - >-
    A zombyre is a living creature that drowned in the River Styx, reanimated by
    the magic of the Stygian waters for some unknown purpose. It is a
    free-willed, semi-intelligent creature appearing much as a normal zombie,
    though bloated from its time spent underwater.
  - >-
    Zombyres tend to dwell in packs, loosely organized but seemingly bound
    together by some unknown force. Some sages speculate this happens when a
    group of individuals all drown together, such as a group of sailors who
    perish when their ship sinks. Zombyres tend to stay within the area where
    they drowned; sometimes making their lair in the very ship that sank beneath
    the waves and cost them their life. They do not appear to be bound to the
    area as some undead are to the place where they died. Zombyres are most
    active at night, rarely venturing onto land during the day. Even nighttime
    excursions rarely see a zombyre travel more than several hundred feet from
    the water's edge. Creatures that venture too close to a zombyre pack are
    attacked and dragged into the water, where the zombyre pack feasts and dines
    on the remnants of those so foolhardy.
  - >-
    In battle, groups of zombyres are relentless combatants and generally swarm
    their opponents, attacking with their powerful fists and diseased bite.
    Large packs of zombyres have been known to climb aboard anchored ships, pull
    the seamen overboard, and attack them in the Stygian waters where the
    zombyres are faster and more at home. Such sailors pulled overboard are
    often times held under the water and drowned.
