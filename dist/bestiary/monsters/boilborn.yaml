  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When killed, a boilborn pops in a 10-foot-radius burst that deals 2d6
      points of acid damage (DC 14 Reflex half). Creatures taking damage must
      succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or contract leprosy.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Leprosy: Injury; save Fort DC 12; onset 2d4 weeks; frequency 1/week;
      effect 1d2 Cha damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. This save is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Purulent wounds that crawl out from piles of diseased dead and areas of
    massive contagion, these oozes slop about thoughtlessly, quivering and ready
    to burst and infect anything that moves. The creatures manifest in areas
    wracked by plagues, where rot and ruin run rampant. Crawling from the aff
    licted areas, boilborn spread out in all directions to disperse their
    infection. Though carefully studied by healers and naturalists focusing on
    oozes, living boilborn are dangerous to experiment upon. This is because
    their death throes can sometimes be triggered accidentally, even when the
    creatures are handled gently and no harm has been done to them. Some posit
    that boilborn have only a limited lifespan, and self-destruct when that
    period ends. Others have labored for years under the hope that the
    infectious fluids contained within boilborn might somehow be used to find
    both cures and immunities to any number of diseases that plague the world.
    Though this experimentation has resulted in certain indicators that boilborn
    might indeed be put to such positive use, a reliable concoction has yet to
    be developed. The boilborn detailed here is by far the most common, but as
    with diseases, other mutations exist. Use the following to represent some of
    the other virulent strains of these disgusting creatures. All diseases
    listed below appear on page 557 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook.
  - >-
    Abyssal Boilborn (CR 3): Colored in hues of bruised blue and bloody red and
    smelling like bile and pus, this dangerous boilborn has squeezed through a
    rift from the Abyss. It has the fiendish creature simple template and the
    advanced creature simple template, and infects its victims with demon fever.
  - >-
    Blindborn (CR 1): Pale greenish gray in color and slightly luminescent, this
    boilborn transmits blinding sickness (Fortitude DC 14) to creatures affected
    by its slam attack or death throes ability.
  - >-
    Infernal Boilborn (CR 3): Accompanied by the smell of brimstone, this
    black-skinned boilborn has the advanced creature simple template and the
    fiendish creature simple template, and infects victims it slams or splatters
    upon with devil chills.
  - >-
    Plagueborn (CR 2): Sickly yellow and wracked with perpetual palpitations
    that emit a fine mist, this boilborn has the giant simple template. Any
    creatures within 5 feet of a plagueborn must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude
    save or contract cackle fever.
