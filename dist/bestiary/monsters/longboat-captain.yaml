Description:
  - >-
    A longship captain typically leads a crew of Ulfen raiders, and as such must
    be as adept at combat as she is at command and tactics. At sea or on land,
    her steely gaze and authoritative tone ensure that her crew follow her
    orders quickly and without argument. An accomplished sailor herself, she has
    the ability to motivate her crew to work in unison and give their best
    effort-and indeed, to fight and die as necessary. She knows the workings of
    her ship inside out, often having had a hand in its construction. If the
    ship needs repairs in the midst of a journey, she proves herself a skilled
    carpenter and sail maker.

    If a longship is caught in one of ferocious storms that frequently lash the
    Steaming Sea, the captain's determination and shouted commands urging all
    hands to row for their lives are often the only things that prevent the ship
    from capsizing. Many longship captains prefer to follow coastlines, and at
    night have their boats seek safe harbor so that the crew can sleep in tents
    on the nearby shore-in such cases, the captain herself claims the privilege
    of the sleeping onboard, possibly with an honor guard or skeleton crew to
    prevent thieves or accidents. If an enemy attacks during the night, the
    high-walled hull of the ship can serve as an impromptu fortification.

    In a naval battle, a longboat captain directs both the ship's course and her
    crew's tactics, all while personally raining down a shower of deadly arrows
    on the enemy vessel. Most longboat captains are certainly capable in melee
    combat, but prefer to issue orders and provide support with their arrows
    from a vantage point from which they can observe the whole battle-often the
    bows of their ships. A captain's swift reactions, as well as her ability to
    yell a hasty word of warning or command to her crew, can d e t e r m i n e
    whether she and her crew face victory or defeat, life or death.

    When engaged in coastal raiding, the captain supervises the planning of the
    attack. She often leads a reserve group of raiders to strike against the
    strongest points of resistance or cut off those trying to flee. Those
    assigned to the captain's guard see the post as a mark of honor, as well as
    a chance for a greater share of the loot.

    A powerful and prosperous captain is often known to have her vessel's
    figurehead enchanted with the ability to spit out gouts of flame, or so that
    its eyes glow with an eerie light, casting fear into the hearts of enemies
    who see it bearing down on them.
