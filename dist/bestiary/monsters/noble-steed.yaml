Description_Visual: >-
  The horse has a sturdy body and long, powerful legs. It has an extremely long
  tail, nearly reaching the ground. Its mane is also unusually long and flows
  back from its head and neck in long, graceful locks. The huge hooves of the
  animal let loose a small shower of sparks as it runs.

    description: >-
      A noble steed's ability to fly is magical in nature, and becomes
      ineffective in an antimagic field. The noble steed loses the ability to
      fly for as long as the antimagic effect persists or for as long as it
      remains in the area.
Description:
  - >-
    Noble steeds are highly prized as mounts. They are about the same size as
    warhorses, but have leaner musculature and long, flowing manes and tails.
    Noble steeds are incredibly fast, and can even run on air. In the wild,
    noble steeds can often be found associating with normal horses and
    pegasuses.
  - >-
    Adult wild noble steeds are incapable of being tamed; these animals must be
    raised as foals in captivity if they are to be tamed. Domesticated adult
    noble steeds can cost as much as 800 gp when they can be found. Noble steed
    foals cost around 400 gp.
  - >-
    Noble steeds can vary in color just as standard horses do. Most tend toward
    lighter shades however, with slightly darker manes and tails. Noble steeds
    can breed with normal horses. The offspring however is always a normal
    horse. Only the mating of two noble steeds produces another noble steed.
    Noble steeds can live up to 50-60 years.
  - >-
    Noble steeds are generally docile and avoid combat if possible. If the
    family or herd is threatened however, the males move to attack while females
    move to protect the young. Much like their mundane counterparts, noble
    steeds attack with a combination of hooves and biting. If combat goes
    against them, noble steeds can usually outrun their foes or can take to the
    air and flee.
