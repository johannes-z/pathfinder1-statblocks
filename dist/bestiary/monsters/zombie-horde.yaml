Description_Visual: >-
  A stumbling crush of moaning, reaching bodies comes towards you. Empty eyes
  seek you out, each staggering footstep bringing the deathless mass closer.
  Straining to grasp you, this group of zombies are so tightly packed together
  it seems to be a single mass of undead, flailing limbs.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Feral Rage (Ex)
    description: >-
      The horde attacks as a ruthless mob, intent only on tearing apart those
      that fall into their clutches. This frenzy prevents them from using any
      sort of tactics, and frees them from any form of control by other beings.
      However, the sheer force of the wave attack allows them to deal 6d6 points
      of damage to any creature whose space they occupy at the end of their
      move. This ability is lost if the horde is broken up.
  - name: Horde Traits (Ex)
    description: >-
      Hordes are not so called because of the size of the group but rather the
      size of the creatures that compose the horde. Unlike normal swarms, hordes
      are composed of Medium creatures which are usually a normal version of a
      creature but otherwise behave in a swarmlike manner. There are usually
      around 50 creatures in a horde. The net effect is that they take only half
      damage from piercing weapons but take normal damage from other weapons. In
      addition when the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points or lower and breaks up,
      unless the damage was dealt by area-affecting attacks, then 2d6 surviving
      members of the horde continue their attack, though now only as individual
      creatures. Otherwise, a horde conforms to all of the other swarm traits as
      described in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary. Rend (EX) Due to
      the grasping and clawing nature of the zombie horde attack, any time the
      horde does more than 20 points of damage, add 3d6 slashing damage from the
      additional pulling and tearing. This ability is lost if the swarm is
      broken up.
Description:
  - >-
    Zombies are one of the most used and abused of the mindless undead. Singly,
    a zombie may be dealt with by experienced adventurers. When gathered
    together in a horde, these mindless creatures are a terror to behold. Packed
    together as tightly as they are, they appear as one solid mass of decaying
    flesh and sinuous limbs.
  - >-
    The flailing nature of the zombie horde's limbs allow the throng to grasp
    and tear at opponents, dealing rend damage in addition to their base attack.
    Any time the horde is in an opponent's square, the target risks being
    completely overrun by the horde
  - >-
    If the horde takes enough individual damage to break it up, up to a dozen of
    the creatures continue on their rampage of destruction, until finally they
    too must be slain.
