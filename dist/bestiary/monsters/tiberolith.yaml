  and blue liquid runs down its shuddering body.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Corrosive Strikes (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tiberolith reduced to 30 or fewer hit points leaks acid, and deals an
      additional 1d6 points of acid damage with its slam attacks.
  - name: Shockwave (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a tiberolith can unleash a burst of electricity. This
      blast deals 12d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures within 30
      feet (Reflex DC 16 half). A tiberolith is immune to its shockwave and that
      of other tiberoliths. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Spell Trap (Su)
    description: >-
      When a tiberolith is targeted by a spell that allows spell resistance and
      its spell resistance fails to protect it against that spell, the spell
      instead becomes trapped in the tiberolith's magical runes. The runes can
      only trap one spell at a time; if a second spell would become trapped, the
      first spell affects the tiberolith normally (including allowing a saving
      throw, if appropriate) and the second spell is trapped. A trapped spell
      dissipates harmlessly after 24 hours.
Description:
  - >-
    Tiberoliths are magical constructs with primitive internal mechanical
    components, held together with sinew and plant matter. Created by a vicious
    lost civilization to protect its citadels, villages, and treasures
    tiberoliths are found in submerged ruins and remain immobile unless attacked
    or approached by unauthorized intruders. Each is covered in a unique pattern
    of markings that glow blue when it moves. When active, it makes an
    unmistakable high-pitched whirring sound. A tiberolith typically stands 18
    feet tall and weighs 7,000 pounds. Its stone body is filled with an acidic
    blue alchemical liquid that channels electricity from its mechanisms. In
    addition to this fluid, its hollow interior spaces have puzzlebox-like
    devices anchored within them, though how these relate to the creature's
    movement is unknown.
