SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Adaros favor a paralytic toxin secreted by the flying nettlefin
      pufferfish-a sticky venom that doesn't wash away in water. Nettlefin
      Toxin: Spear-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/minute for 4 minutes;
      effect paralyzed for 1 minute; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      Adaros are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally
      poisoning themselves.
  - name: Rain Frenzy (Su)
    description: >-
      Adaros revere storms, and their lust for blood is amplified exponentially
      while it is raining. While fighting in the rain or during other stormy
      weather, adaros act as though affected by the rage spell. An adaro gains
      this benefit even if it is underwater, but only as long as it remains
      within a move action away from the water's surface (50 feet for most
      adaros).
  - name: Speak with Sharks (Su)
    description: >-
      An adaro can communicate telepathically with sharks to a distance of 100
      feet. This communication is limited to simple concepts, such as "come,"
      "defend," or "attack."
Description:
  - >-
    Malevolent denizens of the waters, adaros are among the fiercest sentient
    hunters of the tropical seas. They are known and feared by sailors on many
    exotic shores, as well as by common folk who just happen to live near the
    ocean.
  - >-
    Many have witnessed a fellow sailor or fisher suddenly go rigid, a poisoned
    spear jutting from his guts, only to fall into the water and be taken by the
    vicious adaro responsible for the assault.
  - >-
    Strictly carnivorous, adaros feed upon their victims almost immediately
    after slaying them. Their brutally sharp teeth cut through bone almost as
    easily as through flesh, and their powerful digestive systems are capable of
    handling most organic matter. Adaros usually eat once every couple of days,
    gorging on meals half their weight.
  - >-
    Adaros' strange relationship with storms has intrigued scholars for
    centuries. These sea-dwellers have a special connection to the deadly
    creatures of the water and the wildness of foul weather, and it is no
    coincidence that they attack humanoids more often during rough seas. Adaros
    are seminomadic by nature; a tribe travels until it finds a suitable hunting
    ground, and leaves either when its presence becomes too well known or when
    its game runs low.
  - An adaro is 7-1/2 feet long and weighs 250 pounds.
