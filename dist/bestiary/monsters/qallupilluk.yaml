  This hag's lumpy hide, tangled black hair, and ragged garments drip with icy
  water, though she has a curiously sweet smell.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cloying Scent (Su)
    description: >-
      Qallupilluks exude a vaguely sweet and unexpectedly pleasant briny scent.
      This smell comforts and distracts humanoids and animals that come within
      15 feet of the qallupilluk, causing such creatures to take a -2 penalty on
      saves against mind-affecting effects.
  - name: Curse of Scales (Su)
    description: >-
      If a qallupilluk grapples a Medium or Small humanoid opponent, her target
      begins transforming into an aquatic monster. Starting on the third
      consecutive round of grappling, the grappled target must succeed at a DC
      18 Fortitude save every round or fully transform into a grindylow
      (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 148), reefclaw (Bestiary 2 234), bunyip
      (Bestiary 2 50), merrow (Bestiary 2 189), or scrag (Pathfinder RPG
      Bestiary 268). Once fully transformed, the creature is slavishly devoted
      to the qallupilluk that created it. If the qallupilluk is slain, the
      creature loses this devotion but remains transformed. The transformation
      ends after 1 hour or if the creature is slain. A qallupilluk can make this
      transformation permanent by performing a ritual that takes 10 minutes and
      deals 30 points of damage to the qallupilluk. This is a curse and
      polymorph effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A qallupilluk is a sinister and much-dreaded haglike denizen of cold seas.
    An ambush predator, she waits near gaps and weak points in the ice and
    listens for the footsteps of creatures above, sometimes humming or tapping
    on the ice like a trapped seal in the hope of drawing the curious within
    range of her alluring scent. When one grabs a victim, she either drowns her
    prey, saving the body to eat later, or transforms her prey into a monstrous
    servant that she treats as her own child-and eventually, as a mate. All
    qallupilluks are female, but they can reproduce with other aquatic monsters.
    Their offspring are always qallupilluks. Qallupilluks may craft hovels or
    lodges from stone or coral on the seabed. A few craft semipermanent homes in
    the submerged recesses of icebergs. They often know fragments of ancient and
    obscure natural secrets.
