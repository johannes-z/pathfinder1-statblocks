SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bramble Jump (Su)
    description: >-
      A twigjack can travel short distances between brambles, shrubs, or
      thickets as if via dimension door as part of a move action. The twigjack
      must begin and end this movement while in an area of at least light
      undergrowth. The twigjack can travel in this manner up to 60 feet per day.
      This movement must be used in 10-foot increments and does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity.
  - name: Splinterspray (Ex)
    description: >-
      A twigjack can eject a barrage of splinters and brambles from its body
      three times per day as a standard action. This effect creates a 15-foot
      conical burst of jagged splinters, dealing 4d6 points of piercing damage
      to all creatures in the area. A DC 14 Reflex saving throw halves this
      damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Deep in old-growth forests, twigjacks spend their time tormenting intruders
    and wreaking havoc on settlers. Maladjusted protectors of the wood, these
    malicious fey constantly threaten any attempts to civilize the wild.
    Twigjacks delight in breaking wagon wheels from expansionists' caravans,
    snapping hunters' bows, and sabotaging isolated cabins and villages.
    Although they possess a keen intellect, few creatures, even other fey, can
    tolerate these twig-born creatures for long. Treants especially find
    twigjacks bothersome, and resent any suggestion that they are related.
    Equally, twigjacks resent being considered plants, and are proud of their
    fey heritage. Twigjacks sometimes go out of their way to impress dryads, an
    effort that is rebuffed almost every time. But some spriggans, quicklings,
    and other evil fey associate with twigjacks, and while goblins fear and
    distrust the creatures, bugbears often bully them into service.
  - >-
    Gnarled sticks bundled by vines and brambles form a twigjack's entire body.
    Atop its head, a mossy growth not unlike hair sprouts. The creature's eyes
    appear as vacant dark knotholes, and its mouth is just a canyon of
    splintered and broken sticks bisecting its face. Leaves and sprigs of new
    growth randomly sprout from the creature's body.
