    description: >-
      Mongrelmen can imitate sounds made by any creature they have previously
      encountered, including monsters with special vocal attacks. They cannot,
      however, mimic the special vocal attack powers or damage dealt by such
      attacks. A successful DC 14 Will save made by a listener detects the
      falsehood. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial
      bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Though not inherently evil, mongrelmen are shunned from society because of
    their appearance. They make their homes far from civilization, and those few
    encountered in settled areas are usually slaves or servants of the local
    humanoid races. Mongrelmen that must travel among other races take
    precautions so as not to reveal their true identities, using cloaks, capes,
    and the like to hide their forms. Mongrelman society is a collection of
    close-knit tribes, each with its own leader. Mongrelmen never fight against
    other mongrelmen, preferring to live peaceably with others of their kind,
    for all mongrelmen know they are shunned by outsiders and must stick
    together if their race is to survive. Mongrelmen stand about 6 feet tall.
    The average lifespan of a mongrelman is 35 years. Mongrelmen speak their own
    guttural language. Mongrelmen shun combat if possible, only entering melee
    if ordered to do so by their superiors. In combat, mongrelmen fight with
    clubs or longswords. Some carry blowguns and needles or darts (the blowgun
    needles and darts are usually coated with bloodroot poison). Mongrelmen as
    Characters Mongrelmen possess racial Hit Dice and may have class levels.
    Mongrelmen have the following racial traits. +4 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2
    Constitution, +2 Wisdom, -4 Charisma: Mongrelmen are physically gifted, but
    odd to behold Darkvision: Mongrelmen can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

    which provides 2d10 HD, a base attack bonus of +2, and base saves of Fort
    +0, Ref +3, Will +3. Racial Skills: A mongrelman's monstrous humanoid levels
    give it skill points equal to 2 x (4 + Int modifier, minimum 1).Mongrelmen
    receive the following racial modifiers: +8 Disguise, +4 Sleight of Hand, +4
    Stealth. Racial Feats: A mongrelman's monstrous humanoid level gives it one
    feat. Thick Skinned: Mongrelmen receive a +4 natural armor bonus. Natural
    Weapons: Slam (1d4). Languages: Mongrelman begin play speaking their own
    guttural language (Mongrelman). Mongrelmen of high intelligence can choose
    any of the following bonus languages: Common, Draconic, Elven, Goblin, Orc.
    Player Characters: Mongrelman PCs may designate their own parts, choosing up
    to three beneficial monstrous parts. The player may select up to two
    additional beneficial parts if they chose an equal number of detrimental
    parts. An ogre or minotaur arm counts as two beneficial parts. Credit The
