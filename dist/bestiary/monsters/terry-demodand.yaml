Group: Demodand
Source: Tome of Horrors Complete
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adhesive (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tarry demodand exudes a thick tar-like substance that acts as a powerful
      adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items touching it. A tarry
      demodand has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks due to its tarry
      secretions in addition to that provided by its grab ability. A weapon that
      strikes a tarry demodand is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC
      19 Reflex save. A successful DC 19 Strength check is needed to pry it off.
      The save DC and check DC are Constitution-based. Strong alcohol dissolves
      the adhesive. A pint of wine or a similar liquid weakens it, but the tarry
      demodand can still grapple normally. A tarry demodand can dissolve its
      adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 1 minute after the
      creature dies.
  - name: Rage (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tarry demodand that takes damage in combat has a 50% chance of flying
      into a berserk rage the following round, clawing and biting madly until
      either it or its opponent is dead. It gains +4 Strength and -4 AC. The
      creature cannot end its rage voluntarily. While raging, make the following
      adjustments to the tarry demodand's statistics: AC 23, touch 11,
      flat-footed 18; CMB +20 (+28 grapple); CMD 35; Melee 2 claws +21 melee
      (1d6+9), bite +20 melee (1d8+9); Str 28
Description:
  - >-
    The cruel and malevolent tarry demodands wander the planes of Tarterus as
    soldiers and warriors in the mighty demodand armies. They are often employed
    by the shaggy demodands to battle daemons, demons, and devils. Tarry
    demodands care little for anything and attack just about anything weaker
    than them. A typical tarry demodand stands 7 feet tall and weighs about 420
    pounds. The tarry demodand attacks with its claws and bite, though it
    usually opens combat using its spell-like abilities. Should it fly into a
    rage, it attacks relentlessly until its opponent is slain. Any creature that
    becomes stuck to the tarry demodand is shredded by its wicked claws. Credit
