SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Around Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gibbering abomination sees in all directions at once. It cannot be
      flanked List special ability info here.
  - name: Amorphous (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gibbering abomination's body is malleable and shapeless. It is immune to
      precision damage (like sneak attacks) and critical hits, and can move
      through an area as small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or
      one-eighth its space when squeezing.
  - name: Arcane Frenzy (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gibbering abomination is capable of using its spell-like abilities more
      frequently than other creatures. It may use a single spell-like ability
      each round as a swift action, two spell-like abilities as a standard
      action, or four spell-like abilities as a full-round action; it may not
      choose to do more than one of these in the same round, and cannot use this
      ability in the same round it uses Disruptive Cacophony. When engaging in
      an arcane frenzy, the gibbering abomination may use the same spell-like
      ability multiple times, but may not use the same spell-like ability
      against the same target twice in one round. If more than one spell-like
      ability is used, the specific spell-like abilities and their targets must
      be determined before any effects are determined, including saves and
      attack rolls.
  - name: Blood Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      On a successful grapple check after grabbing, several of the creature's
      mouths attach to its target. Each round it maintains its grapple, the
      gibbering abomination automatically deals 3d6+12 points of bite damage and
      1 point of Constitution damage as it drains its victim's blood.
  - name: Deathless (Su)
    description: >-
      When a gibbering abomination is slain, it is not truly dead, and 1 hour
      later it returns to life at 0 hit points, allowing fast healing thereafter
      to resume healing it. A gibbering abomination can be permanently destroyed
      only with death magic or complete incineration of its remains (such as
      dumping it into a pool of magma).
  - name: Disruptive Cacophony (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action the gibbering abomination may produce a horrible
      quasi-arcane chanting that is highly disruptive to nearby magic effects.
      Any creature that can clearly hear this chanting (maximum range 100 ft.)
      must make a concentration check (DC 20 plus level of spell) to
      successfully cast a spell or use a spell-like ability. The check DC is
      Charisma-based. A gibbering abomination that uses this ability may not use
      any of its spell-like abilities on its current turn, or until the start of
      its next turn.
  - name: Pain Immunity (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because the gibbering abomination is already in incredible pain, it is
      immune to any effect or condition caused as a result of extreme pain or
      agony. This ability does not protect it against any physical damage it
      might suffer as well, however.
Description:
  - >-
    A horrifying expanse of fused faces and parts of faces, the gibbering
    abomination is the result of foul arcane experiments studying the creation
    of chimerical creatures. It bears a close superficial resemblance to a
    gibbering mouther or lesser gibbering orb, and may be mistaken for one of
    those, but they are no true relation. Instead, the gibbering abomination has
    been cobbled together from the faces and organs of dozens of humanoid
    creatures; its innards are a bizarre tangle of brains, hearts, and other
    organs. The gibbering abomination is in constant pain as a result of the
    process that created it, haunted by half-remembered memories from the
    creatures it was composed from.
  - >-
    Gibbering abominations have clear memories of the experiments and procedures
    they suffered in their formation, and value nothing more than their own
    personal freedom. Beyond that, their constant anguish has given them a
    hateful attitude toward other creatures.
  - Gibbering Abomination Variants
  - >-
    As the result of the twisted experiments that created them, no two gibbering
    abominations have the same selection of spell-like abilities. The abilities
    listed in the stat block above are merely an example of a typical
    specimen-if such a term could be applied to a creature as bizarre as this.
  - >-
    When creating new gibbering abominations, use the following guidelines to
    assist in assigning spell-like abilities to the creature:
  - 1 The abomination should have between 8 and 12
  - spell-like abilities, with a combined total spell level
  - of 38-45.
  - 2 Roughly half the spell-like abilities should be derived
  - from 1st to 3rd-level spells, and the other half 4th to
  - 6th-level spells. Just one should be of 7th to 9th
  - level; the higher level that spell is, the more
  - it should be a non-primary combat spell effect.
  - 3 Any spell with an area effect should be changed to
  - affect a single target only with a range of Close.
  - Similarly, any spell that would normally generate a
  - ray effect no longer needs a ranged touch at
  - tack to hit, but if the spell would normally generate
  - multiple rays, any additional rays are lost.
  - 4 Any caps for maximum hit dice of creatures
  - >-
    affected should be removed, but other level- dependent caps, such as maximum
    number of dice
  - of damage, should remain.
  - 5 Do not use spell-like abilities with casting times
  - greater than one standard action, such as most
  - summoning spells.
  - 6 In general, it is best to pick spell-like abilities with a
  - balance of offensive, defensive, tactical, and
  - utilitarian spell effects. However, creating a
  - gibbering abomination focused for a particular task
  - is certainly possible, as the mad beings who created
  - it may have designed it with just such a purpose in
  - mind.
