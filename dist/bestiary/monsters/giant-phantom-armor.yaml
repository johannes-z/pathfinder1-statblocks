    CREATING PHANTOM ARMORS Phantom armors are created using the spell create
    undead. Creating a phantom armor requires a corpse wearing a suit of heavy
    armor. The corpse is destroyed in the phantom armor's creation. A magic-user

    least caster level 15th to create a giant phantom armor.
