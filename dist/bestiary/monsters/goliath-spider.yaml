Description:
  - >-
    Goliath spiders are giant hunting spiders that most often prey on large
    creatures such as giant scorpions, snakes, and younger dragons, but
    sometimes catch and paralyze smaller prey to eat later. Camouflaged by their
    hairs and coloration, they prowl atop the forest canopy, dropping upon
    unsuspecting creatures. Females often cannibalize their mates.
