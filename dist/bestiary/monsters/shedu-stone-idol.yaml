  human.
Group: Stone Idol
Source: Tome of Horrors 4
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone idol is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. A transmute rock to mud
      spell slows a stone idol (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no
      saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit
      points. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the stone idol's
      structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1
      full round. A disintegrate spell deals +50% damage to a stone idol. A
      chaos hammer, holy smite, order's wrath, or unholy blight spell deals 1d4
      points of damage per two caster levels to a stone idol if the creator's
      alignment matches one of the aforementioned spells.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      Unless a stone idol's main body is shattered into small fragments and
      scattered to the winds, the creature reforms itself at full strength in
      1d4+2 days.
  - name: Site Bound (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone idol cannot travel more than 200 feet from a central point
      designated by its creator. Once this point is selected, it can never be
      changed. A stone idol taken outside the area ceases functioning until it
      is brought back into the area.
  - name: Smite (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, every 1d4+1 rounds, a shedu stone idol can unleash a
      burst of holy energy from its body in a 20-foot-radius burst. All
      creatures caught within the area take damage as follows: evil-aligned
      outsiders, 10d6 points of damage; evil-aligned non-outsiders, 6d6 points
      of damage; good- and neutral-aligned creatures, 6d6 points of damage. A DC
      20 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. A creature that fails its save
      is blinded for 1d4 rounds as well. The save DC is Constitution-based and
      includes a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    A stone idol shedu stands almost 9 feet tall and can reach lengths of 15
    feet. It typically weighs about 25,000 pounds. A stone idol shedu when
    disturbed opens combat with its smite attack before attempting to trample
    its foes.
  - Construction

    A stone idol shedu is chiseled from a block of smooth stone that weighs at
