SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Brand of the Impenitent (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a balisse angel can brand a judged individual within
      30 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be branded with a
      painless, glowing icon on its chest-usually the holy symbol of the deity
      or empyreal lord the balisse angel serves. This brand lasts for a number
      of days equal to the balisse angel's Hit Dice (10 days for most balisse
      angels). Anyone who attacks the branded target gains a +2 sacred bonus on
      weapon attack and damage rolls and a +2 sacred bonus on caster level
      checks to overcome the target's spell resistance. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Balisse angels, sometimes called confessor angels, appear to good
    individuals on the horns of a moral dilemma or to those experiencing a
    crisis of faith. They prefer to guide individuals to their own moral
    decisions rather than order them to conform to a specific ideal of good.
  - >-
    Balisse angels form from the spirits of individuals who have committed evil
    acts but later are redeemed and die while living an exemplary, moral life.
    Though balisse angels do not usually remember their mortal years, they
    retain a strong belief in the power of mentoring and salvation.
  - >-
    The role of confessor is a solitary one. Balisse angels rarely interact with
    their own kind and cherish every minute they are able to spend on the
    celestial planes. Some balisse angels form long-lasting bonds with the
    people they have helped; between missions they may travel to visit their old
    success stories. Often a balisse angel leaves a mortal just as the mortal is
    beginning to appreciate the angel's company. Reunions are rare, but
    cherished all the more because of their scarcity.
  - >-
    The average balisse angel stands 7 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds; its
    powerful wings make up the majority of this weight.
