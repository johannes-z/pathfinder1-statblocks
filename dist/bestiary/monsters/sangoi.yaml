Treasure: standard (dagger)
Description_Visual: >-
  Dressed in tattered finery, this small, bald humanoid has a gaunt and haggard
  face with sallow skin drawn tight against its delicate bones. Its fingers and
  nails are unnaturally long and spidery, its teeth needle-sharp, and its body
  so thin it seems it could almost disappear if it turned sideways.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Curse of Misery (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a sangoi can deliver its curse to an adjacent
      humanoid as a melee touch attack. If the target fails its saving throw,
      the sangoi gains the benefit of aid (caster level equal to the target's
      Hit Dice). In addition, a sangoi gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls,
      weapon damage rolls, saving throws, and opposed skill checks against any
      creature affected by its curse of misery. A creature that successfully
      saves can not be affected by the same sangoi's curse for 24 hours. The
      save DC is Charisma-based. Curse of Misery: Touch-contact; save Will DC
      19; frequency 1 day; effect permanent crushing despair.
  - name: Hear Heartbeat (Ex)
    description: >-
      A sangoi can hear the beating hearts of living creatures nearby, granting
      it blindsense 30 feet and blindsight 5 feet; it can locate all creatures
      taking bleed damage within 30 feet as if it had blindsight. This ability
      does not reveal the location of creatures without hearts, including
      elementals, oozes, plants, undead, and incorporeal creatures.
  - name: Horrific Critical (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a sangoi enters a blood rage, its claws and teeth elongate and
      sharpen, threatening a critical hit on a roll of 18-20 (in addition to the
      other benefits of blood rage). If a sangoi reduces a humanoid to -1 or
      fewer hit points with a critical hit from one of its natural weapons, it
      can tear out the target's heart and consume it as a free action (Fortitude
      DC 19 negates), killing it instantly. If successful, the sangoi gains 1d8
      temporary hit points and a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. Any humanoid
      within 30 feet who witnesses this attack must succeed at a DC 19 Will save
      or become shaken and sickened for 1d4 rounds (this is a mind-affecting
      fear effect). The save DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Sideways Glance (Su)
    description: >-
      Sangois fade from view when in a creature's peripheral vision. They
      automatically gain concealment against creatures that they flank with
      another creature (another sangoi or otherwise). They can also attempt a
      Bluff check to feint in combat as a swift action, but only against a foe
      that can clearly see them.
  - name: Sunlight Transparency (Ex)
    description: >-
      Direct sunlight causes a sangoi to partially fade from view. Their bodies
      become almost transparent (20% miss chance), and they become fatigued and
      take a -10 penalty on Disguise checks as long as they remain in direct
      sunlight.
Description:
  - >-
    Sangois are malevolent nocturnal fey that haunt small towns and graveyards.
    Because of their taste for blood and their similar habits, they are
    sometimes mistaken for vampires. Sangoi appear as short, emaciated humanoids
    seldom over 4 feet tall and weighing 35 to 40 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Sangois thirst for the blood of the living, preferring humanoid blood, but
    settling for animal blood when humanoids are in short supply or when they
    are operating in disguise and do not wish to reveal their presence with an
    open attack. Though it is much harder to acquire, they are especially fond
    of the blood of good-aligned magical beasts, unicorns in particular. While
    blood provides physical nourishment for them, they also draw psychic
    sustenance from inf licting anguish and despair.
  - >-
    Sangois are expert trappers, catching large and small animals with magic or
    mundane snares. Trapped beasts might be mutilated for a sangoi's pleasure,
    though the wicked fey more likely dominates them and uses them to commit
    murder and mischief.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Sangois are natives of the fey realms of the First World, but they spend
    little time there. Most of their time is spent roaming the Material Plane,
    lurking in shadows and places where death and sorrow linger, such as
    graveyards and ruins. They are wanderers, moving from village to village in
    search of their next victims. When a target is located, a sangoi (or,
    rarely, a pair of sangois working together) seeks to isolate the victim in
    order to murder it and take its form. The sangoi poses as its victim, while
    draining the emotional, mental, and physical energy out of those that give
    them succor with its curse of misery.
  - >-
    Sangoi consider themselves hunters of a sort, seeking children born with
    certain unique characteristics or deformities, such as those born covered
    with a caul, or who bear a particular birthmark or hair or eye color.
    Sangois fear those with such marks, whatever they might be, believing they
    render them powerless against such creatures and that if those with the
    marks are able to grow to maturity, they will bring ruin to the sangoi. Each
    individual sangoi has its own particular mark it grows to fear.
  - >-
    Children so marked are spirited away from their mortal parents and slain,
    sold as slaves to an evil fey master, or simply imprisoned in the depths of
    a sangoi's lair, all to quell whatever threat the sangois believe they pose.
  - >-
    When such a child is found, a sangoi begins lurking about the home in the
    guise of an animal and might even take the form of a pet to attract the
    child's affection. Its curse falls upon the household with this
    infiltration, though sangois credit their chosen targets with immunity to
    their powers, or even the ability to block their powers from affecting
    others. Sangois attempt to abduct their targets at birth when possible, but
    often they do not discover them until a target is older. In such cases,
    sangois try to kill or kidnap their targets using dominated wild animals or
    traps set up to look like natural accidents.
  - >-
    Once a victim has been taken, a sangoi changes its shape to assume the
    victim's form, usually spending several days reading the victim's thoughts
    or speaking with its corpse to learn about it so it might better impersonate
    him. The sangoi then returns to the victim's home and assumes its life,
    going about his daily business while keeping out of direct sunlight when
    possible, often feigning illness or injury.
  - >-
    Once the sangoi enters its victim's home, its curse of misery begins to take
    hold, sapping the life and spirit from the family and friends of its victim.
    The sangoi amuses itself with the abuse and murder of domestic animals
    through traps and magical compulsion, and calls foul weather to cast a pall
    upon the house while it waits for the family of its victim to slip into
    ennui. Once those in the house fall into utter despair, the sangoi plans
    elaborate murders in which it renders its targets helpless, often with traps
    using common household objects and implements, and then carves out and
    greedily devours the hearts of its helpless victims, savoring the sour tang
    of fear that lingers in broken hearts even after death.
