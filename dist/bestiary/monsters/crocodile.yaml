SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Roll (Ex)
    description: >-
      When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a crocodile can perform a
      death roll upon making a successful grapple check. As it clings to its
      foe, it tucks in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its
      victim. The crocodile inflicts its bite damage and knocks the creature
      prone. If successful, the crocodile maintains its grapple.
  - name: Hold Breath (Ex)
    description: >-
      A crocodile can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times
      its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
  - name: Sprint (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per minute a crocodile may sprint, increasing its land speed to 40
      feet for 1 round.
Description:
  - >-
    A crocodile is a primeval reptile that dwells in swamps or along the banks
    of rivers, a habitat that often puts it in violent contact with unsuspecting
    prey that come to the water's edge to drink.
  - >-
    The typical crocodile is 14 feet long and weighs 1,400 pounds, but larger
    species exist. You can use these statistics for similar creatures, such as
    alligators.
