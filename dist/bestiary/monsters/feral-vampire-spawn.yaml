Description_Visual: >-
  This brutish monstrosity appears to have once been a human, though its
  formerly fine grave clothes are tattered and smeared with the filth of a
  boneyard. Massive muscles ripple beneath its cold, hard flesh contributing to
  its hunched posture, and jagged, broken fangs extend from between its
  bloodless lips.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A feral vampire spawn can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the
      feral vampire spawn establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood,
      dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. The feral vampire spawn heals 5
      hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum
      number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points) each
      round it drains blood.
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by a feral vampire spawn's slam gains one negative level.
      This ability only triggers once per round, regardless of the number of
      attacks the feral vampire spawn makes.
  - name: Fast Healing (Su)
    description: >-
      A feral vampire spawn has fast healing 2. If reduced to 0 hit points in
      combat, it assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must reach its
      coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to 9
      miles in 2 hours.) Additional damage dealt to a feral vampire spawn forced
      into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest, it is helpless. It regains
      1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no helpless and resumes healing at the
      rate of 2 hit points per round.
  - name: Gaseous Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A feral vampire spawn can only assume gaseous form when it has been
      reduced to 0 hit points in combat. It then assumes gaseous form as the
      spell (caster level 5th) and returns to its coffin. While gaseous it has a
      fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.
  - name: Shadowless (Ex)
    description: >-
      A feral vampire spawn casts no shadows and shows no reflection in a
      mirror.
  - name: Spider Climb (Ex)
    description: >-
      A feral vampire spawn can climb sheer surfaces as though with a spider
      climb spell.
Description:
  - >-
    Sometimes when vampires create minions something horrible happens to the
    creature causing a fate worse than even that of a typical vampire spawn. On
    these occasions whether by accident or design, upon waking to its new undead
    existence the newly created spawn finds itself trapped within its coffin or
    tomb and unable to free itself even in gaseous form. In these instances the
    spawn rages and struggles to escape as it slowly goes insane, a victim of
    its all-consuming hunger. When the master vampire finally deigns to release
    its new spawn or it finally manages to break free - sometimes years after
    its creation - the spawn is feral and nearly mindless, though with a much
    greater strength due to its incessant rage. Vampire masters often find such
    spawn less of a threat and easier to dispose of when their usefulness has
    ended.
  - >-
    Unlike typical vampire spawn, feral vampire spawn resemble primitive or
    Neanderthal-like versions of their former selves with heavy frames
    supporting a massive musculature and a face twisted by rage and hate into an
    almost animal-like mask. They are usually hunched over from long confinement
    and weigh up to 200 pounds more than typical for a member of their species
    of their relative size.
  - >-
    Feral vampire spawn have lost the ability to speak beyond inarticulate
    roars, though they can understand and obey verbal commands from their
    master.
  - >-
    Feral vampire spawn attack without thought or tactics using their tremendous
    brute strength to smash their foes and feed. Though it is presumed that they
    should still be capable of assuming gaseous form at will or using their
    domination gaze like standard vampire spawn, feral vampire spawn seem to
    have forgotten how to use these abilities.
