  - name: Death Burst (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a plague zombie dies, it explodes in a burst of decay. All creatures
      adjacent to the plague zombie are exposed to its plague as if struck by a
      slam attack and must make a Fortitude save or contract zombie rot.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      The slam attack - as well as any other natural attacks - of a plague
      zombie carries the zombie rot disease. Zombie rot: slam; save Fort DC 11;
      onset 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Con, this damage cannot be
      healed while the creature is infected; cure 2 consecutive saves. Anyone
      who dies while infected rises as a plague zombie in 2d6 hours.
  - name: Staggered (Ex)
    description: >-
      Zombies have poor reflexes and can only perform a single move action or
      standard action each round. A zombie can move up to its speed and attack
      in the same round as a charge action.
Description:
  - >-
    These zombies carry a terrible disease that perpetuates their undead
    lineage-those infected by a plague zombie's contagion rise as zombies
    themselves when they perish.
