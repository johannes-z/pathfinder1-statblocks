Description_Visual: >-
  A ruddy glow emanates from beneath this dragon's red, gem-encrusted scales,
  like lava visible between cracks of cooling stone.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fire Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A wyrm red dragon is surrounded by an aura of intense heat. All creatures
      within 10 feet take 2d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the
      dragon's turn.
  - name: Manipulate Flames (Su)
    description: >-
      A wyrm red dragon can control any fire spell within 110 feet of the dragon
      as a standard action. This ability allows it to move any fire effect in
      the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to
      reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be
      one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 round following the use of this
      ability, the dragon can control any new fire spell cast within its area of
      control, as if it were the caster. It can make all decisions allowed to
      the caster, including canceling the spell if it so desires.
  - name: Melt Stone (Su)
    description: >-
      The dragon can use its breath weapon to melt rock at a range of 100 feet,
      affecting a 55-foot-radius area. The area becomes lava to a depth of 1
      foot. Any creature in contact with the lava takes 20d6 points of fire
      damage on the first round, 10d6 on the second, and none thereafter as the
      lava hardens and cools. If used on a wall or ceiling, treat this ability
      as an avalanche that deals fire damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Few creatures inspire such dread as the magnificently wrathful red dragons,
    and the ones with mythic power are even more fearful. They are the
    embodiments of destruction, hatred, and draconic arrogance. Magnificent and
    utterly frightening to behold, mythic red dragons possess a fierce beauty
    that exceeds all other dragons. From their powerful jaws, capable of
    snapping iron bars and the masts of ships, to their muscular tails, which
    can crash through stone walls as easily as whips break skin, red dragons
    reflect predatory superiority and murderous perfection. A mythic red
    dragon's body has cordlike muscles that allow it to move more quickly and
    gracefully than a creature of its size should have a right to.
  - >-
    Villains of the worst kind, mythic red dragons are unf linchingly evil in
    ways rarely matched even by other mythic evil creatures.
  - >-
    Their destructive impulses and wrathful fiery rampages surprise and delight
    the most heinous demons. These legendary dragons demand annual royal
    sacrifices or tribute in slaves, and think nothing of working their
    underlings to death.
  - >-
    An older mythic red dragon spends little time out of its lair, and when it
    does emerge it prefers to attack humanoid settlements away from the
    immediate vicinity, burning down buildings, dropping peasants from great
    heights, and demanding coins and other treasures. This raiding pattern makes
    it difficult for would-be dragonslayers to find the creature's actual lair.
  - >-
    Mythic red dragons use their magic to protect their lairs with a variety of
    protective spells. A typical lair also contains slave-built mundane traps,
    environmental hazards such as steam vents poisonous fumes, and (if within an
    active volcano) molten rock as part of its defenses.
