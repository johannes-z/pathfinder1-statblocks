Description_Visual: >-
  This is a tremendous sea creature, resembling a whale of gigantic proportions.
  Its humped back stands like a mountain, and its massive eye is nearly as large
  as a sailing ship. Its cavernous blowhole spews forth a jet of water like a
  cyclone.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Smashing Breach (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a leviathan can make a special charge attack
      against creatures on the surface of the water. At the end of its charge,
      the leviathan breaches, then slams down onto the target with incredible
      force. Any Huge or smaller creatures in the leviathan's space must make a
      DC 30 Reflex save or take 4d8+33 points of bludgeoning damage and be
      forced into the nearest square that is adjacent to the whale. This breach
      automatically attempts to capsize any boats caught wholly or partially in
      this area. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Tail Storm (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a leviathan can raise its massive tail and bring
      it crashing down into the water, causing a massive wave that sinks ships
      in the area. The resulting wave fans out from the leviathan's tail in a
      100-foot cone. Huge or small er ships caught in the area and within 10
      feet of the leviathan's tail automatically sink. Creatures in the water
      and within 10 feet of the leviathan's tail take 4d6+22 points bludgeoning
      damage. A successful DC 42 Reflex save reduces the damage by half.
      Additionally, a creature that fails its save is pushed 6d6 x 10 feet away.
      Huge or smaller ships more than 10 feet away within the area must succeed
      on a Profession (sailor) check or capsize. The DC of this check is 42,
      decreasing by 5 for every 10 feet from the leviathan a ship is. The DC
      increases by a cumulative +5 for each size smaller than Huge a ship is.
      The save and base check DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Whale Song (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a leviathan can unleash a song that is so deep and of
      such low frequency that the vibrations alone have adverse effects on
      living creatures. Any living creature within 100 feet of a singing
      leviathan must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d6
      rounds. A creature that succeeds on its save is unaffected by that
      leviathan's whale song for one day. This song is more felt than heard, and
      can be detected by creatures up to 10 miles away. Creatures capable of
      detecting extremely low-frequency sounds (e.g. dolphins, whales, other
      leviathans) can detect this song up to 100 miles away. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Legend holds that there is but one leviathan in every ocean in the world,
    each creature being the undisputed sovereign of its domain. Smaller
    leviathans control the seas, whilst the tiniest-still massive by any
    measure-lurk in a few secluded bays within the lonelier parts of the world.
    Completely unopposed by any other creature, they dominate their realms. When
    a leviathan grows to such size that it can no longer be supported by its
    territory, it challenges another larger in size, seeking to gain mastery of
    its sea or ocean. Failure in this challenge results in death but if it
    overcomes its rival, the leviathan assumes sovereignty of the domain.
    Battles between these titanic creatures are an awesome sight to behold, for
    tidal waves and hurricanes erupt, devastating nearby coastal settlements.
  - Leviathans are over 500 feet long and weigh many hundreds of tons.
  - >-
    Leviathans are seldom stirred to anger and only attack to defend themselves
    from opponents who can truly harm them-a rare occurrence indeed. They strike
    with their massive tail or by biting. A leviathan is so immense that it
    cannot bite any creature smaller than Huge; such small prey is simply
    swallowed whole. Any enemy flanking a leviathan from behind is attacked with
    a devastating tail slap or subjected to the leviathan's tail storm attack.
