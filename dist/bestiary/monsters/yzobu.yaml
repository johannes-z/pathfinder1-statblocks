SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Stampede (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stampede occurs if three or more creatures with stampede make a trample
      attack while remaining adjacent to each other. While stampeding, the
      creatures can trample foes of their size or smaller, and the trample's
      save DC increases by +2.
Description:
  - >-
    An yzobu is a herd animal found in cold hills, plains, and mountains. It
    stands roughly the height of a horse, but has a bulkier frame. Its head is
    more bovine, with a pair of thick, slightly curved horns protruding from the
    sides of its flat forehead and four smaller prongs jutting from the top. The
    fur of an yzobu is long and shaggy, protecting it from the harsh winters of
    its habitat. This pelt accumulates a pungent secretion from the yzobu's body
    that gives it a strong odor that those unaccustomed to the creatures find
    sickening.
  - >-
    Like the hobgoblins who use them as mounts and beasts of burden, yzobus
    (called "battle yaks" by their war-mongering handlers) live in complex
    social groups. These immense herds can number in the thousands, and present
    quite a problem to ranchers, explorers, and pioneers who encounter them
    while traversing the open plains and hills where the yzobus graze. A single
    herd can range over a spread of tens of thousands of square miles in a year,
    devouring all the grass and small vegetation in the region, trampling what
    they can't eat, and forcing other creatures-including humanoids- to move
    elsewhere or suffer the same fate.
  - >-
    Yzobus are extremely aggressive, and fight ruthlessly to defend even the
    weakest member of their herd, making them difficult pests to deal with, and
    even more difficult to train for service or war. Hobgoblins have grown
    skilled at the process, and keep a fair number of tamed yzobus. They breed
    these with wild yzobus every few generations to keep them fierce.
  - Yzobu Companions
  - >-
    An yzobu can be taken as an animal companion or mount by cavaliers, druids,
    hunters, and rangers.
