Description:
  - >-
    Vegepygmys are created by a dangerous fungus known as russet mold- creatures
    slain by russet mold serve as incubators for the mold's spores, and a day
    later, the dead body bursts to release 1d6 fully grown vegepygmys. A
    vegepygmy has no real relation to the body from which it emerges, but the
    creature may yet retain a strange sort of reverence for its "birth corpse"
    and carry with it a grisly memento from the body, typically a few bones or
    teeth. Often, a vegepygmy uses such bones to craft a crude spear or some
    other weapon. Vegepygmy tribes live in tightly knit communities and fiercely
    guard their patches of russet mold. Vegepygmies cannot speak-they
    communicate via a crude language of rhythmic taps, beats, and clicks.
    Hunting parties echo these exchanges through the caves they travel.
    Vegepygmies stand 2 to 4 feet tall and weigh between 15 to 45 pounds.
    Approximately 1 in 20 vegepymies are chieftains. A vegepygmy chieftain is an
    advanced vegepygmy (often one with class levels) that carries an infestation
    of russet mold spores in its flesh. A vegepygmy chieftain infects any
    creature it hits with its natural weapons with russet mold spores (see
    below). Russet Mold (CR 6) This hazardous fungus can be found in dark, wet
    areas, and often grows in great abundance at the heart of a vegepygmy lair.
    When a creature approaches within 5 feet of a patch of russet mold, the
    fungus releases a cloud of spores in a 5-foot radius burst. Everyone in the
    area must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or the spores quickly take root in
    their victims, inf licting 2 points of Constitution damage per round. A new
    Fortitude save can be attempted each round to halt the growth. Although
    immunity to disease won't protect against russet mold spores, the growth can
    be halted by remove disease and similar effects. Exposure to sunlight also
    halts the spores' growth. Plants are immune to russet mold spores. After 24
    hours, a fully grown vegepygmy bursts from the body of any creature slain by
    russet mold, provided the creature was Small or larger. For each size
    category larger than Small, the body produces one additional vegepygmy. A
    patch of russet mold is unharmed by all effects save for acid, alcohol, or
    remove disease (or a similar magical effect, such as heal), all of which can
    kill a single patch of russet mold on contact. Sunlight doesn't kill the
    mold, but does render it dormant and harmless as long as the sunlight
    persists.
