Description:
  - >-
    Blood orcs are considered vicious killers even amongst other breeds of orcs.
    Distrusted in times of peace, their savage warriors are sought out in times
    of war for their brutality and ferocity. Blood orc bands decorate their
    standards and shields with the scalps and severed heads of opponents and are
    known to drink flagons of putrid blood before entering battle. Blood orcs
    always fight to the death, take few prisoners, and offer no quarter to their
    foes. Blood orcs have a special hatred for black orcs whom they see as
    traitors to the orcish god Grotaag. A typical male blood orc stands over 6
    feet tall and weighs around 200 pounds or more. Females tend to be slightly
    lighter and smaller. Blood orcs skin is dark reddish-black and their hair is
    black, dark brown, or crimson (rare, but it does occur). Eye color is always
    black. Blood orcs favor armor and clothes of black or dark red. Skilled in
    combat, blood orcs are ruthless opponents, attacking with weapons and savage
    bite. They swarm foes and are known for assaulting the center of enemy
    forces, overbearing defenders with their brutal attacks. Their most common
    tactic is to form a shield wall with heavy wooden shields. The front rows of
    attackers break enemy lines with battleaxes while the rear ranks attack with
    longspears and glaives. Once melee is mixed and blood is in the air, the
    blood orcs drop both in favor of greataxes. When faced with magic-using
    opponents they spread themselves out to avoid being consumed by area of
    effect spells. Blood Orc Society Blood orcs are a primitive (even for orcs),
    barbaric race of people. Hunters and nomads by nature, they rarely settle in
    one place for long being always on the move following any source of food.
    Blood orc tribes and villages tend to congregate near one another for
    protection, food, and various other needs. Most tribes or villages also
    situate themselves near an abundant source of water. Other orc tribes avoid
    the blood orc nations, seeing them as savages and primitives. Trade between
    the blood orcs and other races is rare though blood orcs do tend to favor
    the company of gnolls, flinds, and hobgoblins (why, no one knows). Each
    tribe or village is let by an elder warrior, a barbarian of great strength
    and power. Each tribe also includes at least a single shaman or witch doctor
    who tends to the wounded, predicts the future, and so on. Blood Orc
