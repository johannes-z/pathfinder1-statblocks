Description:
  - >-
    Astral devas are messengers of the gods of good. They watch over planar
    travelers and sponsor powerful mortals, pushing them to take on good causes.
    A typical astral deva looks human except for its wings, though some look
    like other humanoid races and a rare few have even more unusual forms. An
    astral deva is 7-1/2 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds. Astral devas are
    usually created by deities from the souls of good mortals, though some souls
    spontaneously transform into astral devas without the intervention of a
    deity. Their skills and abilities make them excellent scouts and elite
    agents for celestial armies. They often carry long, flowing scrolls upon
    which are writ messages and judgments from the gods. An astral deva's
    scrolls frequently contain hints of prophecies and major events yet to come,
    and as such the devas are fiercely protective of the contents of these
    scrolls and let none, not even other astral devas, peruse them.
