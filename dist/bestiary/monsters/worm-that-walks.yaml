Description:
  - >-
    When a powerful spellcaster with a strong personality, a lust for life, and
    a remorselessly evil soul dies and is buried in a graveyard infused with
    eldritch magic, a strange phenomenon sometimes occurs. The flesh of the
    decaying body fats and instructs the very worms that gnaw, and these
    graveworms quicken not only on corruption but upon the spellcaster's
    memories and magical power. The spellcaster's very soul is consumed in this
    vile process, only to be split apart to inhabit each of the individual
    chewing worms in so many fragments. The result is a hideous hive mind of
    slithering life known as a worm that walks-a mass of worms that clings to
    the vague shape of the body that granted it this new existence, and can
    wield the powers and magic the spellcaster had in life. A worm that walks
    retains memories of its life as a spellcaster before its death, but is not
    undead-it is a hideous new form of undulant life. Creating a Worm That Walks
    "Worm that walks" is a template that can be added to any evil spellcasting
    creature. A worm that walks retains all the base creature's statistics and
    abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature +2. Alignment:
    Any evil. Type: The base creature's type changes to vermin. It gains the
    augmented subtype. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks. Worms that
    walk are intelligent and do not possess the standard mindless trait of most
    vermin. Note that while a worm that walks has the ability to discorperate
    into a swarm, and while its body is made up of countless wriggling worms, it
    does not itself gain the swarm subtype. Size: Although the worms that make
    up the worm that walks's body are Fine creatures, the worm that walks is
    treated as a creature the same size as the base creature. Senses: As the
    base creature, plus darkvision 60 feet and blindsight 30 feet. AC: The worm
    that walks loses any natural armor bonus the base creature may have had, but
    gains an insight bonus to its AC equal to its Wisdom bonus (minimum of +2).
    Hit Dice: Change the base creature's racial HD to d8s. All HD derived from
    class levels remain unchanged. Defensive Abilities: A worm that walks
    retains all of the base creature's defensive abilities and special
    qualities. It also gains the following additional defensive abilities. Worm
    that Walks Traits: A worm that walks has no discernible anatomy, and is not
    subject to critical hits or flanking. Reducing a worm that walks to 0 hit
    points causes it to discorporate (see below)-a worm that walks at 0 hit
    points is staggered, and one at negative hit points is dying. Worms that
    walk are immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a specific
    number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate),
    with the exception of such spells and effects generated by the worm that
    walks itself, which treat the worm that walks as one single creature if it
    so chooses. Mind-affecting effects that target single creatures function
    normally against a worm that walks, since the creature's individual
    components share a hive mind. A worm that walks takes half again as much
    damage (+50%) from damaging area effects, such as fireball and splash
    weapons. Worms that walk are susceptible to high winds-treat a worm that
    walks as a Fine creature for the purposes of determining wind effects.
    Damage Reduction: A worm that walks loses any damage reduction possessed by
    the base creature and gains damage reduction 15/-. Fast Healing: A worm that
    walks gains fast healing equal to its CR. Immunities: Worms that walk are
    immune to disease, paralysis, poison, and sleep effects. Melee Attacks: A
    worm that walks loses any natural attacks the base creature had, but gains a
    slam attack that deals damage based on its size (see Table 3-1: Natural
    Attacks by Size, on page 299). This slam has the grab ability and affects
    creatures up to one size larger than the worm that walks. A worm that walks
    retains any weapon proficiencies the base creature had. Special Attacks: A
    worm that walks retains all of the base creature's special attacks. It also
    gains the following additional special attacks. Discorporate (Su) A worm
    that walks can collapse into a shapeless swarm of worms as a free action.
    All held, worn, and carried items fall and its Strength score drops to 1.
    The worm that walks functions as a true swarm while discorporated, with a
    reach of 0 feet (its space remains unchanged). While discorporated, the worm
    that walks loses all of its defensive abilities and gains all of the
    standard swarm traits. It loses its slam attacks and all special abilities
    and special attacks, but can make a swarm attack that deals damage equal to
    its engulf attack. A worm that walks can reform into its true form
    (including equipping all gear in reach) as a fullround action as long as it
    has at least 1 hit point. Squirming Embrace (Ex) If a worm that walks
    grapples a foe, as a swift action, it can cause a swarm of worms to squirm
    over the grappled creature. These worms deal automatic swarm damage with no
    attack roll needed (see the table below). If a creature takes damage from
    the swarm, it is also subject to the swarm's distraction ability, and must
    make a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC equals 10 +
    1/2 the worm that walks's HD + its Con modifier). A worm that walks can only
    have one embraced target at a time, but it does not have to continue
    grappling in order to maintain the embrace. If the worm that walks moves
    more than 5 feet from the swarm or dismisses the swarm (a free action), the
    swarm dies. Any area attack that damages the swarm or any severe or stronger
    wind effect that affects the swarm's target kills it. Tenacious (Ex) A worm
    that walks gains a +8 racial bonus on CMB checks made to grapple and a +4
    racial bonus to its CMD. Abilities: Dex +4, Con +4. Skills: Worms that walk
    gain a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks.
    Feats: Worms that walk gain Diehard as a bonus feat. Engulf Damage HD Engulf
    Damage 1-5 1d6 + 1.5 Str bonus 6-10 2d6 + 1.5 Str bonus 11-15 3d6 + 1.5 Str
    bonus 16-20 4d6 + 1.5 Str bonus 21 or more 5d6 + 1.5 Str bonus
