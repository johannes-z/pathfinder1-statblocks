    description: >-
      A hound archon can assume any canine form of Small to Large size, as if
      using beast shape II. While in canine form, the hound archon loses its
      bite, slam, and greatsword attacks, but gains the bite attack of the form
      it chooses. For the purposes of this ability, canines include any dog-like
      or wolf-like creature of the animal type.
Description:
  - >-
    Hound archons look like well-muscled humans with canine heads typically
    resembling those of noble-looking wolves or dogs. Well trained, they prefer
    to make use of their greatswords in battle, though they are equally adept
    with their natural weapons. Hound archons loathe killing mortals and prefer
    to disarm or incapacitate even evil individuals when they can. Against
    fiends and the irredeemably corrupt, though, they show no mercy. Hound
    archons are disciplined soldiers and sentinels. Occasionally good-aligned
    deities send them to watch over specific places and individuals they take a
    particular interest in. Under the guise of unassuming but friendly strays,
    such secret defenders might follow their ward or guard their post subtly for
    years. In Heaven's armies, exceptional hound archon paladins lead their
    fellows into combat, taking on roles as captains and knights. They lead
    incursions against fiendish holdings, whether that entails strikes against
    daemonic fortresses or liberating the captives of night hag soul collectors.
    Such missions make hound archons perhaps the most likely celestials one
    might encounter upon the Lower Planes, and packs of swift-moving wolves
    occasionally reveal themselves to be welcome saviors to those lost within
    such realms. Regardless of their orders, hound archons universally exhibit a
    particular hatred of canine fiends, abandoning all mercy and going out of
    their way to put an end to the evils of barghests, glabrezus, yeth hounds,
    and similar depraved outsiders.
