SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A faerie dragon's breath weapon is a 5-foot cone of pink gas. Creatures
      caught in the puff must succeed on a Fortitude save or experience extreme
      euphoria for 1d6 rounds. Affected creatures are staggered, sickened, and
      immune to fear effects for the duration of the euphoria.
Description:
  - >-
    Faerie dragons are chaotic members of the dragon family and are believed to
    be distant cousins of the pseudodragon. Faerie dragons resemble tiny 1-2
    foot long dragons. Female faerie dragons have a golden sheen to their
    coloring while males have a silver sheen. Faerie dragons love to play pranks
    on passersby and employ their spells to this end. Some faerie dragons spend
    months on end preparing for the day they can unleash their single grand
    practical joke or prank. Faerie dragons avoid combat and only attack if
    cornered or if their lair or young are in immediate danger. A faerie dragon
    attacks with its breath weapon, spells, and bite. Faerie Dragons as
    Familiars Although difficult to control, a faerie dragon can make for a
    powerful familiar. Spellcasters wishing to take a faerie dragon as a
    familiar must take the Improved Familiar feat and have an alignment within
    one step of chaotic good. The character must have an arcane spellcaster
    level of at least 7th before taking a faerie dragon as a familiar. Credit
