SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Entropic Flesh (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature that hits a sceaduinar with a melee attack takes 1d6 points
      of negative energy damage. Attacking with a weapon that provides reach
      allows a creature to avoid taking this damage.
  - name: Entropic Touch (Ex)
    description: >-
      A sceaduinar's natural attacks can strike incorporeal creatures as if they
      were ghost touch weapons. All of a sceaduinar's natural attacks deal +1d6
      points of negative energy damage to the target. This energy does not heal
      creatures healed by inflict spells.
  - name: Void Child (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sceaduinars are immune to effects that target souls (such as trap the
      soul) or require knowledge of a creature's identity (such as scrying).
      When one is slain, it cannot be restored to life by magic save by a
      miracle or wish, or by divine intervention.
Description:
  - >-
    Sceaduinars are strange creatures born of pure entropy, the antithesis of
    creation and life. In the cold heart of the Negative Energy Plane, the
    un-substance of that realm coalesces into snowf lake-like crystals, and it
    is from these strange formations that sceaduinars arise, breaking free from
    their jagged "eggs" fully grown. They hate the living and the undead with
    equal passion, perhaps out of jealousy for those who have a spark of life
    (even if that spark is provided by a corruption of life in the form of
    undeath), though they usually ignore creatures from the Outer Sphere. They
    believe their positive energy counterparts, the jyoti, long ago stole their
    ability to create, breaking the parallel between the two energy planes and
    forcing these void-dwellers into an unwanted role of pure destruction.
  - >-
    In a way, their hatred parallels that of another native of the Negative
    Energy Plane-the nightshade. Yet despite their similar goals, the
    sceaduinars see nightshades as just another corruption of life worthy of
    destruction- even though very few sceaduinars are powerful enough to
    directly oppose one of these deadly undead. Sceaduinars are quite
    intelligent, yet they have no real society to speak of. When they gather
    together, it is always to form a larger band to strike against a
    particularly dangerous foe.
