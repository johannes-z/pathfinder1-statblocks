SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Air Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Airborne creatures take a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls against an
      air elemental construct.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      An air elemental construct is immune to any spell or spelllike ability
      that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects
      function differently against the creature, as noted below. A control
      weather spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to an air
      elemental construct. The construct can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 17 +
      caster's relevant ability score modifier) for half damage. An iron body or
      ice storm spell slows (as the slow spell) an air elemental construct for
      2d6 rounds. Note the iron body spell does not change the construct's form,
      nor does an ice storm spell actually damage the construct. A control winds
      spell heals an air elemental construct of all of its lost hit points.
  - name: Insubstantial Form (Ex)
    description: >-
      An air elemental construct cannot run, wear armor, or enter water or other
      liquids. It can pass through holes and small openings-even cracks. It can
      also occupy spaces occupied by its enemies. (This ability is similar to a
      gaseous form spell-note the air elemental construct is not subject to wind
      effects like the gaseous form spell.) Any piercing or slashing attack
      against an air elemental construct has a 20% miss chance. Bludgeoning
      attacks deal damage normally.
  - name: Wind Blast (Ex)
    description: >-
      An air elemental construct can transform the air in radius around it into
      a forceful blast of wind and debris. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    An air elemental construct appears as a humanoid composed of vapor and mist,
    barely visible at times. It form never touches the ground, always remaining
    at least 1 foot above such a surface. An air elemental construct cannot
    speak or make any vocalizations. An air elemental construct attacks by
    bashing its foes with its powerful fists or by swirling the air around
    itself into a whirlwind of cyclonic proportions that batter and buffet its
    opponents. Elemental constructs are used by powerful mages as servants,
    bodyguards, and assassins. An elemental construct, like any other automaton
    follows any order or command given to it to the best of its ability. An
    elemental construct's creator can command it if the construct is within 60
    feet and can see and hear its creator. If not commanded, an elemental
    construct usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability,
    though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the elemental
    construct a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The
    elemental construct's creator can order the construct to obey the commands
    of another person (who might in turn place the elemental construct under
    someone else's control, and so on), but the elemental construct's creator
    can always resume control over his creation by commanding the elemental
    construct to obey him alone. Each elemental construct appears as a humanoid
    creature about 9 feet tall and is composed entirely of its native element.
    Construction An elemental construct's body is formed completely of one of
    the four elements air, earth, fire, or water. The materials must be the

    rare oils, powders, and other ingredients totaling 5,000 gp. ELEMENTAL
