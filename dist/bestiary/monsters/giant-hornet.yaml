    description: >-
      The first time a giant hornet is successfully hit in combat, it releases a
      fear pheromone that heightens the aggressiveness of all giant hornets
      within 50 feet. All affected giant hornets receive a +1 morale bonus on
      attack rolls for the remainder of the encounter and fight without penalty
      even while disabled or dying (see Pathfinder Core Rulebook).
Description:
  - Giant hornets are larger, more aggressive versions of normal hornets.
  - >-
    They are generally inoffensive if left alone, but if provoked, become very
    deadly opponents. Giant hornets have a society structure consisting of two
    distinct classes: workers and the queen.
  - >-
    Workers spend their time pulling nectar from flowers and carrying it to the
    nest where they feed the young, the queen, and the other hornets. They are
    also the hornets involved in defending the nest and queen from attack.
  - >-
    When aggressors are detected within 100 feet of the nest, the workers fly
    out and patrol the area. Creatures that move within 20 feet are attacked.
  - >-
    The queen's sole purpose is to lay eggs that ultimately hatch and grow into
    new hornets. She has no stinger and does not attack-workers kill most
    aggressors long before they reach the queen. Giant hornet builds its nest
    high above the ground in much the same way a standard wasp does.
  - A giant hornet's nest has a curved flare at the top.
  - >-
    Giant hornets attack by biting their foes, only relying on its stinger when
    threatened. During combat, it releases a pheromone that agitates all other
    giant hornets in the area, making them more aggressive.
