SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Piercing Beak (Ex)
    description: >-
      A kongamato's beak is extremely hard and adept at breaking objects. When
      attempting to damage an item, a kongamato's beak attack does double damage
      and is treated as if it were adamantine for the purposes of overcoming the
      object's hardness.
  - name: Wailing Dive (Su)
    description: >-
      When a kongamato makes a charge while flying or uses its Flyby Attack
      feat, the creature's body becomes infused with energy, causing its bite to
      deal an extra +1d6 points of sonic damage on that attack.
Description:
  - >-
    Kongamatos are primeval dragons that hunt the deep jungles of the world.
    Although not as intelligent or magically adept as their "true" cousins,
    kongamatos are respected and feared for their resilience and awesome
    strength. While the kongamato's body is clearly draconic- squat and dense
    with sharp claws capping each of its four limbs-the creature's head is
    distinctly avian, with a long, toothless beak and a pronounced crest. A
    kongamato's hide is a rich emerald hue, with an ash-colored underbelly and
    crimson webbing on its broad wings. Females have smaller head-crests than
    males, and a rosy hue colors both the undersides of their wings and their
    underbellies.
  - >-
    Kongamatos are apex predators that make their lairs in the tops of the
    oldest and strongest trees, or in caves and ruins. Kongamatos are
    carnivorous and prey on large herd animals. Although they do not have teeth,
    their beaks are sharp and strong, allowing them to carve their kills with
    precision and to punch through wood, rock, and even metal. When possible,
    kongamatos hunt on the perimeter of their territories, gliding silently and
    gracefully through even the thickest forest foliage to surprise prey.
  - >-
    Both males and females grow to a length of almost 30 feet, with an equally
    broad wingspan, and can weigh up to 7 tons. Kongamatos live between 500 and
    600 years.
