  - name: Filament (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cave fisher can fire a thin filament of sticky silk as a standard
      action. This touch attack has a range of 60 feet and no range increment. A
      creature struck by a cave fisher's filament becomes attached to the sticky
      thread. As a standard action, a creature can rip the filament free with a
      DC 20 Strength check. A caught creature can also attempt to escape a
      filament by making a DC 25 Escape Artist check. A filament is AC 14 (touch
      12), has 5 hit points, and has DR 15/slashing. An application of liquid
      with high alcohol content (or a dose of universal solvent) dissolves the
      adhesive and releases the creature caught by the filament. A cave fisher
      can have only one filament active at a time.
Description:
  - >-
    The cave fisher lairs on ledges and cliffs underground, where it can quickly
    strike and reel in its prey. Its lair is always littered with bones and gear
    from its previous victims. The cave fisher is a 7-foot long insect-like
    creature with a hard outer shell. The cave fisher's snout fires a strong,
    web-like adhesive filament it uses to reel in its prey. Often, the ground
    and walls nearby are covered with this filament.
  - >-
    The cave fisher's preferred method of attack is to anchor itself to its
    ledge and string its filament across the ground of its lair. When a living
    creature touches or passes near the filament, the fisher attempts to trap it
    and reel it in. If the cave fisher fails this, it can fire its filament at
    an opponent up to 60 feet away. Another favored method of attack for the
    cave fisher is to secret itself in a crack or a ledge above a cavern and
    dangle its filament down onto unsuspecting creatures passing below it (DC 20
    Perception check to notice the filament).
