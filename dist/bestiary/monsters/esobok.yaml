  Malice oozes from this stout, hunched predator. A ruff of dirty feathers
  adorns its hairless, muscular body just below its crocodilian skull.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Eater of the Dead (Su)
    description: >-
      Esoboks feed on the decaying flesh of undead. They are immune to the
      nauseated condition, and any effect that would normally cause them to
      become nauseated instead causes them to become sickened.
  - name: Wrench Spirit (Su)
    description: >-
      If an esobok begins its turn grappling a living or undead creature, it can
      attempt to wrench that creature's animating spirit free as a standard
      action. If the target succeeds at a DC 14 Will save, it takes 1d6 points
      of force damage; if the target fails, its spirit is stripped from its
      body. This effect instantly destroys mindless undead and leaves
      intelligent undead stunned. All other targets are paralyzed. Once per
      round, a creature paralyzed by this effect can attempt a new saving throw
      to free its soul from the esobok's jaws. An esobok can't use its bite
      attack while it holds a disembodied spirit, but it can release the spirit
      back to the spirit's body as a free action. Creatures without souls (such
      as constructs and oozes) and creatures whose bodies and souls are one unit
      (such as outsiders) are immune to this ability.
Description:
  - >-
    The mad dogs of the Boneyard, esoboks are the blunt and vicious predator
    caste of psychopomps. They patrol the Spire as feral hunters, hungry for
    undead flesh. Though as outsiders esoboks don't have to eat and draw no
    sustenance from this behavior, the spark of undeath is a feast for their
    every sense, and they pursue and ravenously consume undead creatures given
    the chance.
  - >-
    Mortals rarely see these otherworldly hunters, and only those steeped in the
    ways of death know of
  - >-
    their existence. They hazily creep into the edges of living mythologies,
    appearing as torturers of fallen souls or delivering a gnashing end to
    mortals whose souls don't meet Pharasma's expectations. In truth, esoboks
    show a curious neutrality towards petitioners. Only the living- and even
    more so the undead-catch their eye, while the truly dead have little to
    fear.
  - >-
    Esoboks are stout, physically impressive specimens, with dog-like bodies and
    the girth of rhinoceroses or hippopotamuses. Their bodies are bald, aside
    from a thick collar of oily feathers at their necks, but bear distinctive
    spots, stripes, or patterns that identify individuals. Even among
    psychopomps, there is speculation regarding how to differentiate between
    male and female esoboks, or even whether they have physical sexes. The
    typical esobok stands 3 feet tall at the shoulder and nearly as wide, and
    weighs upwards of 300 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Like all psychopomps, esoboks are native to the Boneyard and Pharasma's
    Spire. Esoboks are savage and dogged beings, gifted with impressive teeth
    and claws, but they are less intelligent than other psychopomps, and less
    perceptive. They do, however, possess an uncanny ability to sniff out the
    negative energy that animates undead. Their bodies are nearly unassailable,
    with an immune system any living scavenger would envy. In addition to
    dealing physical damage with their bites, an esobok can plunge its eldritch
    jaws deep inside a creature and tear out the living essence that sustains
    its prey. The ties that bind soul to body are strong, though, and esoboks
    eventually lose their grip on all but the weakest of spirits, at which point
    the spirits return to their victims' bodies. Some fringe cults even summon
    esoboks expressly to loosen the spirit from a guru's physical body, allowing
    her to seek wisdom unburdened by the trivial concerns of the living.
  - >-
    While as outsiders they have no need to eat or drink to survive, esoboks'
    gnawing hunger and focused purpose cause them to grow restless, irritated,
    and unpredictable if denied prey too long. They favor unliving meals, but
    will hunt anything they can chase. Esoboks prefer rich sources of negative
    and positive energy-such as characters who can channel energy, beings that
    radiate these energies naturally, or potions and scrolls of various cure and
    inflict spells-but most every entity in the multiverse holds some shining
    seed of energy that an esobok would savor.
  - >-
    Most psychopomps arise from the souls of the unaligned dead, and bring an
    unusual amount of their living selves with them into eternal services.
    Esoboks instead rise from the Boneyard itself. Most believe they are the
    souls of animals, bound into eternal service by Pharasma. A few scholars of
    esoteric lore believe the Spire forges the
  - >-
    creatures from lingering shreds of soulstuff that have flaked from the
    countless weary dead. Whatever their origins, esoboks lack the strong
    personalities common among other psychopomps. They have few personal
    proclivities and loathe individuality.
  - >-
    Within the Boneyard, packs of esoboks roam like wolves, constantly searching
    for intruders and those who would raise the dead or interfere with their
    tombs. These feral packs carve out territories and defend them from
    outsiders and even other psychopomps. While they prefer the taste of
    undeath, esoboks eat their fill of infernal or celestial trespassers. Only
    petitioners and other psychopomps escape their predation.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Esoboks are the savage guard dogs of Pharasma. While vanths serve as eerily
    disciplined soldiers, morrignas hunt fugitives of the system, and other
    psychopomps tend to the bureaucracy of death, esoboks are her guardian
    beasts. Uncorrupted by ethical questions or personal desires, they simply
    shred whatever they encounter.
  - >-
    Their unruly nature and limited intelligence make esoboks ideal border
    guards and attack animals. Like vanths, their behavior is alien and
    unsettling, seemingly devoid of the mortal heritage of most outsiders.
    Vanths find the creatures comforting, and frequently recruit them to direct
    their savage fury against astradaemons, night hags, and others who might
    profit from interfering with the River of Souls. Yamarajes permit only the
    most disciplined of esoboks within sight of the Boneyard's great palaces of
    justice and record halls, and even then only when tightly chained.
  - >-
    Esoboks are never trusted to retrieve the souls of the fallen. Despite their
    fondness for petitioners, they are rough and simple-minded brutes that are
    difficult to control. Even if allowed to visit the mortal world, they
    require short leashes and disciplined masters. They most frequently
    accompany vanths to sites of undead infection, and more rarely act as muscle
    for morrignas tired of subtlety. Occasionally, mortal summoners call forth
    esoboks to contain outbreaks of undead-their joy at the taste of undead
    flesh usually keeps them from causing much harm to other creatures. If they
    lack undead prey, however, esoboks stranded on the Material Plane prey on
    whatever they can chase and catch.
  - >-
    Though esoboks respect and fear more powerful psychopomps, only vanths seem
    capable of training them into anything more than crude animals. Such trained
    esoboks grow substantially in power, as their newfound discipline taps into
    their latent magic. These war dogs have the advanced simple template and
    gain the following spell-like abilities, each usable once per day:
    ear-piercing screamUM, haunting mistsUM, and teleport.
