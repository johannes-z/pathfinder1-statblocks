SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Improved Tracking (Ex)
    description: >-
      An aerial servant takes no penalty to Survival checks when tracking and
      moving at any speed.
  - name: Link with Caster (Ex)
    description: >-
      When summoned, an aerial servant creates a mental link between itself and
      the caster who summoned it. Should the aerial servant fail the mission it
      has been assigned, it returns to the caster and attacks him. The aerial
      servant can find the caster as long as they both are on the same plane of
      existence. If the caster leaves the plane, the link is temporarily broken.
      Once the caster returns or the aerial servant enters the plane the caster
      is on, the link is immediately reestablished and the aerial servant moves
      at full speed toward the caster's current location. Only when the aerial
      servant or caster is destroyed, is the link permanently broken.
  - name: Natural Invisibility (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability is constant, allowing an aerial servant to remain invisible
      even when attacking. This ability is inherent and is not subject to the
      invisibility purge spell. Against foes that cannot pinpoint it, the aerial
      servant gains a +20 bonus on Stealth checks when moving, or +40 when
      standing still-these bonuses are not included in the statistics above.
      This ability does not function when an aerial servant is on the Astral
      Plane or Ethereal Plane, but instead grants the creature concealment (20%
      miss chance).
  - name: Wind Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, an aerial servant can release
      a blast of wind in an 80-foot line. A creature struck takes 4d8 points of
      damage and those up to the aerial servant's size or smaller are knocked
      down and back 2d10 feet. An affected creature can attempt a DC 22 Reflex
      save to reduce the damage by half and avoid being knocked down. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Aerial servants are semi-intelligent creatures from the Plane of Air that
    often roam the Astral and Ethereal planes. They normally are only found on
    the Material Plane as a result of being summoned by a cleric (or, less
    frequently, a wizard) using the greater planar ally or greater planar
    binding spell and commanded to perform some task, often being required to
    use their immense strength to carry objects or aid the summoner. Though an
    aerial servant performs whatever task is asked of it, it resents being
    summoned and forced to do another's bidding; therefore, it attempts to
    pervert the conditions of the summoning and its mission. An aerial servant
    that fails or is thwarted in its mission becomes insane and immediately
    returns to the caster who summoned it, either killing the caster or carrying
    the caster back to the Plane of Air with it.
  - >-
    Aerial servants are invisible on the Plane of Air. On other planes, they can
    be seen when they wish, though only vaguely, and appear as humanoids
    composed of whitish-gray vapor. Sometimes eyes, a nose, and a small mouth
    form in the vapor.
  - >-
    Aerial servants attack by using a shearing blast of wind as a weapon or by
    grabbing an opponent and crushing it within their powerful grasp.
  - >-
    Aerial servants can only be killed on their native plane. If slain
    elsewhere, they simply dissolve into wisps of vapor and return to their home
    plane.
