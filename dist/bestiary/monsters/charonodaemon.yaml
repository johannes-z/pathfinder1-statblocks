Description:
  - >-
    Charonadaemons resemble their master, Charon, the Boatman of the Lower
    Planes, and are often mistaken for him. Unlike their master, they care
    nothing for ferrying souls across the River Styx and seek to murder or steal
    from those that request passage. Travel across the River Styx by a
    charonadaemon costs 50 gp per character level per creature seeking passage.
    The total cost can be in magic items, coins, gems, or any combination of the
    aforementioned items. Even if the price is paid, the charonadaemon usually
    betrays his passengers, attempting to dump them into the River Styx or kill
    them outright. If more money or fare is offered, the charonadaemon can be
    persuaded not to attack. A charonadaemon can be summoned to the banks of the
    River Styx by casting blasphemy, holy word, planar ally, planar binding,
    summon monster IX, or symbol (any). Charonadaemons appear as 6-foot tall
    skeletal humanoids dressed in black hooded robes. Credit The Charonadaemon
