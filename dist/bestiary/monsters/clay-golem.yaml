SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Berserk (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a clay golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 1% chance each
      round that its elemental spirit breaks free and the golem goes berserk.
      This chance resets to 0% after one minute of inactivity. A berserk golem
      attacks the nearest living creature or smashes some object smaller than
      itself if no creature is within reach. Once it goes berserk, no known
      method can reestablish control.
  - name: Cursed Wound (Ex)
    description: >-
      The damage a clay golem deals doesn't heal naturally and resists magical
      healing. A character attempting to use magical healing on a creature
      damaged by a clay golem must succeed on a DC 26 caster level check, or the
      healing has no effect on the injured creature.
  - name: Haste (Su)
    description: >-
      After it has engaged in at least 1 round of combat, a clay golem can haste
      itself once per day as a free action. The effect lasts 3 rounds and is
      otherwise the same as the spell.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A clay golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. • A move earth spell
      drives the golem back 120 feet and deals 3d12 points of damage to it (no
      save). • A disintegrate spell slows the golem (as the slow spell) for 1d6
      rounds and deals 1d12 points of damage (no save). • An earthquake spell
      cast directly at a clay golem stops it from moving on its next turn and
      deals 5d10 points of damage (no save). • Any magical attack against a clay
      golem that deals acid damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of
      damage it would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the
      golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as
      temporary hit points. A clay golem gets no saving throw against magical
      attacks that deal acid damage.
