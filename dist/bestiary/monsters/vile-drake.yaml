SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      A vile drake can, as a standard action, spit a ball of liquid that
      explodes into a cloud of acid. This attack has a range of 60 feet and
      deals 6d6 points of acid damage (DC 17 Reflex half) to all creatures in a
      20-foot radius spread. Additionally, a creature that fails its save takes
      3d6 points of acid damage one round after failing its save. Once a vile
      drake has used its acid breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      Marsh Sickness: Bite-injury; save DC 17 Fort; onset 1 day; frequency
      1/day; effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Int damage. A creature whose Int score drops
      below 12 as a result of marsh sickness acts as if affected by a confusion
      spell (CL 9th) until the disease is cured; cure 2 saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Savage Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A vile drake applies 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to damage dealt with
      its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.
  - name: Speed Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a swift action, a vile drake may draw on its
      draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional
      move action in that round.
  - name: Swamp Stride (Ex)
    description: >-
      A vile drake can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its
      normal speed.
  - name: Water Breathing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A vile drake can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its
      acid breath and other abilities while submerged.
Description:
  - >-
    Vile drakes prey upon those creatures unlucky enough to find themselves
    caught in the drake's territory. Travelers, fishermen, crocodiles,
    lizardfolk, and chikes (see their entry in this book) are the usual victims
    and subsequent meals of vile drakes. Prey that is not devoured immediately
    is carried back to their swampy lairs and stored under the muck and mud for
    later consumption.
  - >-
    Vile drakes are about 9 feet long and weigh close to 800 pounds. Their
    scales are usually black or dark gray, with lighter colors present on their
    undersides. Eyes are always dark in color. Vile drakes mate for life with
    the female laying a clutch of up to five eggs once per year. Eggs are laid
    in the mud and buried to hide them from predators and poachers. Eggs hatch
    within 9 months. Young reach maturity rapidly, usually within 3 years. Vile
    drakes, on average, live up to 200 years.
  - >-
    Vile drakes often stalk their prey for miles before attacking. They are
    generally pack hunters and so encounters with a solitary vile drake are
    rare. When they spring to attack, vile drakes open with their breath weapon,
    and then rush in to bite with their nasty fangs.
