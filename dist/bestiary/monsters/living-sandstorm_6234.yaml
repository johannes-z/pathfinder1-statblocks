SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Sand (Su)
    description: >-
      While in sandstorm form, a living sandstorm can, as a standard action,
      create 500 cubic feet of fine red sand, filling a 10-foot radius beneath
      it to a depth of 5 feet. All creatures in the area and adjacent squares
      must succeed at a DC 22 Reflex save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Medium
      and smaller creatures in the area are buried and must begin holding their
      breath to avoid drowning in the sand. By attempting a Reflex save against
      the same DC, a creature can avoid being buried if there is an adjacent
      space outside the area to which it can move; if the save is successful,
      the creature is moved into an available adjacent space. As a standard
      action, each buried creature can dig itself out or be dug out by another
      with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Invisible creatures in or adjacent
      to the area when the sand is created are outlined until the dust is
      removed. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Sand Blast (Ex)
    description: >-
      When in sandstorm form, a living sandstorm can attack with a blast of
      scouring sand in a 20-foot line. The sand deals 6d6 points of slashing
      damage and blinds creatures in the area for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 22
      Reflex save halves the damage and negates the blinding. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Notorious for appearing suddenly out of the roiling tempests of the deep
    desert, living sandstorms are capable of turning oases and dry farmlands
    into areas of featureless desert in a shockingly short span of time. When
    angered, they can scour a whole army down to bits of shining metal and bone
    buried under feet of shifting sand over the course of one terrible night.
    Some Osiriani scholars claim that living sandstorms are related to the
    deadly khamsin storms that scour the desert, and while these creatures are
    related to elementals, they have nothing to do with the formation of those
    iconic storms. Living sandstorms are most comfortable when sand is free to
    flow across the earth. They become agitated whenever creatures make an
    effort to remove or limit sand in an area, shelter an area from the drifting
    dust, or alter the weather to reduce or prevent sandstorms. However, they
    are curious creatures and enjoy experiencing new interactions with beings of
    other shapes, and are willing to parley when they believe doing so may open
    the door to a novel diversion-or if a creature simply appears easy to
    intimidate.
  - >-
    A living sandstorm in its humanoid shape is about 6 feet tall and weighs 900
    pounds. In sandstorm form, it expands its form into a pulsing cloud of
    streaming, loose sand, which gathers into small clumps before being
    reabsorbed into the storm.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Living sandstorms are formed from and fed by the unpredictable interaction
    of raw elemental earth and planar storms or vortices carrying the essence of
    other planes. These ageless elemental creatures tend to be curious and
    outgoing when they first discover new places, but are easily frustrated by
    any kind of restraint. They use their ability to create sand liberally,
    attempting to pack caves, voids in the Plane of Earth, and other open areas
    at least half-full of their reddish sand. Because of their origin, they are
    usually found near gates, portals, and vortices between planes both on the
    Plane of Earth and on the Material Plane.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Living sandstorms dwell in the rare open caverns on the Plane of Earth. On
    that plane, they are misfits, feared for their affinities for open spaces
    and howling winds. When conflicts erupt between the powers of the Elemental
    Planes, they are sometimes recruited to lead strike teams into other planes,
    as they are adventurous and enjoy discovering open spaces they can fill with
    their fine, red sand. They are especially valuable when establishing
    beachheads on planes that have little in the way of earth, because of their
    ability to create large amounts of sand in relatively short periods of time.
  - >-
    Due to their intrepidness, they readily answer callings to serve summoners
    so they can visit new places and spread their sand far and wide. If they see
    an opportunity to do so, they may break free of their calling and explore
    the wider Material Plane, where they favor desert climes and their nearby
    regions, and where they are known to contribute to rapid desertification.
    When marooned on the Material Plane, they are generally restless until they
    find a way back to the Plane of Earth, but if they know of a route home,
    they instead explore the nearby area, wandering farther and farther until
    they lose interest in filling that world with sand and long to move on to a
    new one.
