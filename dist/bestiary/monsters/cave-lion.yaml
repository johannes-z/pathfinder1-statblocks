Description:
  - >-
    Cave lions are larger, fiercer, relatives of the common lion and roam
    uncivilized plains in cold or mild climates. They resemble normal lions in
    most respects save for the oversized canines these creatures possess (though
    not as long as the smilodon's teeth). Those that dwell in forested areas
    build their lairs among the thick underbrush while those found in more
    mountainous regions inhabit deep caves. A pride consists of one or more
    families and a family consists of at least one male and a number of females
    and cubs.
  - >-
    Cave lions are carnivores. Their diet ranges from small rodents to large
    herd animals (such as bison or moose). Females are the primary hunters and
    do their hunting during either the day or night. When food is scarce, cave
    lions feed on carrion. This often leads to confrontations with hyenas and
    other such creatures. Such confrontations end when the cave lion or its
    opponent backs down and leaves the area.
  - >-
    These animals mate once per year (usually during the late summer months).
    Females always mate with the dominant male in the pride, though if one is
    unavailable she mates with all other males. Gestation lasts about four
    months after which time a litter of 1d2+1 cubs are born.
  - >-
    They leave the den and go on their own around two years of age and reach
    maturity about four years of age. Cave lions live to be about ten years old.
  - >-
    Cave lions grow to a length of 14 feet and weigh in excess of 900 pounds,
    though the typical cave lion is about ten feet long and weighs about 600
    pounds. They have a broad face and rounded ears, and unlike common lions,
    neither males nor females, possess a mane. They range in color from dark
    yellowish-brown to gold. Many have a mottled coat with darker spots of brown
    or gray. Their underbellies are lighter in color, even white on some
    species. Eyes vary from green to gold to brown.
  - >-
    Their mouths are lined with rows of sharp teeth and oversized canines
    measuring about five inches in length.
  - >-
    Cave lions hunt in pairs or groups. They use their Stealth skill to stay out
    of sight of prey and wait for it to pass by. When potential prey moves
    within range, the lionesses sprint from their hiding place and pounce.
  - >-
    Often, one lioness charges and bites, attempting to pin its prey while the
    other cave lionesses attack relentlessly with their bite attacks. Slain prey
    is dragged back to the lair and devoured by all cave lions.
