SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Charming (Su)
    description: >-
      The spirit's aura sways the feelings of creatures within 30 feet that have
      an attitude of unfriendly or worse. Such creatures must succeed at a DC 25
      Will save or be affected by charm monster for 1 day. Creatures that attack
      the spirit must save against the aura, regardless of their attitude. A
      creature that makes its save is immune to the spirit's aura for 24 hours.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Bardic Knowledge (Ex)
    description: >-
      The spirit adds half her Hit Dice (+9) on all Knowledge checks and may
      make all Knowledge checks untrained. Bardic Magic Each day, the spirit can
      cast any three bards spells of any level and in any combination. Her
      caster level for these bard spells is 18th. She may select any spells from
      the bard spell list when using this ability.
  - name: Bardic Performance (Su)
    description: >-
      The spirit has the bardic performance class ability. She can use bardic

      abilities: countersong, distraction, fascinate, and inspire courage (+5).
  - name: Inspiration (Su)
    description: >-
      The spirit can choose an intelligent creature to inspire and serve as a
      muse for by giving that creature some token of her power (typically a lock
      of her hair or a piece of her garment). As long as the spirit retains her
      favor for this creature and the creature carries the spirit's token, the
      creature gains a +4 insight bonus on all Will saving throws, Craft checks,
      and Perform checks. A bard who has the spirit for a muse in this way can
      use his bardic performance for an additional number of rounds per day
      equal to the spirit's Charisma bonus. The spirit retains a link to her
      token and its carrier as if she had cast a status spell on the carrier.
      The spirit can end this effect at any time as a free action, even if she
      is not on the same plane as the carrier. The spirit may inspire a number
      of creatures at a time equal to her Charisma bonus.
  - name: Stunning Bolt (Su)
    description: >-
      The spirit's stunning bolt is a ray of brilliant divine energy. This
      attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. Any creature that
      it strikes takes 1d8 points of damage and must succeed at a DC 25 Will
      save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. If the target succeeds at this save, it
      is merely dazzled for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Unearthly Grace (Su)
    description: >-
      The spirit adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on all her saving
      throws, and as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.
Description:
  - >-
    The Spirit of Adoration is among Shelyn's greatest servants, an intelligent
    personification of true love, whose power lifts the heaviest heart and
    overcomes all obstacles. She rarely comes to the mortal world, and it is
    even rarer for her to enter battle, but when that time comes, it is said
    that there is nothing she cannot bend or break in pursuit of her goal.
  - >-
    The spirit's true form is that of a 10-foot-tall, angel-winged woman-usually
    a human but sometimes an elf- dressed in flowing clothes and bearing a
    shining steel glaive. When interacting with easily frightened mortals
    (especially children), she uses her shapechanging powers to look like a
    human or elf of normal height, attractive according to the standards of the
    local people, but she never makes herself so beautiful as to cause jealousy
    or inspire inappropriate comments or attention.
  - >-
    When not carrying out Shelyn's will, the spirit enjoys dancing in clouds,
    across lakes, and on mountaintops, whether on Golarion or Nirvana, ignoring
    the occasional bolt of lightning that strikes her.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Although she does not need to eat, the spirit loves the occasional taste of
    food or wine, especially wedding cake and champagne toasts. While she does
    not need to sleep, she loves to dream, deciding the framework of her dreams
    before she sleeps and enjoying the mystery of how they play out. Sleeping is
    the only time she is still, as she loves motion, frequently dancing with joy
    or gesturing with her hands while speaking. Her primary role is as a
    messenger of love and beauty, encouraging mortals to pursue love and create
    art, and for much of her work she is present but invisible, speaking just
    the right words to accomplish her mission and vanishing thereafter.
  - >-
    The spirit only kills when she absolutely has to, such as when confronted by
    mindless creatures or irredeemable undead, and even then only if sparing
    them would create a threat to others. She prefers to let her aura of
    charming change hostile creatures into temporary allies, giving her time to
    move aggressive opponents away from innocents and speak words of diplomacy
    under more amiable conditions. She uses her stunning bolts against creatures
    she believes can be talked into surrender or peace, reserving her glaive and
    attack spells for recalcitrant foes and alien or mindless things that
    absolutely cannot understand love or beauty.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    The spirit is a creature of love and is open with her emotions to all
    mortals. She treasures the presence of every infant, child, adult, and
    animal, and can appreciate the beauty of any landscape, no matter how stark,
    blasted, or strange. She is generous, compassionate, and tolerant, and those
    who meet her under pleasant circumstances can't help but agree that she is
    one of the nicest creatures they've ever met. However, most of her
    interactions on the mortal world occur when some great love or beautiful
    work of art is threatened. At these times she grows quiet, her eyes burn
    with the fire of true love threatened, and her face becomes the stern mask
    of an artist lost in the moment of finishing her masterpiece. When inspired
    by this cause, her hands wield glaive, spell, and ray in a beautiful and
    enthralling dance, as though they move to the very music of creation.
  - >-
    The spirit has an excellent memory for names and faces, and enjoys tracing
    the family trees of Shelyn's agathion servitors, often recognizing a distant
    mortal relation 10 generations later. She is friends with all of the
    goddess's minions, and shares this affection with their mortal relatives.
    Though she is not a gossip, she listens to her fellow celestials and is
    aware of who they've helped in the mortal world; she keeps tabs on those who
    have benefited from the goddess's favor in the past and, if necessary, might
    be willing to repay a past favor.
  - >-
    The minions of Zon-Kuthon fill her with pity. Whenever she encounters them,
    she tries to steal them away to a temple of her creator and have the priests
    try to cleanse the mental stains of that dark god. She tries this with his
    divine servants as well, with much more limited success.
