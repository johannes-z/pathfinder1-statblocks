  This short, stunted humanoid is bald and has weirdly twisted limbs, its body
  seeming to fade and come apart at the edges.

      As a touch attack, a khaei can touch a creature and prematurely age it.
      The creature touched must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or take 1d4
      points of Constitution damage and be permanently aged 1d10 years. This
      effect also deals 1d4 points of damage to the khaei. Effects from multiple
      khaei stack, though a single khaei can use this power on a given opponent
      only once.
Description:
  - >-
    The khaei are a mystery even to themselves. Their twisted limbs give them an
    awkward, shambling gait, and their personalities are dull and incurious,
    making them seem in many ways to be simply degenerate humans. At the same
    time, their bodies' tendency to trail off into mist and shadow, combined
    with their weird magical attack, suggests they could be much more. A typical
    khaei stands 4 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.
  - >-
    By far the most unusual aspect of the khaei is their ability to manipulate
    time. A khaei in fear for her life can grab an attacker and forcefully age
    him by several years, creating enormous strain on the foe's body. This
    exertion does damage to the khaei as well, and thus is rarely used, but a
    would-be tyrant who considers the khaei easy pickings may find himself
    surrounded by a weeping mob that quickly ages him into decrepitude-then
    forgives and cares for him. The few scholars who know of the khaei's
    existence speculate that the creatures may themselves be somehow unstuck in
    time, perhaps sent back or forward from another era in preparation for a
    great event.
  - >-
    Khaei live in small, isolated communities underground, often inhabiting a
    single cavern and refusing to explore beyond it or otherwise improve their
    situation. The only known enclave of khaei in the Inner Sea region is in the
    Dark Forest, a cavern deep beneath the city of Kaer Maga, where they serve
    as both subjects and prey for the mysterious dullahan called the Dark Rider.
    One of the most cherished stories of these khaei concerns a time and
    place-somewhere in either the past or the future- when there were many more
    of them, their cavern-forests linked by magical standing stones.
