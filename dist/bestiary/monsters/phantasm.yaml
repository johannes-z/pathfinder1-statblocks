      Once per round, by making a successful incorporeal touch attack, a
      phantasm can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This
      ability is similar to a magic jar spell, except that it doesn't require a
      receptacle. If the attack succeeds, the phantasm's body vanishes into the
      opponent's body. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will
      save (DC 21). A creature that successfully saves is immune to that
      phantasm's possession ability for one day. A possessing phantasm
      automatically deals one negative level (from its energy drain ability)
      each round. A possessed creature can attempt a Will save (DC 19) each
      round to force the phantasm out of its body. If successful, the phantasm
      is ejected from the host and cannot attempt to possess the same host for 1
      minute. If turned or subjected to a dismissal spell while possessing a
      host, the phantasm is likewise ejected. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Phantasms are malevolent and sinister spirits that delight in the
    destruction of good-aligned creatures. While many undead creatures are the
    undead form of once living creatures, phantasms have no real material
    connection to living creatures; they are spirits born of pure evil. They are
    most often found haunting ruined temples or churches dedicated to evil gods,
    or dungeons constructed by evil creatures; any place where the stench of
    evil permeates the very air.
  - >-
    Phantasms are sometimes employed by other, more powerful undead, such as
    liches or vampires, though for the most part they are solitary creatures
    (though sometimes they are encountered with other phantasms).
  - >-
    Phantasm gangs, while rare, work together to bring about the destruction of
    their foes, using their abilities to destroy and corrupt as many opponents
    as they can.
  - >-
    Phantasms appear as translucent humanoid-shaped creatures with faintly
    discernable facial features resembling a human face twisted and corrupted by
    evil. Hair, if present, is formed of the immaterial stuff the phantasm is
    composed of. Their arms are long and thin and end in wisps of the very stuff
    they are made of. Likewise, their lower torso trails off into the same misty
    substance.
  - >-
    A phantasm is a dangerous foe because of its ability to possess and control
    a living creature. It begins battle by attempting to possess a foe, and if
    successful, it then controls the host like a puppet. In addition, while
    possessing a foe, it is constantly sapping its life energy. When the host is
    destroyed, the phantasm leaves the body and attempts to repeat the process
    with any aggressors still around.
