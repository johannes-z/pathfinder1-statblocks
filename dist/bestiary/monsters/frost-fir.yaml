  The faint scent of pine sap accompanies this vaguely tree-shaped creature,
  which stands on two towering trunklike legs. Its arms resemble the branches of
  a snow-laden conifer.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sticky Resin (Ex)
    description: >-
      A frost fir's bark constantly exudes a sticky resin that aids its combat
      maneuvers and natural attacks. The resin grants a frost fir a +2
      circumstance bonus on all disarm, grapple, and steal combat maneuvers, as
      well as on saving throws against effects that cause it to drop something
      it is holding. Any creature that is damaged by a frost fir's slam attack,
      deals damage to a frost fir with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, or
      otherwise touches a frost fir (including with a grapple maneuver), must
      succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be coated with the frost fir's sticky
      resin. A creature affected by this resin takes a -2 penalty on all attack
      rolls and concentration checks (penalties from multiple contacts do not
      stack). Any enemy grappled by a frost fir takes a -2 penalty on attempts
      to break the grapple and to escape using the Escape Artist skill. Strong
      alcohol, universal solvent, or any amount of fire damage dealt to a
      creature coated in resin removes the resin. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Little known outside the colder climes and higher elevations of the world,
    the malevolent tree creatures known as frost firs keep to themselves and
    disdain any who intrude upon their forested realms. Prevailing theories
    among scholars suggest the species descended from treants long ago, a
    derivative offshoot with an exclusive affinity for evergreen trees. But
    despite sharing a common language, frost firs actually disdain treants,
    citing philosophical differences. This revelation has caused others to posit
    that frost firs originated as an entirely separate species, born of the
    enigmatic First World where plants walk and speak as freely as other
    creatures.
  - >-
    The grim-minded frost firs are as cold and impassive as the windswept ice
    and rocks they call home. They care little for other creatures or societies,
    keeping their distance at all times and actively driving away any who dare
    to approach their groves during a reproductive cycle. Frost firs also have
    an especial hatred for those who create or rely upon open flames for warmth.
    Northern travelers often tell tales of frost fir attacks on their caravans,
    usually initiated with a smothering, snowy assault on any campfires. These
    attacks always come at night, and the frost firs never relent until such
    interlopers completely withdraw from their lands.
  - >-
    Frost firs make staunch combatants, specializing in stealthy forms of
    guerrilla warfare. They often utilize pit traps to capture the unwary, or
    draw their victims into ambushes facilitated by their ability to appear as
    normal trees. After grappling and pinning opponents, frost firs often take
    them prisoner and escort them back to a frost fir grove to be butchered and
    used to fertilize the soil for frost fir young. Frost firs craft any
    remaining bones into crude trophies and gruesome signposts marking their
    territory and warning away others. As a result, few species treat with frost
    firs, and any act of Diplomacy with them automatically faces a starting
    attitude of unfriendly.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Frost firs have no individual gender and reproduce asexually, developing
    both male and female cones that grow along their inner limbs near their thin
    torsos. The male cones produce pollen for the female cones, which close and
    gestate for a full year before the seeds are ready to sprout. To facilitate
    this process, frost firs often stand together on high outcroppings or in
    windswept passes during an especially reverent period they call Highwind.
    This allows a maximized sharing of pollen between multiple members of a
    grove, though a single frost fir can create its own offspring. Indeed, many
    groves have sprung from a lone frost fir capable of creating as many as six
    seed cones in a single reproductive cycle. Such progenitors often earn the
    title of Elder Fir among their own kind, which carries a significant status
    when representing the grove in external matters (see below).
  - >-
    Once a frost fir's fertilized cones fully mature, it clears an area of
    sacred ground, removing any residual snow or ice so it can plant its
    seedlings. Groves often band together to share in the responsibility of
    protecting these offspring, and aggressively defend such plots from
    intruders. Frost fir seedlings grow much like sprouting evergreen trees for
    their first two years, incapable of moving and sustained primarily by
    nourishment derived from the soil and sun. Caretakers of these seedlings
    refer to this time as the Loaming, and they often place carrion or other
    organic detritus around the grove to better fertilize the frigid soil and
    encourage more rapid growth. Some even hunt living creatures to ensure a
    supply of carcasses for this effort.
  - >-
    Following 2 years of sustained growth, a young frost fir finally becomes
    ambulatory enough to join the rest of the grove as a contributing member.
    Its lifespan extends about 50 years thereafter, and it can bear offspring
    for only about half that time. Occasionally, a frost fir's development
    remains stunted during the Loaming process and it fails to uproot itself.
    Such a child continues to grow as a regular evergreen tree, but never gains
    sentience. The frost firs often revisit sites where these trees grow to
    mourn their loss.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Frost firs form communal groves of no more than 12 members at a time,
    banding together until their numbers grow large enough for a group to
    separate and establish a new grove. They always make their homes in colder
    climes where other creatures are less plentiful, choosing the most
    inhospitable conditions in an effort to further deter intruders. Most frost
    firs prefer to keep their groves small to attract less attention, and
    purposefully separate into multiple groves to maximize the survival chances
    of their species. Only in times of great conf lict do multiple groves join
    forces. Such gatherings have given rise to legends of entire forests
    disappearing or growing up from an empty field overnight-usually followed by
    great devastation visited upon whatever stirred up the frost firs' ire.
  - >-
    Within frost fir society, Elder Firs carry a high degree of respect between
    groves, serving as representatives not only among their own kind, but also
    to the outside world. They coordinate reproductive cycles with other frost
    firs to replenish any losses a grove endures, and guide the decision-making
    regarding the establishment of new groves. Sometimes they grow larger than
    the other members of the grove, gaining the giant template while taking
    class levels in druid. Such leaders always select the Plant domain for their
    nature bond. Elder Firs who obtain the thousand faces class ability use the
    guises of Medium humanoids to spy upon and interact with nearby settlements
    to ensure no one encroaches on their lands.
