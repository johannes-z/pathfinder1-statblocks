SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Feaster (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a dahzagan can rip out and devour the heart of an
      orc or half-orc who died in battle within the past 24 hours. The strength
      of the dead warrior empowers her, granting her the effects of rage (CL
      9th).
  - name: Terrifying Howl (Su)
    description: >-
      A dahzagan can use the terrifying howl barbarian rage power as a standard
      action (Will DC 19). A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to
      that dahzagan's terrifying howl for 24 hours.
  - name: Undersized Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although dahzagans are Large, their upper bodies are those of Medium orcs.
      As such, they wield weapons as Medium creatures.
Description:
  - >-
    Servants of the orc pantheon, dahzagans are colloquially known as "orc
    valkyries" and are seen by many orcs as the midwives of their gods. These
    wild, bloodlust-driven warriors possess centaurlike builds with oversized
    wolf
  - >-
    bodies below the waist and large, batlike wings growing from their lupine
    backs. When especially strong, brutal, or savage orcs die in battle,
    dahzagans are sent to the Material Plane to fetch the warriors' souls and
    bear them to their gods. The warriors are then reincarnated as even greater
    orcs and returned to the Material Plane to avenge their own deaths.
  - >-
    Completely feral on the field of battle, dahzagans serve their gods loyally,
    usually taking on aspects of the deities to whom they are sworn. While most
    dahzagans serve orc gods, there are rumors of a rare few sworn to Gorum.
  - >-
    Dahzagans are also seen as the spiritual mothers of "cross-souls"-female
    warriors believed to be reincarnations of male orc champions. While male
    orcs often use the idea to explain the existence of capable female warriors
    and leaders, many female orcs resent the practice, and instead see
    dahzagans' gender as a symbol of female orc strength.
  - The average dahzagan is 8 feet tall and weighs 2,300 pounds or more.
