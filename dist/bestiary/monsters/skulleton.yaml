    description: >-
      The skulleton can use its crumbled remains to attack any creature that
      comes within 10 feet. Twice per day as a standard action, it can billow
      forth a cloud of dust that surrounds it in a 10-foot radius. Creatures
      caught within the area must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or be
      nauseated for 6 rounds. The dust cloud remains for 2 rounds and can be
      affected by wind. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Skulletons are undead creatures believed to have been created by a lich or
    demilich, for the creature greatly resembles the latter in that it is
    nothing more than a pile of dust, a skull, and a collection of bones.
  - >-
    The gemstones inset in its eye sockets and in place of its teeth are not
    gemstones at all, but painted glass (worthless). The skulleton is thought to
    have been created to frighten off would-be tomb plunderers, or convince them
    they have defeated the skulleton's creator rather than a minor servitor and
    tomb guardian.
  - >-
    A skulleton lies in wait for its prey. When a living creature touches a
    skulleton, it uses its dust attack to incapacitate and confuse the
    intruders.
  - >-
    Then it rises in the air, pivoting to face its prey and glowering in a
    display of fearsome presence, using its Dazzling Display feat as a
    full-round action to attempt to demoralize those near it. If the intruders
    have not fled, it moves in to bite with its gem-encrusted teeth.
  - >-
    Construction A skulleton's body consists of a humanoid skull and the bones
    and dusty remains of its body. The false jewels are worthless, but do
    require a jeweler of some skill to properly cut and mount them to lend them
    an air of authenticity. Additional rare powders and incense worth 3,500 gp
    are also needed to complete the process.
