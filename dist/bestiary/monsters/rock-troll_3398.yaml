    description: A rock troll heals only if it is underground and touching dirt or earth.
  - name: Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex)
    description: >-
      A rock troll exposed to sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) can only
      take a single move or attack action and is instantly turned to stone (as
      if by a flesh to stone spell) in the next round if its fails a DC 17
      Fortitude save. This effect is permanent, but can be dispelled if the rock
      troll is removed from the source of the sunlight and stone to flesh is
      cast on it. A rock troll must make a new saving throw each round it
      remains in sunlight.
Description:
  - >-
    Rock trolls are relatives of the normal troll and make their lairs deep
    within the subterranean realms of the earth. Most underground creatures
    avoid rock trolls, as they are completely malign and evil, attacking any
    living creature, especially when hungry. They are quite fond of human and
    halfling flesh. Unlike common trolls, rock trolls cannot regenerate lost
    limbs (though they do possess the ability to quickly heal damage). Rock
    trolls are 10 feet tall and weigh about 600 pounds. They resemble their
    smaller relatives in most respects. The rock troll's hide is stone gray or
    brown, its hair is black or brown, and its eyes are dull brown. Rock trolls
    attack any living thing that enters their territory, usually doing so for
    food. They have no strategy or organization in their attacks; a rock troll
    flails relentlessly at its foes with its powerful claws until either it or
    its opponent is dead. Rock Troll Characters Rock trolls have racial Hit Dice
