SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Razmiri Aversion (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Razmiri conditioning received in life is difficult for an apostasy
      wraith to overcome. If confronted by a Razmiri priest or anyone
      successfully disguised in that garb, the apostasy wraith must make a Will
      save. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the Hit Dice + the Charisma
      modifier of the highest-level Razmiri priest present. The apostasy wraith
      needs to make this saving throw only once per encounter, regardless of the
      number of Razmiri priests present. If the saving throw fails, the apostasy
      wraith is forced to flee as if affected by the Turn Undead feat. If the
      save is successful, it overcomes its aversion and gains a +2 bonus on
      attack rolls and deals double damage against Razmiri priests (or those
      disguised as such) for the duration of the encounter.
  - name: Rend Faith (Su)
    description: >-
      On a successful incorporeal touch attack against a foe with divine
      spellcasting abilities, the ability to channel energy, or other divinely
      granted special abilities, the apostasy wraith's inherent spite and
      contempt toward all things religious disrupts the target's connection with
      his deity. The victim must make a successful DC 16 Will save or be unable
      to use any such ability for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Sense Apostate (Su)
    description: >-
      An apostasy wraith can sense the presence and direction of Razmiri priests
      as if using the locate creature spell (CL 20th). This ability cannot be
      dispelled.
Description:
  - >-
    When the souls of the followers of the Living God Razmir reach Pharasma's
    Court, most are bound for the Inner Court, where their ultimate fate as
    believers of a false god is decided. These mortal souls are so traumatized
    by the knowledge of the falseness of their faith that they know only the
    desire to avenge themselves upon those who so duped them in life. These
    souls disavow the legitimacy of all gods, and return to the Material Plane
    to sow their vengeance.
  - >-
    An apostasy wraith exists in a state of constant conflict, torn between its
    burning shame at falling for such duplicity in life and its scorn and hatred
    toward believers for whom faith proved to be genuine. Their primary
    motivation is to wreak vengeance upon the false priesthood of Razmir, but
    that faith's mental conditioning is so effective as to make it difficult for
    an apostasy wraith to even approach its quarry. If able to overcome its
    aversion, its wrath is terrible. Otherwise, an apostasy wraith gladly vents
    its rage upon followers of other gods in an effort to make them see-even if
    only for a moment-the despair of finding one's faith misplaced.
