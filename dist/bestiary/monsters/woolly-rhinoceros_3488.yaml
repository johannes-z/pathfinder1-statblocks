Description:
  - >-
    The woolly rhino is a herbivore of the Pleistocene era feeding mainly on
    various plants, nuts, berries, and bark, as well as large quantities of
    water.
  - >-
    Thus, it is usually found in areas plentiful with water, such as riverbanks,
    lakes, and even marshes and swamps. The woolly rhino usually forages in the
    morning so encounters are more common at this time. It is mostly a solitary
    creature though chance encounters at a common foraging area may lead to
    encounters with more than one creature. Herds tend to gather near watering
    grounds with the females surrounding the young.
  - >-
    Woolly rhinos mate during the late summer or early fall. Gestation lasts
    about 450 days after which time the female gives birth to a single calf.
  - >-
    Calves are dependent on their mother for about the first two years of their
    life. Around three years of age, the calf becomes completely independent and
    reaches maturity by age five.
  - >-
    The woolly rhino averages about 11 feet long and has two ivory horns, the
    longest averaging about three feet in length. Its body is covered in a thick
    layer of black, brown, ruddy, or yellowish-brown fur that enable it to
    withstand its harsh climate. The creature has poor eyesight, and relies on
    its senses of hearing and smell to locate sources of food and warn of
    impending danger.
  - >-
    The woolly rhino is generally passive, but reacts violently if it or its
    herd is threatened. It attacks by goring and trampling its foes, often
    opening combat by charging its foe.
