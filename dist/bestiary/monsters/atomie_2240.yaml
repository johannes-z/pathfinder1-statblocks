Description:
  - >-
    Atomies are among the smallest of the fey. They dwell in arboreal regions,
    with a single atomie family staking their claim to a single tree. The
    atomies are nocturnal, leaving the safety of their treetop abodes under
    cover of darkness to dance and play among the underbrush.
  - >-
    An atomie is a 1-foot tall creature related to pixies and other sprites.
    Atomies are attractive, especially when compared to other sprites. Atomie
    clothing is almost always magical, made to change color with the seasons to
    help hide the wearer during all times of the year.
