SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Wisdom Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A lamia matriarch drains 1d4 points of Wisdom each time she hits with her
      melee touch attack. The first time each round that she strikes a foe with
      a melee weapon, she also drains 1 point of Wisdom. A DC 21 Will save
      negates the Wisdom drain. Unlike with other kinds of ability drain
      attacks, a lamia matriarch does not heal damage when she uses her Wisdom
      drain. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The queens of a race consumed by bitterness and predatory instinct, lamia
    matriarchs mastermind all manner of foul plots in hopes of breaking the
    bestial curse that aff licts their race. They move with shocking ease from
    silken-tongued temptresses to dervishes, striking with all the deadly
    precision of vipers. Quick to covet, enslave, and overindulge, lamia
    matriarchs luxuriate in gory feasts, violent trysts, and bloody
    entertainments, reveling until their playthings are broken or until they
    tire and move on.
