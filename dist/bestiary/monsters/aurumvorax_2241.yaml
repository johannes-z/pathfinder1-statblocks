  - name: Grab (Ex)
    description: >-
      An aurumvorax can grab a foe of up to one size category larger than
      itself. It gains a +8 racial bonus to grapple attempts due to its multiple
      claws.
Description:
  - >-
    The aurumvorax (also called the golden gorger) is an extremely vicious
    creature, attacking any living prey within its territory (and its territory
    often extends up to 1 mile in all directions away from its lair).
  - >-
    The aurumvorax is 3 feet long and weighs about 200 pounds. The creature's
    claws end in razor-sharp, copper colored nails. The aurumvorax's eyes are
    silver with gold pupils. Small whiskers and hairs near its face are bronze
    in color.
  - >-
    The aurumvorax attacks by biting a foe and holding on with its powerful
    jaws. It then rips the foe apart with its claws. An aurumvorax that grabs
    its prey with its jaws does not release the hold unless broken until either
    it or its prey is dead.
