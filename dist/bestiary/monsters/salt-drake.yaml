    description: >-
      A salt drake's breath weapon is a 30 ft. cone of razor-sharp salt
      crystals. In addition to dealing slashing damage the salt crystals absorb
      bodily fluids, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage to living targets.
Description:
  - >-
    Salt drakes are found in warm, arid climates such as deserts or salt flats.
    Salt drakes are omnivorous creatures and very territorial, even fighting
    among themselves to protect their domains. Most encounters are with a
    solitary drake. Only in the midsummer months is it common to find a mated
    pair or family. A salt drake's scales range from dull blue to midnight blue,
    and it is often mistaken for a young blue dragon. Salt drakes range from 8
    feet to 30 feet long. Though difficult to train, salt drakes are favored as
    mounts by goblins, gnolls, and hobgoblins. A salt drake's primary diet
    consists of large quantities of salt. This diet enables the drake to spew
    salt at its opponents. A salt drake opens combat from the air using its salt
    spray breath weapon. If unable to utilize its breath weapon, it relies on
    its claws and bite to finish off any remaining opponents. Training a Salt
    Drake A salt drake requires training before it can bear a rider in combat.
    To be trained, a salt drake must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer
    (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a
    friendly salt drake requires ten weeks of work and a DC 30 Handle Animal
    check. Riding a salt drake requires an exotic saddle. A salt drake can fight
    while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she
    succeeds on a Ride check. Salt drake eggs are worth 6,000 gp apiece on the
    open market, while young are worth 12,000 gp each. Professional trainers
    charge 2,000 gp to rear or train a dragonnel. Carrying Capacity: A light
    load for a salt drake is up to 516 pounds; a medium load, 517-1,038 pounds,
    and a heavy load, 1,039-1,560 pounds. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
