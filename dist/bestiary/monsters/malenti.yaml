SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Frenzy (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a malenti that takes damage in combat can fly into a frenzy
      in the following round. It gains a +2 bonus to its Constitution and
      Strength, but takes a -2 penalty to its AC. The frenzy lasts as long as
      the battle or 1 minute, whichever is shorter.
  - name: Speak with Sharks (Su)
    description: >-
      A malenti can communicate telepathically with sharks to a distance of 150
      feet. This communication is limited to simple concepts, such as "come
      here," "defend me," or "attack this target."
Description:
  - >-
    The unpredictability and viciousness of the sahuagin race isn't just an
    aspect of their sharklike temperament- it seems to be inherent in their very
    beings. The unusual and typically deadly mutants common to the race attest
    to this, their forms altering and becoming more deadly based either on the
    needs of the community or ambiguous environmental factors. Whatever the
    case, sahuagin mutants often rise to positions of respect and inf luence in
    sahuagin communities, their innate advantages instantly placing them among
    their people's rulers. Of these mutants, four-armed sahuagin brutes and
    malenti- sahuagin with the appearances of sea elves-arise most commonly,
    though these are in no way the only sahuagin mutants known to the savage
    seas.
  - >-
    Sahuagin Alterations Both the four-armed sahuagin and the malenti use the
    stats presented on page 239 of the Bestiary as their foundations, with the
    following alterations. As sahuagin are such common menaces over the course
    of the Skull & Shackles Adventure Path, their variants are included here to
    make encounters with the shark people even more unpredictable and deadly.
  - >-
    Four-Armed Sahuagin: These mutants gain Multiattack and Toughness as bonus
    feats and the multiweapon mastery ability. These changes do not include an
    increase in such a mutant's Hit Dice, but do increase its CR to 3. Despite
    the advantages these additions give the creature, its hit points are on the
    low side for a CR 3 monster. GMs should consider giving four-armed sahuagin
    armor considerably better than that usually worn by CR 3 monsters to make up
    for this relative glass jaw. Giving the creature leather armor (or an
    aquatic equivalent, such as shark leather armor) grants it a +2 armor bonus,
    increasing its AC to 18-above the average for its CR, but a considered
    benefit to help balance out its weakness. Four-armed sahuagin excel as
    barbarians, fighters, rangers, and warriors.
  - >-
    Malenti: These mutants gain a +4 bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, Deceitful
    and Skill Focus (Bluff ) as bonus feats, and command as a spell-like ability
    (representing increased telepathic inf luence over aquatic creatures).
    Additionally, a malenti's natural armor bonus decreases to +2 and the
    malenti loses its light blindness and natural weapons. The benefits a
    malenti gains largely offset those it loses, resulting in no change to the
    creature's CR. Malenti excel as bards, oracles, rogues, and wizards.
  - >-
    Other Sahuagin Mutants Although four-armed sahuagin and malenti are the most
    common sahuagin mutants, they are not the only abnormalities to arise from
    sahuagin stock. The following mutants are also sometimes found in sahuagin
    societies. While rarer than other mutants, they too quickly garner the
    respect and fear of their piscine brethren.
  - >-
    Prehistoric Sahuagin: Also known as adacthys, these sahuagin mutants are
    throwbacks to some even more savage epoch; they are Large, have a +7 natural
    armor bonus, and can speak with aquatic dinosaurs and megafauna in addition
    to sharks. They are usually found in the same waters as prehistoric
    creatures or waters that are somehow strangely affected by the flow of time.
  - >-
    Shark-Blooded Sahuagin: These sahuagin mutants have overly large maws filled
    with rows of sharklike teeth, and the fins and tail of an oversized thresher
    shark (or other local variety). These abnormalities give them the appearance
    of monstrous merfolk, a swim speed of 80 feet, and a bite attack that deals
    1d6 points of damage. Shark-blooded sahuagin are most typically found in
    sahuagin communities with unusually high numbers of shark guardians and near
    shark breeding grounds.
  - >-
    Spined Sahuagin: Covered in hundreds of needle-like spines, these sahuagin
    can raise these piercing protrusions to impale creatures that attempt to
    grab or consume them. Any creature that grapples a spined sahuagin takes 1d4
    points of piercing damage. Additionally, these mutants gain Defensive Combat
    Training as a bonus feat. Spined sahuagin most commonly appear in depths
    that also serve as the hunting grounds of sea serpents, thalassic behemoths,
    or other massive aquatic predators.
