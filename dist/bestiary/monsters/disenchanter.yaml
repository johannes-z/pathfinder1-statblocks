    description: >-
      A disenchanter that makes a successful touch attack with its snout drains
      one magic item carried or worn by the target (determined randomly by the
      DM). If the disenchanter aims at a particular item, it must make an attack
      roll against that item's AC. Items worn or carried have an AC equal to 10
      + its size modifier + the opponent's Dexterity modifier (if any). A
      disenchanter does not provoke attacks of opportunity when using this
      ability. An item struck must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or
      permanently lose all magical properties it possesses. An unattended magic
      item has a save bonus equal to 2 + one-half its caster level. An attended
      magic item either makes its save as its owner or uses its own saving throw
      whichever is better. The save DC is Constitution-based. Disenchanters
      cannot affect artifacts.
Description:
  - >-
    The disenchanter is greatly feared for the damage it can cause. Much like a
    rust monster, it feeds on objects most adventurers hold near and dear to
    their hearts-magic items. A typical disenchanter is about 8 feet long and
    weighs 600 pounds.
  - >-
    A disenchanter targets magical items carried or worn by an opponent. A
    disenchanter is able to discern the most powerful magical items in a group
    and always attack those items first, unless those items are too difficult to
    reach (such as hidden in a backpack), in which case the disenchanter will
    choose to attack a more readily available item (such as a magical shield).
    It fastens its snout onto an item and drains the item's magical properties.
    Magical weapons striking a disenchanter cannot be drained of their magical
    properties.
  - >-
    A disenchanter's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
