Description:
  - >-
    Marai are deviant spellcasters first and fiendish corruptors second. If
    allowed to indulge in their desire for perverse mystical study, most marai
    are content to serve as part of another rakshasa's cabal. A solitary marai
    might pose as a neophyte magician to infiltrate another spellcaster's abode.
    If the marai is successful, the master soon becomes either the servant or a
    corpse.
  - >-
    The possibility of new magical discoveries drives a marai. Morality and
    compassion never constrain the fiend's experiments. A marai prefers to
    torment and exploit mortals who have no idea of the rakshasa's true nature,
    and it takes great pleasure in using magical might to bring would-be heroes,
    especially those who invade its lair, to their knees. Such a game offers a
    marai enjoyment, however, only if subjects are unaware of the danger or at
    least unable to oppose it.
  - >-
    A marai is 6 feet tall and weighs 160 pounds. Its serpentine arms render
    fine manipulation or wielding weapons unfeasible, and so it typically
    assumes humanoid form when working on experiments that require manual
    dexterity. A marai unable to do so must rely upon cantrips like mage hand
    for such tasks-or perhaps the aid of a slave or charmed ally.
