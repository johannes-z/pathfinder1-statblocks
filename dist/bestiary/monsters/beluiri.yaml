  ridge of small spines runs from the creature's brow down the center of its
  head and tapers off just below its shoulder blades.  Its hands end in
  razor-sharp talons and its eyes are sapphire blue.

      must succeed on a DC 27 Will save or fall under her influence for 1d6+1
      hours as if affected by a charm monster spell (CL 20th). The save DC is
      Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from her Ability Focus feat.
Description:
  - >-
    Beluiri is one of the many concubines of Lord Baphomet (and one of his
    favorites). She is known throughout the Abyss as the Temptress, for in her
    many disguises she has seduced countless princes, lords, and generals of the
    Abyss. In the end, she most often betrays those that fall victim to her
    wiles. She is hated for this by more than one noble or lord of the Abyss.
    She sometimes journeys to the Material Plane (in one of her many guises) to
    tempt and seduce mortals, for she knows that all mortals, in their hearts,
    always give in to their true desires-be it power, greed, lust, or one of
    many countless other sins.
  - >-
    Beluiri rarely wears clothing, but at times when she does, she enjoys gowns
    and robes of gold, white, and red.
  - Beluiri prefers subterfuge rather than directly assaulting an opponent.
  - >-
    She usually alters her appearance to appear as an attractive member of a
    potential victim's race; once the victim is lured in, she assumes her true
    form and attacks. If combat goes against her, she flees, but only after
    summoning lesser demons to cover her escape and kill her opponents.
