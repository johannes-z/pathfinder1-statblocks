SQ: corpulence, devil summoner, throne of skulls
Environment: Hell
Organization: solitary, pair, or lecture (3-8)
Treasure: standard
Description_Visual: >-
  Seemingly fused with a monstrous throne of iron skulls, this impossibly
  corpulent being floats several feet off the ground. Trappings cut in mockery
  of holy vestments do little to cover the thing's pallid, leaking rolls of
  blister-pocked girth. Worthless, clublike hands waggle like maggots, directing
  a cloud of weathered scrolls and blasphemous tomes that orbit its bulk. Barely
  distinguishable amid its mound of chins squints a pair of glassy black eyes,
  riding above a disproportionately wide mouth curled into a perpetually
  lecherous grin.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Corpulence (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ayngavhauls are greasy and grossly obese. This extraordinary bulk provides
      them with a +10 bonus on their combat maneuver defense.
  - name: Blasphemous Bile (Su)
    description: >-
      30-ft. line, once every 1d4 hours; damage 4d6 acid, Reflex DC 23 half.
      Those struck by this bile find themselves drenched in liquid corruption so
      profound it impedes the power of non-evil divine magic for 10 minutes. Any
      non-evil divine spellcaster who casts a spell targeting a creature soaked
      in an ayngavhaul's bile must make a DC 23 caster level check or have the
      spell fail. A creature affected by this bile may wash off the sludge by
      spending a round and using at least a gallon of fluid to cleanse itself.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Devil Summoner (Su)
    description: >-
      Ayngavhauls know the secrets of all breeds of devils, utilizing such
      leverage in the summoning of their kind. Any devil within 30 feet of an
      ayngavhaul has half again the normal chance of having a fiend respond to
      its summon devil ability. For example, an osyluth's usual 35% chance to
      summon another bone devil increases to 52% when within 30 feet of an
      ayngavhaul. Summoning bonuses provided by multiple ayngavahuls do not
      stack. Ayngavahuls are immune to this ability, from both themselves and
      others of their kind.
  - name: Searing Word (Su)
    description: >-
      An ayngavhaul can speak words of torment, giving them shape and sending
      them streaking toward their enemies in the form of diabolical sigils. Any
      good-aligned creature struck by one of these infernal words takes 3d6
      points of hellfire damage (half fire, half evil energy); nongood creatures
      take half damage. These words cannot affect creatures affected by
      protection from evil or within an area of magical silence.
  - name: Summon Devil (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day an ayngavhaul can attempt to summon 2d6 imps, 1d4 bearded
      devils, or 2 bone devils with an 80% chance of success, or a contract
      devil (see Pathfinder Adventure Path volume #12) with a 45% chance of
      success. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell.
  - name: Throne of Skulls (Su)
    description: >-
      All ayngavhauls hover upon fearsome infernal thrones. These thrones grant
      the devils their fly speed and a +4 armor bonus. Should an ayngavhaul be
      grappled or knocked down, it is unseated from its throne and loses these
      benefits. An ayngavhaul has telepathic command over its throne and may
      call its conveyance back and reseat itself as a full-round action.
Description:
  - >-
    Bloated scholars of despair, ayngavhauls collect, create, and spread
    heresies and apocrypha, sowing disbelief and corruption to all who would
    seek their foul wisdom. Ironically among the most humanlike, yet still most
    repulsive breeds of devilkind, these corpulent blasphemers are barely even
    able to move without the aid of their profane floating thrones. Although
    their bloated forms make them considerably less of a threat than their
    brethren physically, they speak maledictions foul enough to agonize those
    who hear them, yet even with such powers of vicious wisdom, their true
    strength lies in their envenomed words and temptations of the mind. Their
    centuries of research grant them great leverage over their diabolical kin,
    and few devils dare not obey the summons of these hellish scholars.
    Ayngavhauls are roughly ovular in form, their def lated girths about 10 feet
    tall with their rolls of wet gristle spreading over 13 feet wide. Off their
    thrones, these devils weigh approximately 2,300 pounds, though the eldest
    can weigh considerably more. Ecology Ayngavhauls' bloated girths make them
    slaves to their repulsive physical forms. All ayngavhauls, even the newly
    formed, are monstrously obese, trapped within prisons of their own leaking,
    diabolical flesh. To aid them, though, the forges of Phlegethon create
    terrifying thrones empowered by infernal magics. These foul chariots hold
    their corpulent masters aloft, serving as both vehicles and sources of
    profane protection. Each throne of skulls is bound to a specific ayngavhaul,
    dissolving into a pile of ashes and a breath of searing iron dust should its
    master be destroyed. Habitat & Society The majority of ayngavhuals frequent
    the grim libraries of Hell, particularly the mired museums of Stygia; the
    Fallen Fastness of Dis; and Betzebbul, the palace of Baalzebul, in Cocytus.
    Within these heretical storehouses and academies of evil, these grotesque
    devils rewrite the histories of countless worlds to obscure truths and skew
    the past toward the desires of Hell. Grotesque curators of a sort,
    individual ayngavhauls take great pride in specializing in fields none of
    their brethren have ever thought to focus their studies upon-the more
    obscure and blasphemous, the better. Thus, while one devil might spend eons
    learning all there is to know of linnorm frost poisons, another might
    research the nuances of Azlanti voice tearing. Each seeks to promote its
    particular field of research above all others, sowing its knowledge among
    their blasphemous works, minions, and summoners who might put such foul
    wisdom to the most sinister uses. They prove incessantly paranoid that the
    works of their brethren might be outstripping their own discoveries, or that
    others in related fields might be stealing their research, thus proving both
    suspicious of their kindred and intimately familiar with the works of other
    infernal scholars. As such, a single ayngavhaul might begrudgingly point a
    summoner in search of specific information toward a diabolical expert,
    though these knowledge-obsessed fiends never reveal their secrets without
    demanding a price.
