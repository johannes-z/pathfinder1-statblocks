Description_Visual: >-
  This creature appears as a 30-foot long dragon composed of fire. Its eyes burn
  with a white-hot flame and flames lick the dragon's great mouth as it roars.

  crashing into the ground.

      Anyone within 60 feet of an elemental fire dragon must succeed on a DC 27
      Fortitude save or take 2d8 points of fire damage from the intense heat.
      The save DC is Constitution-based. Combustibles automatically catch fire
      if they contact an elemental fire dragon.
  - name: Rain of Fire (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a hovering elemental fire dragon can rapidly beat
      its wings causing fire to rain down on an area in a 100-foot radius.
      Creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 27 Reflex save or take 2d8
      points of fire damage as clothes catch fire or armor and weapons become
      searing hot. The damage continues for another 1d8 rounds after the attack
      or until the flames are extinguished. Combustibles in the area
      automatically catch on fire.
Description:
  - >-
    One of the most feared creatures from the Plane of Fire is the dreaded
    elemental fire dragon. They make their homes in the heart of the many
    volcanoes that dot the elemental landscape. Composed entirely of flames,
    these magnificent creatures fear little and are respected and feared by
    those that have encountered them. Elemental fire dragons are malign,
    vicious, and thoroughly evil. They delight in killing and torturing others,
    especially magmin (whom they relish as a delicacy). They often employ
    salamanders to aid them in their adventures, but once they have accomplished
    their goals, any surviving salamanders are usually devoured. Elemental fire
    dragons cannot enter water or any other nonflammable liquid, but they can
    fly or step over it. The typical elemental fire dragon is at least 30 feet
    long. Elemental fire dragons are ruthless adversaries. They care nothing for
    treasure or anything of value. An elemental fire dragon attempts to
    annihilate its opponents using any means possible. Copyright Notice Author
