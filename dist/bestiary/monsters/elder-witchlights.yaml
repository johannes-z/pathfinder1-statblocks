Description_Visual: >-
  These fey, when young, resemble caterpillars or worms 1/2 in. long with
  miniscule elven faces. Once they mature they resemble tiny elves no larger
  than a fat housefly, with moth-like wings on their backs. They emit a
  beautiful pastel glow, and when doing so at night they appear to be no more
  than bobbing globes of soft light.

  - name: Glimmer (Su)
    description: >-
      Witchlights produce a luminance in their larval stage equal to a candle in
      brightness. In their adult and elder stage the light is up to half
      torchlight intensity (bright light in a 10 ft. radius). They can change
      the intensity or extinguish this light as a free action. The glimmer is a
      steady, soft glow, and may be silvery-white or just about any color,
      though the fey that raise them favor pastel shades. Each witchlight has
      its own unique color which it cannot change.
Description:
  - >-
    Witchlights are a race of diminutive fey that are bred by pixies and other
    sylvan creatures to provide illumination and atmosphere to their events.
    They are born on midsummer in their larval state. In the autumn they spin
    cocoons for themselves in which they ride out the winter, hatching in early
    spring in their adult form. As adults, their beating wings release thousands
    of spores which, when it comes in contact with flower pollen and moonlight,
    germinate into eggs.
  - >-
    Adult witchlights are vulnerable to cold temperatures, and in all but the
    warmest climates they die in the fall when the weather turns chilly.
  - >-
    However, favored witchlights may be cared for through the harsh winter
    months; those that survive become elder witchlights. They increase to 1 HD
    fey, and gain +1 hit point per year of life until they have reached the
    maximum possible for their hit dice. Elder witchlights have an Intelligence
    score of 2, which increases to 3 when they reach maximum hit points. The
    most intelligent witchlights have limited sentience, capable of
    understanding the sylvan language to a degree and even speaking a few words
    of it.
  - >-
    For every point of intelligence an elder witchlight possesses, it gains one
    of the following spell-like abilities usable at will: stabilize, dancing
    lights, daze, flare, ghost sound, light, prestidigitation, purify food and
    drink (1/hour only), or virtue.
  - >-
    Larval and normal witchlights have no combat abilities, and are worth no XP.
    Elder witchlights may be worth ad-hoc experience (no more than CR 1/4) if
    they have spell-like abilities usable in combat.
  - Witchlight Familiars
  - >-
    A witchlight may be taken as a familiar through the Improved Familiar feat.
    The minimum level to acquire such a familiar is caster level 3. Elder
    witchlights do not gain additional spell-like abilities for having their
    intelligence raised due to being a familiar.
