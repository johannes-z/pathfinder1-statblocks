    description: >-
      An alu-demon gains temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt each
      time she successfully hits with a claw attack. She cannot gain more than
      her target's current hit points + the target's Con score (which is enough
      to kill the target). The temporary hit points disappear in one hour.
Description:
  - >-
    The alu-demon is the female demonic offspring of a succubus and human.
    Though part demon, not all alu-demons are inherently evil (although
    good-aligned alu-demons are extremely rare). The typical aludemon has black
    or brown hair and dark green, brown, or black eyes. Alu-demons are always
    female. Alu-demons are often sent to the Material Plane to seduce mortals.
    When on such missions they typically arrange their flowing hair so it hides
    their horns and also fold their wings against their backs (and tuck them
    under their robe, shirt, or whatever garment of clothing one happens to be
    wearing at the time). Alu-demons attack with weapons (preferring longswords
    or maces) or with claws. The alu-demon mixes in her spell-like abilities
    regardless of the method of attack utilized. Credit The Alu-Demon originally
    appeared in the First Edition module S4 Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth (©
    TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1982) and later in the First Edition Monster
    Manual II (© TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.
