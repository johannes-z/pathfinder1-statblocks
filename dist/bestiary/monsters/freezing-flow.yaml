      As a creature of living ice, a freezing flow is difficult to discern from
      its surroundings in icy and snowy land environments and when in icy water.
      A successful DC 15 Perception check is required to notice a freezing flow
      in these environments. Any creature that fails to notice a freezing flow
      and walks into it automatically takes damage as if struck by the ooze's
      slam attack.
  - name: Jagged Slam (Ex)
    description: >-
      A freezing flow's slam attack is a slashing tendril of crystalline ice. It
      deals slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage and has a critical
      range of 19-20.
  - name: Numbing Touch (Ex)
    description: >-
      Each time a freezing flow deals cold damage with its slam attack or
      constrict ability, the target must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be
      staggered with numbing cold for 1 round. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    It's believed that these strange frozen oozes are created when a
    particularly cold arctic area has prolonged exposure to ice from the
    Elemental Planes. Rising seemingly spontaneously from such a supernatural
    deep freeze, freezing flows shamble forth in search of prey, hungry for the
    life energy of warm-blooded creatures, which they somehow metabolize. Within
    their native habitat, these oozes are particularly difficult to spot. While
    they lack intelligence, they have an instinct to stay put within frozen ice
    flows, on the icy surface of frozen lakes and rivers, or within areas of
    permafrost, waiting for prey to stumble upon them. This instinct may be tied
    to the fact that they can stay relatively dormant for decades or even
    centuries, but eventually they need the life energy of warm-blooded
    creatures to fuel their strange locomotion. Since they dwell in unforgiving
    and underpopulated areas, it is easier for them to conserve energy and wait
    for prey rather than to try to track down warm-blooded creatures. After
    feeding, or when fully fed, these creatures tend to ignore other creatures
    unless attacked. Though freezing flows' crystalline construction can give
    the illusion that they are brittle, nothing is further from the truth. When
    a freezing flow slams into flesh, it does so with enough power to break
    bone, and it is cold enough to numb flesh, causing its prey to convulse in a
    fit of shivers. When hungry, the only things freezing flows avoid are fire
    and high temperatures. Such things can still melt and damage a freezing
    flow, though it typically requires more heat to diminish a freezing flow
    into a puddle of water than it takes to melt a patch of normal ice 10 times
    the ooze's size.
