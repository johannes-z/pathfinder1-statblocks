SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animated Hair (Su)
    description: >-
      A korred's hair is constantly writhing and twitching. As a free action, a
      korred can cause its long hair to reach out and interfere with adjacent
      creatures- tugging at clothes and weapons, tangling feet and arms,
      tickling, and generally making a nuisance of itself. The korred can select
      which adjacent targets are affected by its animated hair. These targets
      must make a successful DC 16 Reflex save each round to avoid becoming
      entangled for 1 round. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Stone Stride (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability works like tree stride, except it requires loose boulders at
      least as large as the korred, and only has a range of 30 feet. The korred
      can use this ability once per round as a standard action.
  - name: Stunning Laugh (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a standard action, a korred can unleash a strange
      laugh that stuns all creatures within a 30-foot burst for 1d2 rounds
      (Fortitude DC 14 negates). This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. Fey are
      immune to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Korreds are an ancient fey race who like forested areas with nice, rocky
    ground. They resemble small, wildhaired humanoids with wild, knotted hair.
    Korreds especially like to dance in ancient stone circles within forest
    glades, often led by satyrs with panpipes. They are a shy race and do not
    take kindly to outsiders discovering them, even by accident. They almost
    always attack nonkorreds who stumble into their territory, seeking to kill
    them or at least drive them off.
  - >-
    Korred clothing normally consists of a simple leather apron, jerkin, or
    kilt, leaving their legs uncovered and their feet bare. Their clothes
    usually have a large pocket or pouch to hold their belongings. A korred's
    hair and beard grow quickly, sometimes an inch a day, and the korred trims
    its hair when the locks become too unruly, saving the trimmings in its
    pocket so it can weave them into ropes for its animate rope spell-like
    ability.
