SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mudbog secretes a digestive acid that quickly dissolves organic
      material, but not metal or stone. Any melee hit deals 1d6 points of acid
      damage. Armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless
      it succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. A wooden weapon that strikes a mudbog
      dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. The
      mudbog's acidic touch deals 17 points of acid damage per round to wooden
      objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the object for 1 full
      round to deal this damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    description: >-
      The consistency and coloration of a mudbog makes it difficult to discern
      from a normal patch of mud. Any creature within 10 feet of a mudbog must
      make a DC 20 Perception or Survival check to determine the actual nature
      of the creature.
  - name: Engulf (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Medium or smaller opponent that walks into a mudbog is automatically
      grappled and takes 1d6 acid damage each round the mudbog maintains the
      hold. Engulfed creatures are considered to be grappled and are trapped
      within the mudbog's body. This ability otherwise functions as swallow
      whole, save that a creature that cut its way out of a mudbog leaves no
      hole in the protoplasmic creature's body.
Description:
  - >-
    Mudbogs are strange, slow-moving, pudding-like creatures that dwell in
    swamps, fens, and wetlands. Situated comfortably in its hole along
    well-traveled paths, a mudbog is likely to be mistaken for a patch of muddy
    water or a wet spot in the road. Creatures attempting to simply walk over or
    through the "mud puddle" find themselves stuck fast and, worse yet, being
    consumed by the hungry ooze.
  - >-
    A mudbog doesn't really attack its opponents; its method of getting a meal
    is strictly passive. However, once a meal stumbles into its protoplasmic
    body, the mudbog is determined not to let it escape. They are brownish in
    color, resembling nothing more than brackish mud. These monsters use their
    coloration to their best advantage and use their acidic bodies to dig a
    hole, usually several feet deep, in which to lie in wait for a meal. The
    average mudbog is roughly 10 feet across and 3 feet deep.
  - >-
    A mudbog lacks the intelligence to collect treasure. However, the
    possessions of its victims can always be found in a heap at the bottom of
    the hole it has chosen as its home. Actually getting to the treasure
    involves somehow removing the mudbog from its hole.
