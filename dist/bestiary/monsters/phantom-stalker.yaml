SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burn (Ex)
    description: >-
      Anyone touching (or touched by) a phantom stalker must succeed on a DC 15
      Reflex save or take an extra 1d6 points of fire damage as clothes ignite
      or armor becomes searing hot. The damage continues for another 1d4+4
      rounds after the phantom stalker's last successful attack. Phantom
      stalkers can also ignite flammable materials with a touch. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Death Throes (Ex)
    description: >-
      A phantom stalker reduced to 0 hit points or less expels a fiery blast
      equivalent to a fireball (caster level 6th) that deals 6d6 points of fire
      damage to all creatures within 20 feet. A DC 15 Reflex save reduces the
      damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based. A phantom stalker never
      uses this ability if it would harm the one that summoned it, unless the
      summoner itself is to blame for the phantom stalker's destruction (i.e.,
      if the summoner attacks the stalker or orders it into battle against
      opponents that clearly outmatch it).
  - name: Find Target (Sp)
    description: >-
      If the one who summoned the phantom stalker is slain while the stalker is
      on the Material Plane, the stalker can unerringly find the slayer as
      though guided by discern location. Once the slayer has been tracked and
      dealt with, the phantom stalker returns to its home plane.
  - name: Flames of Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any magical attack against a phantom stalker that deals fire damage heals
      1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal. If
      the amount of healing would cause the phantom stalker to exceed its full
      normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points.
Description:
  - >-
    Phantom stalkers live in the Elemental Plane of Fire. In its true form, a
    phantom stalker appears as a column of fire. It can take a humanshaped form,
    appearing as a muscular, fiery red humanoid about 8 feet tall. A phantom
    stalker rarely enters the Material Plane on its own. If encountered, it is
    usually in the employ of a spellcaster that has summoned it there to do his
    bidding. A phantom stalker can be summoned using a summon monster IV spell.
  - A phantom stalker is 6 feet tall and weighs about 180 pounds.
  - >-
    A phantom stalker attacks with its claws, attempting to grab its opponent
    and pull it into its body.
