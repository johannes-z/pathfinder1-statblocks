SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Shadow Blend (Su)
    description: >-
      In conditions of illumination other than bright light, a shadow drake
      disappears into the shadows, giving it concealment (20% miss chance). It
      can resume or suspend this ability as a free action.
  - name: Speed Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a swift action, a shadow drake may draw on its
      draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional
      move action in that round.
  - name: Stygian Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a shadow drake can exhale a ball of black liquid
      that explodes into a cloud of frigid black mist. This attack has a range
      of 60 feet and deals 2d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 12 half) to all
      creatures within a 5-foot-radius spread. The mist snuffs out light sources
      in the area effect, extinguishing nonmagical light sources and dispelling
      light spells of 1st level or lower. Once a shadow drake has used its
      stygian breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Shadow drakes are mischievous and greedy. They often use their whiplike
    tails as third limbs, grasping small objects or even using their tails to
    work locks or swipe small objects they desire. Because they are so small and
    fast, they are master thieves and pickpockets. Unlike most drakes and
    dragonkin, shadow drakes like to haunt the fringes of civilization, often
    making lairs in abandoned buildings, forgotten attics, or unused bell
    towers, and stashing their tiny treasure hoards there. A shadow drake can be
    chosen as a familiar by a 7th-level evil spellcaster who has the Improved
    Familiar feat. Young shadow drakes are almost pure black and have lustrous
    hides. As they age, their scales lose this luster and turn dull gray. Much
    like their larger dragon cousins, shadow drakes are long-lived, and can
    reach 150 to 200 years in age.
