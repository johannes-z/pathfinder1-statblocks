  The glossy alabaster coat of this noble horse ripples with muscles, while its
  hooves shimmer with pale blue energy.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapons (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a dragon horse can breathe out a 30-foot cone of
      mist. This mist either deals 10d6 points of cold damage (DC 20 Reflex half
      ), creates a region of fog in the area that lasts for 1 minute (similar to
      that created by a fog cloud spell), or creates a blast of severe wind (see
      Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 439) in the area. The dragon horse may use
      this breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Flying Charge (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dragon horse gains a +4 bonus on damage rolls if it charges while
      flying.
  - name: Know Alignment (Su)
    description: >-
      Dragon horses automatically know the alignment of any creature they can
      see.
  - name: Shift Planes (Su)
    description: >-
      A dragon horse can enter the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, Plane of Air,
      or Material Plane once per day as a standard action. This functions as
      plane shift, but the dragon horse can only bring up to two other willing
      creatures with it, and only if they are on its back.
Description:
  - >-
    Despite their name, dragon horses are not related to dragons. These noble
    creatures gain their name from their ability to fly through the air without
    wings and to create different effects with their misty breath.
  - >-
    Dragon horses are solitary creatures, spending most of their time up among
    the clouds and rarely setting hoof to solid ground. A mated pair of dragon
    horses remains together to raise its young, but otherwise individuals prefer
    to be on their own. They are fierce and reclusive, but peaceful and even
    playful under the right circumstances. Dragon horses sometimes offer aid and
    assistance to decent folk in need, taking care to use their ability to know
    alignment to avoid accidentally providing aid to evil creatures, whom they
    despise.
  - >-
    Dragon horse foals are highly prized as potential steeds, but as dragon
    horses are highly intelligent creatures, they cannot be trained as if they
    were animals. Instead, one who seeks a dragon horse mount must use diplomacy
    to secure the creature's aid.
  - >-
    Peaceful creatures by nature, dragon horses prefer to avoid combat by flying
    away. When they are forced to fight (often in response to an evil creature's
    mayhem), they attempt to deal nonlethal damage to all but evil-aligned foes,
    leaving any unconscious opponents unharmed. Those who have chosen evil ways
    may sometimes receive the same mercy, in the hope that it helps them see the
    light, but innately evil foes are dispatched as quickly and cleanly as
    possible.
