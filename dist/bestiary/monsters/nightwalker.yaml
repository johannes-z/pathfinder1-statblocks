Description:
  - >-
    The most commonly encountered nightshade is the giant-like nightwalker. This
    powerful foe leads armies of undead against the living, but unlike most
    mortal generals the nightwalker is not content to stand back and observe the
    battles from safety. The undead creature is ever eager to put its tactics
    and plans to the test itself, and takes part in battles in every possible
    occurrence save for those that the creature has determined are
    self-destructive. This is not to say that the nightwalker never sacrifices
    its troops to gain a tactical advantage-just that these attacks are the only
    ones the monster feels no urge to participate in directly.
  - >-
    Nightwalkers enjoy inf licting despair before death, particularly by
    destroying valued objects or murdering loved ones before delivering the
    final blow to a foe.
  - A nightwalker is 20 feet tall and weighs 5,000 pounds.
