  - name: Glittering Radiance (Su)
    description: >-
      An orsheval usually glows with a golden light equivalent to that of a
      candle. In battle, its glow increases, filling the area within 5 feet of
      it with shining motes. These motes cling to all creatures in the affected
      area, outlining them as glitterdust for 6 rounds. Opponents in the area
      must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be blinded; a blinded creature may
      attempt a new saving throw each round at the end of its turn to end the
      blindness. The motes persist for 1 round after the orsheval moves from a
      square, leaving a trailing cloud that can affect creatures that move into
      the affected area. The orsheval can suppress or reactivate the glow or
      motes as a free action. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - An orsheval is a patient, hard-working servitor of Abadar.
  - >-
    Accustomed to bearing heavy loads and vulnerable riders, an orsheval
    fulfills its duties without complaint, glad to contribute to the long-term
    goals of its master. Its iron body shines with light, and it uses this
    natural glow to lead allies or continue work long into the night. Although
    only the size of ponies, orshevals can look like miniature, sculpted
    versions of full-grown horses of any kind, but most prefer the shape of a
    sturdy draft horse or warhorse.
  - >-
    An orsheval is as intelligent as a typical human and quite familiar with the
    nature of trade, bargaining, and spotting liars and cheats. Many arrogant
    mortals have ignored or insulted orshevals, thinking them dumb beasts, only
    to have the servitors chastise them using truespeech. When dealing with such
    people, an orsheval might become as stubborn as a true horse, relenting only
    if the offender apologizes and makes appropriate financial restitution to
    the church of Abadar.
  - Most orshevals stand about 4 feet tall and weigh about 700 pounds.
