Description:
  - >-
    The Blackravens are an elite band of soldiers and scouts who guard the
    eastern borders of the Linnorm Kingdoms against incursions from Irrisen and
    other threats, such as frost giants from the Stormspear Mountains and bands
    of ogres from the foothills that border the Nolands of Varisia. Freyr
    Darkwine, the castellan of Hagreach, leads the Blackravens, whose main
    headquarters is a granite fortress called Blackraven Hall, situated next to
    the Rimef low River near the border with Irrisen. While the Blackravens
    count among their number a wide range of individuals from varying races and
    classes, those most commonly encountered are scouts that patrol the rivers
    and roads throughout this borderland. These scouts undergo specific training
    against their hated enemies, and are all rangers specialized in fighting in
    subarctic conditions.
  - >-
    A typical Blackraven patrol contains four to six members. In the open
    terrain around the Rimef low River, Blackraven patrols are sometimes mounted
    on horseback, but in less hospitable places they sometimes use dog sleds,
    skis, or snowshoes. They patrol the border regularly but in no set pattern,
    making it difficult to predict their movements.
  - >-
    A Blackraven dons pale leather armor when he needs to blend into snowy
    environs, or when on reconnaissance missions into Irrisen. Blackraven scouts
    make extensive use of animal messenger spells to maintain communication over
    large areas. Specialists at battling trolls, Blackravens typically carry
    flaming arrows and alchemical fire to inhibit the creatures' regeneration
    and destroy their remains.
