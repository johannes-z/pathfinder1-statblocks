SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Empathic Communication (Su)
    description: >-
      Talorani have the ability to empathically communicate basic ideas (little
      more than emotion and direction) to any others of their kind within 20
      feet. Other creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Sense Motive check to
      receive empathic imagery from a talorani.
Description:
  - >-
    The talorani, more commonly called underdwellers, are an aquatic humanoid
    race thought to be the descendants of merfolk and elves. They dwell in
    shallow coastal waters, having carved out a niche for themselves between
    their aquatic elven ancestors close to shore and their merfolk relatives in
    deeper waters. Their webbed hands and feet have an extra joint in each
    finger and toe, allowing them to move through the water with a speed and
    agility. On land, however, they are slow and ungainly.
  - Talorani are about 5 feet tall and weigh 125 pounds.
  - Talorani Society
  - >-
    Underdwellers live in a clan-based social system comprising, in order of
    increasing size: families - clans - houses - guilds - community. An
    underdweller known as a Father leads a family, a Grand-Father leads a clan,
    a Great-Father leads a house, a High-Father leads a guild, and an All-Father
    leads the community.
  - >-
    There is no true religion amongst the underdwellers as most other races
    understand it, but the sea, called the Mother, is highly revered within the
    community as a living entity that controls all within it. It is not
    worshipped as a god but there are taboos and requirements in place that are
    observed to avoid retribution from the Mother. A common reprimand from the
    matriarchs to warn riotous youngsters is that â€˜the Mother will see you' if
    they misbehave. One major taboo that jeopardizes one's relation to the
    Mother is an unnecessary death. All creatures of the sea are considered an
    inherent part of it, and a creature's death may mean that somewhere else,
    something will not come into being because the creature was no longer
    present. To an underdweller, all creatures need all other creatures, if not
    now, then in the future to survive. Of course, preventing one's own death is
    desirable for the same reason.
  - >-
    Death is looked upon as a sad event and underdweller funerals do not differ
    much from human ritual. The dead are interned within caves near the shore,
    along with their most prized possessions. The entrance is sealed with rock,
    and the place is marked. Even enemies are buried this way, though are placed
    far from the cemeteries of the community.
  - >-
    Humans and all other land-based races are looked on with a mixture of awe,
    fear, suspicion, and fascination. For centuries untold, the underdwellers
    have kept to themselves and avoided the petty attentions of the land races.
    Although there have been no major altercations between the land races and
    the underdwellers, complete avoidance of all surface-dwelling races is
    usually the law in underdweller communities.
  - >-
    A normal underdweller mating ritual allows for the complete polygamy of both
    sexes. Any underdweller may have as many mates as they desire. Children born
    of such unions are taken to the community nursery to be raised by the
    matriarchs - rearing children is the responsibility of the entire community
    rather than just the child's parents. Female underdwellers have the ability
    to control their own fertility, so the choice to bear a child is a mother's
    alone, though it is the law for them to inform prospective paramours of her
    intention to bear children. Other than that, sex is common, often
    experienced, and willingly shared without many of the taboos and discretion
    known by other races. A marriage ritual known as life-binding occurs when
    two underdwellers agree to swear lifelong loyalty to one another in the
    presence of the community All-Father and the Mother. No other may mate with
    one who has been life-bound.
  - >-
    Names amongst the underdwellers are descriptive of an individual's
    appearance, traits or some event in their life. Houses are constructed of
    worked coral and shipwreck debris, shaped like upturned boats facing into
    the current with entrances as round holes in the top of the dome. These
    homes are often decorated with brightly colored rocks, coral, anemones, and
    ship figureheads or name plates.
