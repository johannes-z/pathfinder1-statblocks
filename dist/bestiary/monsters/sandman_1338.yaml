SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sand Form (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a sandman can cause its humanoid form to collapse
      into a pile of animated sand. In this form, treat the sandman as if it
      were a Small earth elemental made out of sand. The sandman retains its
      compression and sleep aura abilities when in sand form, but loses its
      sleep attack and its damage reduction, as its sandy body in this form is
      much more compact and easier to scatter with solid weapon blows.
  - name: Sleep (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature struck by a sandman's slam attack must succeed on a DC 14 Will
      save or immediately fall asleep, as if affected by a sleep spell (caster
      level 8th). There is no limit to the number of Hit Dice a sandman can
      affect with this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Sleep Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A sandman radiates a 20-foot-radius spread that puts creatures to sleep.
      Any creature in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or fall asleep,
      as if affected by a sleep spell (caster level 8th). There is no limit to
      the number of Hit Dice a sandman can affect with this ability. A creature
      that successfully saves is immune to that sandman's sleep aura for 24
      hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Stealthy and unpredictable, the sandman is a terror to all travelers in the
    desert, whether they be traders, messengers, or adventurers. When at rest,
    sandmen resemble ordinary piles of sand, blending in perfectly with barren
    surroundings or ancient tombs. They rely on their soporific powers in most
    situations, putting their enemies to sleep and killing their unconscious
    opponents or dragging them back to their summoner.
  - >-
    Although they themselves are elementals, sandmen don't typically associate
    with other elementals, seeing their unquestioning obedience as weak. Sandmen
    pride themselves as free thinkers, and when given a task by a summoner,
    often interpret the task as they see fit. Because of their arrogance,
    usually only the most confident or most desperate mages bother with sandmen.
  - >-
    It is not uncommon for sandmen to voluntarily stay on the Material Plane,
    fiendishly playing with its inhabitants as they wreak silent havoc.
  - >-
    A sandman takes the form of a rough humanoid about 6 feet tall. Its shape is
    never quite certain, and its animate muscles constantly shift and flex as it
    pummels its targets. Sandmen can manipulate their bodies in many ways, but
    prefer to keep their legs and feet in the form of dusty clouds of sand, so
    as to easily maneuver about in their preferred environments.
  - >-
    Some of these creatures pride themselves on their ability to control their
    shapes. Just as a mortal artist might sculpt incredible works of art from
    stone with a chisel, so do these artist sandmen sculpt their own bodies into
    works of art. Some enjoy using this ability to reshape their appearance to
    mimic that of their conjurer or their enemies, allowing them an additional
    level of theatrics by either assuming a beautiful form or by allowing their
    form to melt away in a hideous manner. Given the combination of their quick
    imaginations and their natural penchant for cruelty, most sandmen tend to
    opt for the latter method of tormenting their foes.
