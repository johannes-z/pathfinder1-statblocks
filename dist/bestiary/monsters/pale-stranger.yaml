  and weathered, and smells of old decay.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Pistols (Su)
    description: >-
      A pale stranger fights with two pistols. A pistol has a range increment of
      20 feet and deals both bludgeoning and piercing damage. At a range of up
      to 20 feet, a pale stranger's pistol attacks resolve as touch attacks.
      While pistols normally consume bullets and black powder when fired, a pale
      stranger's pistols supernaturally reload the instant it fires them,
      allowing the undead to make multiple attacks in a round with the weapons.
      In addition, any pistol a pale stranger wields functions as a +1 pistol. A
      pale stranger does not provoke attacks of opportunity when it fires a
      pistol in melee, and treats pistols as light weapons for the purposes of
      determining penalties from two-weapon fighting. Further rules for pistols,
      and firearms in general, can be found in Ultimate Combat. Stranger's

  - name: Shot (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a pale stranger can take careful aim with one of
      its firearms and take a single, ruinous shot. This single shot always
      resolves as a touch attack, regardless of the actual range. If the pale
      stranger threatens a critical hit with this shot, it automatically
      confirms the critical hit. Regardless of whether the shot is a critical
      hit or not, it deals +6d6 points of damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Sometimes death itself cannot come between a gunslinger and its final
    revenge. When a gunslinger is slain by a hated enemy, or murdered before it
    can achieve vengeance against a hated foe, the anger and wrath can animate
    its remains as a vengeful undead monstrosity. When a pale stranger first
    rises, it seeks out the source of its anger to finish the job-thereafter, it
    wanders the desolate parts of the world looking for new victims to vent its
    unending rage upon.

    A pale stranger appears much as it did in life, though desiccated and
    obviously undead. Rare pale strangers have the ability to hide their undead
    nature and appear as they did in life using veil as a constant spell-like
    ability (CL equals their CR). These pale strangers are often more powerful
    and have class levels in gunslinger or ranger, and often attract large
    groups of adoring bandits and followers who may or may not realize that
    their murderous idol is in fact an unliving horror.
  - A pale stranger stands 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds.
