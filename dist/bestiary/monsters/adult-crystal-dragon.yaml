  - name: Scintillating Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A great wyrm crystal dragon radiates an aura of scintillating color from
      its jeweled scales to a radius of 60 feet. All within this area must make
      a Will save each round to avoid being stunned (if the victim has 15 or
      fewer Hit Dice) or confused (if the victim has more than 15 Hit Dice) for
      1 round. The save DC is equal to the dragon's breath weapon save DC. This
      is a mind-affecting effect. The dragon can activate or suppress this aura
      as a free action. Spell-Like

  - name: Tremorsense (Ex)
    description: >-

      improving at adult (60 ft.) and old (120 ft.).
Description:
  - >-
    Crystal dragons are generally good-natured, though their incredible vanity
    sometimes causes them to seem aloof and cocky. Any perceived insult against
    its appearance is all but assured to send a crystal dragon into a rage-which
    is a problem, as most crystal dragons are prone to seeing insults even where
    none are intended. Crystal dragons prefer underground lairs, and often go
    for decades or even centuries without emerging from their extensive cavern
    lairs onto the surface world above.
  - >-
    Crystal dragons tend to be exacting and even obsessive-compulsive, their
    personalities mirroring the precise and ordered nature of the facets of
    their scales. A crystal dragon's lair is a well-ordered place-these dragons
    find the very idea of the classic sprawl of a dragon's hoard to be shameful.
