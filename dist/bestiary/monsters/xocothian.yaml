      Once per hour, a xocothian can transform itself into two Small elementals
      (one air and one water) for up to 7 minutes. These elementals appear in
      adjacent squares. Each have half of the xocothian's current hit points and
      share the same mind. They can reform into the xocothian as a standard
      action if they are adjacent to each other-the reformed xocothian's hit
      points are equal to the total of the two elementals' hit points. If either
      elemental is slain, the xocothian must use its standard action on its next
      turn to reform (treat a slain elemental's hit points as 0 when determining
      the reformed xocothian's total hit points).

      A xocothian can fly or swim up to 200 feet as a full-round action. When
      using this ability, it must move in a straight line. This does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity.
Description:
  - >-
    A xocothian is a physical manifestation of Gozreh's dual nature and
    destructive power. As a creature that has a form mingling both fish and
    fowl, it's as at home in the water as it is in the air. A xocothian amuses
    itself by manipulating clouds-it can fly in a way that whips off portions of
    clouds, allowing the creature to sculpt the cloud into fantastic creations.
    When on the sea, the creature dives in and out of the waves in a way that
    looks almost like a massive skipping stone dipping below the waves with each
    strike and then erupting into the air in a spray of sea water.
  - >-
    Blunt and impatient, xocothians aren't fond of nuanced manipulation or
    clever gambits when dealing with others. They prefer straightforward
    approaches to obstacles and problems, and always takes such a route unless
    impeded in some way.
  - >-
    When on the Material Plane and not called into service by mortal worshipers
    of Gozreh, xocothians enjoy exploring the natural wonders of the world. They
    splash through the seas, and soar through the skies, keeping away from
    civilization on these travels. Sometimes when encountering mortals, the
    creatures hide themselves in obscuring mist, hoping to be mistaken as a
    cloud.
  - >-
    When at sea, they sometimes surge past ships underwater or in the air to
    create confusion and panic. When feeling sociable, they chat with local
    animals and discuss matters of weather and migrations with members of
    Gozreh's faith and respectful druids of other religions. They grow outraged
    with mortals who poison or pollute water and even those who befoul the air
    with bad smells (such as by burning garbage, casting stinking cloud, or
    running a tannery). Although they don't need to eat, they sometimes choose
    to do so for pleasure, enjoying the sort of food that a carnivorous fish or
    bird would consume.
  - >-
    As enigmatic as its creator, a xocothian may refer to itself as "I," "we,"
    "she," "he," "it," or "they," whether in one body or two.
  - Xocothians are about 8 feet long and weigh around 650 pounds.
