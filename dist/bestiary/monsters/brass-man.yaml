SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A brass man is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell
      resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently
      against the creature, as noted below. A magical attack that deals
      electricity damage slows a brass man (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds,
      with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any
      slow effect on the brass man and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points
      of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would
      cause the brass man to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any
      excess as temporary hit points. A brass man gets no saving throw against
      fire effects.
  - name: Spit Molten Brass (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds (and no more than five times per day), a brass man
      can spit a stream of molten brass n a 30-foot line; damage 6d6 fire,
      Reflex half DC 15. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Brass men are humanoid-shaped constructs built by the powerful efreet of the
    City of Brass. They are created for the sole purpose of guarding some
    efreeti secret within the walls of the City. Some are created as battle
    allies and aid the efreet in battle against their enemies. They are rarely
    encountered elsewhere, though on occasion one is sent to the Material Plane
    by its efreet creator to retrieve an object or creature. Brass men are very
    tough physical opponents and difficult to stop. Typically a brass man begins
    combat by spitting molten brass on the closest opponent before moving into
    melee where it attacks with its huge greatsword or its powerful fists.
    Construction The construction of the brass men is a highly guarded secret
    among the efreet race. No one outside the City of Brass has ever discovered
    the proper method of constructing a brass man, and the efreet aren't
    telling. Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Casey Christofferson.
