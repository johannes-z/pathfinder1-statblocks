Description:
  - >-
    Every trapper and bog farmer living near marshes or swamps has his own name
    for these faintly glowing balls of light-jack o' the lanterns, corpse
    candles, walking fires, pine lights, spooklights, rushlights-but all
    recognize them as dangerous predators and false guides in the darkness. Evil
    creatures that feed on the strong psychic emanations of terrified creatures,
    will-o'-wisps delight in tempting gullible travelers into dangerous
    situations. In the wild lands where they're most common, will-o'-wisps favor
    simple tactics like positioning themselves over cliffs or quicksand where
    they can easily be mistaken for lanterns (especially if they can set their
    traps near actual signal lanterns), allowing them to lure unwary travelers
    into perilous situations. On rare occasions, will-o'- wisps seeking easier
    pickings will move into a city and take up residence near gallows or follow
    along invisibly behind an army in order to harvest the fear of the dying
    men; why the vast majority choose to remain in the swamps where victims are
    scarce remains a mystery. Will-o'- wisps only use their electric shock
    ability under extreme duress, preferring to let other creatures or hazards
    claim their victims while they float nearby and feast. Will-o'-wisps can
    glow any color they choose, but are most frequently yellow, white, green, or
    blue. They can even vary their luminosity to create patterns-many will-o'-
    wisps are fond of creating vague skull-like shapes in their glow to further
    terrify their victims. Their actual bodies are barely visible globes of
    translucent spongy material 1 foot across and weighing 3 pounds, capable of
    emitting light from every surface. A will-o'-wisp's light is approximately
    as bright as a torch, and though they do not seem to use sound to
    communicate with each other, they hear perfectly and can vibrate their
    bodies rapidly to simulate speech. While vilif ied by most other sentient
    creatures, will-o'-wisps are actually quite intelligent, if utterly alien in
    their reasoning. Sometimes organized into groups called "strings," their
    society and goals remain complete unknowns to outsiders, as do their
    origins, though they have sometimes been known to strike bargains with those
    who can offer them vast quantities of appropriately frightened victims. As
    will-o'-wisps do not age, and are effectively immortal unless killed by
    violence, particularly ancient will-o'-wisps can serve as fantastic
    repositories of knowledge from the ancient past, although convincing one of
    these cruel creatures to cooperate with an interrogation can be a trick in
    and of itself.
