  - name: Weapon Fighting (Ex)
    description: >-
      A two-headed troll fights with a weapon in each hand. Because each of its
      two heads controls an arm, the two-headed troll does not take a penalty on
      attack or damage rolls for attacking with two weapons.
Description:
  - >-
    The two-headed troll is thought to be the hideous offspring of an ettin and
    female troll. Sages contend that no other explanation is possible concerning
    this monster. Two-headed trolls prefer to make their lairs underground and
    away from civilization. Although believed to be the offspring of an ettin
    and troll, they do not associate with the former, but are often found
    leading the latter during raids or wars. A two-headed troll stands about 10
    feet tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds. Its hide is mottled green or gray,
    and its facial features resemble that of a standard troll. Two-headed trolls
    typically dress in rags or tattered clothes or even battered and rusted
    armor on occasion. Their legs end in three-toed feet, and their powerful
    arms end in sharpened claws. The two-headed troll has the slow moving gait
    of the normal troll, but does not walk hunched over. Two-headed trolls
    attack with two claws and two bites, though on occasion they have been known
    to wield longswords or clubs. Two-Headed Troll Characters Two-headed troll

    Scent: Two-headed trolls can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of

    saving throw bonuses of Fort +7, Ref +3, and Will +3. Racial Skills: A

    Int modifier, minimum 1). A two-headed troll's two heads give it a +2 racial
