Description_Visual: >-
  This creature is a powerfully built, roughly humanoid-shaped monolith of black
  stone. Its hands end in wicked, serrated and jagged claws. No facial features
  can be discerned.
Group: Quasi-elemental
Source: Tome of Horrors Complete
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Ex)
    description: >-
      When reduced to 0 or less hit points, an obsidian quasi-elemental explodes
      in a cloud of razor-sharp bits of obsidian. A creature caught in the area
      can make a Reflex save for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
      See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics for each elemental's death
      throes.
  - name: Molten Glass (Ex)
    description: >-
      A successful hit against an obsidian quasi-elemental with a piercing or
      slashing weapon (or piercing or slashing natural attack) that deals damage
      equal to its current HD opens a wound that spurts molten glass. The wound
      bleeds for 1d4 rounds and any creature within 5 feet must make a Reflex
      save or take fire damage from the splash. A new save must be made each
      round the wound bleeds and a creature is within the area. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. See the sidebar for the appropriate statistics.
Description:
  - >-
    In a quasi-realm where elemental water and elemental fire conjoin, there
    exists a pocket plane known as the Quasi-plane of Obsidian; a plane of
    barren wastes and blackened rock, of razor-sharp obelisks and fields of
    sharpened glass. Creatures native to this plane appear as blackened obsidian
    with jagged, serrated, or clear-cut angles and edges. Some have barbed
    spikes adorning their elemental forms. Obsidian quasi-elementals are usually
    encountered on their home plane or on the Plane of Fire. Still some can be
    found on the Obsidian Plain in the Plane of Molten Skies (see the City of
    Brass by Necromancer Games). Most, however, prefer the serenity that the
    Quasi-plane of Obsidian offers, and thus they rarely venture forth unless
    summoned. Obsidian quasi-elementals are deadly combatants and strike with
    their sharpened claws, ripping and tearing at their opponents. They are
    relentless in their attacks and never give quarter. Copyright Notice Author
