      When a karkinoi takes a 5-foot step, it can move up to 10 feet instead of
      5 feet as long as it does so in a straight line. It can do this whether it
      is walking or swimming.
  - name: Water Dependency (Ex)
    description: >-
      A karkinoi can survive out of the water for 1 hour per point of
      Constitution. Beyond this limit, it runs the risk of suffocation, as if it
      were drowning.
Description:
  - >-
    Monstrous hunters and bullies of the ocean depths, karkinoi live only to
    destroy creatures that dare cross their path and then feed on the corpses of
    the vanquished. Though not mindless, they have no inclination to build
    civilizations or even settlements, living in roving gangs or nomadic tribes.
    The tools they use in their more humanoid appendages are always scavenged,
    usually from victims, and are discarded when broken or of no more immediate
    use. Pursuits such as crafting, learning, and diplomacy are a waste to them;
    they see these as the activities of food-creatures not strong enough to see
    the world as it is-a stage for domination, feeding, and spawning. Even when
    these brutes band together, it is usually to spawn or to face sources of
    food that are too strong for only one or two karkinoi alone. Large hordes of
    karkinoi come together to hunt inhabitants of coastal settlements. Striking
    at night, they do as much damage as possible before dragging their meals
    into the sea. They make such attacks night after night until the settlement
    is destroyed or the resistance becomes too fierce, at which point the horde
    disbands and each karkinoi makes its own way in the sea. While karkinoi can
    walk on land, they do not enjoy long periods away from the sea, as they dry
    out, crack, and eventually suffocate. Coastal raids are part of the karkinoi
    breeding cycle. The corpses that they drag off into the ocean are tethered
    to masses of eggs, and serve as food for karkinoi spawn. The spawn develop a
    taste for land-meat and crave it, ensuring the next generation of hungry
    raiders. While karkinoi rarely ally with other creatures, they are easily
    swayed by aboleths promising destruction and raw power. In return, the
    aboleths gain expendable, fast-breeding shock troops and guardians. Some
    scholars believe this race was actually created by aboleths in ancient
    times, but were later turned loose in the ocean because skum made more
    reliable slaves than karkinoi brutes.
