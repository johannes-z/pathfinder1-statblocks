SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Prescience (Su)
    description: >-
      A shedu can see all the possible outcomes of any of its own futures. This
      grants the creature an insight bonus to its AC and on initiative checks
      and Reflex saves equal to its Wisdom bonus (+6 for most shedus).
Description:
  - >-
    Shedus live far from the hustle and bustle of humanity in harsh deserts.
    There they populate caves, ruins, or ancient temples reclaimed from the
    shifting sands. In these places of refuge, shedus contemplate the struggle
    between good and evil throughout the universe. Tireless vehicles of good and
    kindness, shedus fight against outsiders who corrupt and threaten humanity.
    Skilled in healing, shedus focus on eliminating plagues, even hunting down
    outsiders and undead working in that destructive medium.
  - >-
    Shedus rarely make their homes near each other. This is not out of any sort
    of animosity, but rather from a feeling that having two or more shedus
    within close proximity wastes the opportunity to provide aid to a larger
    region. When a shedu roams through the lands of another, it always seeks out
    the local shedu for an opportunity to talk and share knowledge over the
    course of 3 days.
