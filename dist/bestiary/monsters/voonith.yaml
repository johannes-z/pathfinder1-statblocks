    description: >-
      As a standard action, a voonith can unleash a bloodcurdling howl. All
      creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst must succeed at a DC 15 Will save
      or become dazed for 1 round and then shaken for an additional 1d6 rounds.
      Any creature that makes a successful save against a voonith's howl is
      immune to the same voonith's howl for 24 hours. This is a sonic
      mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Cunning and aggressive, vooniths are amphibious nocturnal predators with
    voracious appetites and mild intelligence. A voonith's howl is said to
    freeze the blood and is more than capable of stopping a creature in its
    tracks. Vooniths usually howl when they see prey too far away from the
    water's edge to ambush. While the vooniths are native to the strange
    Dimension of Dream, many have found their way out of that realm and into the
    waking world to take up lairs in the swampy fens and remote coastlines of
    the world. How the vooniths originally managed to make this transition
    between worlds is unclear.

    Although they look like little more than wild beasts, vooniths are actually
    rather intelligent. While certainly not as sharp as the average human, a
    voonith is smart enough to know how to speak and often does so with others
    of its kind. Vooniths do not often choose to communicate with other
    creatures, giving rise to the misconception that they're little more than
    dumb animals, but on occasion, travelers in swampy regions tell tales of
    overhearing strange piping voices speaking among the reeds. Those few who
    know the secrets of the Aklo tongue can understand these words, although
    understanding of what the vooniths whisper in the night when they think no
    one else can hear is not always for the best.
  - >-
    While not evil, vooniths have a decidedly dark sense of humor, and take
    great pleasure in concocting violent poems or grisly jokes. Punch lines in
    which non-voonith creatures-particularly humans, cats, and gnomes- meet gory
    and ironic fates are the most entertaining to vooniths. Some tales speak of
    canny travelers who, with the ability to speak Aklo, manage to strike up
    unlikely conversations with lurking vooniths. In truth, vooniths are quite
    social, and when one breeches the awkwardness arising from interspecies conf
    lict, a friendship with a voonith can be an unexpected reward. Vooniths who
    befriend travelers often escort them, quietly and unseen, through dangerous
    bogs, and when such travelers fall prey to other dangers of the swamp, a
    friendly voonith will provide what aid it can.

    Vooniths are 4 feet long and weigh 70 pounds, yet rumors tell of vooniths
    that have grown to much larger sizes than this.
