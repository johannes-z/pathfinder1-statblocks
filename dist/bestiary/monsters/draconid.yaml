Description_Visual: >-
  This hideous creature looks like a cross between a giant spider and dragon or
  hydra. Where its head should be, two long serpentine necks sprout from its
  body. Its head and neck are scaled gray, and its spidery torso and eight
  knobbed legs are covered in short, coarse fur.

Description:
  - >-
    Draconids are a hideous cross between either a giant spider and a hydra or a
    giant spider and a dragon. They dwell deep underground where they dine on
    the flesh of elves, dwarves, goblins, and just about anything else that
    crosses their path. These creatures are never encountered on the surface
    world, preferring to spend their lives underground.
  - >-
    Draconids are solitary creatures and never mix with others of their own kind
    (except for mating purposes). If a draconid moves into another's territory,
    a fight almost always ensues as soon as they discover one another. A typical
    draconid hunting ground covers an area of nearly 10 miles from its lair.
  - >-
    When not hunting, a draconid spends its time in its lair. A draconid's lair
    is something most disgusting and quite memorable to those that stumble
    across it. A tangled mess of shiny coins and gems mixed with corpses, bones,
    and rotted flesh.
  - >-
    A draconid usually waits in its web until prey passes underneath or nearby.
    It then shoots a web, releases its breath weapon and moves into melee. Once
    engaged, the draconid bites with one head and breathes fire with the other.
    One favorite tactic is to slow larger foes with its webs while it snatches
    up smaller targets in its jaws and crush them, bathing them in fire, and
    hurling them away if they prove too troublesome.
