SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      An adult or older forest dragon can assume any humanoid form three times
      per day as if using polymorph.
  - name: Destructive Crush (Su)
    description: >-
      When an old or older forest dragon makes a crush attack, the impact kicks
      up debris in a 20-foot-radius burst for 1d6 rounds. The debris obscures
      the vision of creatures within the debris field and grants concealment to
      those creatures. The forest dragon can see normally within and through the
      debris field.
  - name: Elemental Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, when an ancient or older forest dragon uses its breath
      weapon, it can summon a greater earth elemental within the cone. The
      caster level for these effects is the same as the dragon's caster level.
  - name: Sound Imitation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A very young or older forest dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has
      heard by making a successful Bluff check against the listener's Sense
      Motive check.
  - name: Stony Death (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by a great wyrm forest
      dragon's breath weapon must also make a Fortitude save (same DC as the
      forest dragon's breath weapon) or be petrified as the flesh to stone
      spell. This is a death effect.
  - name: Woodland Stride (Ex)
    description: As the druid ability of the same name.
Description:
  - >-
    Forest dragons, or dilung, are fickle and malevolent dragons that dwell in
    deep, rugged woodlands. While a forest dragon can fly, it prefers to stalk
    the earth, flying only to pursue objects of its wrath.
