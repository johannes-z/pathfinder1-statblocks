SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Enciphered Mind (Su)
    description: >-
      The forbidden knowledge elder sphinxes have accumulated is etched on their
      psyches, and it causes great harm to those who attempt to make psychic
      contact. Any creature attempting to contact an elder sphinx's mind or read
      its thoughts with a divination spell or similar ability must succeed at a
      DC 27 Will save or be overwhelmed by the chaos and vast scope of the
      knowledge within. Those who fail are affected by feeblemind. An elder
      sphinx can willingly suppress this ability at will as a free action. This
      is a mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Enigma (Su)
    description: >-
      Elder sphinxes have removed themselves from the mundane world to
      contemplate the mysteries of the universe-and beyond. To facilitate this,
      they possess an uncanny ability to elude detection and discovery by those
      that could possibly interrupt their meditations. Any creature (other than
      another sphinx), that leaves line of sight of an elder sphinx for more
      than 1 hour must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be unable to recall
      details of the encounter, as if the sphinx cast modify memory to eliminate
      all recollection of itself. The exact details of this memory loss are
      decided by the elder sphinx subconsciously during the encounter and it may
      eliminate up to an hour of memories. This is a mind-affecting compulsion
      effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Litany of Riddles (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an elder sphinx can telepathically project a
      befuddling series of riddles, puzzles, and logic paradoxes at all
      creatures in a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in this effect must succeed
      at a DC 27 Will save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that succeed
      against this effect glean snippets of lore from this brush with the
      sphinx's mind, granting them a +5 insight bonus on all Knowledge checks
      for 1 hour and the ability to attempt Knowledge checks with a DC higher
      than 10 untrained. Once a creature successfully saves against this
      ability, it can't be affected by the same elder sphinx's litany of riddles
      for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect and the save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Sphinx Monolith (Su)
    description: >-
      An elder sphinx can enter a state of suspended animation and transform its
      massive body into a stone monument. This transformation takes 1 minute to
      complete, during which the elder sphinx is immobile. Once it transforms
      into its monolith form, the elder sphinx's body hardens to stone, granting
      it hardness 30 and 350 hit points. If the elder sphinx's stony body is
      reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed and the elder sphinx is slain.
      While transformed, an elder sphinx doesn't need to breathe, eat, drink, or
      sleep. The elder sphinx is aware of its surroundings and it can use astral
      projection at will when in this form. Anytime an elder sphinx's body takes
      damage while using astral projection, its astral form immediately becomes
      aware that it is in danger and can, as a free action, end the astral
      projection and begin reverting back to its natural form (though the
      process still takes 1 minute). When an elder sphinx ends its
      transformation, it is immediately healed of all hit point damage it may
      have sustained while transformed. An elder sphinx can remain in its sphinx
      monolith form indefinitely.
Description:
  - >-
    Older than most modern civilizations, elder sphinxes are the wisest and most
    venerable of sphinx kind. Though they have long since calcified into
    creatures of living limestone, these ancient creatures serve eternally as
    guardians, not of temples or other such terrestrial sites, but of forbidden
    knowledge and lore, much of which is beyond the understanding of lesser
    beings. Elder sphinxes are highly protective of the vast wealth of
    information they possess and strive to defend it from those they deem
    unworthy.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Sphinxes gradually become more sedentary over their long lifespans as they
    lose their inclination toward physical activity. The eldest and most
    knowledgeable sphinxes undergo a transformation that allows them to remain
    undisturbed as they ponder the knowledge they've obtained. They turn into
    creatures of living limestone and grow to tremendous proportions, until they
    resemble ancient and weathered statues. No longer content with the Material
    Plane, elder sphinxes cast their consciousnesses out into the Astral Plane
    and beyond in search of the secrets of the universe, as their mortal hunger
    for nourishment is replaced by a metaphysical hunger for knowledge.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Scholars claim that some elder sphinxes predate even the Age of Darkness and
    thus possess firsthand knowledge of the world as it once was, and have
    learned of the contemporary world only through their astral wandering or
    during the rare times they walk in their corporeal form. Whatever purpose
    they served in their youth has long since been forgotten or abandoned,
    leaving them to pursue more esoteric ambitions. These ancient creatures
    exist solely to seek out new information and to understand the great
    mysteries of the universe while their stony physical remains sit idle as
    time passes them by. In time, these elder sphinxes come to be seen as
    monuments, and sometimes humanoid cultures gather around them and worship
    them
  - >-
    as idols. Infrequently, elder sphinxes can be coaxed to trade ancient
    knowledge for more current information or for arcane secrets they have yet
    to divine from the planes. Finding knowledge or information beyond an elder
    sphinx's experiences, however, is as monumental a task as locating one of
    their kind.
  - >-
    Elder sphinxes have little to no contact with other sphinxes. This only
    occurs when a younger, less powerful sphinx seeks out one of these
    magnificent specimens to plead for lost knowledge. When elder sphinxes do
    come into contact with one another, it is always a meeting of great purpose,
    typically on a matter of such importance that it requires them to share
    their ancient wisdom and unfathomable lore.
