SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Protective Slime (Su)
    description: >-
      A layer of acidic slime coats a babau's skin. Any creature that strikes a
      babau with a natural attack or unarmed strike takes 1d8 points of acid
      damage from this slime if it fails a DC 18 Reflex save. A creature that
      strikes a babau with a melee weapon must make a DC 18 Reflex save or the
      weapon takes 1d8 points of acid damage; if this damage penetrates the
      weapon's hardness, the weapon gains the broken condition. Ammunition that
      strikes a babau is automatically destroyed after it inflicts its damage.
Description:
  - >-
    The babau is an assassin, a murderer, and a sadist- certainly not traits
    unusual in the demons, yet the babau's penchant for stealth and surprise
    sets it apart from its generally less-subtle kin. With no need to eat
    (although most babaus relish the flavor of mortal meat on their thin, raspy
    tongues), a babau can wait in ambush for years or decades-their inhuman
    patience in anticipating a well-conceived murder also setting them apart
    from the other denizens of the Abyss. Babaus obsess over the act of killing
    and take great pride in their grisly art, often leaving behind some form of
    grim marker or obscure signature, whether it be a distinctive modus
    operandi, an unnerving token, or other profane evidence. A babau typically
    carries a longspear or other weapon with which it can strike at foes beyond
    its normal reach, but given the opportunity, a babau prefers to fight with
    its teeth or claws. The foul, caustic sludge that constantly seeps from
    their flesh prevents them from wearing armor unless it is specially treated
    or resistant to acid. A babau is 6 feet tall but weighs only 140 pounds.
    They form from mortal souls of lone killers-those who, in life, took
    pleasure in more personal and intimate murders. Loosed upon the Material
    Plane, a babau often finds itself in the same role, haunting the shadowy
    corners of the world as remorseless assassins.
