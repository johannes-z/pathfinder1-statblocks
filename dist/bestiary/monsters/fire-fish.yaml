Description_Visual: >-
  At various places in the planes, rifts of special tears appear and allow the
  mundane creatures of one plane to intermix with the creatures of other planes.
  On these occasions, it is most often not the terrible beasts such as demons or
  angels that pour through, but much less powerful (but not harmless) creatures
  mirroring the beasts of the natural realm.

Description:
  - >-
    Light orange to bright red in color, the fire fish is approximately the size
    of a common salmon. Firefish frequently stay in their schools; a solitary
    fish is easy prey for many predators.
  - >-
    Firefish spawn yearly, and attempt to return to their place of origin to do
    so. If unable, a firefish locates a warm, rocky area to deposit their eggs.
    The females perish within a day after depositing the eggs. The males, after
    fertilizing the eggs, swim off, living perhaps another week before
    perishing.
  - >-
    These are just a few of the possible creatures available, but they should be
    a good starting point to create other elemental animals.
