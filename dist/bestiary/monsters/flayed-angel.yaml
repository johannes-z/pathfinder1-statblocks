Description_Visual: >-
  This once angelic being has been reduced to a twisted mass of oozing, raw
  flesh and muscle tissue, every bit of the skin having been stripped away from
  the body. The neck ends at a jagged stump, and the tattered, shredded remains
  of once-beautiful wings extend behind it.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gout of Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a flayed angel is physically struck in battle, the impact causes
      a spray of acidic blood to fly off the creature at anyone within 5 feet.
      Anyone in the area of affect must make a DC 24 Reflex save or take 1d6
      points of acid damage from this splatter. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Profane Presence (Su)
    description: >-
      The existence of a flayed angel is such an anathema to the order of the
      multiverse that its very presence is a profanity of nature. This presence
      provides it with a +10 profane bonus to Armor Class and a +2 profane bonus
      to its saves.
Description:
  - >-
    On some rare occasions when an extremely powerful angel is captured,
    tortured to death and subjected to particularly vile rituals, dark gods of
    evil will intervene and prevent that being's essence from returning to its
    celestial home, instead trapping it within the mutilated corpse as a
    horrifyingly profane undead abomination. Such creations are anathema to the
    heavenly hosts and are actively hunted down by angles and archons whenever
    their existence is discovered. They seek to erase the stain upon the forces
    of good by the perversion of such a champion and to release its essence back
    to its rightful plane.
  - >-
    A flayed angel is horribly mutilated, its skin flayed away, its wings
    crippled, and its head removed. The preparation ritual also involves the
    introduction of an acidic embalming fluid that mingles with the blood left
    in its body as a continually-leaking, caustic brew.
  - >-
    A flayed angel stands around 8 feet tall due to the removal of its head and
    weighs about 450 pounds.
  - >-
    Flayed angels have lost most of their original battle prowess becoming
    little more than lumbering death dealers. However, they are still quite
    agile and, as former flyers of great renown, are still expert jumpers. They
    often climb to a higher position in order to leap down on their foes and
    attack in a sad caricature of their former ability to swoop down upon
    enemies from above. Regardless, their attacks soon devolve into brutish
    attempts to rend their foes into unrecognizable hunks of meat.
  - >-
    They strangely retain their inherent damage reduction that can only be
    overcome by evil-aligned weapons, often making them difficult and confusing
    foes. Their natural attacks are no longer considered good-aligned for the
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
  - >-
    The acidic blood mixture that continually oozes through their bodies
    splatters upon a foe on a successful melee hit and deals acid damage as
    well.
