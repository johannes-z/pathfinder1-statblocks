  This petrified skeleton is clad in rotting furs. Stone antlers grow from the
  crown of its skull, and its eyes are polished white orbs.

IsTemplate: '1'
Description:
  - >-
    When the Worldwound opened, the druids of the Green Faith fought longer and
    harder than any other Sarkorian citizen against the rising demon tide. Those
    druids who stubbornly (or faithfully) refused to flee their sacred lands
    managed something that few others in Sarkoris did- they prevented the
    wholesale invasion and corruption of their land from demonic influence, but
    only at a terrible cost. They took the corruption into themselves, and
    today, these druids exist as blighted, undead parodies of their former
    selves. Known as siabraes, these powerful druids have embraced undeath,
    bolstered with the strength of the wounded-but-still-living world beneath
    their feet, and fight not only against demonic trespass into their realm,
    but against all living creatures, for they are filled with bitterness and
    hatred for their brethren, whom they regard as cowards. The Green Faith was
    meant to die, the siabraes believe, for the truth and glory of the
    Stonewilds to emerge.
  - >-
    Siabraes do not form spontaneously; they arise only when a druid of
    sufficient power (at least 11th level) willingly gives her spirit over to
    undeath in a horrific ritual that must occur at the heart of necromantically
    empowered standing stones. Some druids are initially unwilling participants
    in these rituals-captives brought to the stones by elder siabraes to
    increase their numbers. To date, no druid has ultimately been able to resist
    this eldritch transformation with any other recourse than pure death.
    Siabraes may exist elsewhere, but only in the northern Worldwound are they
    encountered in significant number.
  - Creating a Siabrae
  - >-
    "Siabrae" is an acquired template that can be added to any creature with at
    least 11 levels of druid (hereafter referred to as the base creature). A
    siabrae never has the blight druid archetype (Pathfinder RPG Advanced
    Player's Guide 98); its transition from a member of the Green Faith takes it
    into this dismal new unlife via a different path. A siabrae retains all the
    base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
  - 'CR: Same as the base creature +2.'
  - 'Alignment: Neutral evil.'
  - >-
    Type: The creature's type changes to undead with the earth subtype. Do not
    recalculate HD, BAB, or saves.
  - >-
    Armor Class: A siabrae has a +10 natural armor bonus or the creature's
    normal bonus, whichever is better.
  - >-
    Hit Dice: Change the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived
    from class levels are unchanged. As undead, siabraes use their Charisma
    modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: A siabrae gains darkvision 60 feet, tremorsense 60
    feet, channel resistance +4, DR 10/ adamantine and bludgeoning, and immunity
    to fire (in addition to all those granted by its undead traits). The siabrae
    also gains the following defensive ability.
  - >-
    Blighted Rebirth (Su): When a siabrae is destroyed, it may attempt a DC 20
    Fortitude save to avoid destruction. The siabrae automatically makes this
    saving throw if it is in contact with blighted or diseased terrain (such as
    most of the Worldwound's terrain). A successful save causes the siabrae's
    body to crumble to dust, as the blighted earth absorbs its essence. Its
    enduring essence begins forming a new body in a random location within 1d10
    miles (this new location must contain a mass of unworked stone large enough
    for the siabrae's body to form within). This process takes 1d10 days, after
    which the siabrae emerges from the stone with a peal of thunder, though
    without its gear.
  - >-
    Speed: A siabrae gains a burrow speed equal to its land speed, and the earth
    glide universal monster ability.
  - >-
    Melee: A siabrae grows a pair of stony antlers from its skull that grant it
    a gore attack that deals damage based on the siabrae's size, but as if it
    were one size category larger than its actual size. This gore attack is
    always a primary attack, even when the siabrae also uses weapons. If the
    siabrae wishes, it can retain these antlers in any form it assumes via wild
    shape. Shards of the stony antlers break off in wounds-a siabrae's antlers
    constantly replenish themselves as these shards break off. A creature
    damaged by a siabrae's gore attack must make a successful Fortitude save (DC
    = 10 + 1/2 the siabrae's HD + the siabrae's Charisma modifier) or turn to
    stone permanently.
  - >-
    Special Attacks: A siabrae retains all the special attacks of the base
    creature. If it had the ability to use wild shape, it retains this ability,
    but it can assume only the form of creatures that cannot fly. Any form it
    assumes (via wild shape or polymorph effects) or any creature it summons
    appears malnourished, diseased, or even in an advanced state of decay,
    although these are cosmetic effects; they do not impact actual game
    statistics. In addition, a siabrae gains the following special attacks. The
    save DC for any of these attacks is equal to 10 + 1/2 the siabrae's HD + the
    siabrae's Charisma modifier.
  - >-
    Blight Mastery (Su): Any of a siabrae's spell or effects that would normally
    be restricted to affecting animals can also affect undead animals.
  - >-
    Blightbond (Ex): A siabrae has an unholy bond with the blighted earth. It
    loses any animal companion or access to domains it had from its druidic
    nature bond ability. In place of nature bond, the siabrae's close ties to
    the blighted landscape grant it one of the following cleric domains: Animal,
    Death, Destruction, Earth, Madness, or Repose. This ability otherwise
    functions the same as nature bond.
  - >-
    Abilities: Str +2, Wis +2, Cha +2. Being undead, a siabrae has no
    Constitution score.
  - 'Feats: A siabrae gains Toughness as a bonus feat.'
  - >-
    Skills: A siabrae gains a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense Motive, and
    Stealth checks. A siabrae always treats Intimidate, Knowledge (planes),
    Knowledge (religion), Sense Motive, and Stealth as class skills. Otherwise,
    a siabrae's skills are the same as the base creature.
