SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Enemy of Dragons and Eagles (Ex)
    description: >-
      Halas are hated enemies of dragons and eagles. Those creatures gain a +2
      bonus on attack and damage rolls against hala demons.
  - name: Hailstorm (Su)
    description: >-
      A hala can call down hailstones from surrounding clouds once every 1d4
      rounds as a standard action. These hailstones deal 1d6 points of
      bludgeoning damage and 1d6 points of cold damage to all creatures within a
      20-foot radius that have no overhead cover. A DC 14 Reflex save halves
      this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. To use this ability, the
      hala must be outside and there must be clouds in the sky.
  - name: Stormwind Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Halas surround themselves with a buffeting shroud of supernatural,
      windstorm-force winds. These winds shield a hala from any other wind
      effects and form a shell of breathable air around it, allowing the hala to
      breathe underwater. Ranged weapons and gases directed toward a hala are
      affected as the spell wind wall.
  - name: Vengeful Wind (Su)
    description: >-
      Anytime a hala takes damage from a critical hit, a powerful blast of wind
      explodes forth in the direction of the attacker. This blast takes the form
      of a 60-foot-long gale, treated as a gust of wind spell, directed from the
      hala toward the opponent that scored the critical hit against it (if that
      creature is more than 60 feet away, the wind is aimed in its direction but
      doesn't come close enough to affect it). This wind is also charged with
      electricity. Any creature in or that enters the area of effect must make a
      DC 14 Reflex save or take 3d6 points of electricity damage. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Hala demons are commonly known as storm demons. Bound to service by Pazuzu,
    these demons ride the winds across the Abyssal skies, lurk within dark and
    turbulent clouds, and act as his scouts and spies. Halas have a single,
    blood-red eye, an enormous mouth lined with razor-sharp teeth, and lengthy
    horns growing from their heads.
  - >-
    A typical hala stands 7 feet tall, weighs 200 pounds, and possesses large
    wings that span 20 feet across.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Hala demons form from covetous souls, those who desired the possessions of
    others so much so that they indulged in such acts as murder, theft, or
    blackmail. The more persons harmed by these desires, the more likely the
    soul is to become a hala in the Abyss.
  - >-
    Halas are masters of the winds, harnessing the power of storms, redirecting
    and amplifying that energy to cause the most damage and chaos possible. They
    relish the destructive forces of their storms, and can manipulate a storm's
    energy to rain down hailstones to pelt the area. Their command of the winds
    also aids them in flight. They are never impeded by storm winds, but instead
    ride them, often achieving top speeds by accelerating the wind currents
    around them.
  - >-
    Due to the nature of their origin, halas are highly possessive. A hala will
    often refer to the storm clouds they marshal as "my storm." A hala is
    predisposed to grab any item it finds particularly desirable, and will
    actively pillage regions that its storm passes over. The desire to take from
    others remains so prevalent in the hala's nature that it often carries large
    sacks in which to place all the items it takes during its flights. Bags of
    holding or handy haversacks are highly prized possessions to a hala, as it
    allows it to pillage even more items. Halas are voracious, with large mouths
    that open nearly ear-to-ear. Edible items they find in their pillaging are
    often consumed immediately. This includes a particular appetite for children
    and other Small humanoids.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Halas can be seen throughout the Abyss, roaming the skies in servitude to
    Pazuzu as his dedicated scout force. Their heaviest concentration, however,
    exists in High M'Vania, as all hala demons are required to return to
    Pazuzu's realm once a century to report all that they have observed. Despite
    the duty to return to High M'Vania, halas are solitary demons, distrusting
    all others, especially other hala demons, fearing that they will attempt to
    take their pillaged possessions. Therefore, most halas live in isolated,
    remote areas where they maintain their hoards of ill-gotten gains.
  - >-
    Pazuzu values his hala minions not only for the intelligence they gather on
    the activities of his enemies in the Abyss, but also for the chaos and
    destruction they bring on the winds. He is especially fond of sending halas
    to the Material Plane to ravage the countryside with storms and hail. As in
    the Abyss, halas on the Material Plane prefer to reside in remote areas. The
    lair of a hala is often located in a hidden cave in an isolated mountain
    range, or in the hollow of a giant, ancient tree deep in a forest or swamp.
  - >-
    While hala demons have a general dislike for or distrust of nearly all
    creatures, they have an especially strong fear and hatred of two creatures:
    eagles and dragons. Eagles have an innate response to attack and drive a
    hala from the skies, possibly due to the threat the hala represents to the
    eagle's territory and offspring. Dragons-of any breed-largely view the storm
    demons as a danger to their own hoards of treasure, for if a hala discovers
    the dragon's lair, it will stop at nothing to possess all that lies within
    it.
