Description:
  - >-
    Monadic devas are relatives of the astral deva and are usually found
    wandering the Ethereal or Elemental Planes. They serve as leaders and
    officers in the celestial armies.
  - Monadic devas stand about 7 feet tall and weigh about 220 pounds.
  - >-
    Monadic devas, like their brethren, enjoy combat. They use their mace of
    smiting and spell-like abilities when fighting opponents. Monadic devas
    always aid good-aligned creatures if they are being threatened or attacked
    by those of evil alignment.
