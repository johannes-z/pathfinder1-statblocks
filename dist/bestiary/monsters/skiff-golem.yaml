  This unusual river skiff is constructed of finely-crafted wood. On the bow of
  the ship stands a statue of a skeletal figure dressed in a hooded black robe.
  Its hand clutches a long staff.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A skill golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted: Warp wood or wood shape slows
      a skiff golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds (no save). A magical
      attack that deals cold damage breaks any slow effect on the skiff golem
      and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would
      otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed
      its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A
      skiff golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal cold damage.
      Repel wood drives the skiff golem back 30 feet and deals 2d12 points of
      damage to it (no save). Ironwood heals a skiff golem of all its lost hit
      points.
  - name: Man Overboard (Ex)
    description: >-
      A skiff golem can rock itself violently back and forth as a move action,
      causing all those onboard to fall into the water (which if on the River
      Styx could be a very bad thing indeed). A creature can attempt to maintain
      its footing and grab onto the skiff golem by succeeding on a DC 27
      Acrobatics check. The check DC is Strength-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Crafted by Charon, the Boatman of the Lower Planes and his servants, these
    creatures serve as an automated means of transportation across the Styx. A
    rider's destination need merely be whispered in the golem's ear and payment
    dropped into a nearby container on the skiff. When these conditions are met,
    the skiff sets out immediately at full speed, polling across water and land
    alike with otherworldly determination.
  - >-
    If attacked, or if travelers attempt to board the skiff without first
    paying, a skiff golem attacks with its ebon staff and breath weapon (the
    skeletal figure pivots to face its opponents). If it manages to paralyze an
    opponent with its staff, it attempts to knock that foe from its skiff into
    the waiting waters. If threatened with destruction, the skiff golem summons
    several charonadaemons to its aid or makes haste to retreat, poling thru
    rock, stone, magical obstructions, water and fire if necessary.
  - Construction
  - >-
    The construction of a skiff golem is a closely guarded secret, known only to
    Charon and some of his most loyal servants.
