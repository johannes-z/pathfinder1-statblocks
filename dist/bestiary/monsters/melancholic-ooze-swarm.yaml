SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Paralyzing Slime (Ex)
    description: >-
      Melancholic oozes are composed of chemical depressants. Any living
      creature that begins its turn affected by the swarm's viscous ability must
      make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1 round. This is a
      mindaffecting effect. Creatures immune to poison are immune to this
      effect.
  - name: Viscous (Ex)
    description: >-
      As described in the sanguine ooze swarm's special abilities, except that
      the Reflex save DC is 15 and the patches are destroyed if the victim takes
      any amount of acid damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Formed from accumulations of runoff from arcane laboratories and regions of
    magical calamity, alchemical oozes are fist-sized blobs of volatile
    chemicals. Although composed of unpredictable compounds and toxins, these
    mobile oozes pose little threat individually, but in polluted quagmires and
    tainted sewers can collect in numbers great enough to threaten creatures
    many times their size. Swarms of the slimes linger in such contaminated
    areas and seek new accretions of vital solutions, like those found within
    the bodies of higher life forms, to fuel their erratic life cycles. Found in
    numerous varieties with a host of differing abilities, these weird, clinging
    oozes have been differentiated by likening them to the humors said to
    compose the bodies of living beings. Appearing at first to be a collection
    of tiny blobs of viscous, translucent fluid, alchemical oozes become far
    more terrifying once their hungry nature becomes apparent. Each swarm is
    composed of several hundred palm-sized balls of ooze that all scuttle along
    as a single unit.
