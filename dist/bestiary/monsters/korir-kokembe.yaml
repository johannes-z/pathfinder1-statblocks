Description:
  - >-
    Korir-kokembe live in the deep, watery jungles of central Garund, plaguing
    the major rivers and lake systems. While young korir-kokembe may swim near
    populated waterways to claim their prey, their elder kin prefer more remote
    backwaters, sloughs, and heavily wooded swamps where they can hunt
    undisturbed. These degenerate dragons live in a violent symbiosis with the
    tiny vermin that infest the jungle, hosting colonies of such creatures
    within their own bodies. Such tiny vermin constantly swarm in and out of the
    korir-kokembe's gullet, bringing contagion to creatures bitten and allowing
    the wyrm to expel swarms of pests, or to summon yet more vermin to its aid.
    While korir-kokembe are capable of flight, they generally prefer to crawl or
    climb on their eight legs, hunching their bodies like inchworms or twining
    their coils around their prey while savaging creatures with a barrage of
    slashing claws.
