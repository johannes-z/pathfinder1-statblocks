SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Attach (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a giant leech hits with a bite attack, it latches onto its target and
      automatically grapples. The giant leech loses its Dexterity bonus to AC
      and has an AC of 10, but holds on with great tenacity and automatically
      inflicts bite damage each round. A giant leech has a +8 racial bonus to
      maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached giant leech
      can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win
      a grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the giant leech is
      removed.
  - name: Blood Drain (Ex)
    description: >-

      inflicting 1 point of Strength and Constitution damage.
  - name: Susceptible to Salt (Ex)
    description: >-
      A handful of salt burns a giant leech as if it were a flask of acid,
      causing 1d6 points of damage per use.
Description:
