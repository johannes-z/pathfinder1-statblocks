SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Slowing Webs (Ex)
    description: >-
      The web of a temporal crawler emanates a slow effect (as the slow spell,
      caster level 6th) that affects all creatures within 10 feet of the web.
      Affected creatures can make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save the round
      they are affected to negate the effects. Creatures are slowed as long as
      they stay within 10 feet of a web. The slow effects can be counterspelled
      with the successful casting of a haste spell if the caster makes a
      successful caster level check (DC 16) before casting the haste spell. The
      save DC is Constitution-based. A temporal crawler can fire a web up to
      four times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a
      maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is
      effective against targets up to one size category larger than the temporal
      crawler. An entangled creature can attempt a DC 19 Escape Artist check or
      burst it with a DC 19 Strength check. Both are standard actions. The check
      DCs are both Constitution-based and the Strength check DC includes a +4
      racial bonus. Temporal crawlers often create sticky sheets of webbing up
      to 20 feet square. Approaching creatures must make a successful DC 20
      Perception check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and
      become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or
      burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to
      walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot section has 10 hit points,
      and sheet webs have damage reduction 5/ magic.
  - name: Foresight (Su)
    description: >-
      A temporal crawler can see a few seconds into the future. This ability
      prevents a temporal crawler from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or
      flanked. It also grants the temporal crawler an insight bonus to AC equal
      to its Wisdom bonus. This ability can be negated, but the temporal crawler
      can restart it as a free action on its next turn.
  - name: Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      Temporal crawlers are immune to all time-related spells and effects
      (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like).
Description:
  - >-
    Temporal crawlers are man-sized spiders from the Elemental Plane of Time.
    Upon close inspection, it appears that the hourglass-shaped markings along
    its back are animated and sand appears to shift from one chamber to the
    other. If a temporal crawler is slain, the silver hourglass on its back
    fades to gray and the "sand" inside stops flowing.
  - >-
    How temporal crawlers first arrived on the Material Plane is unknown but
    sages believe they jumped through a portal to this plane opened by a time
    elemental or time flayer (see their entry in this book).
  - >-
    These extraplanar creatures are carnivorous and prey on the flesh of living
    creatures. They build their lairs near populated areas where the food supply
    is more than adequate. Temporal crawlers hunt day or night, but prefer to
    leave their webs at night when they have an easier time corralling their
    prey.
  - >-
    Temporal crawlers spend most of their time hunting on the Material Plane
    where prey is easiest to catch. They spin their webs in locations frequented
    by living creatures and lie in wait. When its prey enters a 10- foot area
    around its webs and is slowed, the temporal crawler rushes out and attacks.
    If it can paralyze its prey with its bite, the temporal crawler cocoons it
    in its web. A creature killed is cocooned and stored as food.
