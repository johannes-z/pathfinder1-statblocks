SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acidic Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      Each time a belabra is hit with a slashing or piercing weapon, all
      creatures within a 10-ft. radius must succeed on a DC 14 Reflex save or be
      sprayed by the creature's acidic blood. The save DC is Constitution-based.
      A creature that fails its save is partially blinded and overcome with fits
      of sneezing. Both effects last 1d6+2 rounds. An affected creature takes a
      -1 penalty to AC, loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any), moves at half
      speed, and takes a -2 penalty on Perception checks and on Strength- and
      Dexterity-based skills and checks. All checks relying on vision (such as
      reading and Perception) have a 50% chance of failing. All opponents are
      considered to have concealment (20% miss chance) relative to the blinded
      character. Tentacle-Barbs (Ex) A belabra's tentacles are lined with
      razor-sharp barbs. Anytime a grappled creature attempts to break free, it
      takes 1d4+1 points of piercing damage from the barbs.
Description:
  - >-
    Belabras are large, jellyfish-like omnivores that dwell in deep forests and
    thick undergrowth. They sustain themselves on a diet of plants, berries, and
    rodents. Particularly hungry belabras will attack larger creatures (such as
    humanoids).
  - >-
    Belabras (called "tanglers" by some) resemble jellyfish about 5 feet in
    diameter. Its eyes have no pupils. A small, bird-like beak is hidden among
    its array of tentacles.
  - >-
    A belabra attacks by slamming into its opponents with its hard, chitinous
    shell or by lashing out with its tentacles. Grabbed opponents are pulled in
    and bitten.
