Description:
  - >-
    Known as the middle class of the demodand race, slime demodands are as evil
    as their lesser relatives, the tarry demodands. They delight in torturing
    creatures of lesser skill and rank than themselves. A typical slime demodand
    stands 6 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. The slime demodand attacks with
    its claws and bite in combat. It often opens combat with a ray of
    enfeeblement targeted against the physically strongest (or perceived
    physically strongest) opponent. Credit The Slime Demodand originally
