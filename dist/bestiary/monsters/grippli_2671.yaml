Description:
  - >-
    Gripplis are short frog-like humanoids that dwell in swamps and marshes.
    They can move upright or on all fours. They spend most of their time
    scooting about their community doing many of the same tasks that humans
    employ in their own communities. A grippli stands 2 to 2-1/2 feet tall and
    weighs from 40 to 50 pounds. Its eyes are yellow with vertical-slit pupils
    of black. Gripplis often wear brightly colored or decorated clothes. They
    are attracted to and love brightly colored items. Gripplis are peaceful and
    nonaggressive, only attacking when threatened or frightened. They prefer to
    keep their opponents at distance and attack using their nets and darts. If
    engaged in melee, gripplis employ short swords. Some gripplis coat their
    darts with poison before entering battle. A grippli village is human-like in
    organization. Each grippli family maintains its own dwelling place. The huts
    are small and constructed of wood and mud. Gripplis build them beneath the
    branches of large trees so as to shade themselves from the long, hot days.
    Each grippli village is led by a tribal leader (usually a female adept or
    cleric of at least 3rd level). Gripplis survive through trade with other
    peace-loving races such as elves and halflings or through hunting. Gripplis
    are fond of various fruits and insects (including the giant varieties) and
    collect and store them in village huts for the winter months when food
    becomes scarce. Gripplis reproduce by laying eggs. A typical clutch contains
    a single egg, as gripplis are slow to reproduce. For this reason, they
    defend their young with a ferocity unknown among many other races. Grippli
    Characters Grippli leaders are usually rogues or rogue/fighters. Grippli
    priests are usually adepts. Grippli clerics have access to two of the
    following domains: Animal, Plant, Protection, and Travel. Grippli characters
