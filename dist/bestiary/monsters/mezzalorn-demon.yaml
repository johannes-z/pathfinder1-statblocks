      When reduced to half or less of its normal hit points, a mezzalorn
      releases a pheromone that heightens the aggression of all other mezzalorns
      within a 50-foot radius. Affected mezzalorns gain a +2 morale bonus on
      attack and damage rolls for the rest of the encounter.

Description:
  - >-
    Mezzalorns (or wasp demons as they are called by otherworlders) are entities
    akin to the fly or stirge demons. They spend most of their time flying high
    above the Abyssal planes scouring the lands for food or patrolling a demon
    lord's domain if they are in the service of such a demon. When serving under
    a demon lord or one of his generals, mezzalorns are often utilized as shock
    troops or first-assault troops in war.
  - >-
    Mezzalorns are thoroughly evil and despise all non-demons, attacking them on
    sight. Slain creatures are carried back to their lair and distributed among
    the inhabitants of the nest. Among demonkind they despise stirge demons with
    an unbridled hatred and always attack them on sight, fighting to the death
    when battling them. Slain stirge demons are not eaten by wasp demons (they
    dislike their smell, and as such dislike their taste even more), but are
    completely and utterly destroyed, their bodies being torn to pieces or
    injected with so much venom as to liquefy their internals.
  - >-
    A mezzalorn makes its lair in rocky outcroppings or in underground burrows
    and tunnels on the various abyssal planes. They generally avoid the less
    hospitable planes composed of acids, oozes, slimes, waters, or vapors as
    they require a solid surface on which to build their nests. A nest is
    composed of just about anything a mezzalorn can find and carry: bones,
    debris, refuse, weapons, and so on.
  - >-
    A mezzalorn stands as tall as a human and is about 10 feet long. Its body is
    dark with red bands and ends in a golden stinger. Its legs resemble those of
    a giant wasp and are covered in fine hairs and bristles. Its human-like
    visage is copper and sports matted dark hair. Its horns are black.
  - >-
    Mezzalorn tactics are simple and straightforward: fly into battle, sting a
    foe repeatedly until it dies. Often a mezzalorn grabs a foe, flies upward
    away from the opponent's allies, and stings its grappled victim until it
    dies, dropping the carcass without thought or care before wading back into
    the battle. Mezzalorn's hate stirge demons and fly demons and attack them on
    sight.
