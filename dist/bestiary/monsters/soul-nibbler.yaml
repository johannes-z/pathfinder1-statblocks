Description:
  - >-
    Soul nibblers are rats that have undergone genetic mutation due to continued
    feeding on essence ingots (see sidebar). The biological effects of a
    prolonged consumption of soul stuff are minimal. Soul nibblers are always
    black in color, and their eyes sometime glow with a sickly light.
  - >-
    The magical changes wrought by their unholy diet, however, are more
    profound, granting the soul nibblers unique necromantic abilities.
  - >-
    Having begun life as normal rats, soul nibblers behave in combat much like
    their mundane cousins. The primary difference between soul nibblers and
    standard rats is their bond to dark magic, which grants them the powers of
    energy drain and necromantic immunity.
  - >-
    Essence Ingots Essence ingots are small rectangular bricks of blackened
    stone that contain the soul of a living creature. Creatures are trapped in
    essence ingots through the use of a great smelter, the location of which has
    been lost.
  - >-
    A trapped spirit can be released by casting remove curse (or similar and
    more powerful magic). A released soul reforms its material body in 1d4
    rounds. An essence ingot has a hardness 5, hp 10, and Break DC 20. Note,
    however, that if an essence ingot is broken, the trapped soul is not
    released but is lost forever.
