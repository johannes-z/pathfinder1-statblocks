Description_Visual: >-
  This serpentine horror coils beneath a haze of shimmering heat waves. As the
  outer layer of its form cools into hard, black plates, the cracks between
  these give off the cherry glow of molten rock.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Control Elemental (Ex)
    description: >-
      Lava weirds can attempt to command any outsider with the "Earth,"
      "Elemental," or "Fire" subtype that is within 50 feet. The Will save to
      avoid control has a DC of 21. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a
      +4 racial bonus. This effect is similar to the dominate monster spell. The
      elemental receives a Will save to avoid being commanded. If the save
      succeeds, that elemental is immune to the control elemental ability of
      that lava weird for one day. If the save fails, the elemental falls under
      the control of the lava weird and obeys it to the best of its ability
      until either it or the weird dies. There is no limit to the number of HD
      of elementals a lava weird can control using this ability. The range is
      unlimited though both the lava weird and the elemental must be on the same
      plane of existence; otherwise, the weird loses control of the elemental.
      Lava weirds cannot control other lava weirds using this ability.
  - name: Fire (Ex)
    description: >-
      Lava weirds are living creatures of elemental magma; any successful melee
      hit deals fire damage and the victim must make a successful Reflex save
      (DC 16) or catch on fire (see Catching on Fire in the Pathfinder Core
      Rulebook). The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures attacking a lava
      weird unarmed or with natural weapons take fire damage and must make a
      successful Reflex save to avoid catching on fire just as if the lava weird
      had hit with its attack.
  - name: Drown (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a lava weird pins a grabbed foe, it fully immerses its victim in its
      lava pool. A victim completely immersed takes fire damage (see Lava Pool
      below) and must hold its breath or drown. The victim can hold its breath
      for a number of rounds equal to twice its Constitution score. After that,
      the victim must make a successful Constitution check (DC 10, +1 per
      previous check) each round to continue holding its breath. If the victim
      fails a check, it drowns. In the first round, the victim falls unconscious
      (0 hp). In the next round, the creature is dying (-1 hp), and in the third
      round the victim drowns. Lava Pool A lava weird's pool is a bubbling,
      churning, morass of molten rock mixed with elemental fire. Flammable
      materials that contact the lava pool automatically catch fire on the round
      contact is made. Creatures touching the pool take 2d8 points of fire
      damage per round of contact. Damage from the lava pool continues for 1d3
      rounds after contact ceases, but this extra damage is only half of that
      dealt during contact (1d8 points of damage). Creatures immune to fire are
      unaffected by the lava weird's pool and take no damage, though they can
      still drown if completely immersed.
  - name: Reform (Ex)
    description: >-
      When reduced to 0 hit points or less, a lava weird collapses back into its
      pool. Four rounds later, it reforms at full strength minus any damage
      taken from coldbased effects or attacks.
  - name: Transparency (Ex)
    description: A lava weird is effectively invisible in its lava pool until it attacks.
Description:
  - >-
    Lava weirds are serpent-like creatures formed of elemental magma. They are
    rarely encountered outside the Elemental Plane of Fire or the Plane of
    Molten Skies where they spend their time swimming in pools of liquid fire.
    Sometimes though, a lava weird slips through a portal into the Material
    Plane and takes up residency there, always in a pool of lava or
    magma-whether man-made or naturally occurring. Lava weirds on the Material
    Plane are bound by their chosen pool and cannot leave it while on the
    Material Plane. High-level spellcasters sometimes employ lava weirds as
    guardians. A lava weird appears as a 10-foot long serpent formed of
    elemental fire. Closer examination reveals liquid rock in scale-like
    patterns across its body, growing darker across its back. Two small flickers
    of white fire located on its head serve as eyes. A lava weird prefers to
    hide in its lava pool until victims come within range. Once a target is
    close to its lava pool, the weird quickly lashes out and snatches the
    victim, biting it and coiling around it. It then attempts to pull the victim
    into its lava pool. Lava weirds are highly aggressive and prone to attack
    just about any creature that wanders too close to their pool.
