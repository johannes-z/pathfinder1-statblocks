SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fate Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      The herald's aura acts as consecrate and grants her a +4 deflection bonus
      to AC, a +5 insight bonus to AC, and a +4 resistance bonus on saving
      throws. Any creature striking the herald from within her aura either is
      blinded or takes 1d6 points of Strength damage (herald's choice, Will DC
      25 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Dazed 2d6 rounds (or stunned if 5 HD or fewer, or held for 2d6 rounds if
      undead), 60 feet; Will DC 25 negates. A creature that succeeds at its save
      is immune to the gaze for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect (or a
      necromancy effect against undead). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Incorporeal Form (Su)
    description: >-
      When incorporeal, the herald can use her spell-like abilities and gaze
      attack but can't make slam attacks.
Description:
  - >-
    The Steward of the Skein is Pharasma's foremost agent, a mighty warrior sent
    to restore the balance of fate, announce auspicious births or deaths, or
    stem a rising tide of undeath.
  - >-
    She often appears as an incorporeal shade, making a pronouncement and then
    fading away, though countless creatures over the eons have fallen under her
    armored fists.
  - She stands about 7 feet tall but weighs a mere 200 pounds.
