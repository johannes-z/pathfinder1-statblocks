  - name: Salted Wound (Su)
    description: >-
      Any living creature damaged by a ship sentinel must make a successful DC
      16 Fortitude save or take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls for 1
      round as salty brine drips painfully onto the wound. On a successful
      critical hit, the target takes an additional 3d6 points of damage as its
      flesh cracks and withers from dehydration. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Ship Sight (Su)
    description: >-
      A ship sentinel is treated as having tremorsense out to 100 feet while
      onboard a ship, as its senses permeate the vessel's timbers. It can only
      detect creatures in contact with the vessel or on objects in contact with
      the vessel. It cannot use this ability to detect creatures not in contact
      with the ship, even if they are within the ability's 100-foot radius.
Description:
  - >-
    Ship sentinels are animated constructs that are bound to a specific vessel
    and to that ship's captain. Crafted to resemble a humanoid figurehead, a
    ship sentinel normally rests at the prow of its ship, granting good fortune
    and protection to the crew. But in times of dire need, the captain can also
    activate the ship sentinel, causing it to spring to life and fight alongside
    the vessel's crew. Although individual features of ship sentinels may vary,
    all ship sentinels are made of wood and have the same general statistics.
  - A ship sentinel stands roughly 6 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    A ship sentinel's form is carved and shaped by skilled woodworkers, but
    cannot truly be brought to "life" without offerings from the sea. Most
    spellcasters who endeavor to create these guardians crush a mixture of sand,
    shells, and valuable pearls and mix it with saltwater and oils, creating a
    grainy varnish. The carved figure is coated with the solution and then
    brought to the shores of the sea and affixed to the bowsprit of the craft it
    will protect. Only then is the construct's creation finally complete. Unlike
    with most constructs, however, control of the creature does not fall to the
    creator, but rather to the captain of the ship to which it is affixed. If
    the captain of the ship changes, control of the construct passes to the new
    captain.
  - >-
    Although resistant to most hazards of sea and storm, all ship sentinels
    eventually wear down after a time and require polishing, cleaning, and
    recoating with the specially prepared varnish used during the construct's
    creation. If maintained in this fashion, however, a single ship sentinel can
    guard a ship-passing from captain to captain-for decades or even centuries.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Ship sentinels are solitary creations, and a single construct is capable of
    defending even the largest of ships. Their presence is an undisputed boon to
    all aboard-though most captains prefer not to speak of their crafts'
    guardians, preferring to keep the constructs as secret weapons. When the
    sentinel is needed, the captain must shout a word or short phrase to bring
    the construct to life. An awakened ship sentinel is able to recognize loyal
    members of its crew, placing them under its protective wards, and directs
    its attacks against any living targets that it does not ward, though the
    construct's master can point it toward specific targets.
  - >-
    In combat, ship sentinels can pulverize flesh and bone with their heavy
    wooden hands, but normally wield a weapon of some kind-usually a spear,
    rapier, shortsword, or other light weapon. Stories even exist of elven
    vessels that armed their ship sentinels with huge bows, or of daring Brevic
    sea captains who gave their constructs the fabled Aldori dueling swords of
    their homeland. Regardless of these variations, most weapons used in a ship
    sentinel's construction draw upon the construct's inherent nimbleness, an
    agility belied by the figurehead's wooden form. But whether their weapons
    are forged or natural, all ship sentinels can infuse the sting of seawater
    and salt air into their blows, wracking their foes with crippling pain.
  - >-
    Ship sentinels are resilient foes, their wooden bodies capable of turning
    aside most attacks that cannot pierce or gouge them. Unfortunately their
    construction also makes them vulnerable to fire-their greatest weakness-and
    any magical fire quickly dries a ship sentinel's body to a nearly immobile
    brittleness.
  - >-
    Variant Ship Sentinels Ship sentinels can be crafted in a wide variety of
    forms and are often embellished and customized similarly to mundane
    figureheads. The following are some of these constructs' most common
    customizations.
  - >-
    Ballista Marksman: Some ship sentinels have a light ballista built into
    their forms; these sentinels are usually designed to look like an archer
    with an oversized bow, a beauteous lillend, or a cruel erinyes. Such ship
    sentinels rarely have a melee weapon, resorting instead to slams if unable
    to use their ballistae to make ranged attacks. Statistics for ballista
    marksmen are modified as follows: Ranged light ballista +12 (3d8 plus salted
    wound /19-20). See Chapter 3 of Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat for
    additional details on siege engines.
  - >-
    Mariner's Muse: Sculpted to resemble harp-playing angels or armored heralds,
    a mariner's muse ship sentinel can use the inspire courage effect of a
    bard's bardic performance once per day for 5 rounds as if it were a
    5th-level bard. It always uses all 5 rounds of its performance at the same
    time and can never use the performance multiple times in 1 day for any
    duration.
  - >-
    Sea Sorcerer: These ship sentinels are often crafted to resemble wizards,
    sea serpents, or abstract orrery-like sculptures, and possess limited
    spell-like abilities. They can only use these abilities while onboard a
    sailing vessel. These spell-like abilities can each be used 3 times per day,
    and include animate objects, grease, and obscuring mist.
  - Construction
  - >-
    A ship sentinel is built from 400 pounds of wood. The creator or a hired
    artisan must then shape the creature into the desired likeness, usually
    after a fashion common to the nautical vessels of the region. Afterward, a
    special varnish is made from a mixture of sand, seawater, crushed pearls and
    shells, and magically treated oils- the varnish is worth a total of 250 gp
    and is applied to the entire form. If the creator intends for the ship
    sentinel to wield a weapon, a masterwork or better version of that weapon
    must also be supplied.
