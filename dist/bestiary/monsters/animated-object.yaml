    An animated object is not simply one monster, but a whole category. The
    stats presented here are for a Medium animated object (with 2 CP that have
    not been spent to gain additional abilities), but any object can become
    animated, most commonly via the spell animate objects. Permanent animated
    objects can be built using the Craft Construct feat (see page 314). Unless
    an animated object uses a Construction Point to be made of another material,
    all animated objects are made of wood or material of equivalent hardness.
    Creating an animated object of a different size than Medium can be done
    simply by adjusting the object's size (and thus adjusting its Strength,
    Dexterity, natural armor bonus, and size modifier to attack and AC as
    detailed on page 296) and Hit Dice. Size Sample Object H D CP CR Tiny
