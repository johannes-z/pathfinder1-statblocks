SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Luckbringer (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a ceru can bring luck or misfortune upon any
      creature it can see within 30 feet. This effect lasts for 1 round, and the
      ceru decides in advance whether the modified luck is good or bad. If the
      ceru grants bad luck, anytime the target makes an ability check, attack
      roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse
      result. A successful DC 13 Will save negates this effect. If the ceru
      grants good luck, the target must choose a single roll (as above) prior to
      rolling, and may roll the chosen roll twice and take the higher result. A
      creature can only be affected by this ability once per 24 hours, and the
      ceru may use the ability once per day for every 4 HD it has (minimum once
      per day). The save DC is Charisma-based. If the ceru is a familiar, it may
      use its master's character level, if higher, in place of its racial Hit
      Dice for determining the number of uses of this ability, and for
      calculating the save DC (DC = 10 + 1/2 or the master's character level +
      the master's Cha modifier).

Description:
  - >-
    Cerus are artificial creatures created through the fusion of alchemy and
    magic in the Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra, where they are regarded as
    amazing pets for the rich and powerful. A single ceru fetches at least 300
    gp from Vudrani specialty merchants. Most cerus are sterile, and so the rare
    breeding pair commands an additional +1,000 gp beyond the cost of two
    non-breeding cerus. Many breeders would rather kill their breeding stock (or
    murder would-be thieves) than lose control of their exclusivity.
  - >-
    Cerus do not yet exist outside of exotic merchant stalls and strange arcane
    laboratories. Rumors persist of an alchemical formula allowing the creation
    of a first-generation ceru that is reliably fertile. This revelation is
    bound to spur a race among arcanists to find the formula and introduce these
    creatures to the Inner Sea region in much greater numbers. A spellcaster of
    7th level or higher can bond with a ceru via the Improved Familiar feat.
  - >-
    Upon reaching maturity, a ceru's body is 1 foot long and weighs 12 pounds.
    The rare fertile female ceru bears only one litter per year, no matter how
    frequently bred, with typically no more than one to three offspring.
