Description:
  - >-
    Rune guardians are animated constructs from ancient Thassilon, created by
    the runelords to guard laboratories, ossuaries, and repositories of lore.
    Each rune guardian is dedicated to one of the seven rewards of rule (now
    known as the seven sins of the soul), and empowered with that sin's
    associated school of magic. As such, there are seven varieties of rune
    guardian, each recognizable by its shape-that of the Thassilonian rune
    representing that specific sin and arcane school. (The Thassilonians did not
    consider divination a separate school). Unlike golems, rune guardians are
    intelligent, able to follow complex orders and pursue intruders. They were
    built to coordinate with other servants of the runelords-for example, an
    envy guardian's hold portal ability is more dangerous when used to lock
    someone in a room with a servitor monster. A rune guardian is approximately
    1 foot in diameter and weighs around 10 pounds. Variant Rune Guardians The
    statistics presented above represent only the least specimen created by the
    ancient runelords, with the power of a single 1st-level spell. Other
    variants exist, with different spell-like abilities or ones of increasing
    magical power. Rune guardians are always tied to one school of magic, and
    all of a rune guardian's spelllike abilities must come from that school. For
    example, a rune guardian of wrath might cast magic missile or shocking grasp
    instead of burning hands. In addition to the spell-like ability listed
    above, more powerful rune guardians of gluttony might possess the ability to
    cast blindness/deafness or ray of exhaustion. Construction A rune guardian's
    body is carved from a single block of semiprecious stone, then polished and
    treated with rare dusts and oils worth at least 500 gp. Rune Guardian CL
