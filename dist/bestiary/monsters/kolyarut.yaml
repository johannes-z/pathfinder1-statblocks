  Beneath its cloak, this man-shaped creature appears to be part statue and part
  metallic machine.

Description:
  - >-
    Kolyaruts are enforcers of bargains, traveling to the very edges of the
    planes in order to punish oath-breakers and see that contracts are kept.
    They care little for the terms of the agreements in question, only that
    promises are fulfilled, debts are paid, and balance is maintained.
  - >-
    Least conspicuous of the inevitables, even in their natural form, kolyaruts
    are the size of tall humans, though they weigh far more because of their
    composition.
  - >-
    Capable of using both invisibility and disguise self to pass completely
    unnoticed through humanoid lands, kolyaruts most frequently appear as
    cloaked warriors bearing finely crafted bastard swords, allowing others to
    chalk up any metallic noises to the clanking of hidden armor until the
    moment when they pull back their hoods and let their quarries look upon
    their mechanical faces, understanding only too late the nature of the
    mysterious strangers.
  - >-
    Perhaps because their missions can be the murkiest and most open to
    interpretation, kolyaruts are by far the most talkative of the inevitables,
    naturally possessing a courtly grace and an encyclopedic knowledge of social
    customs, which they use both to assist them in gathering information on
    their targets and in issuing challenges (or executing dignified sentences)
    on the battlefield. Though naturally as solitary as their kindred, kolyaruts
    are occasionally content to let members of other races tag along and assist
    them in achieving shared goals, though they have little problem abandoning
    or even exploiting these "comrades" if it brings them closer to fulfilling
    their mission.
