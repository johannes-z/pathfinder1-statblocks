    Infamous among travelers for its deadly poisonous bite, the emperor cobra is
    a foul-tempered snake typically encountered in bogs. The snake's scales are
    generally a dark green, with a pale green or even ivory underbelly. Its eyes
    are bright red and lack the distinctive serpentine slit most snake eyes
    possess. Emperor cobras are often trained to serve as guardians in temples.
    They are 16 feet long and weigh 200 pounds.
