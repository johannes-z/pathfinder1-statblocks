    Colossal 10 Much like their smaller kin, giant cockroaches are extremely
    adaptive and exist in any place they can find a ready source of food. Giant
    cockroaches are not normally very violent, but readily attack if threatened
    or if food becomes scarce. A number of species of giant cockroach exist, as
    summarized on the table above. Most of these variants have additional
    abilities, such as poison stings.
