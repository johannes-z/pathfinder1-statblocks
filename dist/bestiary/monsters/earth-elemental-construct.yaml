SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Earth Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      An earth elemental construct gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls
      if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne
      or waterborne, the elemental construct takes a -4 penalty on attack and
      damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      An earth elemental construct is immune to any spell or spell-like ability
      that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects
      function differently against the creature, as noted below. A transmute
      rock to mud spell slows an earth elemental construct (as the slow spell)
      for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. A transmute mud to rock spell heals
      all of its lost hit points. A stone to flesh spell does not change its
      structure, but deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to the
      construct who can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 16 + caster's relevant
      ability score modifier) for half damage.
  - name: Pound (Ex)
    description: >-
      An earth elemental construct can slam an opponent that is at least two
      size categories smaller than itself into the ground, wall, or other nearby
      solid surfaces, dealing bludgeoning damage, when it makes a successful
      grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful
      check, including additional damage). In addition, the pounded creature is
      stunned for 1 round; a DC 39 Fortitude save negates this additional
      effect. The save DC is Strength-based.
Description:
  - >-
    An earth elemental construct stands about 9 feet tall and weighs about 3,000
    pounds. Its body is stocky and wide, with powerful arms and legs. Creators
    often carve symbols or runes (including their own arcane mark) into the body
    of an earth elemental construct. An earth elemental construct is a
    relentless opponent and constantly hammers its foes with its stony fists. An
    earth elemental construct cannot speak or make any vocalizations. Elemental
    constructs are used by powerful mages as servants, bodyguards, and
    assassins. An elemental construct, like any other automaton follows any
    order or command given to it to the best of its ability. An elemental
    construct's creator can command it if the construct is within 60 feet and
    can see and hear its creator. If not commanded, an elemental construct
    usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if
    attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the elemental construct
    a simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The elemental
    construct's creator can order the construct to obey the commands of another
    person (who might in turn place the elemental construct under someone else's
    control, and so on), but the elemental construct's creator can always resume
    control over his creation by commanding the elemental construct to obey him
    alone. Each elemental construct appears as a humanoid creature about 9 feet
    tall and is composed entirely of its native element. Construction An
    elemental construct's body is formed completely of one of the four elements
    air, earth, fire, or water. The materials must be the finest quality or
    purest form taken from the respective plane and mixed with rare oils,
    powders, and other ingredients totaling 5,000 gp. ELEMENTAL CONSTRUCT CL
