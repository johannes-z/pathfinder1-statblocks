Source: PFRPG Bestiary 2
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Confusion (Su)
    description: >-
      The eerie shifting of patterns on a gloomwing's wings is hypnotic-any
      creature within 30 feet that does not avert its gaze from the gloomwing
      must make a DC 14 Will save at the start of each turn or become confused
      for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect- gloomwings and tenebrous
      worms are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Implant (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gloomwing can lay eggs inside a Small or larger helpless or dead
      creature as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A
      creature implanted with gloomwing eggs must make a DC 14 Fortitude save
      each morning to avoid suffering 1d4 points of Constitution damage. Within
      24 hours of a creature's death from this damage, 1d4 young tenebrous worms
      (see page 259) emerge from the corpse, devouring it completely in the
      process. The eggs can be destroyed via any effect that cures disease, but
      the eggs themselves are not treated as a disease for purposes of what
      creatures are immune to this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Pheromones (Su)
    description: >-
      After the first round of combat, a gloomwing can emit a strange, musky
      scent in a 30-foot radius as a free action. All creatures within this area
      (save for other gloomwings or tenebrous worms) must make a DC 14 Fortitude
      save each round to avoid becoming weakened by the pheromones. Once a
      creature fails a save against this effect, it takes a -4 penalty to its
      Strength score-this penalty lasts for as long as the battle continues and
      for 1 hour thereafter. Lesser restoration or any other effect capable of
      healing ability damage immediately removes this Strength penalty. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Gloomwings are strange, moth-like natives of the Plane of Shadow. Despite
    their appearance, they are not vermin and possess a crude but serviceable
    intelligence. While gloomwings can be conjured via spells like lesser planar
    ally or lesser planar binding to serve as guardians or even mounts,
    occasionally a gloomwing will slip through a tear in the fabric of the
    planes and make the journey to the Material Plane on its own. A gloomwing
    loose on the Material Plane is active for 2 to 3 hours at dawn and again for
    2 to 3 hours at dusk, preferring to spend the remaining hours of the day
    hiding in abandoned buildings, caves, or deep canyons or foliage where the
    shadows are thickest. During its periods of activity, it flies through the
    sky on the hunt for creatures to attack and implant its eggs in- the
    gloomwing does not need to eat, leaving this urge to propagate its species
    as its primary drive.
  - >-
    For all the dangers a gloomwing presents, it is the creature's young that
    pose the gravest threat. These creatures are known as tenebrous worms (see
    page 260), and despite being the larval form of the adult gloomwing, are
    much more dangerous creatures. The fact that a gloomwing can lay several
    eggs a day if presented with enough living hosts makes them dangerous not
    for what they can inf lict themselves, but for what they can spawn.
