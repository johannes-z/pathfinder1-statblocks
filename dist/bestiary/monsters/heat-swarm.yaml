    description: >-
      Anyone within 20 feet of a heat swarm must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude
      save or take 1d6 points of heat damage per round from the intense heat.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A heat swarm is a mass of flying, aggressive, foul-tempered elementals from
    the Para-Plane of Heat. A single heat elemental that makes up a heat swarm
    resembles a thumb-sized ball of fire with vaguely discernable facial
    features.
  - >-
    Heat swarms are highly territorial and attack any creatures (other than
    their own kind) entering their domain. Several swarms often work together to
    drive away a common foe.
  - >-
    When encountered on the Material Plane (which is a very rare occurrence
    indeed), a heat swarm is most often found in a highly unbearable (by human
    standards) climate such as an active volcano.
  - A heat swarm attacks by moving on top of and engulfing its foe.
