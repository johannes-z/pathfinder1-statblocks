SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Constitution Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      A mihstu deals 1d2 points of Constitution damage to an engulfed opponent
      each round the hold is maintained.
  - name: Engulf (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mihstu can try to wrap a Medium or smaller creature in its body as a
      standard action. The mihstu attempts a grapple that does not provoke an
      attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold
      and can slash (with a tentacle) the engulfed victim with a +4 bonus on its
      attack roll. It can still use its tentacles to strike at other targets.
      Attacks that hit an engulfing mihstu deal half their damage to the monster
      and half to the trapped victim.
  - name: Resistance to Missile Attacks (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ranged attacks (including magic missile) used against a mihstu have a 50%
      miss chance.
  - name: Susceptible to Cold (Ex)
    description: >-
      Cold-based attacks and effects deal no damage to a mihstu, but stun it. If
      the cold-based effect allows a saving throw and the mihstu succeeds on its
      save, it ignores the stun effect. If it fails its save, or if the effect
      doesn't allow a save, the mihstu is stunned for 1d4+2 rounds.
Description:
  - >-
    Mihstus are semi-solid creatures from the Plane of Air. They are found in
    cool, damp, dark areas such as ruins, dungeons, and underground caves and
    caverns. The mihstu can shape its body at will and almost always appears on
    the Material Plane as a cloud of swirling vapor. It can seep through small
    cracks and openings. When threatened, a mihstu forms four tentacles from its
    body. Each tentacle ends in a razor-sharp, barb-like talon. It slashes at
    its opponents using these tentacles. The mihstu can also engulf an opponent
    in its misty form. A mihstu's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons
    for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Credit The Mihstu originally
    appeared in the First Edition Monster Manual II (Â© TSR/Wizards of the Coast,
    1983) and is used by permission. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based
