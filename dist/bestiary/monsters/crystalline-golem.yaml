SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Crystalline Destruction (Ex)
    description: >-
      When reduced to 0 hit points, a crystal golem shatters in an explosion of
      jagged shards of rock. All creatures within a 10-foot burst take 3d6
      points of slashing damage and 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage; a DC 13
      Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A crystal golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance, with the exception of spells and spell-like abilities
      that have the sonic descriptor. In addition, certain spells and effects
      function differently against the creature, as noted: A transmute rock to
      mud spell slows a crystalline golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds,
      with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost
      hit points. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the golem's
      structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1
      full round.
Description:
  - >-
    Crystalline golems are man-shaped growths of crystal, animated by a powerful
    wizard and possessed of rudimentary intelligence. They attack by clubbing
    with their rock-like fists. These are comparably quite a weak form of golem,
    but the process of creating them is not as arduous as for the other sorts.
  - Construction
  - >-
    Crystalline golems are created out of fine quartz or other crystal weighing
    1,200 pounds, and worth 3,000 gp. The crystal is shaped into a man-size
    form, and infused with electricity to spark its animation.
