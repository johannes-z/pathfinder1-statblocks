Description:
  - >-
    Huecuva are the undead spirits of good clerics who were unfaithful to their
    god and turned to the path of evil before death. As punishment for their
    transgression, their god condemned them to roam the earth as the one
    creature all good-aligned clerics despise - undead. Huecuva resemble robed
    skeletons and are often mistaken for such creatures.
  - >-
    A huecuva attacks with its claws, raking and slashing at its opponents. It
    attacks relentlessly until either it or its opponent is dead. During combat,
    if a good-aligned cleric attempts to turn a huecuva and fails, the huecuva
    concentrates all attacks on that cleric, ignoring all other opponents until
    the cleric or the huecuva is dead.
  - >-
    A huecuva's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of
    overcoming damage reduction.
