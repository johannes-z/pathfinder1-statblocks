  This man-sized plant is deep green with trumpet-shaped flowers of red, yellow,
  and orange topping its stalks.
Source: Tome of Horrors Complete
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      The tri-flower frond can tip its yellow bloom over a slumbering or prone
      foe and shower it with sap laden with potent digestive enzymes. This sap
      does 1d6 points of acid damage per round to flesh until it is washed or
      scraped off.
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    description: >-
      Since a tri-flower frond looks like a normal flowering plant when at rest,
      it takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone
      with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills
      instead of Perception to notice the plant.
  - name: Fluid Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      Against a sleeping or helpless foe, a tri-flower frond can release a
      needle-sharp tendril from its red bloom that pierces its target and drains
      its body fluids. This deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round,
      and the victim is considered grappled.
  - name: Sleep Pollen (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature struck by one of the tri-flower frond's tendrils must make a DC
      13 Fortitude save or fall into a deep, coma-like slumber from which it
      cannot be awakened that lasts for 1-4 hours. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Resistances and immunities to poison apply against the
      pollen, but resistances or immunities to sleep effects do not. A
      slumbering victim can also be awakened by a successful DC 20 Heal check
      after one minute of treatment. A creature that falls victim to the sleep
      pollen is subject to the tri-flower frond's acid and fluid drain attacks,
      both as free actions.
Description:
  - >-
    Tri-flower fronds are carnivorous plants found in warm (and rarely
    temperate) forests. They are immobile creatures that reproduce by releasing
    seeds into the air and allowing either the wind (or creatures who happen to
    come into contact with them) to carry them wherever they go. Seeds take root
    once they touch the ground, and within a few months, a new tri-flower frond
    appears. These creatures are generally most active during the day and dine
    on fresh meat, having no preference as to the source. If a foe falls victim
    to its sleep poison, the tri-flower frond droops over the fallen foe,
    allowing its yellow bloom to drip a shower of caustic acid on the sleeping
    victim while it inserts a needle-like tendril from its red bloom into the
    victim's body and drains fluids. A tri-flower frond stands about 5 to 8 feet
    tall. While the orange, red, and yellow flower combination is the most
    common, other color combinations have been reported, including white, gray,
    and pearly silver-gray, and golden brown, deep brown and russet. Credit The
