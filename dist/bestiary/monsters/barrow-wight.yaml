SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoid creature that is slain by a barrow wight becomes a barrow
      wight itself in only 1d4 rounds. Spawn so created are less powerful than
      typical barrow wights, and suffer a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and
      checks, as well as -2 hp per HD. Spawn are under the command of the barrow
      wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which
      point they lose their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and
      freewilled barrow wights. They do not possess any of the abilities they
      had in life.
  - name: Resurrection Vulnerability (Su)
    description: >-
      A raise dead spell cast on a barrow wight destroys it (Will negates).
      Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.
Description:
  - >-
    Barrow wights are undead creatures akin to normal wights, but they are
    always found in or near barrows, usually guarding the treasure contained
    therein. They hate living creatures and attempt to destroy anyone who
    invades their resting place.
  - A barrow wight is a twisted, insane creature standing about 6 feet tall.
  - >-
    A barrow wight attempts to use its gaze attack on the closest creature to it
    when it is first encountered. Creatures not affected by its gaze are
    pummeled with its fists.
