Description:
  - >-
    Barrow wights are undead creatures akin to normal wights, but they are
    always found in or near barrows, usually guarding the treasure contained
    therein. They hate living creatures and attempt to destroy anyone who
    invades their resting place.
  - A barrow wight is a twisted, insane creature standing about 6 feet tall.
  - >-
    A barrow wight attempts to use its gaze attack on the closest creature to it
    when it is first encountered. Creatures not affected by its gaze are
    pummeled with its fists.
