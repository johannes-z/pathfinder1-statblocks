SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cold (Su)
    description: >-
      Hoar spirits generate intense cold. It deals an extra 1d3 points of cold
      damage with each claw attack. Creatures attacking a hoar spirit with
      unarmed or natural attacks take 1d3 points of cold damage each time they
      hit.
  - name: Glaciate (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by a hoar spirit's claw must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude
      save or by paralyzed by bone-numbing cold for 1d4+1 rounds and take 1
      point of Dexterity damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Heatsense (Ex)
    description: >-
      Hoar spirits can detect heat (such as that generated by living creatures)
      within 60 feet, including the heat of invisible creatures. It functions as
      blindsense in regards to any non-visible heat sources within its range.
Description:
  - >-
    Believed to be the spirits of humanoids that freeze to death either because
    of their own mistakes or because of some ritualistic exile into the icy
    wastes by their culture, hoar spirits haunt the icy wastelands of the world
    seeking warm-blooded living creatures in which to share their icy hell.
  - >-
    Hoar spirits are rarely encountered alone. Though they act independently and
    never communicate, something draws these creatures to each other.
  - >-
    Perhaps some semblances of their former lives or maybe like-minded creatures
    that share the same fate are drawn together. Sages have speculated this for
    ages.
  - >-
    Hoar spirits do not speak, and it is not known if they even understand any
    language at all. They have a distinctive low-pitched moan that sounds like a
    whistling wind blowing through ice and snow covered trees.
  - >-
    When confronted, a hoar spirit attacks with its claws attempting to freeze
    its foe. If facing multiple opponents, a hoar spirit blasts them with its
    cone of cold before engaging them with its claws. Creatures killed by a hoar
    spirit are dragged to its icy lair, kept on ice, and devoured at the
    monster's leisure.
