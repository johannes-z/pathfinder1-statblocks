  - >-
    Strix fiercely defend both land and air in their mountain territories.
    Deadly but wise, strix would prefer to live quietly amid the towers of
    Devil's Perch in Cheliax, yet time and tradition have taught them the
    wingless peoples of the shores and lowlands cannot be trusted, and that only
    fear and bloodshed will protect their homes. Fortunately, the strix excel in
    this regard. Strix have learned to hate humans. Although the source of this
    hatred is unclear to all but the strix, it most likely comes from centuries
    of bloody invasions into their lands, disastrous first encounters, or an
    even older grudge. On average, strix stand just over 6 feet tall, with males
    and females being roughly the same size. Sharply pointed ears, pupilless
    eyes, and slitted nostrils distinguish the race, though their 12-foot
    wingspans prove most distinctive. An adult strix weighs around 170 pounds.
    Most strix live to be about 40 years old, with the eldest reaching ages of
    up to 60. Strix Characters Strix are defined by their class levels-they do
