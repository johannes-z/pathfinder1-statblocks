Description_Visual: >-
  Every feather like a plate of shimmering armor and its beak the length and
  sharpness of a knight's lance, this towering, ibis-like bird looks to be
  sculpted from silver and brass. Standing upon long legs ending in powerful
  metallic talons, its beady eyes dart about voraciously.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Glare (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, in any area of normal or brighter light, a giant
      stymphalides can ruffle its metallic feathers in such a way as to dazzle
      all creatures nearby. Any creature within 30 feet must make a DC 19 or be
      blinded for 1d6 minutes. A creature can defend against this effect in the
      same way it would a gaze attack. This is a sight-based effect. The DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Wing Razors (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant stymphalides's metallic feathers are razor-sharp. In addition to
      being able to slash creatures with its wings as a melee attack, it may
      beat its wings, flinging two large, feathered shards at a single target.
      These wing razors deal 2d6 points of damage and cause bleed. A giant
      stymphalides can use this attack a number of time per day equal to its
      Constitution modifier.
Description:
  - >-
    Man-eating birds of prey, the rare creatures known as stymphalides stalk the
    arid plains and coastlines of Golarion in ravenous swarms, shredding
    warm-blooded animals and unwary travelers with their bladed feathers and
    dagger-like beaks. From a distance, stymphalides might easily be mistaken
    for cranes, ibises, or other longnecked birds, though in full sunlight their
    gleaming feathers and the haze of blood lingering from past meals are
    impossible to mistake. Peculiarly, the feathers and beak of a stymphalides
    are made of steel, similar to the metallic hide of a gorgon. The wings of
    stymphalides are as sharp as knives and often lacerate their prey as the
    birds swarm and beat their wings against their unfortunate victims' skin.
    Similarly, their beaks are supernaturally sharp and can pierce the tough
    hides of animal prey or the armor of those warriors foolish enough to hunt
    the creatures. Even if a victim of a stymphalides swarm's frenzied attacks
    manages to fend off the vicious creatures, the wounds caused by the birds
    continue to bleed long after being inflicted, and the victim often perishes
    from loss of blood before ever reaching help. Most stymphalides stand
    approximately 2-1/2 feet tall and weigh little more than 40 pounds. Although
    mean-tempered and territorial, lone stymphalides prove relatively harmless,
    thus traveling in swarms of several dozen, relying on strength of numbers to
    bring down large or dangerous prey. Many tales also tell of enormous breeds
    of these monstrous birds, powerful enough to prey upon wyverns. These giant
    stymphalides are said to grow up to 13 feet tall and weigh over 250 pounds,
    with wingspans reaching upward of 25 feet. Such gigantic stymphalides are
    rarely seen, preferring to lurk upon desolate cliffs or even amid harsh
    extraplanar realms. Ecology Unlike vultures and other birds of the deserts
    and plains, stymphalides do not scavenge carcasses, although they are not
    above driving away natural scavengers if a large, fresh kill looks
    particularly inviting. When traveling in flocks, stymphalides prove fearless
    predators, swooping in and swarming any creature that wanders into their
    territory. The birds actively hunt their prey, harrying and killing lone
    individuals or stragglers. The attacks of a stymphalides swarm often prove
    so vicious that the creatures can take to flight once they have wounded
    prey, wait for it to bleed to death, and return to pick the corpse clean.
    Stymphalides generally avoid attacking large groups of people, unless the
    birds have gathered in a particularly sizable flock. Stymphalides are not
    purely carnivorous. A lone stymphalides might resort to eating fruit and
    other plants if it is separated from its flock or food is scarce, and
    orchards and fields of crops have been devastated by stymphalides when great
    swarms of the birds, starving from overpopulation or lack of prey, migrate
    to new territories. Yet although the birds are omnivorous, they seem to
    prefer meat. Those plainsfolk or desert-dwellers whose livelihoods depend on
    livestock have learned to fear the sight of flocks of birds silhouetted
    against the sky, as herds of cattle and other grazing animals have been
    ravaged by their swarms. Habitat & Society Most swarms of stymphalides roost
    near watering holes, rivers, and coastal cliffs, preying upon unfortunate
    creatures desperate enough to seek food or water so near to the dangerous
    birds' nests. The nests of stymphalides are frequently made from the bones
    of the creatures' prey, piled into macabre ziggurats upon which entire
    flocks of the birds rest. Particularly large flocks of the birds construct
    enormous nests, and giant stymphalides can create towers visible for miles.
    When not at rest, flocks of the creatures soar high on warm currents of air,
    relying upon their keen eyesight to spot suitable prey far below. Because of
    their voracious appetites, flocks of stymphalides must claim a vast swath of
    territory to maintain their feeding habits. Stymphalides are fiercely
    territorial, and flocks of the birds frequently fight with one another in
    swooping aerial battles to determine possession of land. Fortunately for the
    folk of civilized lands, stymphalides rarely encroach upon areas well
    traveled by humanoids and other creatures clever enough to bring down one of
    these metal-winged avians. Among the people of the plains, the metallic
    birds are often regarded as nearly legendary creatures. Stymphalides breed
    at an astonishing rate, however, and overpopulation and exhaustion of game
    frequently force extraordinarily large and deadly groups of the creatures to
    band together in search of new lands and new prey to devour.
