  This figure would be the picture of elegance and refinement were it not for

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Droning Wings (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, when it flutters its wings as a standard action, a coloxus
      can create a mesmerizing display of color and a sound-dampening buzzing
      drone. All creatures within 30 feet that can see the coloxus must make a
      DC 24 Will save or be slowed for up to 6 rounds. Each subsequent round,
      the coloxus must take a swift action to maintain the effect or the effect
      ceases at the end of its turn. Additionally, the sound creates a buffer
      against sonic energy, granting the fly demon immunity to sonic attacks or
      effects while it continues to drone. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Siphon (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature bitten by a coloxus must make a DC 23 Fortitude save or take
      1d4 points of Charisma damage. A coloxus heals itself of 5 points of
      damage for every point of Charisma damage it deals. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Coloxus demons, known also as fly demons, resemble humans with the head of a
    fly and twin pairs of gossamer wings. Even their smallest movements and
    gestures seem infused with manic quickness and alertness. A coloxus prefers
    to wear opulent clothing and jewels that would rival the wealthiest nobility
    of any race. A coloxus is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.
  - >-
    Ironically-given their grotesque, insectile appearance-coloxus demons are
    demons of vanity. They are formed from the souls of narcissistic mortals
    responsible for disasters or tragedy through their careless self-absorption.
  - >-
    Despite their foul appearance, coloxus demons consider themselves cultured
    and elite. They are unusually patient and well mannered for demons, and as a
    result are often used as emissaries, diplomats, and negotiators by marilith
    generals, balors, and even demon lords. Even when facing hated foes, coloxus
    demons are the epitome of courtesy, but such manners are always a deceitful
    veneer, masking the creatures' efforts to gain the upper hand.
  - >-
    Evil mortal spellcasters are fond of conjuring coloxus demons for similar
    roles, but the monsters also work well as assassins. Even in this role, a
    coloxus is dignified and polite. Only when presented with a ref lection of
    itself does the normally civilized coloxus show its true demonic colors-any
    creature foolish enough to trick a coloxus into looking at a mirror finds
    herself the eternal foe of an insulted and scandalized demon.
