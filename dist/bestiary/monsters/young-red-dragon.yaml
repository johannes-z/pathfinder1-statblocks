SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fire Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      An adult red dragon is surrounded by an aura of intense heat. All
      creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of
      the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient
      dragon's damage increases to 2d6.
  - name: Incinerate (Su)
    description: >-
      A great wyrm red dragon can incinerate creatures in its fiery breath. A
      creature reduced to fewer than 0 hit points by its breath weapon must make
      a Fortitude save (using the breath weapon's DC). Failure indicates that
      the creature is reduced to ash. Creatures destroyed in this way can only
      be restored to life through true resurrection or similar magic.
  - name: Manipulate Flames (Su)
    description: >-
      An old or older red dragon can control any fire spell within 10 feet per
      age category of the dragon as a standard action. This ability allows it to
      move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability
      also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new
      placement must be one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 round following
      the use of this ability, the dragon can control any new fire spell cast
      within its area of control, as if it were the caster. It can make all
      decisions allowed to the caster, including canceling the spell if it so
      desires.
  - name: Melt Stone (Su)
    description: >-
      An ancient or older red dragon can use its breath weapon to melt rock at a
      range of 100 feet, affecting a 5-foot-radius area per age category. The
      area becomes lava to a depth of 1 foot. Any creature in contact with the
      lava takes 20d6 points of fire damage on the first round, 10d6 on the
      second, and none thereafter as the lava hardens and cools. If used on a
      wall or ceiling, treat this ability as an avalanche that deals fire
      damage.
  - name: Smoke Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A very young red dragon can see perfectly in smoky conditions (such as
      those created by pyrotechnics). Spell-Like

    that fall under its shadow.
