SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mind Thrust (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action up to three times a day, a neothelid can deliver a
      massive blast of mental energy at any one target within 60 feet,
      inflicting 15d10 points of damage. A successful DC 25 Will save negates
      the effect. This effect can only harm creatures with Intelligence scores.
      This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Psychic Crush (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action up to three times a day, a neothelid can attempt to
      crush the mind of a single creature within 60 feet. The target must make a
      DC 25 Will save or collapse, becoming unconscious and dying at -1 hit
      points. If the target succeeds on the save, it takes 6d6 points of damage
      and is sickened for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
  - name: Trace Teleport (Ex)
    description: >-
      A neothelid telepathically and reflexively learns the mental coordinates
      of the destination, of all creatures that teleport within 60 feet of it,
      gaining an awareness of the location equivalent to "seen casually." This
      knowledge fades and is lost after 1 minute. This power does not grant any
      environmental information about the conditions of the destination.
Description:
  - >-
    Dwelling only in the deepest reaches of the underworld, the immense
    neothelids once ruled empires in the depths, yet their numbers have been
    vastly reduced as other races have proven swifter to breed and adapt. Today,
    the neothelid is a legend, the subject of tales of horror among those few to
    have experienced the creature's wrath in person and lived to tell about it.
  - >-
    Neothelids are served by all manner of strange wormlike creatures, minions
    they use to observe and wage war against their enemies. The neothelids
    themselves were spawned by even more horrific entities, ageless horrors from
    strange dimensions beyond the edge of known reality-the neothelids see
    themselves as the chosen agents of these malevolent forces, working to ready
    the world for their return.
