SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immortal (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sprites are one of the few races that are truly immortal, never aging.
      They cannot die from natural causes. They still need to eat, sleep, and
      breathe, and can be killed normally.
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      A sprite is never at risk of poisoning itself when handling poison. They
      use sprite poison on their arrows.
  - name: Speak with Animals (Su)
    description: >-
      Sprites can communicate with animals as the spell of the same name. This
      innate supernatural ability is always active and cannot be negated or
      dispelled.
Description:
  - >-
    A reclusive folk, sprites live in meadows and woodland glens, where they
    have appointed themselves the monitors of their lands. They stand about 2
    feet tall and fly by means of their tiny diaphanous wings. Sprites have very
    delicate features with tiny, upturned noses and large pointed ears. Their
    eyes sparkle like moonlight on a forest lake, and their tiny, high-pitched
    voices sound almost like music.
  - >-
    Sprites are shy and reclusive, avoiding contact with other races; only
    druids have regular contact with sprites, and indeed many druids get their
    training from sprites. However, sprites detest evil and attack it on sight
    with their weapons, preferring to strike from ambush while invisible. If
    possible, they render their victim unconscious using their envenomed arrows,
    then spirit the creature away to some remote location where it is placed
    without weapons or gear and left to fend for itself. Creatures that have
    demonstrated especially evil characteristics may be slain outright, however.
  - >-
    Unlike their pixie cousins, sprites are not especially mischievous by
    nature, and prefer to be left alone.

    Sprite Poison: Type injury; save DC 15; frequency 1/ min. for 2 min.; effect
    unconscious 1 minute/ 2d4 hours; cure 1 save.

    Sea Sprite Sea sprites are the aquatic version of normal sprites. As their
    name implies, they are joyful fey who dwell in the sea. Their hair resembles
    strands of seaweed and they have large, fish-like eyes. The skin of a sea
    sprite is pale blue. Lacking wings, sea sprites cannot fly, but thanks to
    fine webbing in their fingers and toes they are adept swimmers. Sea sprites
    can breathe both air and water without difficulty. Like normal sprites, sea
    sprites make use of special ammunition that put their opponents to sleep.
  - >-
    Sea sprites have the same statistics as their land-dwelling brethren, with
    the following exceptions: They have the aquatic and amphibious subtypes;
    they do not have a fly speed but have a swim speed of 30 feet, and their
    Swim score is +12 (Swim score is based on their Dexterity, not their
    Strength). They employ crossbows rather than shortbows, and prefer spears
    over short swords.
