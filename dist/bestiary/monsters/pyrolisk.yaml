SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Conflagration Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Burst into flames for 4d8 damage, range 30 feet, Fortitude DC 12 half. The
      flames burst from within the target creature and immediately burn out, so
      there is no continuing damage or burn effect. A creature that successfully
      saves cannot be affected again by the same pyrolisk's conflagration gaze
      for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Pyrotechnics (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round, a pyrolisk can cause an ordinary fire to burst into a
      shower of flashes, sparks, and bursts of light (as pyrotechnics, fireworks
      version only). Will DC 12 to negate the blindness. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The pyrolisk resembles a cockatrice and is often mistaken for it (Spot check
    at DC 25 to identify the pyrolisk successfully). The difference lies in the
    coloration of its tail feathers and wings: the pyrolisk has a single red
    feather in its tail and a reddish tinge to its wings. Otherwise, it is
    identical to the cockatrice in appearance.
  - >-
    The pyrolisk uses its gaze attack to ignite those that are unaffected by the
    blinding flash of its pyrotechnic ability. It is a fierce combatant,
    fighting until either it or its opponents are dead.
