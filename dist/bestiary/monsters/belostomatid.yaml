SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Digestive Enzymes (Ex)
    description: >-
      A belostomatid injects a corrosive enzyme into its prey that both
      paralyzes and liquefies flesh. A creature struck by the belostomatid's
      piercing bite must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for
      1d4 rounds. For every round the creature is paralyzed it takes 1d2 points
      of Constitution damage.
  - name: Hold Breath (Ex)
    description: >-
      A belostomatid can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times
      its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
Description:
  - >-
    The belostomatid is the monstrous form of its diminutive counterpart, a
    5-inch-long "giant" water bug commonly known as a "toe-biter." A monstrous
    belostomatid has a flattened, oval-shaped body measuring 12 feet long, and
    four rear, oarlike legs, which it uses to thrust through the water. The
    belostomatid's front two legs are thick and end in sharp, single-tipped
    claws, which it uses to slay its prey. Two large black eyes are mounted on
    each side of the creature's rostrum, and it uses its 2-foot-long, beaklike
    proboscis to inject its deadly acidic enzymes into its victims.
  - >-
    Belostomatids are ambush predators. They hide amid floating snags and piles
    of debris in still and slow-moving waters, seamlessly blending in with their
    surroundings despite their size. With a powerful surge forward, a
    belostomatid grabs its prey, thrusts its rostrum deep into the prey's body,
    and begins pumping a paralyzing digestive enzyme into its prey, dissolving
    it from the inside out.
