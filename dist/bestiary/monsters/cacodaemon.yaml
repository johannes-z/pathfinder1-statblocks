SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alter Self (Su)
    description: >-
      A cacodaemon can assume the shape of any Small or Medium humanoid as a
      standard action. This supernatural ability works like alter self (CL
      12th), but the cacodaemon can remain in the chosen form indefinitely. It
      can assume a new form as a standard action or return to its own as a free
      action.
Description:
  - >-
    The dreaded and feared cacodaemons are employed as guards and soldiers in
    the Oinodaemon's palace. A select few are used as the Oinodaemon's personal
    assassins and can be found wandering the planes (usually on a mission for
    the Oinodaemon). Cacodaemons are completely loyal to the Oinodaemon and
    never question their position or authority; they do not take orders from any
    other daemon. Even the mighty arcanadaemons hold no power over the
    cacodaemons. A cacodaemon stands about 7 feet tall and weighs about 800
    pounds. Cacodaemons are relentless combatants and never back down from a
    fight. They often begin combat by changing forms and appearing as a race
    friendly to their potential opponents. Once an opponent is lured close to
    the cacodaemon, it changes to its natural form and attacks. Opponents are
    first subjected to the cacodaemon's hold person ability and those affected
    are usually killed rather quickly. A cacodaemon does not hesitate to summon
    other daemons to its aid if needed. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
