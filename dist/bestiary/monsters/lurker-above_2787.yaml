    description: >-
      When a lurker above grapples a target, it forms an airtight seal around
      its prey. A grappled target cannot speak or cast spells with verbal
      components and must hold its breath (see the suffocation rules in the
      Pathfinder Core Rulebook).
Description:
  - >-
    The lurker above is a subterranean carnivore that preys on any living
    creatures that enter its territory. These creatures are extremely
    territorial and are never encountered with others of their kind. Mating
    habits among lurkers is unknown to sages as no two of these creatures have
    ever been encountered together. A typical lurker above has a hunting
    territory of several square miles. A lurker above waits for its prey,
    clinging to the ceiling, roof, or other such overhang. When prey passes
    beneath it, the lurker above drops from its hiding place and wraps itself
    around its prey. Lurker Below The lurker below is an aquatic variety of
    lurker above that makes its lair in any body of water and in any climate
    (though it rarely lairs in extremely cold climates). Lurkers below are pale
    blue or black in color and are often mistaken for giant manta rays. Lurkers
    below cannot fly, but have a swim speed of 40 feet. They are otherwise
    identical to their landbased counterparts detailed above. Credit The Lurker
