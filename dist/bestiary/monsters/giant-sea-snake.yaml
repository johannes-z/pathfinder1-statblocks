Description:
  - >-
    The giant sea snake is one of the biggest reasons many sailors of the
    Shackles have a downright visceral and phobic response to the thought of
    falling overboard. These patient predators are known to follow sailing
    ships, swimming just below the surface of the water while they wait for the
    opportunity to strike at any unfortunate crew members who might fall over
    the side. Particularly hungry giant sea snakes have been known to climb the
    side of a vessel and snatch unwary sailors right from the deck.
  - >-
    Giant sea snakes typically reach up to 30 feet in length and weigh 500
    pounds.
