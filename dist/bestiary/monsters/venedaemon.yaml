Description_Visual: >-
  Silken robes drape this androgynous fiend's form, providing only an outline of
  the body beneath. Claw-tipped tentacles emerge from the cuffs, clutching wands
  and soul gems, while below its robe's margins, its multiple-jointed
  legs-almost like a reptilian insect's-end in clawed, three-toed chitinous
  feet. Its face remains perpetually covered by a dark veil, and a trio of long,
  forked tongues periodically emerges from its rounded mouth and tastes the air
  around its thin lips.

      A venedaemon may consume a held soul gem as a swift action, allowing it to
      cast any of its spells known without using a spell slot. For the daemon to
      use this ability, the consumed gem must contain the soul of a creature
      with Hit Dice equal to or greater than the spell level of the desired
      spell.
Description:
  - >-
    The venedaemon personifies death by magic, and so possesses an inborn talent
    for all manner of sorcery. As hungry for souls as any other member of its
    daemonic brethren, the venedaemon thirsts equally for intangible wealth
    through the acquisition of knowledge, so that it can best utilize the arcane
    magic lurking within its blood. In particular, venedaemons yearn for the
    secrets and magical lore held within the bindings of wizards' tomes, knowing
    that these arcane formulae are the key to unlocking their mysterious powers.
    In the process of acquiring such tomes of knowledge, venedaemons invariably
    come across other forms of information- whether it be info regarding a rival
    daemon's weaknesses, lore that hints at a wealth of unclaimed souls hidden
    in one of Abaddon's vast caverns, or a rumor of some hidden and terrible
    source of daemonic power-that they can make use of in trading with other
    daemons. These rumors and smatterings of advice can be sold to other daemons
    for captured souls, and the trade often goes both ways, as venedaemons are
    also inclined to trade their hard-earned soul gems for tomes of magic other
    fiends may have chanced upon.
  - >-
    In addition to its myriad magical abilities as a daemon, a venedaemon casts
    spells like a sorcerer with a caster level equal to its Hit Dice. A
    venedaemon can gain additional levels as a sorcerer in order to bolster its
    arcane powers, in which case it gains a bloodline (usually Abyssal or
    Infernal) as well as a sorcerer's other class features and special
    abilities.

    Venedaemons are gaunt, and despite standing close to 7 feet tall, they
    rarely weigh more than 150 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Like all mundane daemons, venedaemons most often form from the hunted,
    specifically from those evil souls who died as a result of the abuse of
    magic-whether by their own greedy hands, at the whim of powerful rivals,
    through the inadvisable pursuit of knowledge too terrible for them to safely
    handle, or by other spellcasters who slew them for their crimes. While these
    hunted were often spellcasters themselves, some venedaemons develop from
    nonmagical souls that were simply casualties to arcane violence. These
    individuals are often so tainted with the magical disturbances that killed
    them that they nonetheless develop arcane powers in an ironic twist of
    daemonic evolution. Other times still, venedaemons formulate from much odder
    means.
  - >-
    Occasionally, mortal wizards seek to control the awe-inspiring forces of
    Abaddon and its daemons by using cacodaemon as familiars. The cacodaemon,
    for its part, is usually willing to serve a mortal master for a time in this
    regard, though it usually has ulterior motives for its servitude. When a
    cacodaemon familiar's master dies, the daemon is often prompt in devouring
    the mage's soul and turning the soul into a soul gem. Instead of the soul
    gem returning to Abaddon and being consumed by a more powerful daemon,
    sometimes the deceased mage's power triggers a reaction within the
    cacodaemon, fusing with it and transforming the familiar over several weeks
    or months into a new creature, typically a venedaemon with no memories of
    its mortal or previous daemonic existence. Far from being a hazard, this
    possibility of transformation is in fact one of the primary reasons why
    cacodaemons are sometimes eager to serve as familiars, as it represents one
    of the only ways for a cacodaemon to advance its station.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Most venedaemons are relatively weak compared to the towering daemonic
    brethren that inhabit Abaddon, and knowing this, they often work together as
    best they can, collaborating in groups with other venedaemons, or in
    conjunction with other fiends willing to accept their services. Hurled into
    Abaddon with an innate talent for magic but only scraps of its mortal
    knowledge remaining, the average venedaemon ultimately flocks to the service
    of a more powerful daemon willing to act as a patron that lets the
    venedaemon pursue its studies. In such arrangements, the venedaemon slowly
    gains power and inf luence within the confines of its daemonic partnership,
    which often consists of itself, its daemonic master, and many other daemons
    acting as a team built on the shared goal of total mortal annihilation. This
    daemonic horde traverses planes searching for opportunities to create mass
    destruction, the master simply using the venedaemon for its magical
    qualities to slaughter mortal souls. As the venedaemon gleans what it can
    from the charred remains of dead mortal spellcasters' volumes of scribbled
    formulae, it gradually strengthens its unspeakable powers, and in time, the
    tables are turned, and when the venedaemon slays its patron, it gains
    dominion over dark magic as well as its brethren. Those venedaemons who do
    not wish to submit to the will of a more powerful daemon in order to pursue
    knowledge often simply prefer to be left alone to their research,
    experimenting on mortals with their dark arts and occasionally selling their
    findings to other daemons for souls and magical artifacts.
  - >-
    Venedaemons find themselves aligned with the lesser fiends of Abaddon,
    particularly the equally lowly ceustodaemons, whose deathly association with
    the energies and particularly subservient standing among daemons makes the
    two obvious allies. Cacodaemons also make for suitable alliances, as a
    venedaemon may help guide its smaller brethren to capture the soul of an
    opposing spellcaster, allowing the cacodaemon to mature with the soul and in
    time develop into a fellow venedaemon. Within the realm of Abaddon,
    venedaemons gravitate toward the River Styx for its mysterious,
    memory-wiping properties, for many venedaemons themselves find a peculiar
    yearning for their memories, if only to regain even more of the power they
    once possessed, somewhere in the dark recesses of their mind.
