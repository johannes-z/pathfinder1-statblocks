SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Crystal Breath (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, as a standard action, a caterprism can spew forth a
      crystalline silk-like substance in a cone to a range of 20 feet. The
      substance instantly solidifies to a rock-like hardness, forming
      needlesharp spears of crystal that impale those in the area and deal 3d6
      points of piercing damage. A DC 17 Reflex save halves the damage. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Crystalline Mandibles (Ex)
    description: >-
      The mandibles of a caterprism are so sharp that they can bite through
      nearly anything. The bite attack of a caterprism is treated like a touch
      attack; i.e., it ignores any armor bonus. Further, the bite of a
      caterprism is considered to have the vorpal special quality, and on a
      successful critical hit with its bite attack, the caterprism severs the
      head of its opponent.
Description:
  - >-
    A caterprism is from the Elemental Plane of Earth. It resembles a
    caterpillar made of crystal with hexagonal body segments and twelve sharply
    angled legs. Each body segment is about 2 feet long and contains a single
    pair of legs. The head of a caterprism is caterpillar-like, with large
    faceted eyes and huge mandibles.
  - >-
    Although caterprisms prefer to consume the rich minerals of their home
    plane, they sometimes wander through natural portals into the Material
    Plane. There, they create long, winding tunnels as they eat their way
    through the solid rock. Dwarves have been known to bring caterprisms under
    some degree of control, using them to help carve out new mines and dwelling
    places.
  - >-
    If it feels threatened, a caterprism's first action is to shoot at its
    opponents with its crystalline silk-like secretions. It then closes to bite,
    or rears up and stabs at opponents with the first four of its razor sharp
    legs.
  - >-
    A caterprism can eat through 1 foot of solid stone per minute, leaving
    behind a permanent tunnel 5 feet in diameter.
