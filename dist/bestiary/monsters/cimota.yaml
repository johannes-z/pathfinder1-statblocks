SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Displacement (Su)
    description: >-
      Cimota manifest on the Prime Material Plane as a shifting cloud of shadows
      that coalesce into their cloaked and hooded forms. On any round that a
      cimota first manifests (see below), its shifting forms affect it as a
      displacement spell. Attacks on a cimota at this time have a 50% miss
      chance as if the cimota had total concealment. Unlike actual total
      concealment, this displacement does not prevent enemies from targeting a
      cimota normally. This effect is canceled one round after a cimota
      manifests, or if a cimota takes any action in its new locale.
  - name: Lifesense (Su)
    description: >-
      A cimota notices and locates living creatures within 60 ft., just as if it
      possessed the blindsight ability.
  - name: Manifestation (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a cimota can transport itself via planar travel from
      any point on the Prime Material Plane to another point within its defined
      area, or within 300 ft. of the artifact to which it is bound. A cimota may
      also lurk on the Negative Material Plane, prepared to manifest on the
      Prime Material if certain conditions are met, such as trespassers entering
      the area they are doomed to guard. A cimota cannot attack or move in the
      same round in which it manifests, although it may manifest as partial
      surprise action before initiative. A cimota benefits from displacement
      (see above) on the round in which it first manifests.
  - name: Unholy Existence (Su)
    description: >-
      Although it is possible to temporarily destroy a cimota's physical form,
      it will return in 1d6 days, manifesting again to continue its unholy
      existence. The only way to permanently destroy a cimota is to disrupt its
      existence by consecrating the ground to which it is tied or the
      destruction of the artifact to which it is bound. Sometimes, significant
      alteration of an unholy place, such as demolition of an evil temple or
      burning a haunted forest, could cause cimota to fade away permanently.
      Although their physical forms may be damaged by normal attacks, their
      unholy existence grants them SR 17. Because cimota exist partially on the
      Negative Material Plane they are subject to banishment or other spells
      that affect outsiders.
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Animals do not willingly approach within 30 ft. of a cimota unless a
      master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. This aura
      takes effect when a cimota manifests on the Prime Material Plane. Animals
      that come within 30 ft. of a place where cimota are lurking on the
      Negative Material Plane, or an artifact to which a cimota is bound; Will
      be uneasy and show signs of disquiet.
Description:
  - >-
    Cimota are the physical manifestations of evil thoughts and actions. They
    exist on the Negative Material Plane, manifesting in the Prime Material as
    cloaked figures. Their existence is always tied to a specific area or
    artifact that is imbued with ancient and highly malevolent evil. A cimota is
    able to manifest itself anywhere within an accursed locale that has given it
    life, or within 300 feet of an evil artifact to which it is attached.
  - >-
    The physical form of a cimota is a floating figure in a monk's cassock.
    Green eyes glow deep within their raised cowls, but their bodies are
    entirely invisible. See invisibility, true sight, or some similar ability to
    see invisible objects will reveal a ghostly, black human figure within the
    cimota's cloak. Cimota are manifestations of evil that may be touched like
    any other creature. They take damage from normal weapons. Their unnatural
    existence allows them to fly on the Prime Material Plane just like an
    incorporeal creature, except that they cannot pass through solid objects.
    When a cimota is destroyed in combat only a few shreds of tattered black
    cloth remain to show that they ever existed.
  - >-
    Cimota are bound to repeat the evil thoughts and actions that created them.
    When they manifest they will endlessly repeat the deeds that spawned them.
    So, for instance, a group of cimota may haunt a ruined temple, re-enacting
    evil rituals. Cimota may guard an unholy site such as a city, forest or
    building. They will fight to the death to defend these places. Cimota who
    are bound to an artifact may act out the intentions of that artifact. A
    cimota might follow the owner of an artifact, for instance, slaying the
    owner's friends and associates while keeping its existence a secret. Within
    the parameters of their creation, cimota are capable of strategy, deception
    and intelligent tactics.
  - >-
    Cimota are created by evil energy. Their supernatural nature gives them the
    ability to fight with two fists or two weapons without penalty, each attack
    landing with the force and accuracy of a single weapon attack. Cimota
    attacks are either a rake of invisible claws or a blow from a fist. They are
    capable of delivering slashing or bludgeoning blows as needed.
  - >-
    Cimota are capable of speaking Common and Infernal. Their voices are either
    hollow, ringing and unnatural, or malevolent whispers. Most often cimota use
    their voices to chant or to shout out dire condemnations at intruders. They
    do not parley and they never negotiate unless it is to deceive mortals to
    their deaths.
