SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Deflective Wings (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an angelic guardian can spread its wings and protect
      a single adjacent creature from the next ranged attack. The next time the
      protected creature would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged
      attack, the attack is instead deflected and the protected creature takes
      no damage. An angelic guardian can only deflect one ranged attack per turn
      in this way. This effect lasts until the angelic guardian's next turn or
      until the protected creature leaves its square, whichever comes first.
  - name: Metallic Feathers (Ex)
    description: >-
      An angelic guardian's wings are honed to razor-sharp edges, and attacks
      with them deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.
Description:

    Those toiling in the Golemworks of Magnimar provide myriad goods to their
    buyers, but perhaps none are so popular as the highly sought-after angelic
    guardian. Nobles, entrepreneurs, and wealthy paranoiacs alike purchase
    angelic guardians to serve as their personal protectors. Though inspired by
    Varisian depictions of angelic beings, these metallic beings are not truly
    from another plane, but are instead merely stylized automatons designed to
    watch over and protect their masters. They can be found throughout much of
    the Summit, where they line aristocrats' gardens and stand stoically for
    days or even weeks without moving, their burning halos the only feature
    suggestive of animation.

    Angelic guardians can be forged from various substances, though their bodies
    are typically made from brass and their wings from steel. Angelic guardians
    stand nearly 7 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds.
