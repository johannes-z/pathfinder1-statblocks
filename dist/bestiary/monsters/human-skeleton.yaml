Description:
  - >-
    Skeletons are the animated bones of the dead, brought to unlife through foul
    magic. While most skeletons are mindless automatons, they still possess an
    evil cunning imparted to them by their animating force-a cunning that allows
    them to wield weapons and wear armor. Creating a Skeleton "Skeleton" is an
    acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than an
    undead) that has a skeletal system (referred to hereafter as the base
    creature). Challenge Rating: Depends on Hit Dice, as follows: HD CR XP 1/2
    1/6 65 1 1/3 135 2-3 1 400 4-5 2 600 6-7 3 800 8-9 4 1,200 10-11 5 1,600
    12-14 6 2,400 15-17 7 3,200 18-20 8 4,800 Alignment: Always neutral evil.
    Type: The creature's type changes to undead. It retains any subtype except
    for alignment subtypes (such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind (such
    as giant). It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base
    creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. Armor
    Class: Natural armor bonus changes as follows: Skeleton Size N atural Armor
    Bonus Tiny or smaller +0 Small +1 Medium or Large +2 Huge +3 Gargantuan +6
    Colossal +10 Hit Dice: A skeleton drops any HD gained from class levels and
    changes racial HD to d8s. Creatures without racial HD are treated as if they
    have 1 racial HD. If the creature has more than 20 Hit Dice, it can't be
    made into a skeleton by the animate dead spell. A skeleton uses its Cha
    modifier (instead of its Con modifier) to determine bonus hit points. Saves:
    Base save bonuses are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD + 2.
    Defensive Abilities: A skeleton loses the base creature's defensive
    abilities and gains DR 5/bludgeoning and immunity to cold. It also gains all
    of the standard immunities and traits possessed by undead creatures. Speed:
    A winged skeleton can't use its wings to fly. If the base creature flew
    magically, so can the skeleton. All other movement types are retained.
    Attacks: A skeleton retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon
    attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature, except for attacks
    that can't work without flesh. A creature with hands gains one claw attack
    per hand; the skeleton can strike with each of its claw attacks at its full
    attack bonus. A claw attack deals damage depending on the skeleton's size
    (see pages 301-302). If the base creature already had claw attacks with its
    hands, use the skeleton claw damage only if it's better. Special Attacks: A
    skeleton retains none of the base creature's special attacks. Abilities: A
    skeleton's Dexterity increases by +2. It has no Constitution or Intelligence
    score, and its Wisdom and Charisma scores change to 10. BAB: A skeleton's
    base attack bonus is equal to 3/4 of its Hit Dice. Skills: A skeleton loses
    all skill ranks possessed by the base creature and gains none of its own.
    Feats: A skeleton loses all feats possessed by the base creature and gains
    Improved Initiative as a bonus feat. Special Qualities: A skeleton loses
    most special qualities of the base creature. It retains any extraordinary
    special qualities that improve its melee or ranged attacks. Environment:
    Any, usually the same as base creature. Organization: Any. Treasure:
    Generally none, although sometimes a skeleton's creator arms it with magical
    armor or weapons. Variant Skeletons Numerous variant skeletons exist, such
    as those whose bones burn with an unending fire and those who drip with gore
    and reassemble themselves over time. Both of these variant skeletons can be
    created using animate dead, but they count as twice their normal number of
    Hit Dice per casting. Once controlled, they count normally against the
    controller's limit. Perhaps the most dangerous variant skeleton, though, is
    the skeletal champion. This skeleton retains its intellect, and often any
    class levels it possessed in life. A skeletal champion cannot be created
    with animate dead-these potent undead only arise under rare conditions
    similar to those that cause the manifestation of ghosts or via rare and
    highly evil rituals. Each of the following skeleton types modifies the base
    skeleton in a few key ways. Except as noted, these variations can be stacked
    with one another-it's possible to have a bloody burning skeletal champion.
    Bloody Skeleton A bloody skeleton is coated in a slick layer of blood and
    gore infused with negative energy. This gore allows the skeleton to reform
    and heal itself. In addition to the changes for the skeleton template, make
    the following adjustments to the base creature. Challenge Rating: As a
    normal skeleton + 1. Fast Healing: A bloody skeleton has fast healing equal
    to 1 per 2 Hit Dice it possesses (minimum 1). Saves: A bloody skeleton gains
    channel resistance +4. Abilities: A bloody skeleton's Charisma is 14.
    Special Qualities: A bloody skeleton gains the deathless special quality.
    Deathless (Su): A bloody skeleton is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points,
    but it returns to unlife 1 hour later at 1 hit point, allowing its fast
    healing thereafter to resume healing it. A bloody skeleton can be
    permanently destroyed if it is destroyed by positive energy, if it is
    reduced to 0 hit points in the area of a bless or hallow spell, or if its
    remains are sprinkled with a vial of holy water. Burning Skeleton A burning
    skeleton is surrounded by an aura of flames that deals fire damage to those
    it strikes. In addition to the changes for the skeleton template, make the
    following adjustments to the base creature. Challenge Rating: As a normal
    skeleton + 1. Aura: Burning skeletons possess a fiery aura. Fiery Aura (Ex):
    Creatures adjacent to a burning skeleton take 1d6 points of fire damage at
    the start of their turn. Anyone striking a burning skeleton with an unarmed
    strike or natural attack takes 1d6 points of fire damage. Defensive
    Abilities: Burning skeletons lose their immunity to cold but gain immunity
    to fire. A burning skeleton gains vulnerability to cold damage. Melee
    Attacks: A burning skeleton's melee attacks (including both those made with
    a natural weapon and those made with a manufactured weapon) deal an
    additional 1d6 points of fire damage. Abilities: A burning skeleton's
    Charisma is 12. Special Qualities: A burning skeleton gains fiery death.
    Fiery Death (Su): A burning skeleton explodes into a burst of flame when it
    dies. Anyone adjacent to the skeleton when it is destroyed takes 1d6 points
    of fire damage per 2 Hit Dice the skeleton possessed (minimum 1d6). A Ref
    lex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the skeleton's Hit Dice + the skeleton's Cha bonus)
    halves this damage.
