SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Manipulate Path (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a dosojin can alter the structure and stability of
      its ward, making travel along its road or trail either easier or harder
      for specific groups of travelers. Helping travelers in this way makes a
      dosojin's ward sturdier and more straightforward, allowing creatures to
      reach their destination in half the time they would normally take (though
      this does not grant a bonus to creatures' movement speeds in combat). If a
      dosojin instead chooses to hinder travelers, it creates unexpected twists
      and turns within its ward, turning the path into difficult terrain and so
      causing travelers to take twice as long as they normally would to reach
      their destination. These effects last as long as the targets stay within
      the boundaries of the dosojin's ward.
  - name: Mimic Statue (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a dosojin can assume the appearance of any
      Medium-sized statue, such as a stone marker, a religious icon, or a
      sculpture carved into the side of a cliff. A dosojin's body is hard and
      has the texture of rough stone no matter what appearance it takes. A
      dosojin gains a +20 racial bonus on Disguise checks when imitating a
      statue in this manner.
Description:
  - >-
    Dosojins are kami that take the form of stone icons and watch over roads and
    trails. They are often found in statue form at the edges of villages, along
    mountain passes, at the beginnings of tunnels and other major
  - >-
    works of roadway construction, or at simple country crossroads. In urban
    areas, dosojins can sometimes be found on street corners and near bridges.
    They serve as the guardians of travelers, keeping the malicious and
    malevolent off the paths they diligently watch over. Wise travelers know to
    seek a dosojin's blessing before traveling upon its ward, for falling out of
    favor with the kami of travel is a sure way to become lost or hampered.
    Pious mortal couples also seek out dosojin for their own reasons, as the
    kami are often regarded as patrons of fertility, and are known for their
    habit of choosing mates and standing beside one another for their entire
    lives. In many regions, the blessing of a dosojin is believed to ensure a
    long and happy marriage, as well as many healthy children.
  - >-
    The average dosojin stands about 4-1/2 feet tall and weighs upward of 400
    pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    As creatures that symbolize travel and connections, dosojins straddle the
    line between the lands of the civilized and the wild, often with one foot
    literally in each. Dosojins spend most of their time guarding their chosen
    sites in the form of nondescript statues and way markers, meditating
    motionlessly for seasons at a time. While semi-social dosojins within cities
    and other settlements are not uncommon, the majority of these kami stand
    along remote and secluded roads, going to great lengths to ensure that their
    true identity is not known. It is not uncommon for dosojins to create false
    duplicates of themselves using their stone shape ability, and these
    misleading markers inspire a certain amount of faith among those who look
    out for the kami of roads, as one can rarely tell if a sculpture is a
    dosojin by looks alone. A dosojin requires no sustenance, but it is not
    uncommon for travelers to leave offerings for a silent watcher, usually
    tributes of fruits, nuts, and potables, gifts that the kami gladly shares
    with hungry travelers, happy to inspire such good faith among passersby and
    to foster a system of give-and-take between strangers.
  - >-
    Dosojins are fond of the creatures that traverse their roads and trails, and
    maintain the roadways they guard to ensure both the ward's survival and the
    safe travel of the voyagers that traverse it. Though they have an aff inity
    for the creatures that constructed their roadways, dosojins still protect
    their wards with the aggressive righteousness typical of all kami, and
    scarcely hesitate when faced with an oni or other evildoer seeking to
    disrupt the balance. Dosojin have little patience for those who litter on
    their roadways or unnecessarily obstruct the paths, and they take it upon
    themselves to discipline those they deem worthy of punishment. Rarely
    violent in an overt sense, dosojins
  - >-
    prefer to use their magic in order to trick travelers into becoming lost,
    letting the wilds they travel through become the primary instruments of
    their demise. Dosojins prove quite deadly to those who fail to show kami
    proper respect, as they use their powers of illusion to lead troublesome
    caravans into impassible ravines and destructive oni onto unsound, derelict
    bridges.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Dosojins are odd among kami in that they are known to select mates from
    among their own kind, and it is not uncommon to see two seemingly redundant
    statues standing next to one another near a trailhead or fork in the road.
    While they do not reproduce in any typical sense of the word, dosojins are
    nonetheless sought out by mortal couples hoping to conceive, as many people
    see the kami as symbols of fertility. However, most scholars agree that
    dosojins do not collaborate in this way to foster fecundity, but rather act
    as symbols of camaraderie and companionship for travelers on their roads,
    encouraging teamwork and cooperation among groups of diverse individuals
    with a shared goal.
  - >-
    While most dosojins are content to watch over particular highways or roads
    for their entire existences and act as helpful guardians for most passersby,
    some choose instead to act as appraisers of travelers' skills and bravery.
    Cunning individuals that indulge in acts of trickery more often than their
    tamer brethren, these rogue dosojins craft obstacles and trials for
    travelers they deem worthy of the challenge. The tests are not meant to
    substantially impede voyagers, and are simply forms of innocent fun that a
    dosojin uses to gauge the strength and resolve of various wayfarers. Those
    who surpass a dosojin's challenges (which usually take the form of puzzles
    or illusions) earn the kami's respect and the assurance of safe travel
    throughout the rest of its domain, while those who avoid the obstacle or
    overcome it through brutish and witless means garner only scorn. Careful
    travelers know to watch out for the statuelike kami when making their way
    along potentially protected roads, as the guardians expect voyagers to act
    honorably and respectfully while travelling upon their paths. Some of the
    most important mandates to keep in mind when interacting with dosojin and
    walking through their territories are as follows.
  - • Mortals who respect the land and its laws shall know no harm.
  - >-
    • Mortals who fail to show proper reverence for tradition shall not pass by
    a dosojin upon the first attempt.
  - • Mortals who actively harm the natural world shall be cursed to wander it.
  - >-
    • Mortals who stray from a dosojin's path to do harm should not expect to
    find that path ever again.
