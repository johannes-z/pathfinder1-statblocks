      Skulks can pass through forest and subterranean settings almost without a
      trace. Add +10 to the DC to track a skulk in these environments.

    description: >-
      A skulk's racial bonus to Stealth comes from his ability to change the
      color of his skin to match his surroundings, even complex or regular
      patterns like bricks and mortar. A skulk loses this conditional bonus if
      he is wearing armor, or if he wears any clothing that covers more than
      one-quarter of his body, as skulks can only change their own flesh, not
      things they carry. A skulk normally conceals small items behind his body;
      by putting his back to a wall and changing his front half, he can hide the
      item because observers don't have line of sight to the item.
Description:
  - >-
    Skulks are a race of cowardly and lazy humanoids that live on the fringes of
    society, stealing what they need and doing what they must-even committing
    casual murder-to survive. Their unabashed cowardice is perhaps their most
    widely known trait, but skulks don't see themselves as particularly craven.
    Instead, they view their dishonorable behaviors as the most expedient method
    of survival.
  - >-
    They hate most other humanoids, viewing them as lazy and foolish, and think
    nothing of sneaking into a home, killing all the residents, and burglarizing
    what they can carry off without getting caught.
  - >-
    Skulks travel in small groups, rarely forming tribes of more than 16, for in
    larger groups bickering quickly leads to violent infighting. Murder between
    skulks is not uncommon, but they understand safety in numbers, and most
    frown upon treason within a group that is already relatively small,
    punishing traitors with a quick death. When possible, they set up camps in
    discreet spots near other settlements, commonly inhabiting sewers, caves, or
    forests-though their unsavory, murderous tactics often force them to
    relocate before local law enforcement, quickly alerted to their presence
    once the remains of a family of victims are discovered, finds them.
  - >-
    Skulks are roughly the same size as a human, averaging 6 feet tall, though
    they are significantly more gangly and nimble, and commonly weigh only 140
    pounds.
  - >-
    Skinny arms and legs help them sneak around obstacles and squeeze into
    narrow spaces. Skulks can live up to 50 years, though most die from violence
    long before that. Although skulks have racial Hit Dice, they generally
    advance in power by taking class levels. Rogue is a favorite choice among
    skulks, for their natural abilities at stealth and sneak attacks fit well
    with this choice, but they also excel in the roles of clerics, fighters and
    rangers who specialize in ranged weapons, and rarely as wizards
    (particularly illusionists).
