SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Corpse Call (Su)
    description: >-
      Zuvembies cannot speak, but their strange calls and whistles captivate the
      minds of those who hear them. Once per day, a zuvembie may call out, and
      all living creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within a
      100-foot spread must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or move toward the
      zuvembie using the most direct means possible. If this path leads them
      into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, the creatures
      receive a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril.
      Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves.
      A victim within 5 feet of the zuvembie simply stands and offers no
      resistance to the zuvembie's attacks. This effect continues for as long as
      the zuvembie continues its call as a standard action each round. This is a
      sonic mind-affecting charm effect, and has no effect on deaf creatures.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Tied to the dark forces of nature and unholy magic, zuvembies employ fear
    and the wild creatures of the land to take their vengeance upon the living.
    Zuvembies appear to be withered, animate corpses but possess ruthless minds
    and blasphemous vigor. Revenge fuels a zuvembie, a hatefulness directed
    toward those who wronged it in life. Yet even when the last one who maligned
    it lies dead, its rage remains, turning against all who live, especially the
    relatives of the target of its original hate.
  - >-
    Most zuvembies willingly performed the vile rituals to attain vengeance
    through unlife, but the transformation can also be wrought upon a helpless
    victim. The method of transforming into a zuvembie involves the creation and
    consumption of a vial of oil of animate dead, plus the performance of
    additional dark rites that take a day to perform and cost 3,000 gp. The
    ritual kills the target, who must make a DC 20 Will save. Failure results in
    the victim's death, while success means it reanimates as a free-willed
    zuvembie.
  - Zuvembies stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and rarely weigh over 100 pounds.
