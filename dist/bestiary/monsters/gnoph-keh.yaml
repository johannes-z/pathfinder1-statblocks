SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blizzard (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per hour as a standard action, a gnoph-keh can create a stationary
      blizzard that fills a 20-foot-radius spread. The gnoph-keh can place the
      center of this blizzard at any point within its reach. Multiple gnoph-kehs
      can use the aid another action to help a single gnoph-keh create a much
      larger blizzard-every additional gnoph-keh who aids the first increases
      the area of the blizzard's radius by 20 feet. All gnoph-kehs wishing to
      aid the primary creature must be within the area of that gnoph-keh's cold
      aura. Once created, the blizzard remains active for 1 hour if it was
      created in a cold environment, or for 1 minute if created anywhere else.
      The wind in the blizzard's area blows in a clockwise circular pattern at
      windstorm speeds, restricts visibility as fog does, and makes the region
      count as difficult terrain. A gnoph-keh can move through a blizzard
      (either one created by magic or a naturally occurring blizzard) without
      penalty.
  - name: Cold Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A gnoph-keh radiates an aura of blistering cold in a 30-foot radius. Any
      creature that ends its turn within this area takes 2d6 points of cold
      damage. While in a blizzard (either one created by magic, such as the
      gnoph-keh's blizzard power, or a naturally occurring blizzard), any
      creature that takes damage from a gnoph-keh's cold aura must make a DC 22
      Fortitude save to avoid being staggered by the numbing cold for 1 round.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Heat Susceptible (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gnoph-keh takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws made to resist the
      effects of high temperatures (see page 444 of the Pathfinder RPG Core
      Rulebook). When a gnoph-keh takes damage from heat in this way, and the
      damage is from temperatures in excess of 90ยบ F, the damage the creature
      takes is always lethal damage. In these conditions, the gnoph-keh's cold
      aura does not function at all.
  - name: Icewalking (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the
      gnoph-keh climbs must be icy. The beast can move across icy surfaces
      without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or
      charge on ice.
  - name: Snow Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gnoph-keh can see perfectly well in snowy conditions, and does not take
      any penalties on Perception checks while in snow.
Description:
  - >-
    The gnoph-keh is a six-legged horned creature vaguely akin to a polar bear
    in shape and outline, yet possessed of a cruel and creative intellect that
    elevates it from the rank of wild beast to murderous warmonger. Covered with
    a dense pelt of shaggy white fur, the gnoph-keh is equally at home walking
    on two, four, or six legs. The creature prefers to travel on all six when
    using its powerful charge or running, but rears up on its hind legs in
    combat to bring its four front claws to bear on its foes. With the
    gnophkeh's ability to call up and direct powerful blizzards matched to its
    ability to move and see in such conditions without any disadvantage, the
    creature is rightfully feared in the frozen realms where it dwells.
  - >-
    Ecology The gnoph-keh is, and always has been, a beast of the frozen white
    realms. Temperatures above freezing are uncomfortable to the gnoph-keh, to
    the extent that prolonged exposure to warm or hot temperatures can actually
    kill this mighty creature. Its aura of cold helps to protect it somewhat
    when it ventures into temperate areas, but once in a subtropical or
    similarly heated environment, the monster's freezing body cannot
    compensate-its flesh begins to literally melt, as if it were composed of ice
    and snow. The gnoph-keh has watery blue blood, and as it melts, this pale
    fluid runs in copious, steaming gouts from its body, inf licting severe pain
    on the creature. Accounts of gnoph-kehs being driven to blind rage in such
    conditions and simply attacking all nearby creatures and objects with no
    attempt to seek safety are likely apocryphal, since a gnoph-keh presented
    with such extreme temperatures generally does everything in its power to
    flee. They can use their ability to create blizzards to delay this fate, but
    in hot areas, the fact that this ability lasts only a minute usually only
    postpones the inevitable.
  - >-
    Although once much more numerous, gnoph-kehs today are spread quite thin
    through the frozen wastelands and mountain heights they prefer to dwell in.
    This, combined with the creatures' long gestation period, means that few
    gnoph-kehs are born. The monsters are exceptionally long-lived, with all
    indications that they can survive for centuries, or even millennia, if not
    slain by sickness or violence. Gnoph-kehs typically only seek out others of
    their kind for two reasons-to mate (an event that generally happens only
    once a century for any single gnoph-keh) or to make war.
  - >-
    Gnoph-kehs are hermaphrodites, capable of fertilizing others of their kind
    while also capable of becoming pregnant (although they cannot fertilize
    themselves). Despite its resemblance to a mammal, the gnoph-keh does not
    birth live young-instead, it lays a clutch of a dozen or so furry eggs that
    it buries in the snow or in the ice of a glacier. As the eggs grow, they
    slowly absorb each other until finally only a single egg remains. The
    creature inside doesn't hatch as much as it simply absorbs the leathery,
    furry sphere that surrounds it, transforming into a fully grown gnoph-keh.
  - >-
    Habitat & Society The primary driving force behind gnoph-keh society is
    war-not between themselves, but against other creatures that share their
    realms. Whether this drive to wage war is rooted in a strange psychological
    need, spurred by racial memories of the creatures' interactions with even
    more hostile races in the distant past, or something else entirely, there
    can be no denying that the gnoph-kehs enjoy the act of spreading misery to
    other races-particularly to humanoids. The only times a gnophkeh interacts
    with one of these "lesser races" is to subjugate it for the purposes of
    establishing an army that the gnoph-kehs can then use against similar races,
    for the only thing that eclipses a gnoph-keh's lust for warfare is the
    delight in turning tribes against each other. Once one tribe wipes out all
    of its competitors, the inevitable result is the final destruction of the
    victorious tribe by its own hateful commander. In this way, a single
    gnoph-keh can eradicate far larger groups than it would normally be able to
    destroy on its own.
  - >-
    While gnoph-keh society may seem monolithic to humanity, this is largely due
    to the simple fact that most of humanity's interactions with the gnoph-kehs
    are in the framework of pain and death. And while gnoph-kehs do not usually
    gather in groups or build cities, there is evidence that this is not always
    the case in certain strange and ancient ruins found in frozen corners of the
    world.
  - >-
    Most gnoph-kehs spend their time alone in contemplation or worship of
    strange statues they carve from glaciers or frozen lakes. The countenances
    of these gnoph-keh gods are alien and frightening. Very few gnoph-keh
    clerics or other divine spellcasters exist, prompting some scholars to
    theorize that these statues are in fact effigies of a long-forgotten and
    even more terrible force-perhaps the same one that nearly drove the
    gnoph-kehs into extinction so long ago and instilled in their minds such an
    overwhelming predisposition for war.
