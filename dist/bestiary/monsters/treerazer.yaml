SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Corruption (Su)
    description: >-
      Treerazer exudes an aura of corruption to a radius of 120 feet. This aura
      causes plants to grow hideous, sprouting thorns, twisting, and becoming
      fungoid in nature. Creatures with woodland stride or freedom of movement
      can move through this fungal bloom with ease. Living creatures within
      Treerazer's aura of corruption must make a DC 39 Fortitude save each round
      or their flesh grows pasty and clammy as tendrils of diseased plant matter
      and fungal growth sprout from it. This condition persists as long as the
      creature remains within Treerazer's aura of corruption and for 1 minute
      thereafter. While suffering the effects of this aura, the living creature
      is treated as a plant for the purposes of spells and effects that harm or
      otherwise inconvenience plant creatures more than other creatures. The
      victim would thus be subject to antiplant shell, blight, and additional
      damage from horrid wilting or a plant bane weapon, and could be affected
      by control plants. The corruption does not otherwise impart plant traits
      to creatures. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Defoliation (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, Treerazer can exude a pulse of
      defoliating energy in a 30-foot-radius spread. This pulse appears as a
      wave of sickly green energy, and causes all plants and plant creatures in
      the area to blacken and wither. Such creatures take 20d10 points of damage
      and 1d8 points of Strength drain, or half with a successful DC 39
      Fortitude save. A plant that isn't a creature (such as a tree or a shrub)
      doesn't receive a save and immediately withers and dies. Treerazer can
      choose to exclude any number of plants in the area from this effect, and
      generally does so to preserve twisted and corrupted plants and fungus. The
      save DC is Constitution-based. Nascent Demon Lord Traits A nascent demon
      lord is a powerful demon that has not yet made the full transition from
      unique demon to full demon lord of an Abyssal realm. Treerazer's current
      exile to the Material Plane prevents him from achieving full demon lord
      status. Yet he still possesses the typical nascent demon lord traits,
      which are similar to those possessed by a typical demon, only more potent,
      as summarized here. • Immunity to death effects, electricity, charm and
      compulsion effects, and poison. • Resistance to acid 30, cold 30, and fire
      30. •
  - name: Summon (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day, nascent demon lords can summon any demon or combination of
      demons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works,
      and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell. • Telepathy 300 ft. • A nascent
      demon lord's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated
      as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of resolving damage reduction.
      • Nascent demon lords can grant spells to their worshipers. Granting
      spells does not require any specific action on the nascent demon lord's
      behalf. All nascent demon lords grant access to the domains of Chaos and
      Evil-in addition, they grant access to two other domains and a favored
      weapon that vary according to the nascent demon lord's themes and
      interests.
Description:
  - >-
    Treerazer, the self-styled Lord of the Blasted Tarn, was once the favored
    minion and lieutenant (some even say child) of Cyth-V'sug, Demon Lord of
    Fungus and Parasites. After a failed attempt to wrest that crown away from
    Cyth-V'sug, Treerazer fled to the Material Plane. Cyth-V'sug was unable (or
    perhaps only unwilling) to pursue, but took steps to ensure that Treerazer
    would remain there by exiling him, transforming Treerazer into a native
    outsider and severing his bond to the Abyss-if the Lord of the Blasted Tarn
    is slain, his animus will not return to the Abyss and reform.
  - Death, to Treerazer, is a permanent thing.
  - >-
    Treerazer arrived on Golarion near the end of the Age of Darkness, and found
    the savaged planet much to his liking-so much so that the sting of exile was
    somewhat ameliorated. He spent many centuries wandering the remote corners
    of Golarion before finally coming upon the abandoned elven nation of Kyonin
    in 2497 ar. In the Sovyrian Stone, he found an artifact that he believed he
    could use to reinstate his Abyssal link and, perhaps, even uproot the entire
    nation and refocus the portal from Sovyrian to the Abyss, thereby reclaiming
    his position there and taking one more step toward revenge against
    Cyth-V'sug.
  - >-
    Yet the elves sensed his tamperings and returned to confront the demon. A
    terrific battle resulted, and while the elves were able to drive Treerazer
    out of Iadara and into southern Kyonin, they were unable to slay him or
    force him out completely-they merely concentrated his power in a smaller
    region. Instead, the elves "walled off " this region, a perverted realm
    known today as the Tanglebriar. Treerazer lurks at the Tanglebriar's heart
    to this day, the greatest bogeyman in elven mythology and a very real and
    constant threat to the nation's security.
  - >-
    Treerazer begins most combats by casting time stop and raising an antiplant
    shell to prevent plant creatures (including creatures under the effect of
    his aura of corruption) from approaching. If he has time, he also creates
    walls of thorns and summons demons (usually four nalfeshnees and 12
    hezrous). In melee, Treerazer gleefully takes up Blackaxe and makes full
    attacks against the closest foe, or Greater Vital Strikes if he's forced to
    move or charge. During the first 3 rounds of combat, he targets obvious
    spell effects with quickened greater dispel magic. If Treerazer is reduced
    to fewer than 150 hit points, he teleports back to his fortress, Witchbole,
    to recover and plan his revenge.
  - >-
    Treerazer's Cult Cults of Treerazer are quite rare beyond Kyonin, where
    secret cabals of cultists venerate him. When they do appear beyond these
    borders, they are secretive but sadistic groups, eager to sacrifice
    nonbelievers yet cunning in remaining undetected by the law of the land.
    Treerazer's symbol is a bleeding dead tree that's been split in half. His
    clerics have access to the Domains of Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and Plant.
    His favored weapon is the battleaxe.
