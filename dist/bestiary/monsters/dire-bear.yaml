Description:
  - >-
    Larger, more aggressive, and far more deadly than its lesser cousins, the
    dire bear (known to barbarian tribes variously as the cave bear or the
    short-faced bear) is a primeval menace indeed.
  - >-
    This behemoth avoids more civilized reaches of the world, preferring to
    dwell in remote wilderness locations.
  - >-
    A dire bear is a rare and terrifying sight- especially to those not used to
    normal bears.
  - >-
    Unlike most bears, a dire bear is short-tempered and swift to anger when
    confronted with intruders in its territory.
  - Like a grizzly, a dire bear attempts to subdue or kill with its claws.
  - >-
    However, a dire bear is far more likely (and willing) to begin biting a
    grabbed foe.
