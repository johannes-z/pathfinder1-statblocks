Description:
  - >-
    Razor treants are the evil and hateful cousins of the treants, often
    combating with treants over rulership of vast primordial forest in distant
    and exotic lands. However, unlike their kind cousins, they hate all
    non-plant creatures with passion and enjoy nothing more than torturing a
    hapless traveler for hours by inflicting on him hundreds of small wounds,
    until he finally dies from pain, exhaustion or loss of blood.
  - >-
    Animals know better than to come anywhere near the murderous trees, making
    the area around the razor treant deathly still when there is no wind.
  - >-
    Because of their slow movement rate, razor treants prefer to trick their
    opponents into coming within its reach and then attacking with its slam
    attack if there are few victims or with bloody autumn attack if it is
    surrounded by a large group. Groups of razor treants enjoy "playing" with
    their victims by hurling them at each other. Few are the heroes who suffered
    these sadistic games and lived to tell the tale. Razor treants often let
    wounded opponents flee on purpose, knowing they will die of loss of blood
    within minutes anyway.
