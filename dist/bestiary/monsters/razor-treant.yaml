Description_Visual: >-
  This thin and gnarled black tree grows wickedly sharp razors instead of
  leaves. The razors ring like a thousand tiny bells with every wind gust.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bloody Autumn (Ex)
    description: >-
      In this awesome attack the razor treant violently shakes itself as a
      full-round action, letting all of its leaves fall off to the ground. All
      creatures within 30 feet of the razor treant suffer 10d4 slashing damage
      and 1d4 bleed damage (DC 20 Reflex save for half and no bleed damage).
      Those who fail the Reflex save must succeed on an additional DC 20 Will
      save or be staggered for 1 round from the terrible pain of the hundreds of
      small wounds inflicted on them. Using this attack leaves the razor treant
      without its razor leaves for 2-6 days so it only resorts to this tactic in
      desperate situations.
  - name: Razor Leaves (Ex)
    description: >-
      Razor treants grow razors instead of leaves, hence the name. These
      extremely keen steel blades range from one to three inches in length and
      can easily cut through flesh. Any physical attack made by a razor treant
      is counted as being keen and wounding (already incorporated into the
      statistics above). Even merely touching a razor treant (including unarmed
      melee attacks) inflicts 1d4 points of slashing damage plus wounding on the
      victim. When a razor treant is struck for more than 20 points of damage in
      a single blow, it loses some of its poorly connected leaves. Everyone
      within 30 feet of the razor treant suffers 1d4 points of wounding slashing
      damage (DC 20 Reflex negates). The razor leaves break down quickly after
      the treant's death, remaining for only 1d2 rounds. The area around the
      treant is considered difficult terrain during that time.
Description:
  - >-
    Razor treants are the evil and hateful cousins of the treants, often
    combating with treants over rulership of vast primordial forest in distant
    and exotic lands. However, unlike their kind cousins, they hate all
    non-plant creatures with passion and enjoy nothing more than torturing a
    hapless traveler for hours by inflicting on him hundreds of small wounds,
    until he finally dies from pain, exhaustion or loss of blood.
  - >-
    Animals know better than to come anywhere near the murderous trees, making
    the area around the razor treant deathly still when there is no wind.
  - >-
    Because of their slow movement rate, razor treants prefer to trick their
    opponents into coming within its reach and then attacking with its slam
    attack if there are few victims or with bloody autumn attack if it is
    surrounded by a large group. Groups of razor treants enjoy "playing" with
    their victims by hurling them at each other. Few are the heroes who suffered
    these sadistic games and lived to tell the tale. Razor treants often let
    wounded opponents flee on purpose, knowing they will die of loss of blood
    within minutes anyway.
