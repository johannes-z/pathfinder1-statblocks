Description:
  - >-
    Dwarves are a short and stocky race, and stand about a foot shorter than
    most humans, with wide, compact bodies that account for their burly
    appearance. Male and female dwarves pride themselves on the long length of
    their hair, and men often decorate their beards with a variety of clasps and
    intricate braids. Clean-shavenness on a male dwarf is a sure sign of
    madness, or worse-no one familiar with their race trusts a beardless dwarven
    man.
