  - name: Desert Thirst (Su)
    description: >-
      A blue dragon can cast create water at will (CL 8). Alternatively, it can
      destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids
      are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions)
      and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 16)
      or be destroyed.
  - name: Sound Imitation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has
      heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive
      check.
Description:
  - >-
    Blue dragons are consummate schemers and obsessively orderly. In combat,
    blue dragons prefer to surprise foes if possible, and are not above
    retreating if the odds turn against them. They prefer to lair near those
    that they control, sometimes even within the confines of a city.
