    These small, intelligent, humanoid tree frogs live in primitive societies
    deep in the forests and marshes of the world. They hunt giant insects and

    advanced creatures for metal and gemstone ornaments.

    Grippli hatchlings develop into adults in less than a year. Unless they meet
    a savage end from a forest threat, they can live 60 years, their skin
    graying and losing its luster as they age. A grippli stands just over 2 feet
    in height and weighs 30 pounds.
