  - name: Spider Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy, save that it works only
      on spiders. A jorogumo uses her Hit Dice (normally 14) as her effective
      druid level. Spiders are normally mindless, but this empathic
      communication imparts upon them a modicum of implanted intelligence,
      allowing the jorogumo to train them and use them as guardians (though it
      does not grant them skills or feats).
  - name: Spider Legs (Ex)
    description: >-
      A jorogumo's spider legs can emerge or retract as a free action. When a
      jorogumo's spider legs are present, she gains a +8 circumstance bonus on
      Climb checks and gains Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat.
  - name: Swift Shapechanger (Ex)
    description: A jorogumo can assume spider or human form as a swift action.
Description:
  - >-
    Jorogumos are seductive schemers who secret themselves away in isolated
    mountain valleys where they lure travelers, especially men, to their dooms.
    Exclusively female, jorogumos must mate with humanoids to produce fertile
    eggs. After copulation, a jorogumo paralyzes her partner by poisoning him
    into a coma. She lays a single egg within the father's body, then cocoons
    the corpse and hides the victim. Periodic visits to re-poison the victim
    ensure his coma lasts for the 2d4 days required for the young jorogumo to
    hatch and feed. Jorogumos are enthusiastic enemies of tengus and attack them
    on sight-they never take tengus as "mates."
