Description:
  - >-
    Those evil souls that are taken to Hell and processed to become lemures but
    fail ultimately become nupperibo: a life-form even more disgusting and sad
    than the lowly lemure. Nupperibos are gathered by the dukes and arch-devils
    and used as fodder in their never-ending wars. A typical nupperibo army
    consists of thousands of these creatures.
  - Nupperibo stands 5 feet tall and weigh about 100 pounds.
  - >-
    Nupperibos unerringly follow the orders of their commander. They are
    relentless in their pursuit and attack, and continue to assault anything in
    their path until ordered to stop by their commander. A nupperibo killed in
    battle is 99% likely to be reformed (by a duke or arch-devil) into another
    nupperibo; the remaining 1% are "promoted" to lemure status, having proved
    their worth in combat.
