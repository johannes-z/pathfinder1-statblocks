Description:
  - >-
    Pesties are the larger, stealthier cousin of the mites. They lack the fangs
    of their kin but stand taller-though they tend to be leaner-with elongated
    limbs, long, slender fingers, and large pointed ears. Pesties stand between
    2-1/2 and 3 feet tall and weighs 20 pounds. Pesties do not communicate with
    others (even those of their own race) except through body language and crude
    hand signals. It is unknown whether pesties simply cannot or choose not to
    speak. Unlike mites who like to swarm over enemies in a sudden rush, pesties
    prefer to utilize their great speed and employ hit-and-run tactics to keep
    opponents off-balance. Pestie Society Pesties often are found working with
    or lairing with goblins or (more usually) common mites. They are less likely
    to band together into large communities than their smaller cousins and have
    an almost kleptomanic urge to pilfer items of interest or value whenever
    they see them. This tendency often leads to the pesties being driven out of
    whatever community they currently live in when their allies' patience
    reaches an end. However, the trapmaking skills of the mite complement the
    pesties' adeptness at speed and hit-and-run tactics so that invariably the
    two groups end up in cooperation again. Pesties that wear out their welcome
    in a goblin community face a grimmer fate, either succeeding in outrunning
    their pursuers or ending up in a goblin cook pot. Pestie Characters Pesties
    have racial Hit Dice and may possess class levels. Pesties have the
    following racial traits. -2 Strength, +6 Dexterity, -4 Intelligence, +2
    Wisdom, -2 Charisma. Pesties are quicker physically but slower mentally than
    common mites. Small size: Pesties are Small creatures with a +1 bonus to
    Armor Class, +1 bonus on attack rolls, +4 bonus on Stealth checks, -1
    penalty on CMB/CMD checks, and lifting and carrying limits 3/4 those of
    Medium characters. Base speed: A pestie's base land speed is 40 feet, and it
    has a climb speed of 20 feet. Darkvision: Pesties can see in the dark out to
    120 feet. Low-light vision: Pesties can see twice as far as humans in
    conditions of dim light. Racial Hit Dice: A pestie begins play with two
    levels of fey, which provides 2d6 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +1, and
    base saves of Fort +0, Ref +3, Will +3. Racial Skills: A pestie's fey level
    gives it skill points equal to 2 x (6 + Int modifier). A pestie receives the
    following adjustments: +4 racial bonus on Sleight of Hand and Stealth
    checks. Racial Feats: A pestie's fey levels gives it one feat. Special
    Attacks: Hatred, spell-like abilities (see above). Special Qualities: Scent,
    DR 2/cold iron, light sensitivity. Languages: Pesties begin play
    understanding (but unable to speak) Aklo. Pesties with a high intelligence
    can choose from the following languages: Goblin, Undercommon. Credit The
