SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Chains (Ex)
    description: >-
      A zelekhut's arms end in long lengths of barbed metal. These chains deal
      slashing damage and 1d6 points of electricity damage with each hit.
Description:
  - >-
    Zelekhuts are bounty hunters and executioners all rolled into one. They seek
    out those beings who continually evade justice-either through active flight,
    or through power and station-and bring law and justice to the multiverse's
    most notorious fugitives and criminals.
  - >-
    Ironically, while zelekhuts are implacable and unrelenting in their duty,
    they have little interest in passing judgment of their own, a fact that
    often confuses other races. Rather, a zelekhut is content to enforce the
    laws of any given society, and while it might hunt a condemned serial killer
    or notorious thief across half a dozen planes, it will not shift a single
    hoof to capture a corrupt ruler whose offenses are 10 times worse, so long
    as the atrocities are within her technical rights as ruler. All zelekhuts
    understand that laws can and must differ from place to place, and it is not
    the zelekhut's job to moralize, merely to track down those who seek to flee
    their punishment.
