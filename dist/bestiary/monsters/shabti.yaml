SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immortal (Ex)
    description: >-
      Shabti do not age naturally and cannot die of old age. While some might
      come into being at age categories other than adulthood, they never leave
      their original age category. Spells and effects that cause aging affect a
      shabti as normal.
  - name: Immune to Undeath (Ex)
    description: >-
      Shabti can't become undead. Spells and abilities that would transform a
      shabti into an undead creature have no effect. Past-Life
  - name: Knowledge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Shabti remember bits of their past lives. As a result, they treat all
      Knowledge skills as class skills.
  - name: Resist Level Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shabti takes no penalties from energy drain effects, though he can still
      be killed if he accrues more negative levels than he has Hit Dice. After
      24 hours, any negative levels a shabti takes are automatically removed
      without the need for an additional saving throw.
  - name: Shattered Soul (Ex)
    description: >-
      Shabti who are killed are exceptionally difficult to return to life. Those
      who attempt to return a shabti to life using raise dead, resurrection, or
      similar spells must succeed at a caster level check equal to 10 + the
      shabti's Hit Dice. If this check fails, the spell fails and the caster
      can't return the shabti to life for the next 24 hours (though the caster
      can try again after this period).
Description:
  - >-
    Death is more terrifying for those who have the best of life. Many rulers
    obsess over their mortality, the most brazen turning to the mystical arts,
    pouring their fears into splendid vessels, fashioning simulacra of
    themselves to bear the scourge of Pharasma's judgment. In the mortal world,
    these icons are nothing but gold with a ruler's face and name, but in death,
    they are shabti.
  - >-
    Existing as something between mortal souls, fabricated beings, and true
    children of the planes, shabti are immortal facsimiles of death-obsessed
    nobles. They serve out the sentences of their mortal twins, whether it be an
    infinity of torture or an eternity wandering the planes. Most never emerge
    from such trials, but some manage to find their own paths upon the planes.
  - >-
    Shabti typically look like idealized humans with perfect physiques and
    flawless features. They usually stand just over 6 feet tall and weigh
    between 150 and 210 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Shabti are artificially created creatures, brought into being by mortal
    magic interfering with the natural course of souls. They are born when an
    individual of royal blood makes use of a rare magical item known as a
    sovereign shabti (see the sidebar on page 91). The methods of creating these
    soul-guarding relics number among the deepest secrets of royal dynasties and
    cultic societies, meaning few mortals have access to such magic. However,
    groups on countless disparate worlds have discovered various routes to this
    power. This proliferation, along with the race's immortality, means that
    while shabti are rare sights in most planar metropolises, they are certainly
    not total strangers. They're practically unknown on the Material Plane, and
    are typically mistaken for aasimars or ifrits. Still, traditions and
    superstitions harkening back to this magic make the placement of mundane
    versions of these figurines-called ushabti-common in Osirian tombs
  - >-
    Shabti appear when a paranoid noble uses a sovereign shabti in an effort to
    avoid their judgment. They come into being full-grown and possessing
    glimpses from a life of privilege, yet knowing nothing of the magic that
    spawned them or the karmic debts they've been burdened with. Some appear on
    the terrifying thresholds of evil-aligned planes among legions of doomed
    petitioners. Others might simply wander onto the planes from the mists of
    the Maelstrom.
  - >-
    Most shabti have golden skin that feels cool but not metallic, which is
    regularly accented by gemstone veins, nails, or other embellishments. Some
    have skin tones more similar to jade, ivory, or ebony. Apart from their
    distinctive colorations, shabti have anatomies similar to humans. However,
    all shabti are sterile, preventing the race from propagating naturally. As
    such, childlike shabti are exceedingly rare.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Most shabti can be found in the planar metropolis of Axis, though Dis,
    Heaven's Shore, and the City of Brass also seem to be to many shabti's
    liking. Even in such places, though, shabti rarely gather in groups larger
    than two or three. Many seek to distinguish themselves from the magic items
    that spawned them, adopting self-chosen family names- "Answerers" and
    "Crowns" being popular among some.
  - >-
    Upon their creation, shabti don't realize they're copies of another being.
    Each individual initially believes he is a deceased member of royalty,
    usually taking his rich appearance as a sign of divine favor or spiritual
    value. Most prove quite indignant, then distraught, in the face of their
    torture or forced labor. Eventually, they discover their unusual nature.
    Many deny the notion, choosing to live as if their copied memories were
    their own. Others face ages of depression, madness, and self-destruction.
    Some, however, embrace the freedom of a new, rare existence and seek to live
    up to the splendid forms fate has granted them.
  - >-
    Many shabti learn of their nature from psychopomps. As Pharasma naturally
    despises such attempts to circumvent the natural cycle, her psychopomps are
    constantly on the lookout for shabti. When they find shabti, they
    immediately free them from any punishments, then use the shabti's memories
    to track down their mortal creators and bring them to justice.
