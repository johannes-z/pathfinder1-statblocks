Description:
  - >-
    Giant frogs leap into combat using their charge attack. Though giant frogs
    (the smallest variety) may flee or not attack opponents larger than
    themselves, the larger variety (dire, killer, and Abyssal) are ferocious and
    nearly mindless killing machines, attacking everything in sight that is not
    a frog.
