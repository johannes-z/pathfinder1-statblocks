  The vicious spines surrounding this boar's head are almost as unnerving as the
  wild look in its eyes.

    description: >-
      Targets of a bristle boar's successful gore attack must succeed at a DC 16
      Reflex saving throw to avoid being speared by the dangerously sharp spines
      around its head and neck. Failure results in 1d4 points of piercing damage
      as well as 1 point of bleed damage per round for 3 rounds. Bleed damage
      from multiple spines doesn't stack, but the duration is reset by
      subsequent attacks. Magical healing or a successful DC 15 Heal check ends
      the bleed effect. The save DC is Strength-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Bristle boars are native to the plains and low hills of Belkzen, and are
    well-known threats to trackers and scouts familiar with the area. The long,
    hollow spines surrounding their heads are reminiscent of porcupine spines,
    and make these boars deadlier than their common cousins. Bristle boars are
    quite lean and aren't considered particularly good to eat-but a desperate
    adventurer faced with starvation could survive on the meat if necessary.
  - >-
    A typical bristle boar stands roughly 4 feet off the ground and weighs 200
    pounds.
