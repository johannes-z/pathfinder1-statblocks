    description: >-
      Since a vampire rose looks like a normal white rose bush when at rest, it
      takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with
      ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills
      instead of Perception to notice the plant. Dwarves can use stonecunning to
      notice the subterranean version.
Description:
  - >-
    Vampire roses look like normal white rose bushes and are often mistaken for
    such. The typical vampire rose bush stands about 3 feet tall.
  - >-
    A vampire rose stands motionless until its prey moves within range, when it
    strikes with a thorny stalk. Opponents are grabbed and drained of blood.
    When fully sated with blood, a vampire rose's petals flush red.
