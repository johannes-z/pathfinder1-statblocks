SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Force Field (Ex)
    description: >-
      An evaluator robot is sheathed in a thin layer of shimmering energy that
      grants it 50 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to an evaluator robot with
      an active force field is deducted from these hit points first. As long as
      the force field is active, the evaluator robot is immune to critical hits.
      An evaluator robot's force field has fast healing 10, but once these hit
      points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not
      reactivate for 24 hours.
  - name: Integrated Laser Rifle (Ex)
    description: >-
      An evaluator robot has a built-in laser rifle. This weapon has a range of
      150 feet and deals 4d6 points of fire damage on a hit. The weapon can fire
      once per round as a ranged touch attack. A laser attack can pass through
      force fields and force effects, such as a wall of force, to strike a foe
      beyond without damaging that field. Objects like glass or other
      transparent barriers don't provide cover from lasers, but unlike force
      barriers, a transparent physical barrier still takes damage when a laser
      passes through it. Invisible creatures and objects are immune to damage
      from lasers. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to
      concealment from laser attacks. Darkness (magical or otherwise) has no
      effect on lasers other than providing concealment.
  - name: Memory Wipe (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an evaluator robot can make a touch attack that, if
      it hits, injects nanites into a target and erases the last 12 hours of its
      memories. A successful DC 19 Will save negates this effect. This is a
      mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Intelligence-based.
  - name: Process Languages (Ex)
    description: >-
      Exceptional processing and data stores allows an evaluator robot to parse
      language in a way that lets it permanently speak and understand any spoken
      or written language it observes for at least 1 minute.
  - name: Stun (Ex)
    description: >-
      An evaluator robot's melee attacks deliver a nonlethal jolt of electricity
      with each strike. If the robot strikes a creature twice in one round with
      its bastard sword or slam attack, that target must succeed at a DC 19
      Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is
      Intelligence-based.
  - name: Superior Optics (Ex)
    description: >-
      An evaluator robot can see invisible creatures or objects as if they were
      visible.
Description:
  - >-
    Androffans, the race responsible for the presence of robots on Golarion,
    were a spacefaring people who visited dozens of worlds. Masters of
    engineering, they created robots that could perform a wide array of tasks,
    even trusting their creations to perform complex surgeries on the
    Androffans' own organic forms. In the course of their interplanetary
    explorations, the Androffans quickly learned that not every world was ready
    to comprehend the awesome experience of leaving one's home planet to visit
    others. Not wanting to risk valuable crew members, the Androffans created
    evaluator robots as an alternative to sending a shuttle mission to alien
    planets and interacting in person. When sensors aboard Androffan ships
    orbiting foreign worlds discovered other humanoid species, evaluator robots
    would be dispatched to assess the planets' alien cultures.
  - >-
    Taking forms designed to be recognizable to a planet's general populace,
    evaluator robots would drop from orbiting surveillance ships onto alien
    worlds to collect data so that their masters could determine the readiness
    of the planets' inhabitants to accept the existence of creatures from other
    worlds. Androffans also used evaluator robots to determine how violent or
    superstitious the indigenous populations were so that they could carefully
    plan direct contact. Evaluator robots were fashioned into pleasing and
    majestic forms to command respect and admiration from the humanoids they
    interacted with, and were usually made slightly taller than the planet's
    primary race so as to seem properly impressive. These robots' advanced
    construction utilizes sophisticated lightweight materials, making their
    durable frames weigh in under 400 pounds. The model presented here is the
    most common design-a radiant humanoid angel with gleaming feathers of
    brushed metal.
  - Design
  - >-
    The engineers who designed evaluator robots created each one to serve
    specific purposes tailored to the world it was intended to observe. These
    thematic designs were tested through trial and error by the evaluators
    themselves, who paid close attention to the religions encountered on each
    planet. They discovered that reverence for angelic beings was common on many
    worlds populated by sentient humanoids, so the engineers built the majority
    of evaluator robots in this form.
  - >-
    Although some evaluators were designed for use on worlds that used advanced
    technology, evaluators were rarely used to observe cultures that had already
    reached space on their own or that were otherwise accustomed to dealing with
    beings from other worlds. In some cases, Androffan engineers designed
    evaluator robots to mimic the form of beings iconic to the populace,
    gathering information about these individuals from intercepted communication
    signals. This was often judged too risky, however, as it was found that
    cultures rarely responded well to the eventual revelation that their
    resurrected heroes and messiahs were actually alien robots.
  - >-
    Even though redesigning an evaluator robot's outward form was simple, their
    complex programming required a vast amount of collected data. If the robot
    couldn't reply in a convincing manner, or if its memory-modifying nanites
    took no hold on the alien humanoids it encountered, then the evaluator's
    mission was quickly compromised. The robot's creators then had to hope that
    the interaction would be interpreted as a fluke supernatural experience, or
    that the witness would be disbelieved and derided by its community.
  - >-
    Evaluator robots are universally curious, their programming filling them
    with an endless need to learn about living creatures. These robots take
    every opportunity to ask questions of intelligent organic life forms,
    especially humanoids. An evaluator robot compares these answers to profiles
    of existing cultures, either installed when it was created or assembled from
    previous interactions. Complex algorithms capable of parsing the nuances of
    myriad humanoid societies allow the robot to quickly evaluate and categorize
    the nature of a particular society using these hundreds or thousands of
    profiles. Once an evaluator has thoroughly assessed a planet's cultures, its
    Androffan masters use this information to plan a landing expedition to make
    direct contact.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    As robots, evaluators have no society outside of their programming, and
    their habitat is wherever they happen to be deployed. In the Inner Sea
    region, nearly all evaluator robots encountered to date have been found in
    Silver Mount.
  - >-
    Since they were designed to interact with sentient organic beings, evaluator
    robots don't regularly associate with
  - >-
    other robots unless tasked with a project requiring such interaction, and
    instead keep the company of humanoids (though their cold robotic presence
    isn't always comforting).
  - >-
    Crafts that split from Divinity during its crash and fell to other parts of
    Numeria contained two other known evaluator robots. A tribe of Ghost Wolves
    destroyed one of these evaluators-designed to resemble a horned, red-skinned
    fiend-when it appeared before the Kellid barbarians in the Sellen Hills. The
    robot fought with wicked claws, and after it was destroyed, it exploded in a
    blast that killed dozens of the barbarians. The other evaluator, reportedly
    appearing as a six-armed, three-faced woman with bronze skin, was spotted
    brief ly by griffon riders at Castle Urion before it headed south into the
    River Kingdoms, and hasn't been seen since.
