SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A boggart's natural form is that of a small humanoid (resembling a young
      gnome, halfling, or goblin). It has one other form: that of a small,
      immature will-o'-wisp. In humanoid form, a boggart assumes the same
      appearance and traits of its form, much as a lycanthrope would. In
      humanoid form, a boggart retains all of its special attacks and special
      qualities. The second form is that of a will-o- ‘wisp. In this form, a
      boggart is nearly indistinguishable from a normal will-o'- wisp, but a DC
      18 Knowledge (dungeoneering) or Perception check reveals that the boggart
      is in fact smaller and brighter. A boggart can assume either form as a
      standard action, though it cannot maintain either one for longer than 1
      minute (10 rounds). A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the
      boggart revert to its true natural form when slain. A true seeing spell
      reveals the boggart's natural form if it is in will-o'-wisp form.
  - name: Confusion (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, as a full-round action, a boggart can unleash a screech that
      confuses all those hearing it within 30 ft. of the boggart. The confusion
      lasts for 6 rounds. An affected creature can make a DC 15 Will save to
      negate the effects. Each additional boggart within 10 feet that joins the
      screeching increases the save DC by +1. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Detect Thoughts (Su)
    description: >-
      A boggart can continuously detect thoughts as the spell (caster level
      8th). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.
  - name: Electricity (Su)
    description: >-
      A boggart delivers 2d6 points of electricity damage with a successful slam
      attack (DC 15 Fortitude for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Feed (Su)
    description: >-
      When a boggart slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on the corpse,
      devouring both flesh and life force, as a full-round action. Feeding
      destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or
      resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that
      a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a devoured victim
      to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the
      creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic. A boggart
      advances in Hit Dice by consuming corpses in this fashion. For every three
      suitable corpses a boggart devours, it gains 1 Hit Die, and its Strength,
      Constitution, and natural armor increase by +1. Its attack bonus and saves
      improve as normal for an aberration of its Hit Dice, and it gains skill
      ranks, feats, and ability score improvements normally. The boggart only
      advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose Hit Dice or levels
      are equal to or greater than its own current total. A boggart that reaches
      9 Hit Dice through feeding immediately becomes a will-o'-wisp upon
      completion of the act.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      Boggarts are immune to most spells or spell-like abilities that allow
      spell resistance, except magic missile, protection from evil, magic circle
      against evil, and maze.
Description:
  - >-
    The boggart is a relative of the will-o-wisp. Sages believe it to be a sort
    of "larval" or immature form of said creature. It haunts many of the same
    places as its adult form and can be just as deadly when encountered.
  - The typical boggart stands 2 feet tall.
  - >-
    A boggart begins melee using its confusion ability. It then uses its
    electrical attack against its foes while changing forms as it wishes. Foes
    not in melee range are subjected to its electrical discharge attack (it
    fires a thin line of electricity from its hands). If reduced to 5 or less
    hit points, the boggart attempts to escape by changing to its will-o-wisp
    form and moving across grounds its enemies cannot traverse.
