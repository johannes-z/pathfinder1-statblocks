SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      A dun pudding secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material
      and metal quickly, but does not affect stone. Each time a creature suffers
      damage from a dun pudding's acid, its clothing and armor take the same
      amount of damage from the acid. A DC 20 Reflex save prevents damage to
      clothing and armor. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a dun pudding
      takes 2d6 acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a DC 20
      Reflex save. If a dun pudding remains in contact with a wooden or metal
      object for 1 full round, it inflicts 20 points of acid damage (no save) to
      the object. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Corrosion (Ex)
    description: >-
      An opponent that is being constricted by a dun pudding suffers a -4
      penalty on Reflex saves made to resist acid damage applying to clothing
      and armor.
Description:

    A variety of the black pudding, the dun pudding is found only in warm, dry,
    arid regions. It is light tan or brown in color.
