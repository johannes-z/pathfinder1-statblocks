Description_Visual: >-
  This creature has the upper torso of a small humanoid and the lower torso of a
  goat, thus giving it a satyr-like appearance. It has a long, flowing beard,
  and like its hair, is tangled and matted into frightful knots. It wears a
  simple leather covering on which hangs a large leather pouch. Its hair is dark
  and its wild, brown eyes have an almost feral-like gleam in them.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animate Hair (Su)
    description: >-
      A korred can weave its hair (contained in its pouch) into animated ropes
      that can entangle foes. The time it takes to weave enough hair to entangle
      one foe is dependent on the size of the creature as follows: Size Time Up
      to Tiny 1 round Small or Medium 2 rounds Large 3 rounds A korred cannot
      entangle an opponent of greater than Large size. This ability otherwise is
      similar to the animate rope spell (caster level 15th)
  - name: Laugh (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a korred can unleash a laugh that stuns all creatures
      that hear it within 60 feet for 1d2 rounds. A DC 14 Will save negates the
      effects. A bard's countersong ability allows a stunned creature a new Will
      save to break free. Whether the save is successful or not, a creature is
      immune to the laugh of the same korred for one day. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Armed with a club that seems too large for it to wield, a korred is a
    satyrlike creature that dwells deep in the forest. Korreds keep their
    belongings in a large pouch; the contents of such a pouch vary with the
    tastes of the individual, but all korreds carry shears with which to cut
    their matted hair when it becomes too long. A korred opens combat using its
    laugh to stun its opponents. It follows this with its animated hair attack.
    Entangled foes are pelted with rocks or attacked with shears. Korreds are
    automatically proficient with their shears. Korred Shears (Exotic Light
    Melee Weapon) Korred Shears: Cost N/A (cannot be bought); Damage 1d4 (S),
    1d6 (M); Crit x3, Weight 1 lb., Type slashing.
