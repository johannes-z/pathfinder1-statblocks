SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Maelstrom (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, as a standard action, a brine drake can create a whirlpool
      within 100 feet. The whirlpool is 50 feet deep and covers a 30-foot radius
      at its top. Ships and creatures of the brine drake's size or smaller that
      come into contact with the whirlpool must succeed on a DC 19 check (Swim
      check for creatures, Profession [sailor] check for ships) or be pulled
      into the swirling waters and trapped, spinning around the whirlpool and
      taking 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage initially and 3d6 points of
      bludgeoning damage for another 1d6 rounds at which point the whirlpool
      dissipates. A brine dragon is immune to the effects of its own maelstrom.
      The check DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Savage Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A brine drake applies 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to damage dealt with
      its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.
  - name: Speed Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a swift action, a brine drake may draw on its
      draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional
      move action in that round.
  - name: Watery Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round, as a standard action, a brine drake can unleash a blast of
      salt water in a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in the area take 7d6 points
      of bludgeoning damage (DC 19 Reflex half). Once a brine drake has used its
      watery breath, it cannot use it again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Brine drakes are often confused with sea dragons and have a similar
    appearance to their much larger, and deadlier cousins. Like true sea
    dragons, brine drakes are the bane of major shipping lanes, lying in shallow
    water near the surface and attacking small lightly armed vessels and hunting
    lesser creatures.
  - >-
    Brine drakes make their homes in underwater caverns and the hulls of sunken
    vessels large enough to handle their huge size. What treasures they scour
    from the depths of the sea are piled within their caverns.
  - >-
    Brine drakes thankfully mate only once every few years, with a female
    producing a clutch of two to six eggs. Eggs hatch within 8 months and young
    reach maturity in roughly 5 years. Brine drakes are over 12 feet long and
    weigh around 1,600 pounds. They live up to 300 years.
  - >-
    Brine drakes attack from beneath whenever possible, rising from the waters
    at great speed, latching their jaws around their target and coiling
    themselves around other prey or crushing the hulls of vessels under 30 feet
    in length. Brine drakes drive other creatures away with slaps of its deadly
    tail.
