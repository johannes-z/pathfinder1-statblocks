Description_Visual: >-
  A narrow, beetle-like creature glides across the water's dark surface on four
  brown, spindly legs. It stands just over five feet tall, holding its head and
  thorax upright while clutching an intricately carved hunting spear in two
  clawed forelimbs. Powerful mandibles click in rhythm with the reed-thin
  antennae waving upon its head as if testing the air for the scent of prey.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hold Breath (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bog strider can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times
      its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
  - name: Tremor Tap (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bog striders can send and receive messages by creating and sensing silent
      vibrations on the surface of any body of water they currently tread. The
      range of communication extends outward 120 feet to all other bog striders
      within line of effect on or under the water. Because the ripples created
      on the water prove omni-directional, bog striders can communicate with
      multiple targets at the same time. Only bog striders can understand this
      form of communication. This ability also grants bog striders tremorsense
      in water at a range of 120 feet.
  - name: Water Sprint (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per hour, a bog strider can move up to 5 times its normal speed (250
      feet) on water when making a charge or retreating from an enemy. Once it
      decides to increase its movement in this fashion, the effect lasts for up
      to 4 rounds, after which a bog strider becomes fatigued for as many rounds
      as it chose to move at a higher speed.
  - name: Water Stride (Su)
    description: >-
      A bog strider can tread upon rivers, lakes, and flooded swamplands or
      marshes as if under the effects of the water walk spell. It also gains an
      increased movement rate by using the surface tension and its multiple legs
      to propel itself across the water.
Description:
  - >-
    Bog striders call themselves Ses'h in Aquan, but the first explorers to
    encounter them named the reclusive bug-men after their ability to stride on
    water like solid ground. Individual bog striders resemble upright beetles
    with four legs, two arms, and powerful mandibles. They depend on their
    waterborne speed to quickly chase down prey and flee from predators.
    Otherwise, they care little for civilizations other than their own, rarely
    venturing from the swampy rivers and lakes they call home. The long, spindly
    legs of bog striders give the impression of a greater size then their
    relatively fragile frames actually account for. Although their limbs are in
    most cases more than double, even triple, the length of other humanoids,
    their inflexible joints grant them little more mobility, range of motion,
    and capability to reach than others. Regardless of gender, nearly all bog
    striders stand 5 feet tall and weigh approximately 150 pounds. Ecology Bog
    striders reproduce during specific seasonal and astrological cycles that
    occur only two to three times during their entire lifespan-detecting their
    moment of peak fertility through changes in the weather and tidal effects
    upon large bodies of water. Thereafter, pregnant females lay a clutch of
    four to 10 eggs, keeping them submerged and guarding against predators until
    they hatch 6 months later. The younglings then cling to their mother for the
    next 3 months as they learn the rudiments of survival and socialization
    within the tribe. Unfortunately, predators (intelligent or otherwise) often
    view bog strider eggs and younglings as easy prey. Hatcheries suffer attacks
    by crocodiles and giant frogs, while birds of prey, boggards, and human
    hunters pick off younglings who stray from their mothers on the open water.
    As a result of these reproductive challenges, bog striders struggle to keep
    pace with other swamp-dwelling cultures, suffering through periods of
    decline and nearextinction. These difficulties make them increasingly
    insular and territorial, meeting interlopers with spears more often than
    diplomacy. A bog strider's diet consists almost entirely of meat. They
    routinely hunt for fish, crustaceans, or snakes, and occasionally hunt for
    birds, giant wasps, or dragonflies. They particularly excel at spearfishing
    and snaring airborne prey with thrown nets. The wide stance of a bog
    strider's four legs displaces its weight over any body of water by
    maintaining the surface tension with a cushion of air trapped beneath
    several small ridges on each foot. While not dissimilar to the motion of
    minute water-striding insects, for bog striders the motion is aided by some
    manner of innate magic or other supernatural relationship with the water.
    Regardless of the source of this ability, it allows them to literally walk
    on water, though they can also fully submerge and hide below the surface if
    they desire. Bog striders who survive into adulthood can live up to 60
    years. Each youngling develops a varied pattern of mottled gray and brown
    coloration across its carapace, uniquely distinguishing it from others.
    These spots tend to fade as bog striders age, causing their elders to all
    look much alike. Habitat & Societ y Bog striders can survive in all but the
    coldest of climes, living their entire lives on the rivers, lakes, and bogs
    where they make their homes. Their society focuses primarily on survival due
    to the depredations of natural predators and wars with lizardfolk and
    boggards. Each member of a bog strider tribe, both male and female, learns
    to defend the tribe at the earliest possible age. In addition, everyone must
    develop a skill that contributes to the community's prosperity, and by
    extension, the continued survival of their species. Females serve as the
    builders of bog strider society. They weave large mats of reeds, rushes, and
    netting that they coat in waterproof tree sap to trap pockets of air below
    the water's surface where they can safely build and hide their villages.
    When not looking after their young, the females continuously expand or
    replace flooded sections of these communities. Meanwhile, male bog striders
    act as hunters and gatherers, bringing back enough food to last through
    harsh winters and times of drought. They also scout the waterways for
    threats to their community, leaving those who pass through their territory
    unmolested but fighting off those who attempt to stay or exploit the same
    resources they depend upon. Frequently small bands also venture far from
    their native lands, seeking to find new, uninhabited waterways where their
    imperiled communities might be left in peace. Seer-queens rule over multiple
    bog strider communities to form secluded tribal unions, acting as religious
    leaders and reading the river currents or tides to divine the will of
    Gozreh. Many become clerics or druids worshiping the nature god in its
    feminine form, though they interpret Gozreh more as a great body of water
    than a likeness of themselves. Because seer-queens lose their personal
    markings like any other elder, they are difficult to distinguish from the
    rest of their community. They often use this advantage to hide among their
    own people, both to thwart those who would target them and to mingle more
    freely among their subjects. Bog Strider Seer-Queens Leaders of multiple
    tribes of bog striders, seer-queens help organize and coordinate efforts to
    stave off the extinction of their species and interpret the will of nature.
    The following adjustments to a standard bog strider represent a seer-queen.
    Many also pursue a deeper faith in Gozreh, attaining class levels as a
    cleric or druid. +5 natural armor. This replaces the standard bog strider
    natural armor bonus. +4 Intelligence, +4 Wisdom, +6 Charisma. Seer-queens
    are smarter, wiser, and more regal than normal bog striders. Water Magic
    (Sp) While standing upon the water's surface, bog strider seer-queens can
    cast the following powers as spell-like abilities: 3/day-create water,
    purify food and drink; 1/day-delay poison, fog cloud, quench.
