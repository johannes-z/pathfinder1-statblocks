Description:
  - >-
    Dire foxes are larger and fiercer versions of the normal fox. They are
    solitary creatures whose hunting grounds can cover up to 10 square miles.
  - >-
    Dire foxes spend about one-third of their day hunting for food. They are
    excellent hunters and have no problem attacking and bringing down large
    prey. They are omnivorous and feast on a diet of rodents, dire rodents (such
    as dire rats), insects and giant insects, and various plants and herbs. If
    food is scarce, dire foxes live off of carrion until their food supply
    increases.
  - >-
    Mating season varies depending on climate. Dire foxes found in colder
    climates mate during the late winter and early spring months. Those found in
    warmer climates mate during the winter. This is the only time more than one
    dire fox will be encountered and such encounters consist of one male and at
    least one female (two females sometimes). If pups are present, there will be
    2d6 of them. Young dire foxes reach maturity at about 10 months of age and
    leave the den to claim their own hunting territory which can be up to 250
    miles away from their birthplace.
  - >-
    Dire foxes are about 5 feet long and have yellowish-red or reddish-brown
    fur. A strip of black fur runs across their shoulders and down the center of
    their backs. The dire fox's underbelly is white more often than not, but a
    gray underbelly is not uncommon. Dire foxes have thick, bushy tails with the
    same color fur as their body. The tail ends in a black or white bushy tip.
    The lower legs of a dire fox are either black or white and their eyes are
    yellow. A rare breed of dire fox has silver or silver-black fur.
  - >-
    A dire fox prefers to sneak up on its prey and catch it unaware. When it
    spots a potential meal, the dire fox stands motionless, waiting for its
    target to move closer. When its prey is within range, it leaps out and
    attacks. If cornered, dire foxes fight to the death.
