SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Anathematize (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a curse devil can temporarily drop its
      natural invisibility to reveal its true, horrifying form. All creatures
      within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become cursed as
      bestow curse; additionally, all creatures in the area must succeed at a
      second DC 16 Will save or have their memories of the event stripped as if
      by modify memory. The curse devil can resume its invisibility at the end
      of its turn as a free action. Whether or not the saves are successful, an
      affected creature is immune to that curse devil's anathematize ability for
      24 hours. If its natural invisibility is negated by other methods, the
      curse devil can't use this ability. Those who can see invisible creatures
      are immune to this effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Broken Curses (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a curse devil dies, any lingering curses or harmful effects caused by
      the devil are undone as if by a miracle spell.
  - name: Infernal Bond (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a curse devil is created by a lesser or greater devil, its creator
      forges a magical link between the curse devil and a mortal signed to-or
      implicated in-an infernal contract, such as a mortal who sold her soul to
      a devil or the first-born child of a mortal who was promised in an
      infernal bargain). Thereafter, the curse devil can always find the
      specified mortal as though guided by a locate creature spell with no
      maximum range. The specified mortal takes a -2 penalty on saving throws
      against the curse devil's anathematize ability and its spell-like
      abilities.
Description:
  - >-
    Curse devils, or phiams, are constructs of Hell that exist outside the
    infernal hierarchy. They are forged by more powerful devils to hunt down
    mortals whose souls belong to Hell. When folk speak of "family curses" or
    "damned fates," a curse devil is often pulling strings.
  - A curse devil is 4 feet tall and weighs 80 pounds.
