Description:
  - >-
    Kobolds are creatures of the dark, found most commonly in enormous
    underground warrens or the dark corners of the forest where the sun is
    unable to reach. Due to their physical similarities, kobolds loudly proclaim
    themselves the scions of dragonkind, destined to rule the earth beneath the
    wings of their great god-cousins, but most dragons have little use for the
    obnoxious pests. While they may speak loudly of divine right and manifest
    destiny, kobolds are keenly aware of their own weakness. Cowards and
    schemers, they never fight fair if they can help it, instead setting up
    ambushes and doublecrosses, holing up in their warrens behind countless
    crude but ingenious traps, or rolling over the enemy in vast, yipping
    hordes. Kobold coloration varies even among siblings from the same egg
    clutch, ranging through the colors of the chromatic dragons, with red being
    the most common but white, green, blue, and black kobolds not unheard of.
    Kobold Characters Kobolds are defined by their class levels-they do not
    possess racial Hit Dice. A kobold with NPC class levels takes a -3 penalty
    to its CR (rather than the normal -2 penalty). All kobolds have the
    following racial traits. -4 Strength, +2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution: Kobolds
    are fast but weak. Small: Kobolds are Small and gain a +1 size bonus to
    their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty to their CMB and
    CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks. Normal Speed: Kobolds have a
    base speed of 30 feet. Darkvision: Kobolds can see in the dark up to 60
    feet. Armor: Kobolds have a +1 natural armor bonus. Crafty: Kobolds gain a
    +2 racial bonus on Craft (trapmaking), Perception, and Profession (miner)
    checks. Craft (trapmaking) and Stealth are always class skills for a kobold.
    Weakness: Light sensitivity (see page 301). Languages: Kobolds begin play
    speaking only Draconic. Kobolds who have high Intelligence scores can choose
    any of the following bonus languages: Common, Dwarven, Gnome, and
    Undercommon.
