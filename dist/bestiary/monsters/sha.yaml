SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      A sha transmits a potent disease with its bite. The most common form of
      disease carried by a sha drives its victims insane, reducing them to
      babbling fools or raving lunatics. Set's Touch: Bite-injury; save Fort DC
      15; onset 1d3 days; frequency 1 day; effect 1d4 Wis damage and 1d4 Cha
      damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Sandstorm (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a full-round action, a sha can create a sandstorm
      (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 431). The sandstorm has a radius of 100 feet
      centered on the sha, and lasts for 1 minute per Hit Die the sha possesses
      (6 minutes for a typical sha).
  - name: Sandstorm Sight (Su)
    description: >-
      A sha can see clearly in a naturally occurring sandstorm or one created by
      it or another sha using its sandstorm ability.
Description:
  - >-
    Once more prominent in Ancient Osirion, shas are favored creatures of the
    god Set, and faded scrolls detailing the past of Osirion refer to more
    powerful versions of these creatures the people called Set beasts.
    Considered heralds of the dark god Set, shas stalk the deepest deserts, only
    skirting the edge of civilization. Villagers whisper that a sha nears when
    they spot faint red lights in the distance, believing those lights to be
  - >-
    the menacing eyes of the sha. Many times, simple worry drives these
    sightings, but shas live in the deep deserts and they certainly keep an eye
    on humankind. An urge to hunt the people who forgot their patron drives shas
    to attack caravans, harass remote villages, and prowl isolated oases to
    slaughter humanoids.
  - >-
    Black fur, tinted with the dust and sand of the desert, covers a sha's body.
    The creature's eyes glow a dull red. Explorers report that seeing a sha's
    eyes glowing in the dark night is often the only indication of an impending
    attack. A sha's strong jaw, lined with razor-sharp teeth, allows the
    creature to drag down larger prey in a fashion similar to a wolf. Standing
    at chest height to most humans, shas weigh between 100 and 150 pounds. Shas
    possess a distinct canine appearance, and they are often mistaken at night
    for common jackals whose eyes are illuminated by firelight. This
    misidentification was prevalent in Ancient Osirion as well, leading some to
    wrongfully associate the creatures with Anubis. These days, scholars and
    those who still worship the old gods of Osirion are among the few people who
    correctly identify these beasts and their deific association.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Legends state that shas were once simple canine animals long ago. The
    Osirian deity Set admired their reliability as trackers, hunters, killers,
    and masters of the deep deserts, and so blessed these early creatures with
    supernatural powers and sapience to create the first shas. Possessing the
    gifts of keen perception and eyes that would never tire, shas served Set as
    protectors of his cults and weapons to be sent against rivals. They also
    have the ability to understand the tongue of ancient Osirion, though they
    lack the physical capability to speak the language. This way, the creatures
    can understand and carry out commands, but lack any way to disagree or
    communicate displeasure at their directives. Set gave his loyal beasts the
    ability to conjure supernatural sandstorms, tying them closer to his
    portfolio as god of storms. This power allows the creatures to obfuscate
    their approach and drive off dangerous enemies, yet the creatures' ability
    to see through their own sandstorms allows shas to pick off their quarry
    unhindered. Set also imbued his beasts with the ability to transmit horrific
    plagues upon those they bite, weakening their victims' minds and driving the
    victims deep into madness.
  - >-
    When Set first imbued the shas with divine might, his creations were much
    more powerful and cunning. With the passage of millennia and the gradual
    decline of Set's worship, his blessings have faded, resulting in the shas
    that now prowl the deserts. On rare occasions, a convergence of old sha
    bloodlines results in a particularly formidable, devious, and cruel sha
    known as a Set beast,
  - >-
    which Osirionologists believe is the original form once taken by Set's
    favored creatures. Malice and strength are not the only qualities passed
    from generation to generation; shas still seem to remember the source of
    their power, for they attack those who openly display holy symbols of other
    gods before savaging those who show faith in one of the gods of ancient
    Osirion.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Most shas lead a solitary existence, though some end up finding a lone
    partner to hunt with or a small pack to join. When alone, a sha spends its
    days trekking the vast wastelands of the desert, prowling among lost
    monuments that were once proud accomplishments of ancient Osirion. Those
    exploring such sites must keep alert, because shas plan ambushes and
    silently stalk their prey, often waiting until their victims emerge from
    darkened ruins before striking. While wandering the deserts, shas also
    attack small convoys or groups of nomads along the desert fringes. Using
    their innate ability to conjure sandstorms, shas close in on the
    unsuspecting groups and try to injure as many different enemies as possible,
    then retreat before their foes can regroup. By doing this, the shas ensure
    that survivors return to civilization mad with disease and then spread the
    sickness to others or act on their insane urges.
  - >-
    When packs of shas come together, they usually do so because a number of
    their kind happened upon each other in pursuit of a caravan or some other
    nomadic prey, then decided to continue hunting together once they fed. If a
    group forms, it follows a strict hierarchy that revolves around the
    strongest sha taking the lead. If more than one sha feels it has the right
    to lead, the pack forms a circle and the two shas fight until one submits to
    the other. Such competition never takes place if a Set beast is present; the
    pack members acquiesce to this greater creature and follow its commands
    unerringly, lest they invite its wrath.
  - >-
    Set beasts travel the breadth of what once constituted Ancient Osirion, as
    lone wanderers or packs that never stray far from the ancestral borders of
    that old empire. The largest enclaves roam the deserts of modern Osirion and
    Thuvia, generally avoiding civilization until the urge to hunt overtakes
  - >-
    them. A handful of sizeable packs even hunt in the open wilds of Katapesh,
    seeking trade convoys to ambush. Deeper into the Brazen Peaks, a pack of
    shas has recently been harassing settlements of Pahmet dwarves between
    Oe-Tet and Erekrus, going so far as to stalk the dwarves as they travel
    between towns. Groups of shas dot the eastern edges of Rahadoum, where their
    infectious bites have strained the resources of many settlements that lack
    divine healing. For protection from these creatures, a handful of remote
    settlements and nomadic wanderers in Osirion once again embraced their
    ancient religions and began paying token homage to Set, hoping their meager
    efforts would stave off any further attacks from shas and Set beasts.
  - Set Beasts(CR 6)
  - >-
    The people of Osirion and northern Garund watch out for shas, but more
    threatening than those creatures are their ancient and powerful kin known as
    Set beasts. These Set beasts are even more closely tied to their patron, and
    Osirionologists claim that Set beasts were among the first of their kind
    created by the god himself.
  - >-
    A Set beast is a sha with both the advanced simple template and the fiendish
    simple template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 294). In addition to this, the Set
    beast gains the ability to speak and knows one additional language beyond
    Ancient Osiriani (typically Common or Infernal). More closely tied to Set's
    portfolio of storms, Set beasts also deal an additional 1d6 points of
    electricity damage with their bite attacks.
