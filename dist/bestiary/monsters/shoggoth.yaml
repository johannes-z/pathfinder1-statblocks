SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Around Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shoggoth's many sense organs grant a +4 racial bonus on Perception and
      immunity to flanking.
  - name: Maddening Cacophony (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a shoggoth can give voice to sounds and words sane life
      was not meant to hear. All creatures in a 60-foot radius must make a DC 22
      Will save or be confused for 1d6 rounds. Each round a creature is affected
      it takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. A creature that saves cannot be
      affected by this shoggoth's maddening cacophony for 24 hours. This is a
      sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

    description: >-
      To use this ability, the shoggoth must begin its turn grappling a creature
      or must trample. A shoggoth may attempt to engulf as many creatures as it
      grapples or tramples in a round. This ability otherwise functions as
      swallow whole, save that a creature that cuts is way out of a shoggoth
      leaves no hole in the protoplasmic creature's body.
Description:
  - >-
    Although even lunatics and doom-saying prophets desperately claim the
    monstrous shoggoth is nothing more than a drug-induced vision or thankfully
    unreal nightmare, the truth is altogether more dire. The shoggoths exist,
    although they keep to the deepest of ocean trenches or the most remote of
    forgotten caverns and ruins, emerging only rarely to spread madness and
    destruction in their slime-caked wakes.
  - >-
    The first shoggoths were created in eons past, long before the first gods
    turned their attentions to the Material Plane. Some hold that the aboleths
    engineered them, while certain strange texts hint of a race even older that
    engineered the first shoggoths as slaves. Eventually, these dread beasts
    developed enough intelligence to rebel against their creators, and now they
    lurk, patient but potent, in the lightless deep.
