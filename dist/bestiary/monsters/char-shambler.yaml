Description_Visual: >-
  The humanoid creature looks like a mass of charred skin, burned black and hard
  with cracks showing raw, red flesh beneath. Visible waves of heat rise from
  this creature and a miasma of foul smoke seems to follow its every shuffling
  step, and the stench of scorched flesh and acrid smoke clings to its flesh.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burning Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      A char shambler that wins a grapple check establishes a hold, latching
      onto the opponent's body and automatically doing bite damage each round
      that the hold is maintained. In addition the fire damage from the bite
      attack increases from 1d6 on the first round to 3d6 points of damage on
      the third round. As the char shambler makes this attack it slowly begins
      charring its opponent. If it kills an opponent in this manner, the
      victim's flesh and tissues are completely charred away while the char
      shambler inhales the resulting smoke for its sustenance. It then devours
      the scorched and crumbling bones in 1d4 rounds.
  - name: Desecrating Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Through the sheer foulness of its presence, a char shambler emits an aura
      within a 20- foot radius similar in effect to the secondary function of a
      desecrate spell (i.e. cutting off an area's connection to a non-associated
      deity and countering consecrate). This effect does not offer any bonuses
      to undead within the radius. Furthermore, it counters and dispels spells
      with the good descriptor within its area as if it was casting dispel magic
      as a 5th-level wizard.
  - name: Smoke Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      In addition to its stench, a char shambler continually gives off a cloud
      of acrid smoke from its scorched flesh. This cloud likewise affects all
      within 10 feet of the char shambler. The smoke provides concealment (20%
      miss chance) to those within the cloud and they must make a Fortitude save
      each round (DC 24, +1 per previous check) or spend that round coughing and
      choking. This is saving throw in addition to the sickening effects of the
      char shambler's stench. A character who chokes for 2 consecutive rounds
      takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. The save DC is Constitution-based
      and includes a +2 bonus from its Ability Focus feat. A char shambler is
      immune to the effects of smoke (its own or otherwise) and ignores the
      concealment it provides as well.
Description:
  - >-
    A char shambler is the result of a failed experiment to create a creature
    known as a charfiend (see Creature Collection by Sword and Sorcery Studios)
    from some base stock. The only documented examples come from the work of the
    lich Saca-Baroo and his experiments with the silid race (see The Tome of
    Horrors Complete by Frog God Games), but other examples may exist.
  - >-
    As described, a char shambler's skin is charred and broken, and the creature
    lives in constant searing pain from the failed process that created it. It
    typically stands 6 to 7 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds. Its face is a mask
    of charred flesh hiding the appearance of the original creature. This tough,
    charred shell provides it with good natural armor.
  - >-
    Whether a char shambler can speak or not is unknown, as none have ever been
    known to. They do respond to commands in Common when under magical
    compulsion or a similar condition.
  - >-
    A char shambler's existence is typically occupied by its never-ending desire
    to feed, and its actions tend to follow this course. When prey is spotted,
    it tries to disperse its enemies with its stench and smoke cloud so that it
    can focus on capturing and feeding on one individual without distractions.
