Description:
  - >-
    Geryon, the Great Serpent, rules Hell's fifth plane. His fortress, a large
    iron citadel located in the heart of a great city, is situated at the center
    of his plane. Geryon often leaves his fortress to wander the city, but
    rarely ever journeys beyond the city's gates. The city is a large, dark
    place filled with all manner of filth, waste, and creatures. Geryon is one
    of the most powerful arch-devils (by physical standards) and enjoys
    displaying his physical prowess to any who would watch, often destroying pit
    fiends or minor dukes for sheer pleasure and entertainment. While he is
    weaker than other arch-devils (in station and overall power), he has allied
    himself with Mephistopheles and as such is feared by many. For all of Hell's
    inhabitants know, if any can wrest the throne of Hell from Asmodeus, it is
    Mephistopheles, and Geryon wants to make sure he is on the winning side when
    the time comes to challenge the current Overlord.
  - Geryon is 20 feet tall and 30 feet long. He weighs about 8,000 pounds.
  - >-
    Geryon attacks with his massive fists and poisonous tail in combat. One of
    his favorite tactics is to grab an opponent and sting it to death with his
    tail.
  - >-
    Servants of Geryon Followers of Geryon are evil humanoids that revere
    serpents, some clans and tribes of lizardfolk, and several inphidian
    communities. Devout followers of Geryon are called Serpent Masters and must
    sign a pact of evil with Geryon. Serpent Masters can receive spells from
    Geryon and are granted access to two of the following domains: Evil, Law,
    and Strength.
