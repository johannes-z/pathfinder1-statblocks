Description:
  - >-
    Movanic devas serve as infantry in the celestial armies, though they spend
    most of their time patrolling the Positive, Negative, and Material Planes.
    On the Positive Plane, they watch over wandering good souls, which sometimes
    puts them into conf lict with the jyoti. On the Negative Plane, they battle
    undead, the sceaduinar, and the other strange things that hunt in the hungry
    void. Their rare visits to the Material Plane are usually to help powerful
    mortals when a great menace threatens to plunge an entire realm into evil.
