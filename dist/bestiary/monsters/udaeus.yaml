  - name: Armor and Weapon Training (Ex)
    description: >-
      Udaeoi are proficient with simple weapons, martial weapons, light armor,
      medium armor, heavy armor, and shields (including tower shields).
  - name: Energy Resistance (Ex)
    description: >-
      An udaeus has resistance 30 against one type of energy. By performing a
      ritual that takes one day, an udaeus can change its energy resistance to a
      different energy type (either acid, cold, electricity, or fire). Most
      udaeoi choose fire resistance unless they expect to fight a creature using
      a specific energy type.
  - name: Fighter Training (Ex)
    description: >-
      An udaeus counts its racial Hit Dice as fighter levels for the purpose of
      qualifying for feats. If it has levels in fighter, these HIt Dice stack.
  - name: Infuse Arms and Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any improvised weapon an udaeus wields is treated as a comparable normal
      weapon. Any normal weapon an udaeus wields is treated as a masterwork
      weapon. Any masterwork weapon it wields is treated as a weapon with a
      magical +1 enhancement bonus. Any weapon with a magical enhancement bonus
      it wields is treated as though its enhancement bonus were 1 higher than
      its actual value (to a maximum of +6). This ability also applies to armor
      and shields (normal is treated as masterwork, masterwork is treated as +1,
      and +1 or higher is treated as 1 higher than actual).
Description:
  - >-
    An udaeus (plural udaeoi) is a fierce humanoid who's obsessed with
    perfecting its skills at war. The first udaeoi were obedient warriors
    created by a deity out of dragon teeth, but now they are a distinct race and
    capable of reproducing on their own. Though an udaeus loves combat and is
    eager to demonstrate its abilities, it is violent only when it's in an
    honorable battle; only a desperate or manipulated udaeus would resort to
    thuggery. Udaeoi resemble tall, athletic humans with bone-white skin and
    black hair. They mark themselves with tattoos or brands, usually of weapons,
    dragons, or battle scenes. When an udaeus hardens its flesh with its innate
    magic, these markings look like carvings and cracks in a marble statue.
    Udaeoi might hire themselves out as mercenaries or serve as soldiers in a
    local army. Udaeoi prefer to fight alongside their own kind, and a squadron
    usually comprises members of the same fighting company or family unit.
