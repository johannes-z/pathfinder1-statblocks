SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Soul Lock (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a shoki can use its +2 cold iron quarterstaff to capture the
      soul of a creature at the threshold of death-any undead creature or being
      with 0 or fewer hit points. The target must succeed at a DC 19 Will save
      or be slain, its spirit locked within the shoki's staff. A corporeal
      undead transforms into a corpse if affected by this ability, while an
      incorporeal undead is trapped bodily within the staff (this ability
      cancels a ghost's ability to rejuvenate). A spirit trapped within a
      shoki's staff cannot be returned to life through any means short of true
      resurrection, miracle, or wish. A trapped soul can be freed if the shoki
      wills it, or by casting banishment, dismissal, or freedom upon the staff.
      A shoki's staff can only contain one soul at a time. The save DC is
      Wisdom-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Shokis are the collectors of lingering souls, tasked with compelling even
    the most deluded beings to take the first step into the River of Souls.
    Their tactics are varied, but most start by counseling the wayward dead
    using theosophical arguments and blunt warnings of the ravenous things that
    wait to feed upon lost spirits. Each shoki bears powerful tools to aid it in
    such pursuits-eclectic collections of holy symbols and withered staves of
    cold iron capable of imprisoning a single soul. Shokis only use their staves
    against the most stubborn or demented souls, whom they capture and
    personally escort to the Boneyard for judgment.
