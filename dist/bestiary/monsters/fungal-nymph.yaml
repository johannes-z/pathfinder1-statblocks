Description:
  - >-
    A fungal creature is an animate plant with the appearance of a living
    creature. It grows from spores implanted in the dead body of a host
    creature, and takes on the host creature's basic form and many of that
    creature's abilities. It retains none of the memories of the creature it
    grew from, yet it instinctively knows how to use the abilities it inherited
    from its host. How exactly this is possible is a question that continues to
    befuddle scholars. The leading theory is that the spores' precise modeling
    of their host succeeds in capturing some of the creature's
    physiology-essentially copying its mind-but that for some reason the
    departure of the creature's spirit or soul upon death prevents the spores
    from copying the memories as well. Fungal creatures are often content to sit
    in quiet contemplation, absorbing the nutrients they require from the
    life-giving earth. But when faced with living creatures, the overwhelming
    biological need to reproduce takes over, and the fungal creatures try to
    seed their spores into new hosts to spawn the next generation of fungal
    creatures. Fungal creatures have the general appearance of the base
    creatures from which they spawned, but their skin is pale fungus rather than
    flesh and blood. Mushroom caps and shelf fungi sprout from a fungal
    creature's body, along with fungal gills to deliver the fungal creature's
    spores. As with many types of fungi, a fungal creature's flesh is poisonous,
    and any creature that ingests any part of a fungal creature's body risks
    infection by its spores (as described in the create spawn ability and fungal
    spores poison on the facing page). The fungal nymph presented here is built
    using the nymph from the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary. See page 217 of the
    Bestiary for rules on this creature's blinding beauty, inspiration, spells,
    stunning glance, unearthly grace, and wild empathy abilities.
  - CREATING A FUNGAL CREATURE
  - >-
    "Fungal creature" is an inherited template that can be added to any
    corporeal, living creature susceptible to Constitution damage (referred to
    hereafter as the base creature). A fungal creature uses all the base
    creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
  - 'CR: Same as the base creature +1.'
  - >-
    Type: The creature's type changes to plant (augmented). Do not recalculate
    base class Hit Dice, BAB, saves, or skill points.
  - 'Senses: A fungal creature gains darkvision 60 feet.'
  - >-
    Armor Class: The fungal growths that appear on a fungal creature's body
    increase the base creature's natural armor bonus by 2.
  - 'Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected.'
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: A fungal creature gains immunity to disease in addition
    to all of the standard plant traits.
  - >-
    Speed: Each of a fungal creature's speeds decreases by 10 feet from those of
    the base creature (minimum 5 feet).
  - >-
    Attacks: A fungal creature retains all the natural weapons, manufactured
    weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. If the base
    creature has no other natural attacks, the fungal creature gains a slam
    attack that deals damage based on the fungal creature's size.
  - 'Special Attacks: A fungal creature gains the following.'
  - >-
    Create Spawn (Ex): A creature killed by Constitution damage from a fungal
    creature's poison spore cloud transforms into a fungal spawn over a period
    of 24 hours. A plant growth spell halves the transformation time, and a
    diminish plants spell doubles it. A blight spell destroys the fungal spores
    and prevents the corpse's transformation, but spells that remove disease are
    ineffective against the growing spores. Once a creature fully transforms
    into a fungal spawn, the corpse from which it grew is destroyed. A fungal
    spawn gains the fungal creature template, but it loses all class levels and
    memories of the base creature from which it was spawned. If the base
    creature has 1 or fewer racial Hit Dice and normally has class levels, use a
    1st-level warrior version of it as the base creature. The fungal spawn
    awakens as a free-willed being that knows all it needs to know (including
    language) in order to use its abilities and survive. Although it bears no
    allegiance to the fungal creature that created it, the new fungal creature
    immediately recognizes other fungal creatures as its own kind.
  - >-
    Poison Spore Cloud (Ex): Once per day, a fungal creature can release a
    choking cloud of spores in a 15-foot-radius spread that lingers in the air
    for 10 rounds. This cloud functions as an inhaled poison. Any breathing
    creature in the cloud must succeed at a Fortitude save or inhale the spores.
    A creature that remains in the area of the spore cloud must continue to
    attempt Fortitude saves against its effects. Multiple spore clouds from
    multiple fungal creatures require multiple saves from any creature in an
    area where the clouds overlap. Fungal Spores: Poison- inhaled; save Fort DC
    10 + 1/2 the fungal creature's racial Hit Dice + the fungal creature's Con
    modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con damage and fatigued
    for 1 minute; cure 2 saves.
  - >-
    Poisonous Blood (Ex): A fungal creature's blood and flesh are ingested
    poisons. Any creature that makes a bite attack against a fungal creature,
    swallows one whole, or otherwise ingests part of one must succeed at a
    Fortitude save or be aff licted by the poison. A fungal creature can drain
    its own blood to procure an ingested poison that functions as described
    above. However, its blood has a distinctive and largely unwelcome smell and
    taste, so most intelligent creatures would refuse to eat food tainted with
    it unless the taste was thoroughly disguised (which requires a successful DC
    15 Profession [cook] check). The fungal creature must deal at least 1 point
    of damage to itself to get a full dose of poison, and the drawn blood (or
    amputated flesh) retains its poisonous nature for only 24 hours unless
    additional living fungal blood is mixed into it. Fungal Blood or Flesh:
    Poison-ingested; save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 the fungal creature's racial Hit Dice
    + the fungal creature's Con modifier; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes;
    effect 1 Str damage, 1 Dex damage, and nauseated for 1 minute; cure 2 saves.
  - >-
    Special Qualities: A fungal creature gains the following. Fungal Metabolism
    (Ex): Fungal creatures breathe, but they do not eat or sleep in the typical
    manner. Rejuvenation (Ex): A fungal creature gains all the sustenance it
    requires from contact with moist natural earth, but it must rejuvenate
    itself as often and for as long as humans need sleep. As long as it is in
    contact with moist natural earth, a resting fungal creature regains hit
    points as though it were undergoing complete bed rest and long term care (4
    hit points per Hit Die for each day of rest). The fungal creature can engage
    in light activity during rejuvenation, but any strenuous activity (like
    fighting, running, or casting a spell) prevents it from regaining hit points
    for that day. Complete bed rest doesn't increase the amount of healing a
    fungal creature gains from rejuvenation.
  - 'Abilities: Str +4, Dex -2 (minimum 1), Con +4.'
  - >-
    Languages: If a fungal creature is able to speak, it gains the ability to
    speak Sylvan in addition to any other languages the base creature knows.
