Description_Visual: >-
  This shambling humanoid's taut gray skin shows signs of arcane symbols now
  faded with age and decay. Long, darkwood spikes riddle its body; every inch of
  flesh is staked and violated. A palpable aura of entropy and despair hangs
  over the sorry, perforated creature.

  - name: Sacrilegious Aura (Sp)
    description: >-
      The overwhelming entropic energies and the sheer number of voidsticks
      animating the voidstick zombie warp and augment negative and positive
      energy around the creature. As with all voidsticks, an aura of intense
      negative energy extends in a 30-foot radius from the zombie functioning as
      the spell desecrate. Undead within this aura receive a +1 profane bonus on
      attack and damage rolls and the DC to resist channeled negative energy
      increases by +3. The voidstick zombie constantly gains the benefits of
      this effect (the attack and damage bonuses are already incorporated into
      its statistics). In addition, this miasma of void energies also interferes
      with wielding positive energy. Any creature attempting to use positive
      energy in this area-such as through a cleric's channel energy ability, a
      paladin's lay on hands, or any spell with the healing descriptor-must make
      a DC 25 concentration check. If this check fails, the effect is blocked,
      consuming one use of the ability, or the spell is lost.
Description:
  - >-
    The voidstick zombie is the hateful creation of wicked shamans and
    necromancers, who use voidsticks to animate the dead. One voidstick is
    required for every Hit Die possessed by the base creature. These vile
    devices, each of which is 6 to 10 inches in length, are pierced through the
    living or dead body of a creature, pumping the dark energy of the void into
    its form. Packed with the bitter entropy of negative energy, the creature
    rises, seeking out the life force of others with endless sadness and insane
    determination. Its single goal is to extinguish life and smother any source
    of positive energy. Multiple voidsticks in a creature's form feed one
    another, augmenting their standard abilities and imbuing the touch of the
    voidstick zombie with the power to drain life from anything it touches. The
    zombie becomes almost a sliver of the void itself, existing in a state of
    such negative power that its very proximity can tamper with other creatures'
    abilities to summon the powers of the Positive Energy Plane, and with the
    perpetual sadness that numbs its own intellect it gains the power to enhance
    and inf luence other creatures that depend on negative energy.
  - >-
    These sad creatures, wracked with soulless negative energy, constantly
    hunger for destruction, delighted at every chance they get to snuff the
    spark of life from the living. They hunt the islands throughout the
    Shackles, especially the Cannibal Isles, where their creation began long
    before its current inhabitants made their home there.
  - >-
    As the brutal and savage kuru people of the Cannibal Isles explored the
    ruins of Ghol-Gan, they discovered the foul magic involved with the
    voidsticks, and as they turned to barbarism and cannibalism, their shamans
    carved these devices and created the first voidstick zombie seen on Golarion
    in thousands of years. The kuru use voidstick zombies for war against each
    other and to serve as ruthless hunters, culling humanoids who wander too
    close to their blood-drenched islands. Kuru shamans create the vile
    voidsticks in order to enhance their own necromantic strength as well as to
    animate voidstick zombies. In some tribes it is seen as a great honor to be
    transformed into one of these powerful creatures, and some aged shamans on
    the eve of their death elect to undergo this transformation instead of
    becoming a ritual meal for their tribes.
  - >-
    Since the rediscovery of voidsticks, those interested in necromancy and the
    creation of new undead have sent emissaries to the Shackles eager to buy
    them. These enterprising necromancers experiment with the devices and
    unleash voidstick zombies into Avistan and Garund to fulfill their murderous
    intent.

    Voidsticks In remote parts of the world, it is not always practical for the
    faithful to visit holy places with any regularity. In particular, the weak,
    the sick, and the dying may be in no position to trek across plains or risk
    dangerous water crossings to see their spiritual leaders. In response to
    this, the godstick was born-a crafted rod that serves as a portable shrine,
    carried by shamans and witchdoctors and pushed into the ground to focus
    devotion at any location. Ingenuity is not just the way of the benign,
    however, and just as often it is the way of evil. Before long, shamans who
    worshiped more hateful deities corrupted this notion; they created the
    voidsticks and drove them into bodies, living or dead, charging those bodies
    with the power of the endless void and creating rattling, hungry
    abominations.

  - DESCRIPTION
  - >-
    Each voidstick is 6 t0 10 inches long, with a diameter of about an inch.
    Carved from single pieces of polished darkwood, they often display markings
    or symbols sacred to the deity of their creator, but can just as easily be
    plain and smooth. Planting a voidstick into the ground with an appropriate
    prayer is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The
    device floods the area with negative energy, producing an effect identical
    to the desecrate spell in a 20- foot radius. In addition, any evil divine
    caster within 20 feet of the voidstick may cast her spells without the need
    for any material component with a value of 10 gp or less, or any focus item
    with a value of 50 gp or less. This ability functions only for the
    individual planting the voidstick and persists until the stick is uprooted.
  - >-
    While this is a useful tool for shamans in locations poorly serviced by
    trade in magical goods, it pales in comparison to the voidstick's most
    potent function: the creation of undead. Creating a voidstick zombie
    requires an hour-long ritual during which foul symbols are drawn across a
    corpse's flesh. At the end of the hour, the creator must make a DC 25
    Knowledge (religion) check before driving the first voidstick into the
    victim's heart. If this check succeeds, the victim is transformed into a
    voidstick zombie. To fully animate the creature, one voidstick must be used
    for each Hit Die the base creature has. In 12 rounds, the creature rises
    under its own power, eager to spread its negative energy and snuff out life
    nearby. Undead created using voidsticks are not under the control of their
    creator but can be commanded using channeled negative energy, spells, or
    similar effects.
  - >-
    Voidsticks can also be driven into a living body to slay the creature and
    transition it to undeath. If a living body is used, the creature must be
    pinned or otherwise helpless for the duration of the entire ritual. When the
    ritual is complete and the first voidstick is inserted, the creature must
    make a DC 18 Fortitude save. If this save succeeds, the creature is reduced
    to 0 hit points and is dying, but the magic of the voidstick and the ritual
    are wasted and the ritual must be performed again, using another voidstick.
    If the save fails, the creature dies and the ritual is successful,
    transforming the base creature into a voidstick zombie.

    Undead that contain such an item benefit from the +2 bonus hit points per
    Hit Die for having been created in the area of an enhanced desecrate spell.
