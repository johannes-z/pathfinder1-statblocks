Description:
  - >-
    Born of mysterious origins and raised by unknowing foster parents,
    changelings are the children of hags and their tricked lovers. Most do not
    know of their monstrous origins, but there comes a time in every
    changeling's life when these roots begin to call out to their host, urging
    the confused girl toward some end she cannot identify. Changelings are
    always female, tall, and slender. A changeling's hair is typically dark and
    her skin abnormally pale, but she otherwise looks for all practical purposes
    like a member of her father's race. A frequent but not universal trait of
    changelings is their mismatched, different-colored eyes. Upon reaching
    puberty and adulthood, the average changeling stands approximately 5-1/2
    feet tall and weighs about 110 pounds. Ecology When a hag of any sort
    conceives a child with a man, the result is a changeling. The male parent is
    usually eaten or killed by his partner before he can see the offspring, or
    else flees the area in shame upon discovering the true nature of his lover,
    and the hag herself interacts with the child just long enough to set it on
    the stoop of some unsuspecting family or temple. Depending on the race of
    her father, a changeling can resemble any type of humanoid, including
    dwarves, gnomes, and even orcs and goblins. A changeling and her new family
    are never aware of the strange child's true parents, but in most cases
    everyone involved is keenly aware that there is something odd about the
    frail child with the ghostly pallor. Even the young girl herself can easily
    see that she possesses abilities others do not-powers that are subtle at
    younger ages and only truly begin to manifest themselves when she reaches
    adolescence. It is around puberty that the changeling begins to hear what
    hags refer to as "the call," a hypnotic, spiritual voice that only she can
    hear and that beckons her to travel. To where, the changeling does not know,
    but the underlying prospect of finding out her true origins is often enough
    to drive the girl to seek out the source of this mystical voice. The voice
    is in fact that of the changeling's birth mother, who forms a coven with two
    others hags in order to summon her child back to her, now that she is old
    enough to fully transform into a hag. This transformative ritual is a
    barbaric one that only the most determined changelings willingly go through;
    upon arriving at the coven, it is usually too late to turn back for
    changelings who were merely drawn to the voice by curiosity. Those who seek
    power, however, identify with the hags, and happily go through the ordeal in
    order to unlock their dormant abilities. Regardless of her desires, though,
    a changeling who has undergone the transformation cannot go back; once she
    becomes a hag, she remains a hag, and her mind turns as wicked as her form
    has turned hideous. Changelings who ignore the call eventually cease to hear
    it. In this case, a hag mother sometimes disguises herself and ventures into
    civilization, seeking out her daughter. If she finds her, she lures the girl
    back to the coven, where she can perform the ritual of transformation. The
    process of performing the call or physically retrieving the changeling is
    taxing, though, and many hags find it easier to simply lure in another mate
    and birth another changeling in hopes that this one will heed the
    evertantalizing call. Habitat & Society Raised wherever she will be
    accepted, a changeling has no real say in the habitat she grows up in.
    Families who inadvertently raise changelings often react in one of two ways
    toward the strange child's development of supernatural powers: they either
    embrace the girl, nurturing her and her gift, or they disown her as an
    abomination, casting her out into a world of loneliness and resentment. Of
    course, this reaction to her power often has a huge inf luence over the
    changeling's course of action as a young adult. Changelings who are accepted
    by their adopted society often don't see the need to follow their mothers'
    voices, instead using their powers for their own ends, whereas shunned
    individuals almost always answer the call and become treacherous hags with
    embittered hearts and shattered souls. Hags usually prefer to mate with the
    prevalent and fecund humans of Golarion, producing changelings that resemble
    humans. Changelings of other races do occur, but their attitude and outlook
    are much more dependent on the attitudes of their adoptive parents than on
    their racial background. Changelings rarely band together with other
    changelings, as hags only seldom allow their unions to result in offspring,
    and changelings encountering others of their type may never recognize their
    shared origins. Thus, the abandoned offspring graft themselves into whatever
    society will accept them, adapting to new roles with remarkable ease. If a
    changeling chooses to heed the call that beckons her as a young woman, she
    quickly finds herself in an entirely different sort of society: hags, though
    accepting of their own brood, are quite unlike any other creatures, and
    their form of culture is so primitive and evil that it can hardly be called
    culture at all. A changelingturned- hag follows the same patterns as her
    mother and other brethren, eventually charming an unwitting suitor and
    creating a changeling offspring of her own, repeating the vicious cycle.
    Having no innate predisposition toward evil, a changeling's values are
    solely a product of her environment, and any given individual is just as
    likely to perform evil as she is to act righteously. Often, though, a
    changeling's slightly unusual appearance marks her as the target for
    harassment, potentially leading her toward a vengeful path. Any means of
    releasing innate magical energy is good enough for the changeling, and many
    become witches. Changeling Characters Changelings are defined by their class
    levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All changelings have the
    following racial traits. -2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma:
    Changelings are frail, but possess a sharp wit and unnatural beauty. Hag
    Trait: A changeling possesses one of the following traits, depending on the
    type of hag her mother is. Hulking Changeling: A changeling who was born of
    an annis hag is much more physically formidable than other changelings. You
    receive a +1 trait bonus on any damage you inf lict with a melee attack.
    Green Widow: A changeling of green hag descent is naturally able to lure in
    potential mates and effectively trick them into pursuing her. You gain a +2
    trait bonus on Bluff checks made against characters that might be sexually
    attracted to you. Sea Lungs: A changeling with a sea hag mother can survive
    underwater for longer than usual. You gain the ability to hold your breath
    for a number of rounds equal to three times your Constitution score instead
    of two. Claws: A changeling's hands and fingernails tend to harden and
    become sharp as she reaches adolescence. This gives her the claw (1d4)
    natural attack. Natural Armor: Hags and their offspring have uncommonly
    tough skin. A changeling begins play with a natural armor bonus of +1.
    Darkvision: Changelings can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Languages:
    Changelings begin play speaking the primary language of their host society
    and Common. Changelings who have high Intelligence scores can choose from
