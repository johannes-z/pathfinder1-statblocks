      A tataka's unarmed strikes deal 2d6 points of damage. If a tataka gains
      monk levels, it uses its tataka unarmed strike damage or its monk unarmed
      strike damage, whichever is higher. Its unarmed strikes function as lawful
      and evil weapons for overcoming damage reduction. Spells A tataka casts
      spells as a 12th-level sorcerer. A tataka can cast spells from the cleric
      list as well as those normally available to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are
      considered arcane spells for a tataka.
Description:
  - >-
    Tataka rakshasas are the least subtle and largest of their kind. They are
    philosophers and fanatics, loyal servants of the rakshasa immortals. Their
    familiarity with religion and its trappings makes them excellent corruptors
    and blasphemers. Such rakshasas might assault sacred sites or rituals
    directly so as to foil good works and slay holy people. A tataka holds all
    religions in contempt save the worship of rakshasas, and it openly mocks and
    assaults any who dare believe otherwise.
  - >-
    Tataka rakshasas are more than zealots, though, and they train from an early
    age in martial arts-their strikes can break bones as surely as any unarmed
    strike from a monk or other practitioner of such styles of combat.
  - A typical tataka is 12 feet tall and weighs 1,300 pounds.
