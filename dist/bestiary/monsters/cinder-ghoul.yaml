SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Limited Gaseous Form (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because it has solid body parts that constantly float and swirl within it,
      a cinder ghoul has a limited version of the gaseous form ability. Although
      other gaseous creatures can issue under the crack of a door, a cinder
      ghoul cannot. A cinder ghoul can, however, make slam attacks, retains its
      natural armor bonus, and all supernatural attacks. Spells, spell-like
      abilities, and supernatural abilities affect them normally. A cinder ghoul
      cannot enter water or other liquid. It is not ethereal or incorporeal, and
      is affected by winds or other forms of moving air to the extent that the
      wind pushes them in the direction the wind is moving. However, even the
      strongest wind can't disperse or damage a cinder ghoul. Because it
      contains burning embers and small bits of perpetually smoldering flesh, a
      cinder ghoul cannot hide and gets no bonuses to Stealth checks in an area
      of mist, smoke, or other gas.
  - name: Smoke Inhalation (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a cinder ghoul can attempt to force some of its
      smoky form into the lungs of a living opponent. To initiate this attack it
      must move into its target's space. The target must then make a successful
      DC 18 Fortitude save or inhale part of the creature. Smoke inside the
      victim's lungs burns the surrounding tissues and organs, dealing 1d2
      points of Constitution damage each round. The affected creature can
      attempt another Fortitude save each round to cough out the burning
      residue. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A creature that is burned to death by magical fire may rise again as a fiery
    undead being called a cinder ghoul. The lairs of old red dragons may be
    haunted by many of these pathetic, angry spirits, and many a wizard that has
    dispatched a foe with a well-placed fireball has been found mysteriously
    charred to death many months after the deed.
  - >-
    Cinder ghouls are barely intelligent, but they do have a very vivid
    recollection of the pain they endured in the moments before their death.
  - >-
    Filled with anger as fiery as the flames that took their life, cinder ghouls
    harbor a strong hatred of fire and any living creature that has control over
    it.
  - >-
    Although it cannot speak, the sound of wailing and screaming and the rushing
    of fire-stoked wind constantly accompany a cinder ghoul.
  - >-
    In melee a cinder ghoul slams with the charred remains of its fists. If a
    cinder ghoul encounters an opponent that demonstrates any form of control
    over fire-either through casting a fire spell or using a magic item that
    produces fire-it attacks that opponent to the exclusion of all others.
