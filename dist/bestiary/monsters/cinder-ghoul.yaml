Description:
  - >-
    A creature that is burned to death by magical fire may rise again as a fiery
    undead being called a cinder ghoul. The lairs of old red dragons may be
    haunted by many of these pathetic, angry spirits, and many a wizard that has
    dispatched a foe with a well-placed fireball has been found mysteriously
    charred to death many months after the deed.
  - >-
    Cinder ghouls are barely intelligent, but they do have a very vivid
    recollection of the pain they endured in the moments before their death.
  - >-
    Filled with anger as fiery as the flames that took their life, cinder ghouls
    harbor a strong hatred of fire and any living creature that has control over
    it.
  - >-
    Although it cannot speak, the sound of wailing and screaming and the rushing
    of fire-stoked wind constantly accompany a cinder ghoul.
  - >-
    In melee a cinder ghoul slams with the charred remains of its fists. If a
    cinder ghoul encounters an opponent that demonstrates any form of control
    over fire-either through casting a fire spell or using a magic item that
    produces fire-it attacks that opponent to the exclusion of all others.
