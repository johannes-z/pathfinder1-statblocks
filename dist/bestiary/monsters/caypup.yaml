SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Thunderous Growl (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a caypup can issue a rumbling growl from its throat
      that sounds like distant thunder and scares away potential attackers.
      Creatures within 15 feet of the caypup must succeed at a DC 12 Will save
      to attack the caypup (as if affected by sanctuary). The caypup can choose
      to bestow the same effect on an adjacent ally as well. This effect lasts
      for 3 rounds or until the caypup or its ally attacks (whichever comes
      first), after which time the caypup must wait at least 1d6 rounds before
      using this ability again. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Cayhounds-as fickle and determined as their patron god and master, Cayden
    Cailean-sometimes birth pups on the Material Plane or Elysium. These
    half-celestial offspring are known to mortals as caypups.
  - >-
    Like their otherworldly forebears, caypups are driven to perform acts of
    good and to halt wrongdoing in the lands they roam. Caypups sometimes join
    adventurers in hopes of reenacting the legendary deeds of Cayden Cailean and
    his hound, Thunder. A 7th-level spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat
    can gain a caypup as a familiar.
  - >-
    After maturing through infancy, caypups reach an adolescent state that they
    occupy for their entire lives. Resembling juvenile mastiffs with rust-red
    fur and piercing blue eyes, caypups are 4 feet from nose to tail and weigh
    about 75 pounds.
