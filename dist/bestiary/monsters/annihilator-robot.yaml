SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Booster Jets (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a swift action up to 10 times per hour, an annihilator robot can gain a
      fly speed of 60 feet (poor maneuverability) for a duration of 1 minute.
  - name: Chain Guns (Ex)
    description: >-
      These advanced firearms have a range increment of 200 feet, automatically
      reload as a free action, and never misfire. An annihilator's core can
      process scrap metal into new ammunition, effectively giving the
      annihilator infinite ammo with these weapons.
  - name: Combined Arms (Ex)
    description: >-
      When taking a full attack action, an annihilator can attack with melee and
      ranged integrated weapons simultaneously.
  - name: Plasma Lance (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once every 3 rounds, an annihilator may fire a
      120-foot-long line of plasma from its tail. All creatures in this area
      take 20d6 points of plasma damage (Reflex DC 22 halves). The save DC is
      Intelligence-based.
  - name: Suppressing Fire (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an annihilator can use its chain guns to fire in a
      100-foot cone. When it does so, it makes a single chain gun attack against
      every target in this area.
Description:
  - >-
    The first known annihilator rampaged through western Numeria in 4709 ar,
    destroying dozens of towns and villages before retreating with more than a
    dozen prisoners into the Felldales. Since then, increasing numbers of these
    immense and devastating robots have been spotted in the region. Annihilators
    seem driven to destroy structures and slaughter living foes, yet they often
    gather up the dying and unconscious from battlefields-their purpose for
    keeping these battered but still-living prisoners is unknown.
