Description:

    Chike are savage crocodilian humanoids (called Crocfolk by other races) that
    make their homes deep within swamps and marshlands. They are believed to be
    descended from or related to actual crocodiles, though scholars cannot find
    a link between the two somewhat related creatures. Chike usually live in
    small tribal villages of up to 40 individuals led by a tribal leader
    (usually the strongest of the group). Buildings are constructed of whatever
    natural resources and materials the chike can find. Larger tribes also have
    one or two shamans in their midst. Chike are extremely territorial,
    generally sharing their domain only with actual crocodiles. Some tribes
    however do associate with marsh-dwelling races such as lizardfolk engaging
    in trade and allying against common enemies.

    Chike are diurnal hunters, preferring the heat of the day vs. the cold and
    darkness of night. Favored meals include birds, fish, humans, goblins, and
    reptiles (including other chike if food truly becomes scarce). Being
    cold-blooded, a chike's metabolism allows it to survive up to 3 months
    without eating.
  - >-
    Chike males stand over 8 feet tall while females stand just about 8 feet
    tall on average. Greenish-brown scales cover the chike's back while their
    sides and underbellies are generally smooth and lighter in color. Chike
    reproduce on average once per year with the female laying up to six eggs at
    a time. Eggs are buried deep within their muddy lair in a special incubation
    hut. The female spends most of her time with the eggs until they hatch. Both
    the eggs and young are protected by all adults in the tribe. Females fight
    to the death to protect their eggs and young.

    Chike are feared by many other races for their brutality and savagery in
    battle. These creatures prefer to use weapons and a fearsome bite, but
    particularly savage chike forego weapons and simply rend their opponents to
    pieces using their powerful claws. When hunting, chike submerge in water,
    leaving only their eyes and snout exposed. When their quarry moves within
    range, chike spring to attack. Though chike possess tails, they do not
    normally use them in combat.
