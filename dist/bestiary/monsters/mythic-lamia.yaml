Description:
  - >-
    A mythic lamia dabbled in dark pacts or strange magic in an attempt to break
    the ancient curse that gives her a monstrous form, but instead gained the
    ability to change her shape as well as other magical abilities. Impressed by
    her progress but angered by her lack of complete success, she continues her
    research and plotting.
  - Lamia Matriarch
  - >-
    In most cases, a mythic lamia will permanently transform into a lamia
    matriarch (Bestiary 2 175), losing her mythic power as she stabilizes in
    that form. A lamia matriarch that gains mythic power gains the mythic
    lamia's aura of seduction, a tail slap attack, grab, and constrict. She
    increases her sorcerer caster level to 8th and usually learns spells that
    aid her minions, such as freedom of movement and rage. She may use her touch
    attack to drain Wisdom or drain one use of mythic power from the target and
    regain one of her own uses of mythic power (save negates).
