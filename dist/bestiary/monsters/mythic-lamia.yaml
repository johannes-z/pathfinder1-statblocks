SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Seduction (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature within 30 feet of a mythic lamia must succeed at a DC 16 Will
      save or become fascinated. A creature that succeeds at this save is immune
      to the lamia's aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The
      save DC is Charisma-based. Spells A mythic lamia casts spells as a
      6th-level sorcerer, and can cast spells from the cleric list as well as
      those normally available to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered
      arcane spells for a mythic lamia.
  - name: Wisdom Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A lamia drains 1d4 points of Wisdom each time she hits with her melee
      touch attack. (Unlike with other kinds of ability drain attacks, a lamia
      does not heal any damage when she uses her Wisdom drain.) Lamias try to
      use this power early in an encounter to make foes more susceptible to
      charm monster and suggestion.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic lamia dabbled in dark pacts or strange magic in an attempt to break
    the ancient curse that gives her a monstrous form, but instead gained the
    ability to change her shape as well as other magical abilities. Impressed by
    her progress but angered by her lack of complete success, she continues her
    research and plotting.
  - Lamia Matriarch
  - >-
    In most cases, a mythic lamia will permanently transform into a lamia
    matriarch (Bestiary 2 175), losing her mythic power as she stabilizes in
    that form. A lamia matriarch that gains mythic power gains the mythic
    lamia's aura of seduction, a tail slap attack, grab, and constrict. She
    increases her sorcerer caster level to 8th and usually learns spells that
    aid her minions, such as freedom of movement and rage. She may use her touch
    attack to drain Wisdom or drain one use of mythic power from the target and
    regain one of her own uses of mythic power (save negates).
