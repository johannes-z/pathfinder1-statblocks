  Surrounded by a nimbus of near-blinding light, this strange creature looks

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blinding Light (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shining child can radiate a 60-foot-radius aura of blinding light as a
      free action. Creatures within the affected area must succeed on a DC 25
      Fortitude save or be permanently blinded. A creature that successfully
      saves cannot be affected again by the same shining child's aura for 24
      hours. The save is Constitution-based.
  - name: Burning Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      A shining child corrupts the positive energy within a living creature into
      an unnatural burning light. For the next 5 rounds after a successful touch
      attack by a shining child, the target takes 2d6 points of fire damage. The
      burning light can be "extinguished" by casting darkness or deeper darkness
      on the target, or by entering an area of natural darkness (not counting
      the light from the burning target).
  - name: Radiant Armor (Su)
    description: >-
      The light that surrounds a shining child grants a deflection bonus to its
      AC equal to its Charisma bonus. The bonus is negated as long as the
      shining child is in the area of effect of a spell with the darkness
      descriptor that is at least 3rd level.
  - name: Searing Ray (Su)
    description: >-
      A shining child's primary attack is a ray of searing light. This attack
      has a range of 120 feet. The ray deals double damage to undead creatures.
Description:
  - >-
    Creatures of burning light and strange geometry, shining children are a
    terror to behold. Beyond the flares of energy that constantly burst from
    their forms (particularly in beam-like gouts from their eyes and mouths),
    the creatures are vaguely humanoid, with strange hands that each bear four
    fingers. Occasionally summoned by powerful wizards in search of rare arcane
    knowledge, the shining children (who disdain individual names) communicate
    via telepathy, a psychic roar like metal tearing that sometimes resolves
    into strained and raspy words.
  - >-
    Though they harbor many secrets, their greatest secret may be their own
    origin. Numerous theories abound-that the shining children are beings from
    another dimension, avatars of a dying star grown sentient, or creatures of
    light battling living darkness at the edge of reality. A shining child
    stands just over 4-1/2 feet tall and weighs 85 pounds.
