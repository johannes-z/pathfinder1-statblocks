  tentacles it uses to pull itself along the ground.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bellow (Su)
    description: >-
      A herald of Tsathogga has two distinct bellows, each usable once every 1d4
      rounds. The first is a trilling croak like that of a frog. All opponents
      with 30 feet hearing this trilling must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save
      or be deafened for 1d6+4 rounds. Opponents within 10 feet must make a DC
      22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Alternately, a herald can
      focus its bellow attack against a single opponent within 100 feet. The
      opponent takes 5d6 points of sonic damage. A successful DC 22 Reflex save
      reduces the damage by half. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Bloated (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because of its bloated, heavy body, a herald of Tsathogga that attacks
      with more than 5 tentacles in one round cannot move that round.
  - name: Regeneration (Ex)
    description: >-
      A herald of Tsathogga takes normal damage from fire and good-aligned
      weapons, and from spells or effects with the good descriptor.
Description:
  - >-
    The dark, dismal tropical swamps and fens of the world are home to a
    horrible creature known only as the herald of Tsathogga. A vaguely froglike
    thing almost 20 feet across, the herald of Tsathogga is a nightmare creature
    that is spoken of only in hushed whispers. The creature is believed to have
    been created by the Frog God as punishment against humanity for wrongdoings
    done to Tsathogga and his worshippers.
  - >-
    Its warty, putrid skin is a pale yellow-green, and two monstrous eyes that
    have seen unknown secrets gaze from its fleshy face. The body of the thing
    resembles that of a massive toad, but rather than legs the herald of
    Tsathogga drags itself through the murky terrain on ten thick tentacles.
  - These tentacles are covered in tiny lancets that inject paralytic venom.
  - >-
    Some who have seen the herald of Tsathogga swear that it is capable of
    flight, but these reports are dismissed as madman's fantasy.
  - >-
    Though only one herald is thought to exist, rumors as of late, speak of at
    least three of these creatures in existence.
  - >-
    A herald of Tsathogga attacks first with its tentacles, attempting to
    paralyze or otherwise incapacitate as many opponents as possible.
  - >-
    Paralyzed opponents are pulled to the creature's maw and bitten. Its
    tentacles are not coordinated enough to grab moving targets, so it cannot
    pick up opponents that have not been paralyzed.
