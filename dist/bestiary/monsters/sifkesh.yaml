SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Charisma Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      Sifkesh's claw leaves hideous scars that resist healing even via magic;
      these scars manifest as Charisma drain. The more scars a victim gains in
      this manner, the more despondent and depressed its personality grows. A
      creature whose Charisma score is drained to 3 or lower by this attack
      automatically fails any Will save against any spell-like ability or
      supernatural attack made by Sifkesh. A successful DC 41 Will save resists
      the Charisma drain inflicted by this attack, and instead causes the victim
      to be sickened for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Critical Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      Critical hits cause Sifkesh to experience a sudden rush of energy and
      healing. Any additional damage dealt to Sifkesh by a critical hit actually
      heals her of that amount of damage rather than harming her. This damage
      applies simultaneously to the attack's normal damage, and can prevent her
      from being slain if the damage from the normal attack would otherwise have
      been enough to kill her. Sifkesh takes no damage at all (but neither does
      she gain healing) from critical hits she or her allies deal to her-only
      attempts to actually damage her can heal her in this way. Whenever Sifkesh
      is healed of any damage in this manner, she becomes hasted for 1 round.
      Sifkesh takes normal damage from sneak attacks and other precision-based
      damage.
  - name: Despairing Cry (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, Sifkesh can unleash a
      soul-rending mournful scream that affects all creatures in a
      60-foot-radius spread. A creature in this area must attempt a successful
      DC 38 Will save or be overcome by suicidal despair-on a successful save, a
      creature is merely sickened for 1d4 rounds. A creature fully affected by
      this special attack takes a -6 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws,
      ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls, and cannot gain the
      benefit of any morale bonus for 24 hours. A creature that is normally
      immune to fear loses that ability while under the effects of despairing
      cry, and can be ordered to take obviously suicidal acts while under the
      influence of effects like charm person, dominate person, and suggestion.
      The effects of multiple despairing cries do not stack. This is a
      mind-affecting sonic curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Detached Limbs (Su)
    description: >-
      Sifkesh's arms, legs, and head are not physically attached to her torso.
      Instead, they float in approximately the positions they would normally
      take up, but never quite perfectly aligned. She is immune to any effect
      that severs limbs or her head. In addition, when she attacks, her limbs
      can move with surprising speed, effectively granting her exceptional reach
      for a Medium creature.
  - name: Heretical (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sifkesh's heretical persona protects her from servants of faith. Against
      any spell cast by a divine spellcaster, her Spell Resistance increases to
      41, and she gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against such spells. A
      divine spellcaster who willingly touches Sifkesh must succeed at a DC 38
      Will save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Immune to Edged Weapons (Ex)
    description: Sifkesh is immune to all forms of slashing damage and bleed effects.
  - name: Precise Cuts (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sifkesh deals an amount of additional damage equal to her Intelligence
      bonus on any successful attack that deals slashing damage.
  - name: Suicide (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as an immediate action, Sifkesh can drop her defenses when
      attacked by a foe. She is treated as flat-footed for this attack, loses
      her profane bonus to her AC and spell resistance, and automatically fails
      any saving throws against that attack. If this attack kills her, she
      immediately utters her despairing cry (even if she's already used it
      within the previous 1d4 rounds). Any creatures affected by this particular
      despairing cry are also stunned for 1d4 rounds. One round after she
      commits suicide, Sifkesh automatically comes back to life, as if affected
      by true resurrection.
Description:
  - >-
    Sifkesh, the Sacred Whore, is the demon lord of suicide, heresy, and
    hopeless despair. She rules the Abyssal realm of Vantian, the legendary City
    of Open Windows. The city itself is constantly destroying itself, as its
    buildings continually plummet into the churning surf along an eternally
    crumbling coastline.
  - >-
    Sifkesh is among the most enigmatic of all demon lords, for she seems more
    diabolic or even daemonic in her personality and appearance. Planar scholars
    have long struggled to interpret the demon lord's position and power. The
    belief that Sifkesh rose from the animus of a heretical erinyes who became
    the first of Hell's heretics is correct, and she constantly works to seduce
    and lure additional powerful devils from their infernal roles, inviting some
    to join her as favored minions but leaving others in place so they can more
    easily work to subvert Hell's machinations.
  - Sifkesh's Cult
  - >-
    Sifkesh is worshiped by blasphemers, heretics, outcasts from other
    religions, and survivors of botched suicide attempts. Her faithful are
    relatively solitary individuals, and there isn't a strong element of group
    worship of the demon lord-her cults tend to be small and often amount to
    only a single worshiper who might employ or rule his own group of minions or
    followers who don't actually serve the Sacred Whore. Worship of Sifkesh is a
    deeply personal and secretive thing, and many of her followers publicly
    belong to other religions, worshiping the demon lord of heresy in secret as
    they work to undermine the faith their allies and companions believe them to
    have. Holy sites to Sifkesh include desecrated churches, haunted houses, and
    towers with too many windows-nearly always, such temples and shrines to
    Sifkesh are empty and abandoned. The lone worshiper might share the site
    with other creatures such as predators or undead, and may even rely upon the
    presence of such creatures as convenient protection and defense against the
    enemy.
  - >-
    Sifkesh's unholy symbol is a pair of feminine hands crossed at slashed
    wrists. Her favored weapon is the war razor (The Inner Sea World Guide
    290-291). She grants access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Madness, and
    Trickery, and to the subdomains of Deception, Demon, Loss, and Nightmare
    (even though she normally wouldn't be able to grant access to the subdomain
    of Loss, she can do so due to her close associations with despair and
    hopelessness).
