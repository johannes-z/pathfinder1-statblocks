Description:
  - >-
    The triple-headed Cerberus is the guardian of Hades. There is only one in
    existence and most creatures (both living and dead) are grateful for this
    fact. Cerberus is tasked with the duty of keeping dead souls in Hades. If a
    dead soul attempts to pass beyond the Gates of Hades and back into the land
    of the living, Cerberus attacks relentlessly until that soul returns to
    Hades. If slain, the soul is immediately devoured by Cerberus and is lost
    forever. Cerberus is also tasked with keeping living creatures out of the
    land of the dead (adventurers being what they are, they love to journey to
    Hades). Living creatures that attempt to move past Cerberus into Hades
    (through the main gates) are immediately attacked.
  - >-
    Cerberus is a 30-foot long black mastiff. He rarely chooses to communicate
    with creatures even though he speaks several languages.
  - >-
    Cerberus only attacks if a dead soul attempts to pass beyond the Gates of
    Hades into the land of the living or if a living creature attempts to enter
    the Realm of the Dead. Cerberus never willingly moves more than 60 feet from
    the Gates and cannot be removed by any means, short of a god's magic.
  - >-
    He opens combat with his baneful howl and quickly follows with his breath
    weapon. Living creatures that do not retreat are subjected to his gaze
    attacks and bites. Cerberus attacks until all his opponents are dead or have
    retreated. The souls of those he kills are allowed to pass beyond the Gates
    and into Hades while Cerberus feasts on their body.
  - If slain, Cerberus's corpse melts into smoldering slime before fading away.
