SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Frenzy (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant caribe that detects blood in the water goes into a killing frenzy,
      as do all other giant caribes within a 90-foot radius. Frenzied giant
      caribes attack until either they or their opponents are dead. A frenzied
      giant caribe can make one extra attack when making a full attack action.
      The attack is made using the creature's full base attack. Additionally, it
      gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex
      saves. A frenzied giant caribe's swim speed increases by 10 feet. This
      frenzy lasts for 1 minute and can only be used once per encounter.
  - name: Keen Scent (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant caribe can notice creatures by scent in a 90-foot radius
      underwater and can detect blood in the water at ranges up to 500 feet.
Description:
  - >-
    The giant caribe is a rare form of giant saltwater piranha. They are pale
    bluish-green in color and about 6 feet long, though larger specimens have
    been encountered.
  - >-
    Giant caribes attack by swarming an opponent and biting with their
    razor-sharp teeth. Once blood is drawn, the entire pack goes into a frenzy,
    attacking twice each round.
