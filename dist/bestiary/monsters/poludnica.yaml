Description_Visual: >-
  A haze of heat shimmers around this beautiful woman. The glare of the sun
  gleams from her radiant skin.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Darkness Powerlessness (Su)
    description: >-
      As long as a poludnica is within an area of magical darkness, her
      sunstroke haze aura does not function. She also becomes staggered and
      cannot use any of her spell-like abilities.
  - name: Grace (Su)
    description: >-
      A poludnica adds her Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to her Armor
      Class.
  - name: Searing Weapons (Su)
    description: >-
      Any weapon a poludnica wields becomes incredibly hot and conducts and
      amplifies her ability to cause fatigue by reducing the target's ability to
      resist the effects. In melee combat, such a weapon deals an additional 1d6
      points of fire damage plus 1d2 points of Constitution damage. The
      Constitution damage is negated with a successful DC 21 Fortitude save. The
      weapon cools rapidly if it leaves her grasp, losing these additional
      abilities immediately.
  - name: Sunstroke Haze (Su)
    description: >-
      A poludnica radiates oppressive heat in a 10-foot radius. Any creature
      that starts its turn within this area must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude
      save or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and become fatigued. A
      fatigued creature that fails a second saving throw becomes exhausted. The
      fatigued or exhausted condition lasts for as long as the nonlethal damage
      goes unhealed. A poludnica can activate or suppress this ability as a free
      action and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Tied to Day (Su)
    description: >-
      A poludnica's connection to the sun tethers her to the Material Plane.
      During daylight hours (from dawn to sunset), her abilities are as shown
      above whether she can actually see the sun or not. During the nighttime
      hours (from sunset to dawn), a poludnica shifts to the Ethereal Plane (as
      ethereal jaunt). This is automatic, involuntary, and causes a poludnica
      great distress. While on the Ethereal Plane, a poludnica is affected by
      her darkness powerlessness and is nearly helpless. This curse cannot be
      dispelled or removed by anything short of divine interaction.
Description:
  - >-
    Driven by an obsession that few can fully comprehend, poludnicas are bitter
    creatures of light, heat, and envy. Although they are surprisingly strong
    and deadly combatants, these scythe-wielding women resort to violence only
    when guile and trickery have failed. They are lonely creatures that seek the
    company of mortals by luring farm workers and children away from their
    families so that they can brief ly enjoy a feeble simulation of family life.
    In the rural farming communities where her kind is most commonly found, a
    poludnica might also be known as Cornwife, Lady Midday, or Mother Noon. She
    might even be mistaken for a vengeful or beneficent ghost depending on how
    she presents herself.
  - >-
    Averaging 6 feet tall and weighing approximately 170 pounds, poludnicas
    could easily be mistaken for strapping farm girls if it were not for their
    radiance. Their maximum life expectancy has not been documented and it is
    commonly believed that poludnicas are effectively immortal unless they
    suffer some deadly mishap. It has been theorized that permanently keeping a
    poludnica in magically darkened conditions would eventually lead to her
    death, but no scholars have so far attempted to prove this hypothesis.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Poludnicas draw their physical sustenance from sunlight, but they often eat
    and drink to emulate the simple folk who are the subjects of their
    obsession. However, emotional nourishment is more difficult for them to
    obtain and their need for companionship and the simulation of a normal
    family life leads them to commit questionable acts of kidnapping or even
    murder.
  - >-
    Like bees who pollinate nearby flowers-which then go to seed and produce
    more flowers the next season-a poludnica's ability to enrich local plant
    life leads farming communities to thrive around their lairs. These plentiful
    fields bring more farmhands and more families, all potential companions for
    the poludnica.
  - >-
    Though the magic that pulls poludnicas into the Ethereal Plane at nightfall
    is viewed as a curse, it is also one of their most useful abilities. Though
    distressed and weakened on the Ethereal Plane, poludnicas can nonetheless
    perceive events upon the Material Plane. They often spend their nights
    spying on mortal families. Each night they move ethereally through mortals'
    homes, watching them eat, sleep, and enjoy the company and intimacy of
    others. Though this fills all poludnicas with sorrow, many are also driven
    to impotent, jealous rage as they watch children sleeping peacefully and
    wives embracing their husbands.
  - >-
    The origin of their cursed existence is a mystery- whether poludnicas were
    created by some powerful creature that did not anticipate the maddening
    effects of their abilities or whether they were once different creatures
    cursed for some failure or insult is not known. Either way, the curse has
    driven these lonely fey slightly mad.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Poludnicas usually claim a few hundred acres of fertile land as their
    territory, most often centered on a lair that is hidden in plain sight,
    inaccessible, or avoided by the community, such as a hollow beneath the
    tangled roots of a tree, the tumbledown barn of a former companion who no
    longer lives, or an abandoned and supposedly haunted farmhouse.
  - >-
    By day, a poludnica prowls crop fields seeking to lure, coerce, or
    physically abduct an overworked farmhand back to her home where she has
    built a mockery of a human farmhouse kitchen or bedroom, expecting her
    abductee to indulge her whims in a pantomime of normalcy, companionship, or
    intimacy. Sometimes one of these companions might choose to play along with
    his captor or try to escape during daylight hours, but those that bide their
    time until nightfall when the poludnica disappears at least have a chance of
    escape.
  - >-
    If a companion survives until nightfall, the poludnica fades away, leaving
    the suitor or child to fend for himself while she watches impotently from
    the Ethereal Plane. This may not prove to be a problem, but since many
    poludnicas make their daytime lairs in inaccessible places, if the captive
    cannot free himself before dawn, the poludnica often simply returns-likely
    unhappy with the "inconsiderate" companion's lack of loyalty to his new
    "family."
  - >-
    Some poludnicas who are kinder than most choose to hide their presence
    altogether. They avoid coming into contact with the peasants working the
    land, except at night where they can invisibly and sorrowfully observe
    mortals enjoying the companionship that is denied to the poludnicas
    themselves. More commonly, poludnicas are driven to lure away farmhands and
    kidnap children who they believe will come to love them and consider them
    their new family.
  - >-
    For all the suffering poludnicas cause, dwelling in a poludnica's territory
    is not without its benefits. Their crop-enriching powers provide abundant
    food, and many farming communities have come to see them as a kind of
    guardian spirit. Children often weave cornhusk dolls to placate a local
    poludnica, ask for her protection, or thank her for sparing their fathers or
    brothers. Some poludnicas are touched by these displays and stop, or at
    least reduce, their predations on those in the community.
