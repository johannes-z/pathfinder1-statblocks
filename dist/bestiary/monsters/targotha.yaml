SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Jolt (Ex)
    description: >-
      A targotha stores electrical potential that it can expend as a ranged
      touch attack with a range of 240 feet and no range increment. Using this
      ability within oil or tar reduces its range to 30 feet. A targotha cannot
      use this ability in water. A jolt deals 12d6 points of electricity damage,
      and the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude 28 negates the stun
      effect). It can use this ability once every 1d4+1 rounds, during which the
      targotha cannot ignite its volatile breath. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Razor Fins (Ex)
    description: >-
      A targotha's razor fins threaten a critical hit on a 19 or 20, augmented
      to 17-20 by its Improved Critical feat.
  - name: Slippery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A targotha secretes a thick mucus that allows it to move gracefully
      through viscous fluids like tar and oil. This mucus dissolves away
      adhesives (such as sovereign glue, tanglefoot bags, and webs) in 1d4
      rounds. Additionally, all combat maneuver checks to grapple a targotha
      automatically fail. The targotha automatically succeeds at any combat
      maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks to escape a grapple or a pin.
  - name: Tail Slap (Ex)
    description: >-
      A targotha adds 1-1/2 its Strength modifier on damage rolls for its tail
      slap. It can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver against a creature struck
      by its tail slap as a free action without provoking attacks of
      opportunity. The targotha can't move as part of this bull rush.
  - name: Volatile Breath (Ex)
    description: >-
      A targotha can breathe a cone of flammable gas as a breath weapon. As a
      swift action, it can ignite the gas with its jolt ability. When ignited,
      the gas explodes, dealing 15d6 points of fire damage in the area of the
      cone (Reflex DC 28 half). If not ignited, the gas confuses all creatures
      in the area of effect that breathe it in before the gas dissipates at the
      start of the targotha's next turn. This confusion last for 1d4 rounds
      (Fortitude DC 23 negates). The save DCs are Constitution-based, and the
      confusion save DC has a -5 racial penalty.
Description:
  - >-
    Before the great starship crashed on Golarion, it traveled the stars,
    collecting all manner of strange specimens. One of the oddest varieties were
    targothas, which came from a lush planet rich in oil and tar where local
    fauna evolved to live in that world's tarry seas.
