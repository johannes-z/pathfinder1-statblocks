      The first time a creature successfully hits a giant yellowjacket it
      releases a fear pheromone that heightens the aggressiveness of all other
      giant yellowjackets within 50 feet. All affected giant yellowjackets
      receive a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls for the remainder of the
      encounter and fight without penalty even while disabled or dying.

Description:
  - >-
    be distinguished from giant hornets by the yellow markings on their thorax
    and abdomen. Giant yellowjackets spend their days suckling nectar from
    flowers and fruit juices from plants. When hunting for food to feed the
    young, they seek out sources of carrion or animal tissue.
  - >-
    Living prey is attacked and stung to death and then cut into pieces by the
    giant yellowjacket's sharp mandibles and carried piece by piece back to the
    nest.
  - >-
    Giant yellowjackets generally build their nests high above ground in rocky
    outcroppings or forested areas. Some giant yellowjackets prefer to build
    their nests underground, constructing them in abandoned giant snake holes.
  - >-
    Giant yellowjackets are 8 feet long with alternating bands of black and
    yellow on their thorax and abdomen. Workers generally have thicker black
    bands than the queen or soldiers. The yellowjacket's stinger is slightly
    curved and barbed and their mandibles are well-formed and developed,
    allowing them to chew their food.
  - >-
    Giant yellowjackets attack by biting their foes. Though it has a poisonous
    stinger, it usually conducts combat with its bite attack, unless threatened
    by or confronting a particularly powerful opponent. In such cases, the giant
    yellowjacket brings its stinger to bear and repeatedly stings its foes until
    they are dead. If attacked, a giant yellowjacket releases a pheromone that
    agitates all others of its kind, making them deadlier and more aggressive.
