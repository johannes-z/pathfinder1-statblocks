Description_Visual: >-
  This porcine demon has huge tusks and tiny wings, and its furred flesh oozes
  with greasy black-and-purple energy.
Group: Demon
Source: Mythic Adventures
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Demonic Knowledge (Su)
    description: >-
      By expending one use of mythic power as a free action, the demon learns
      one weakness, vulnerability, or special defense of an opponent within
      reach.
  - name: Touch of Chaos (Sp)
    description: >-
      This functions like the Chaos domain granted power (Core Rulebook 42),
      except the demon can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to
      use this ability when it hits with a natural attack.
  - name: Unholy Nimbus (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a free action, the demon can create writhing
      colored lights on its body. One round later, the light bursts in a 60-foot
      radius. Any non-demon caught within this area must succeed at a DC 24 Will
      save or be dazed for 1d10 rounds as visions of madness hound it. The save
      DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic nalfeshnee gains its power by tricking or forcing other mythic
    beings to imbue it. It hoards its many valuable secrets as a dragon hoards
    gold.
