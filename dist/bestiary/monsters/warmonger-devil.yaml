Description_Visual: >-
  Armored like an infernal knight upon some monstrous steed, this fiend of iron
  and nails scuttles upon six heavy, bladed, beetle-like legs. Its body seems to
  be nothing more than plates upon hulking plates of dark metal, each pierced
  through with gleaming spikes studded with the gruesome trophies of past
  massacres. In one clawed gauntlet it grips a long, twisted trident, while in
  the other it readies a thick net woven with fiendish barbs.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hellstrider (Su)
    description: >-
      A levaloch is not impeded by rough terrain, and can move or charge through
      such squares as normal. It can also cross areas covered with deadly
      impediments (such as caltrops or thorns) without being damaged or
      hindered. In addition to being entirely immune to fire, the creature's
      legs are immune to acid and cold, allowing it to cross even rivers of acid
      or lava without being damaged or hindered as long as the material is less
      than 4 feet deep. This ability does not protect a levaloch against magical
      hindrances like black tentacles, web, or similar spells.
  - name: Merciless Blow (Su)
    description: >-
      Levalochs show no mercy to the vulnerable. Any trident attacks they make
      against entangled creatures (including those entangled by its net) deal an
      extra 2d6 points damage.
  - name: Phalanx (Ex)
    description: >-
      Devils gain a +1 morale bonus on attacks and to AC while adjacent to a
      levaloch.
  - name: Stability (Ex)
    description: >-
      Levalochs receive a +4 racial bonus to their CMD when resisting a bull
      rush or trip attempt while standing on the ground.
  - name: Summon Devil (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day a levaloch can attempt to summon 1d4 lemures or 1 bearded
      devil with a 40% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a
      4th-level spell. Skills Levalochs have a +2 racial bonus on Stealth and
      Perception checks. This Stealth bonus increases to +8 when a levaloch is
      concealed amid metal objects or debris.
Description:
  - >-
    Fearsome giants of steel and blades, levalochs serve within the armies of
    archdevils and infernal dukes as potent warriors and tenacious hunters,
    creatures of absolute discipline endlessly obedient to diabolical tyrants.
    Renowned for their skill on Hell's battlefields, these fearsome soldiers
    excel in moving swiftly over the broken landscapes that typify the nine
    layers of the Pit, hunting down intruders and seeking out errant souls
    wherever they might flee. En masse, the armored clanking of obedient and
    watchful infantry sound like the workings of great machines as levaloch
    hosts man Hell's ramparts, from the Iron Fortresses of Avernus to the walls
    of Ashtart. Levalochs possess consistent forms, each resembling all others
    of their kind in general shape and size, though each devil's armor proves
    distinctive. Some claim that the arrangement of a levaloch's spikes, horns,
    blades, or other iron-shod embellishments might reveal what layer of Hell or
    infernal noble spawned the devil, though few have the time to ponder such
    concerns as one of these razor-legged legionaries rages forward. With little
    variation, levalochs stand just over 10 feet tall and weigh almost exactly 1
    ton. Ecology Levalochs blur the line between devil and automaton. While
    created from the souls of the damned and the profane energies of Hell, these
    fiends live only to obey their masters and, upon their home plane, seemingly
    possess little will or ambition beyond such obedience. Requiring no food or
    rest, a levaloch sentinel might hold its post, completely motionless, for
    centuries, collecting ages of dust without complaint as it awaits orders
    that might never come. While intelligent, these devils prove fanatically
    devoted to the causes of their masters, the archdevils, Asmodeus, and Hell
    itself, drawing on ingrained wells of discipline and faith to mete out the
    greater will of their overlords. Levalochs are highly prized throughout the
    Pit for this discipline, held up as epitomes of diabolical warriors second
    only to the ferocious cornugons, and pointed to throughout the planes as
    embodiments of the soldier's ideal. Yet this discipline only persists while
    levalochs remain under orders from more powerful devils. Left to their own
    devices, each levaloch fancies itself a tyrant by its own right and relishes
    the opportunity to promote conf lict and bloodshed through petty mortal
    angst and grudges. While all devils possess anatomies that perpetually baff
    le mortal scholars, levalochs prove even more enigmatic, having no internal
    physiology at all. Being little more than living suits of blasphemous chitin
    and Hell-forged armor, these fiends lack all weaknesses of even infernal
    flesh and blood, while retaining all of the potent resistances common to
    their diabolical kin. A levaloch's sentience seems to linger within its
    armored shell, remaining until that exoskeleton proves too damaged to
    contain an animating spirit any longer. Should a levaloch's armor be
    destroyed, the plates of metal and carapace fall to pieces and quickly
    corrode, revealing nothing more than the strong scent of pitch within.
    Despite their unusual anatomy, levalochs are still thinking, even cunning
    creatures. The fiendish intelligences housed within these ironclad horrors
    cause some sages to draw frightening parallels between levalochs and the
    profane soul-bound armors of the infamous undead graveknights. Habitat &
    Society Commonly found upon the first and sixth layers of Hell and amid the
    outlying fortresses of Dis, levalochs muster in the service of the Pit's
    most martial tyrants. Most know only their orders, following their masters'
    commands to the letter, disregarding all things that fall outside of their
    purview-at least until such things threaten their masters' holdings or
    themselves. Intruders within infernal citadels sometimes find themselves
    unchallenged as they wander vast halls watched over by whole platoons of
    posted, idle levalochs, only to be attacked unexpectedly upon encountering
    those specifically commanded to stand sentry. These fiends hold to their
    orders not out of dull-wittedness, but out of obsessive obedience to the
    rule of Hell, as proven by their murderous cunning in battle. On the rare
    occasions levalochs find themselves left to their own devices, the true
    intellect of these armored terrors becomes apparent. Capable of shocking
    changes in personality, a levaloch that might not have spoken a word in its
    entire existence might prove shrewd and subtle when it finds itself upon the
    Material Plane, stirring old angers, forging Hellish weaponry, even training
    mortal warriors in a strategic game of warmongering and open campaigning,
    all encouraging bloodshed in the name of Hell. They despise the weakness of
    emotion and the changeability of mortal minds. Thus, they delight in testing
    themselves against mortal flesh, indulging in massacres and encouraging
    genocides against such weak, worthless creatures whenever their plots might
    gain even the slightest benefit from such atrocities. Such pride rarely
    proves the undoing of levalochs, though, as these armored fiends treat every
    battle as a chance to hone their impressive skills and give foes-regardless
    of race-no quarter.
