Description:
  - >-
    These aquatic daemons roam the lower planes sowing misery and blight. They
    delight in drawn-out deaths, poisoning creatures or dismembering victims to
    watch them slowly bleed out. On their home plane of Abaddon, piscodaemons
    gravitate toward the same aquatic regions inhabited by hydrodaemons, and
    often the stronger among their ranks end up leading armies of hydrodaemons
    against their enemies. These creatures serve as sergeants in the hierarchy
    of Abaddon, and run their units with an excess of cruelty and violence.
  - >-
    Instead of preying on the weak, piscodaemons enjoy targeting strong,
    well-armored warriors, knowing the pain of their weakening poison rests
    poorly on shoulders accustomed to bearing heavy weights and delivering
    devastating blows.
  - Piscodaemons are 7 feet tall and weigh 400 pounds.
