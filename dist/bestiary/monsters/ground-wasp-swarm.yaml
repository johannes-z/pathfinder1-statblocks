Description:
  - >-
    Ground wasps live in colonies dug into the ground, and even inhabit cracks
    and hollow spaces within tombs and ruins. These social insects leave their
    nests only to hunt (or defend the nest), often lurking just within the
    entrance and relying on their tremorsense to detect nearby creatures. When a
    creature gets too near their nest, the wasps stream out of hiding and
    attack.
  - >-
    Many varieties of ground wasps are parasitic, and attack large creatures as
    a means of reproduction, as well as in defense. Ground wasps have a
    paralytic poison, and once a victim has sustained dozens of stings, its body
    goes limp. Once its prey is incapacitated, a ground wasp swarm descends on
    the still-living creature and lays hundreds of eggs just beneath its skin.
    Some ground wasps swarm for food in a similar fashion. Mature ground wasps
    don't eat much flesh themselves, but they often take down prey so they can
    retrieve food for their growing larvae.
