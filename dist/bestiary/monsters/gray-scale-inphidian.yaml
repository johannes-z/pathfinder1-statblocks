Description:
  - >-
    The gray-scale inphidian (also called the abomination inphidian) is the
    result of a magical experiment gone awry. Foul, dark magic brought down by
    inphidian sorcerers on others of their race resulted in this creature; the
    strongest of the inphidian race perhaps, but also the most weak-minded and
    slowest. Most gray-scales seemingly have no memories of their past life or
    the tortures inflicted on them; those that do however, have both a hatred
    and fear for magic and those that wield it.
  - >-
    Gray-scales are considered by many inphidian nests to be dangerous,
    unstable, and an abomination against the race, particularly the gray-scales
    with the magic bane quality. These feelings, often times come from inphidian
    night adders (some of whom likely assisted in helping the gray-scale into
    its current state). Most often, gray-scales are shunned by their inphidian
    nest and cast out, left to wander the world and survive on their own, by
    whatever means they can. In some instances, a gray-scale stays with its
    nest, never fully accepted by many of the other inphidians, but tolerated,
    feared and respected for their battle skills. In these cases, one or more
    gray-scales serve as guards for the nest, or the muscle for an inphidian
    raiding party.

    A gray-scale inphidian appears as an 8-foot tall hulking and slightly
    hunched humanoid with slate gray scales, the head of a giant viper with
    elongated fangs and red eyes, and the distinguishing inphidian
    characteristic: the heads of vipers in place of its hands. They shun wearing
    both armor and clothing. Gray-scales understand the Inphidian language, but
    seemingly have trouble speaking it; communicating in a slow and broken tone.
  - >-
    Perhaps a side-effect of the experiments conducted on them, or perhaps by
    design, but no sightings of female gray-scales have ever been reported.
    Likewise, gray-scales appear to be sterile, unable to reproduce with others
    of the inphidian race.
  - >-
    In battle, a gray-scale inphidian prefers to overwhelm its opponents with
    its pure strength instead of attacking from ambush. It lashes out with both
    snake hands followed closely with a vicious bite from its viper head. A
    grabbed opponent is repeatedly bitten by the gray-scale until either it is
    dead or wounded enough to be out of the fight. The gray-scale then turns its
    attention to another opponent. If faced with a spellcasting opponent, it
    usually focuses all attention in the spellcaster's direction, even pushing
    through other opponents to get to the spellcaster.
