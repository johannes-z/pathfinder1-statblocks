Description:
  - >-
    Perhaps nowhere in the Inner Sea region are tengus a more common sight than
    aboard a pirate vessel in the Shackles. Superstitious by nature, many
    sailors in this region have assigned to these feathered humanoids the dual
    role of good luck charm and mascot, based on the misguided belief that
    tengus can absorb ill omens and bad luck. Where this notion came from is
    anyone's guess, though some scholars have suggested that tengus may have
    been confused with the chickcharney, with whom they have nothing in common
    aside from their feathered forms. While this old sailor's conceit may earn
    such tengus, referred to as "jinx eaters," some special treatment aboard
    ship, perhaps exempting them from the rough bullying so common in pirate
    crews, it does not mean they do not have the same responsibilities and
    duties of all mariners engaged in piracy. Jinx eaters must be able to hold
    their own in a fight, though most adopt methods of avoiding such conf licts
    altogether, honing their skills of guile and misdirection instead of brawn
    and steel.
  - >-
    Jinx eaters are typically mad for plunder, especially seeking out jewelry
    and other such baubles, at times even lifting them from unsuspecting
    shipmates. Such pilfering inevitably leads to angry confrontations onboard,
    and the kleptomaniacal tengu must rely on his reputation as a source of good
    luck if he is to be spared a severe beating at the hands of his cohorts.
  - >-
    Several settlements around the Shackles host rookeries of decent size, and
    it is common to find retired jinx eaters in such districts; often these are
    particularly boastful individuals who have given up on the life at sea or
    have been ousted from their old ship by their increasingly jaded crew
    members.
