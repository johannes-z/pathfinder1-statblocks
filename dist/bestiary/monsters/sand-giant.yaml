SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fist of Sand (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a move action, a sand giant can form a volume of sand
      within 40 feet into the shape of a 20-foot long arm that ends in a
      clenched fist. The arm is Huge and has a space of 15 ft. and a reach of 20
      ft. The arm and fist cannot move from the location where it was created.
      The sand giant can order the arm to attack a target as a move action. Once
      given a target, the arm automatically attacks that target on the giant's
      turn. The arm remains for a number of rounds equal to the sand giant's Hit
      Dice (19 rounds for a typical sand giant). A sand giant does not need to
      concentrate to maintain the arm and can direct it to attack a new target
      or adapt a new tactic as a free action. The arm's base attack bonus is
      equal to that of the giant that created it, and it deals slam damage equal
      to the slam attack for a creature of its size (Huge). Any creature struck
      must succeed on a DC 29 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save
      DC is Strength-based, using the HD of the sand giant and the Strength of
      the fist of sand. The arm has an AC of 20 (+12 natural, -2 size) and has
      hit points equal to three times the Constitution score of the sand giant
      that created it. It has a Strength score of 30. The arm loses shape if it
      is reduced to 0 or less hit points, the duration expires, or the sand
      giant dies.

      weapons, light and medium armor, and shields.
Description:
  - >-
    Sand giants are brutal, somewhat barbaric giants that prey on those weaker
    than themselves. They have dark tan skin, brown hair, and dark brown or dark
    green eyes. An adult male stands approximately 20 feet tall. Males tend to
    wear their hair and beards braided. Sand giants wear light clothes and light
    armor (if any). In times of battle or war, males may don chainmail. A
    typical sand giant's bag contains food, 3d4 mundane items, and a modest
    amount of cash (no more than 12d10 coins). Sand giants can live to be 500
    years old. Sand giants make their homes in warm desert lands away from
    civilization. They live in organized tribes consisting of 8-9 families of
    2-4 members each. On occasion, a tribe forms a raiding party that sets off
    to the nearest civilized place, returning at a later time with food, coins,
    and captives. For each adult in a sand giant's lair, there is a 40% chance
    that the lair has 1d3 captives of any humanoid race. Sand giants favor their
    greatswords in combat. They usually begin combat by shaping a fist from the
    surrounding terrain and attacking with their greatswords in concert with the
    earthen fist. Sand giant do not throw rocks like many other giants do, but
    they can catch rocks or similar projectiles as other giants. Sand Giant
