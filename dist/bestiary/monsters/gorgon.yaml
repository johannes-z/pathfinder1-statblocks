Description:
  - >-
    Gorgons are magical, foul-tempered creatures-while they might appear to be
    constructs at first glance, beneath their artificallooking armor plates they
    are made of flesh and bone. Like aggressive bulls, they challenge any
    unfamiliar creature they encounter, often trampling their opponent's corpse
    or shattering its stony remnants until the creature is unrecognizable. The
    females are just as dangerous as the males, and the two sexes appear
    identical. A typical gorgon stands 6 feet tall and 8 feet long. It weighs
    4,000 pounds. Gorgons derive nutrients from the consumption of minerals,
    particularly the stone of their petrified victims, and any statues they
    create are likely to be gnawed thoroughly. They cannot digest metal or gems,
    so their dung (which resembles bitter-smelling gray powder) often contains
    small, raw crystals and nuggets of ore. Their aggression toward all other
    creatures means that there are few to no predators or other prey animals in
    their grazing grounds. Each herd is led by a dominant bull; solitary gorgons
    are usually adolescent bulls driven out of their herd by the lead bull.
    Their flesh is tough but beefy (once the armored hide is removed), and to
    those who acquire the taste, quite filling. Many stone giant tribes believe
    eating gorgon meat enhances their own natural armor. Powdered gorgon horn is
    worth 250 gp as an alternate material component for magic items using bull's
    strength, stoneskin, flesh to stone, statue, and similar magic.
