Description_Visual: >-
  This massive giant has hideously primitive features and gray blotchy flesh.
  Unkempt, it wears nothing but filthy rags and carries a tremendous greatclub
  and its eyes glare maliciously. Most disturbing, its protruding tusk-like
  teeth hang over its swollen lips causing a steady stream of drool.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Pound (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cave giant that successfully grabs a foe two or more sizes smaller than
      itself can smash the opponent into the ground, walls, nearby trees, or
      other solid objects as a standard action. This deals 2d6+12 points of
      bludgeoning damage to the victim. In addition, the opponent must make a
      successful DC 24 Fortitude save or be stunned for one round. A cave giant
      can perform this action once per round as long as it maintains the
      grapple. The save DC is Strength-based.

Description:
  - >-
    Dumber, stronger cousins of hill giants, cave giants live in small communal
    bands of no more than twelve individuals, with a single male leader that is
    usually stronger and certainly meaner than all others. They often take up
    residence in large hill or mountain caves, foraging for food such as
    mountain goats, bears, and wayward explorers. Extremely primitive and
    simple-minded, cave giants have no real concept of fire or creature
    comforts, so they eat their food raw. Cave giants are not rock-throwers like
    many of their brethren, but they are quite skilled at combat with their huge
    greatclubs. They take great glee in pounding humans into paste, and then
    eating the paste. Cave Giant Characters +16 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +12
    Constitution, -6 Intelligence. Cave giants are dumb, indestructible brutes
    of primitive intelligence and reasoning and make excellent barbarians. Huge:
