SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alert (Su)
    description: >-
      A marble sentinel can take simple orders and identify intruders, and it
      possesses the ability to alert its creator or another creature to which
      it's keyed. When a marble sentinel detects a trespasser, it can choose to
      alert the creature to which it's keyed in one of two ways. The sentinel
      can create a loud sound like that of a bell, chime, or gong that can be
      clearly heard at a range of 500 feet. Alternatively, a marble sentinel can
      send a mental alert to the creature to which it is keyed as long as that
      creature is within 1 mile of the sentinel. The mental alert wakes the
      keyed creature from sleep, but doesn't affect normal concentration. A
      marble sentinel's creator is the first creature to which it is keyed, and
      the creator can pass its link to another creature as part of a 4-hour
      ritual that uses materials costing 500 gp.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A marble sentinel is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow
      spell resistance, save for spells with the force descriptor.
  - name: Paralyzing Bolt (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a marble sentinel can fire a green-hued bolt of
      energy as a ranged touch attack out to a maximum range of 30 feet. A
      creature struck by this ray must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be
      paralyzed for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Marble sentinels were prized for their ability not only to detect intruders,
    but also to restrain them with paralyzing bolts. This ability only lasts
    temporarily, so the creator or other creature the sentinel is keyed to would
    have to receive the alert and mobilize her guards to properly subdue and
    restrain any trespassers.
  - Construction
  - >-
    Though the exact process of creating the base form differs depending on the
    materials involved, the process of animating sentinels is roughly the same.
    Each sentinel must be carved or worked to a fine detail before being
    subjected to spells and magical unguents worth 1,000 gp.
