  This fanged horse is in an advanced state of decay, yet despite its dripping
  maggots, it moves as if it were very much alive.

Description:
  - >-
    The demonplague has a particularly hideous effect on animals and other
    unintelligent beasts that succumb to its ravages-fallen creatures arise from
    death and continue to spread the vile plague with their bite. Certain demons
    and humanoid cultists are fond of using plagued beast horses as mounts.
  - Creating a Plagued Beast
  - >-
    "Plagued Beast" is an acquired template that can be added to a living,
    corporeal creature with an Int score of 1 or 2. A plagued beast uses all of
    the creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
  - 'CR: As base creature +1.'
  - 'Alignment: Neutral evil.'
  - >-
    Type: The creature's type changes to undead. It retains any subtype except
    for alignment subtypes and subtypes indicating kind. Do not recalculate
    saves, BAB, or skill ranks.
  - 'Armor Class: Increase from the base creature by +2.'
  - >-
    Hit Dice: Change all of the creature's racial HD to d8s. As undead, plagued
    beasts use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead
    of Constitution).
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: Plagued beasts gain darkvision 60 feet and channel
    resistance +2. A plagued beast also gains damage reduction 5/slashing. They
    are immune to cold, and gain all of the standard undead traits.
  - >-
    Melee: A plagued beast gains a bite attack that deals damage based on the
    plagued beast's size. If the beast already has a bite attack, the bite's
    damage increases by one step, as if it had increased one size category.
  - >-
    Special Attacks: A plagued beast inflicts demonplague (see page 29) with
    each successful bite attack. The save DC to resist the disease is equal to
    10 + the plagued beast's HD + 1/2 the plagued beast's Charisma modifier.
  - >-
    Abilities: +4 Str, +2 Dex. A plagued beast has a minimum Charisma score of
    15-if the base creature's Charisma is lower, increase it to 15. If it's 15
    or higher, do not adjust the plagued beast's final Charisma. A plagued beast
    has no Constitution score; as an undead, it uses its Charisma in place of
    Constitution when calculating hit points, Fortitude saves, or any special
    ability that relies on Constitution.
  - 'Feats: A plagued beast gains Toughness as a bonus feat.'
