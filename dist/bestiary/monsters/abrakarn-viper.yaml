SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Confusing Critical (Sp)
    description: >-
      If an abrakarn viper confirms a critical hit against an opponent with its
      bite attack, the opponent must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or be confused
      for 1 round (as lesser confusion). The save DC is Charisma-based and
      includes a +9 racial bonus. Demon-Souled (Ex) Bound demonic life force
      animates the viper, giving it the chaotic and evil subtypes.
  - name: Find Master (Su)
    description: >-
      As long as an abrakarn viper and its diadem are on the same plane, the
      viper can unerringly find the diadem's wearer (or just the diadem, if it
      is removed).
  - name: Guard (Ex)
    description: >-
      If so ordered, an abrakarn viper defends the wearer of the diadem. All
      attacks against the diadem's wearer take a -2 penalty when the wearer is
      within the viper's melee reach.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      An abrakarn viper's bite injects poison from a hidden reservoir within its
      body. The creator must refill this reservoir manually. The reservoir holds
      enough poison for three successful bite attacks, after which the creature
      merely deals bite damage. Refilling the reservoir takes 5 rounds and
      provokes attacks of opportunity. The creator can fill the reservoir with
      any injury poison (typically drow poison).
  - name: Shield Other (Sp)
    description: >-
      The wearer of an abrakarn viper's diadem can activate this ability as a
      standard action when within 100 feet of the viper. This ability transfers
      half the damage that would be dealt to the diadem's wearer to the viper
      (this ability does not provide the bonuses to AC or on saving throws
      granted by the spell of the same name). Damage transferred in this way
      bypasses any defensive abilities the viper possesses (such as immunity or
      damage reduction).
Description:
  - >-
    Demonic spirits imbue this serpentine construct with the unnatural power to
    protect anyone who wears its diadem of control.
  - Construction

    An abrakarn viper's body and its diadem of control are built from 5,000
    pounds of magically treated brass and rare metals costing 10,000 gp in
    total.
