SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Inflict Warpwave (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an imentesh can inflict a warpwave upon any
      corporeal creature within 100 feet. The target can resist the warpwave's
      effects with a DC 20 Fortitude save. If the imentesh wishes, it can use
      this ability as a swift action, but if it does so, it is affected by the
      warpwave as well unless it resists the effects with its own Fortitude
      save. See page 213 for a list of possible effects caused by a warpwave.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Missionaries of chaos and heralds of reality's eventual unraveling,
    imenteshes are the proteans most likely to be encountered outside of Limbo.
    Despite their sometimes loquacious and courtly manner, imenteshes' entropic
    agenda is ever at the front of their minds, and this inherent madness is
    evident in the soft, telepathic susurrus that constantly surrounds them,
    threatening to warp the minds of the weak-willed.
  - An imentesh is 15 feet long and weighs 1,200 pounds.
