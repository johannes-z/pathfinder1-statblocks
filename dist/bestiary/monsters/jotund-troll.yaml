Description:
  - >-
    Jotund trolls are gigantic, nine-headed horrors. Prowling frigid moors and
    marshes, these rapacious creatures have the same insatiable appetites of
    common trolls but require much more sustenance because of their excessive
    size. Jotund trolls stand 30 feet tall and weigh roughly 25,000 pounds. They
    can live for up to 100 years.
  - >-
    The jotund troll's nine heads each have their own brains and senses, but
    they share, after a fashion, the same mind. Despite this, a jotund troll's
    heads often argue and bicker, particularly over which head gets to eat. The
    fact that all nine maws lead to the same shared stomach makes little
    difference in such culinary disagreements.
  - >-
    Jotund trolls spawn with either their own kind or with other trolls. In the
    latter case, there is only a 5% chance the offspring will be a jotund troll.
    Apart from brief mating periods, jotund trolls are solitary, although some
    cull together bands of other giants into devastating war parties that can
    lay waste to entire regions.
