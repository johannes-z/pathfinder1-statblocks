Description:
  - >-
    A mythic ogre is an example of inbreeding going exactly right, the perfect
    combination of hardiness and fast maturity without any significant
    deformities that would hamper its ability to hunt. Able to evade death like
    a monstrous cockroach and prone to violent outbursts like a berserk child, a
    mythic ogre has all the qualities common ogres admire, and easily takes over
    the family unit by browbeating others into submission. Some even manage to
    dominate hill giant tribes with sheer numbers, making the next generation
    taller and stronger.
  - Ogre Dragonslayer
  - >-
    Sometimes the hilly terrain of a mythic ogre's tribe overlaps with that of a
    red dragon. If the dragon breeds, the ogres respond to the threat of
    hatchlings by hunting down the dragon and its offspring and fashioning armor
    and weapons out of their enemies' bloody remnants. Some of these families
    eventually develop fire resistance, a trait they pass on to their offspring.
