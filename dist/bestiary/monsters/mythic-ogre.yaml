SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Iron Resilience (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per round, a mythic ogre can ignore an attack that would reduce it to
      negative hit points or kill it. The ogre takes no damage from the attack.
      As an immediate action, a mythic ogre can expend one use of mythic power
      to use this ability to ignore all attacks from one creature for 1 round.
  - name: Rising Fury (Ex)
    description: >-
      Each time a mythic ogre takes damage, it gains a +2 morale bonus on damage
      rolls until the end of its next turn. This bonus increases by +2 each time
      the ogre takes damage, up to a maximum of +10. At the end of the ogre's
      turn, this damage bonus resets to +0.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic ogre is an example of inbreeding going exactly right, the perfect
    combination of hardiness and fast maturity without any significant
    deformities that would hamper its ability to hunt. Able to evade death like
    a monstrous cockroach and prone to violent outbursts like a berserk child, a
    mythic ogre has all the qualities common ogres admire, and easily takes over
    the family unit by browbeating others into submission. Some even manage to
    dominate hill giant tribes with sheer numbers, making the next generation
    taller and stronger.

    Sometimes the hilly terrain of a mythic ogre's tribe overlaps with that of a
    red dragon. If the dragon breeds, the ogres respond to the threat of
    hatchlings by hunting down the dragon and its offspring and fashioning armor
    and weapons out of their enemies' bloody remnants. Some of these families
    eventually develop fire resistance, a trait they pass on to their offspring.
