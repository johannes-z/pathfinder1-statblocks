Description_Visual: >-
  Rattling with each stride, this looming, horned, skeletal figure clutches a
  wicked staff. A seething glow burns in its eye sockets.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Draining Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A thanadaemon's energy drain attack functions through any melee weapon it
      wields.
  - name: Fear Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Cower in fear for 1d6 rounds, 30 feet, Will DC 21 negates. This is a
      mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Soul Crush (Su)
    description: >-
      A thanadaemon can crush a soul gem (see cacodaemon) as a standard action
      to gain fast healing 15 for 15 rounds (this is a standard action). This
      action condemns the crushed soul to Abaddon- resurrecting this victim
      requires a DC 28 caster level check.
Description:
  - >-
    While all daemons represent death in some fashion, thanadaemons, the Deacons
    of Death, represent the inevitable death through old age. Thanadaemons
    effortlessly work eerie skiffs along every pus- and bile-choked river in
    Abaddon, including the legendary River Styx. For the right price (typically
    50 pp or 2 gems worth at least 300 gp each), a thanadaemon will even carry
    passengers on its skiff, yet those who travel with these fiends should
    beware-they frequently renegotiate the terms once they've got their
    passengers in dangerous realms.
