Description_Visual: >-
  This creature resembles a goat with tangled and patchy gray-and-white hair,
  and horns and hooves that appear to be made of stone. Its eyes are stark
  white. Around its neck hangs a dented and ugly iron lantern, glowing with a
  foul amber light.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear Light (Su)
    description: >-
      A lantern goat can emit an ugly yellow light from the lantern around its
      neck as a free action. All creatures within 60 feet that view this light
      must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be panicked for 1d4+4 rounds. A
      creature that succeeds on its save is immune to the fear light of that
      lantern goat for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Lifesense (Su)
    description: >-
      A lantern goat notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just
      as if it possessed the blindsight ability. It also senses the strength of
      their life force automatically, as if it had cast deathwatch.
  - name: Soul Capture (Su)
    description: >-
      Any living creature reduced to below 0 hit points while within 60 feet of
      a lantern goat must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or have its soul drawn
      into the lantern goat's lantern. The DC increases by +1 for every hit
      point the character is below 0 (e.g., a character at -3 hit points must
      save at DC 20). Once captured, the lantern goat slowly digests the
      creature's soul over a period of 1 hour, using it to fuel its dark
      energies. A creature slain in this manner can only be returned to life by
      a resurrection, true resurrection, wish, or miracle. Raise dead has no
      effect on such a slain creature. If the lantern goat is slain and the
      lantern destroyed, the soul is released back to the body if still living.
      The lantern cannot be destroyed or removed until the lantern goat is
      destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Lantern goats are undead wanderers thought to be the coalescence of souls of
    people who died while lost in the wilderness. Just as normal goats sometimes
    drift from the shepherd's care and fall prey to the dangers of the wild, so
    too do humans and demihumans often meet with a dire end while trekking alone
    in the hills. Whether they die of exposure or become a predator's meal,
    these lost travelers usually journey in spirit form to the afterlife. Some,
    however, if they perish too close to a lantern goat, find their souls drawn
    into the fell receptacle the creature wears around its neck.
  - >-
    The scarred and battered lantern that depends from the goat's neck serves to
    channel souls into the creature itself. As the goat moves through the hills,
    its lantern casts a sickening yellow glow that attracts the souls of the
    recently deceased. Lantern goats roam low mountains and foothill damned to
    patrol the mortal realm in search of those who die alone.
  - >-
    How the lantern goat behaves in combat depends upon the number of
    adversaries it faces. Normally the goat preys on lone travelers, attacking
    them with its stony hooves and horns. If it encounters a group, the lantern
    goat emits a fear light from its lantern, intending to panic everyone in
    range and then pick them off individually.
