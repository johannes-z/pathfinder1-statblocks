Description:
  - >-
    Tethers are generally friendly (at least they act that way) to most
    creatures they encounter. When it selects an owner, it follows that creature
    around purring and meowing. If it manages to kill its owner with its energy
    drain ability, it selects a new owner from the remaining family members (if
    any). A tether is more outgoing than its relative, the slinker, and enjoys
    crawling into its owner's lap, wrapping its tail around its owner's legs or
    arm and gently purring. Of course, the entire time this is going on, it is
    draining its owner's life force. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
