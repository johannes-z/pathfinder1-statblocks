Description:
  - >-
    Jellyfish often cluster together during springtime or when environmental
    conditions such as an increase in ocean temperature favor it. When
    conditions are right, jellyfish shift from being a nuisance to being a
    menace, if accidentally so, for a jellyfish swarm, unlike more aggressive
    monstrous kin like the giant jellyfish, comprises not aggressive hunters but
    rather opportunistic strikers. They do not generally move to attack nearby
    prey, but their nearly translucent coloration makes it horrifically easy for
    a creature to swim into a swarm unawares. Once a jellyfish swarm deals
    damage to a creature, the swarm pursues it for several rounds before giving
    up the chase. Many aquatic races use jellyfish swarms as defensive
    guardians, trusting a swarm's lack of interest in moving to keep it
    stationary for long periods of time.
