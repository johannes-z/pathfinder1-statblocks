SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Paralyzed with fear 1d4 rounds, range 30 feet, Will DC 16 negates and
      renders target immune to this ability for 24 hours. This is a
      mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Cocoon (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per round as a standard action, and no more than three times per day,
      a cerebral stalker can cocoon a grappled foe by shooting sticky webbing
      from its body. The webs cover as much of the victim as possible, excluding
      the top of the victim's head, its eyes, and its nose. The webs remain
      attached to the cerebral stalker's body and stretch from just under its
      arms to its knees. A cocooned victim is anchored to the cerebral stalker
      and cannot move. The cocooned creature can, as a standard action, break
      free with a successful DC 20 Strength check or DC 16 Escape Artist check.
      The webbing has 8 hit points. Note the victim is still grappled even if it
      breaks the webbing and must succeed at a grapple check to get completely
      free of the cerebral stalker's grasp. The check DCs are Constitution-based
      and the Strength check includes a +4 racial bonus. Once a victim is
      cocooned, the cerebral stalker can use its sink ability.
  - name: Consume Brain (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once it has its victim underground, the cerebral stalker begins gnawing on
      the victim's head, rapidly chewing through bone and tissue, dealing 2d8+4
      points of damage each round. When the victim dies, the cerebral stalker
      has reached its goal-the victim's brain, which it promptly devours. A
      victim slain in this manner is ejected from the ground and becomes a
      zombie (see below).
  - name: Earth Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cerebral stalker can glide through any sort of natural earth or stone as
      easily as a fish swims through water. Its gliding leaves no sign of its
      passage or hint of its presence to creatures that don't possess
      tremorsense. A move earth spell cast on an area.
  - name: Sink (Su)
    description: >-
      After cocooning a foe, the cerebral stalker begins sinking into the
      ground, taking the cocooned victim with it. It takes four full rounds for
      the stalker and foe to completely sink into the ground. In the first
      round, the creature sinks to its knees; in the second round to its waist;
      in the third round to its neck; and in the last round, both stalker and
      foe are completely underground. opportunity. Creatures attempting to grab
      the cocooned victim and prevent the sinking must first break or burn the
      webbing (see above), and then succeed at a grapple check against the
      cerebral stalker. A dispel magic (or similar effect) cast on a sinking
      cerebral stalker paralyzes it (as if by a hold monster spell) for a number
      of rounds equal to the caster's level if the stalker fails a Fortitude
      save. The stalker can make a new save each round to negate the paralysis.
      The stalker and victim sink to a depth of 10 feet where the victim is
      placed in a stasis (similar to temporal stasis). The spot where the
      cerebral stalker and victim sunk radiates magic and can be detected
      normally. Spells such as locate object, discern location, scrying, and
      other divinatory magic reveals the entombed creature and stalker. A
      freedom spell cast on the spot where the stalker and victim sunk
      immediately frees the subject from the webbing and ejects both it and the
      stalker, who is stunned for 1 round, to the surface.
Description:
  - >-
    A cerebral stalker is a carnivorous predator that lies in wait just below
    the surface of the ground for an unsuspecting victim to pass over or near
    it. When it detects its prey, the stalker bursts through the ground in a
    shower of rock and earth, cocoons its victim and disappears into the ground
    to devour the victim's brain.
  - >-
    The lair of a cerebral stalker is a large, hollow chamber of earth, often
    littered with skull fragments, bits of webbing, and chunks of brain matter.
  - >-
    Cerebral stalkers are solitary creatures and do not work in concert with
    others of their kind. They attack those of their own race if another
    attempts to take up residence in an area already inhabited by a cerebral
    stalker (the typical stalker's hunting ground covers an area of 5 square
    miles, though it rarely journeys that far from its lair). The lifespan and
    reproduction method of these creatures is completely unknown.
  - >-
    The cerebral stalker prefers to attack from ambush, hiding just below the
    surface of the ground where it uses its tremorsense ability to detect
    creatures moving above it. When it successfully detects a creature, it
    violently emerges from the ground (behind its target, if possible) and grabs
    the unsuspecting victim. A grappled opponent is quickly cocooned and pulled
    beneath the ground where its brain is devoured. Those interfering with the
    stalker as it sinks into the ground are subjected to its fear gaze.
