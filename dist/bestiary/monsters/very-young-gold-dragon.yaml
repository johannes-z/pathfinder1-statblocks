      Instead of a cone of fire, a gold dragon can breathe a cone of weakening
      gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1
      point of Strength damage per age category (Will save half).

  - >-
    Gold dragons are the epitome of virtue. Other metallic dragons revere their
    gold cousins as the agents of divine forces and the paragons of dragonkind,
    and often seek them for advice or aid.
