Description:
  - >-
    Chalicotheriums are massive creatures resembling sloths with vaguely equine
    heads and long forelimbs ending in wickedly sharp claws. These creatures are
    generally docile and will attack only when provoked, but they defend their
    homes and young from attack viciously. A typical adult chalicotherium is
    about 10 feet tall at the shoulder and 12 feet long from nose to rump, and
    weighs 14,000 pounds.
  - >-
    When on the ground, a chalicotherium seems almost to be standing upright, as
    its short, stocky rear legs support most of its body weight. Its ability to
    climb is superb, though only exceptionally large trees are sturdy enough to
    support it, and its long front limbs allow it to quickly ascend to dizzying
    heights even among relatively sparse foliage. The chalicotherium diet
    consists mainly of flowers and leaves, and a small family of these animals
    can quickly strip all the greenery from an area of forest before moving on.
  - >-
    Chalicotheriums are generally found alone or in breeding pairs with young.
    Chalicotheriums are protective of their offspring, which they produce in
    small litters of one to three pups at a time. These pups use their
    still-developing claws to hold on to a thick fat pad on the mother's back.
