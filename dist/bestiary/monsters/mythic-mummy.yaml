Description:
  - >-
    A mythic mummy is the preserved and animated remains or royalty-the honored
    dead a common mummy is compelled to protect. Wielding powers over sand and
    able to create new minions to replace the fallen, a mythic mummy is a
    formidable opponent. Its used to absolute obedience from living and undead
    subjects. If awakened from its eternal rest, a mythic mummy uses its magic
    to appear as it did in life, though if angered or surprised it may reveal
    its undead form.
