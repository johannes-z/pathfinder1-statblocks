  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a mythic mummy can expend one use of mythic power to
      transform a slain opponent into a non-mythic mummy with the advanced
      simple template. The new mummy is under the command of the mummy that
      created it, and remains enslaved until the mythic mummy's death, at which
      time it becomes a free-willed creature.

    description: >-
      A mythic mummy can command earth and sand within 100 feet to c reate a
      variety of spell-like effects. As a s tandard action, a mummy can reduce
      rock to sand (as transmute rock to mud) or create lifelike shapes made
      from sand (as major image, though these shapes collapse if disbelieved or
      attacked). The mummy can expend one use of mythic power to summon a giant
      advanced sandman (Bestiary 2 236). The mummy's caster level equals its Hit
      Dice for these effects.

      All creatures within a 30-foot radius that see a mummy must succeed at a
      DC 18 Will save or be paralyzed by fear for 1d4 rounds. A creature only
      has to attempt this save against a particular mummy's despair ability once
      every 24 hours. This is a paralysis and mind-affecting fear effect. The
      save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
  - name: Mummy Rot (Su)
    description: >-
      Curse and disease-slam; save Fort DC 18; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha; cure -. This otherwise functions like standard
      mummy rot. The DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic mummy is the preserved and animated remains or royalty-the honored
    dead a common mummy is compelled to protect. Wielding powers over sand and
    able to create new minions to replace the fallen, a mythic mummy is a
    formidable opponent. Its used to absolute obedience from living and undead
    subjects. If awakened from its eternal rest, a mythic mummy uses its magic
    to appear as it did in life, though if angered or surprised it may reveal
    its undead form.
