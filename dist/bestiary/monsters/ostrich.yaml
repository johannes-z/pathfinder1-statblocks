    description: >-
      An ostrich can hide in plain sight as a bush or shrub by crouching down
      and concealing its head and legs. It makes a Stealth check as normal, but
      anyone who observes it from within 30 feet automatically sees through the
      ruse.
Description:
  - >-
    Adult female ostriches average 6 feet tall and weigh about 220 pounds, with
    males averaging 7 to 9 feet and 250 pounds. Although they are likely to flee
    from predators when they can, ostriches are more than willing to stand and
    fight when trapped or defending their chicks; they're known to kick even
    lions to death in defense of their young.
  - >-
    A trained ostrich has a market price of 80 gp, whereas an egg is worth 25
    gp. Because it's bipedal, an ostrich requires an exotic saddle.
