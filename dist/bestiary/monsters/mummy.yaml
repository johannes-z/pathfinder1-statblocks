SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Despair (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures within a 30-foot radius that see a mummy must make a DC 16
      Will save or be paralyzed by fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save
      is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same mummy's
      despair ability for 24 hours. This is a paralysis and a mind-affecting
      fear affect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Mummy Rot (Su)
    description: >-
      Curse and disease-slam; save Fort DC 16; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day;
      effect 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha; cure -. Mummy rot is both a curse and disease
      and can only be cured if the curse is first removed, at which point the
      disease can be magically removed. Even after the curse element of mummy
      rot is lifted, a creature suffering from it cannot recover naturally over
      time. Anyone casting a conjuration (healing) spell on the afflicted
      creature must succeed on a DC 20 caster level check, or the spell is
      wasted and the healing has no effect. Anyone who dies from mummy rot turns
      to dust and cannot be raised without a resurrection or greater magic. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Created to guard the tombs of the honored dead, mummies are ever vigilant
    for those who would desecrate their sacred ground. Mummies are created
    through a rather lengthy and gruesome embalming process, during which all of
    the body's major organs are removed and replaced with dried herbs and
    flowers. After this process, the flesh is anointed with sacred oils and
    wrapped in purified linens. The creator then finishes the ritual with a
    create undead spell. Although most mummies are created merely as guardians
    and remain loyal to their charge until their destruction, certain powerful
    mummies have much more free will. The majority are at least 10th-level
    clerics, and are often kings or pharaohs who have called upon dark gods or
    sinister necromancers to bind their souls to their bodies after
    death-usually as a means to extend their rule beyond the grave, but at times
    simply to escape what they fear will be an eternity of torment in their own
    afterlife.
