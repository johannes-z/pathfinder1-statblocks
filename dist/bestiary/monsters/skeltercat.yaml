  The tawny coat of this snarling feline resembles that of a mountain lion,
  though this creature is much more muscular and carries itself with a strange
  posture.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mixed Mind (Ex)
    description: >-
      A skeltercat's mind is a bizarre combination of animal instinct and human
      intellect. This disordered consciousness grants the creature immunity to
      confusion effects. Additionally, any creature that attempts to read a
      skeltercat's mind or communicate with it telepathically must succeed at a
      DC 13 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Musk (Ex)
    description: >-
      A skeltercat has glands that produce a noxious musk. Any living creature
      within 10 feet must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or be nauseated for
      1d4 rounds and sickened for 1 minute afterward. A creature that
      successfully saves is instead sickened for 1d4 rounds and can't be
      affected again by the same skeltercat's musk for 24 hours. This is a
      poison effect, and other skeltercats are immune to this effect. A
      skeltercat can suppress this effect as a free action. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Partial Transformation (Su)
    description: >-
      A skeltercat can alter portions of its body in order to give itself access
      to certain abilities. As a standard action three times per day, a
      skeltercat can gain one of the abilities listed below. A partial
      transformation lasts for 10 minutes. As a swift action, a skeltercat that
      has already activated a partial transformation can spend an additional use
      of this ability to switch which benefit it receives. Only one such benefit
      can be in effect at a time. Climb: The skeltercat's claws extend, granting
      it a climb speed equal to half its base land speed. Additionally, when
      falling within arm's reach of a wall, ledge, or something else it could
      grab on to for stability, it can slow its descent, taking damage as if the
      fall were 20 feet shorter. Hide: The skeltercat's hide bristles like that
      of an angry cat and grows thicker, increasing its natural armor bonus by
      2. Legs: The skeltercat grows an additional pair of legs, bringing its
      total to six, increasing its base land speed to 60 feet, and granting it
      the rake special ability. The rake attacks use the same damage and
      critical threat range as the skeltercat's normal claw attacks. Swim: The
      skeltercat grows webbing between its toes and whale-like flukes on its
      tail, granting it a swim speed equal to its base land speed. Additionally,
      it gains the hold breath universal monster ability. Tail: The skeltercat's
      tail grows thick and clublike. It gains a tail slap as a primary attack
      that deals 1d6 points of damage plus trip on a successful hit.
  - name: Scream (Su)
    description: >-
      A skeltercat can release a terrifying cry that affects all creatures
      within a 300-foot spread. All creatures in that area must succeed at a DC
      13 Will save or become panicked for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic,
      mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against
      this effect can't be affected by the same skeltercat's scream for 24
      hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    For a long time, many experts believed the creature now known as the
    skeltercat existed only in the folklore of the Shoanti tribes or in the
    far-fetched tales of a few wild-eyed travelers. Only with the recent
    reopening of the Bloodsworn Vale have rumors of the skeltercat's existence
    been taken seriously. As traffic through the vale increases, reports of
    attacks by strange, shapeshifting cats are growing startlingly commonplace.
    Such tales are told most frequently in the fortress city of Skelt, a common
    stopover for merchants traveling through the Bloodsworn Vale. The stories
    out of Skelt gave these creatures their name.
  - >-
    The skeltercat resembles a heavily muscled cougar or mountain lion, having a
    tawny coat, powerful paws with retractable claws, and strong hind legs that
    allow it to jump great distances. It primarily walks about on all fours,
    adopting an oddly hunched posture that distinguishes it from normal cats.
    When faced with a threat, a skeltercat rises onto its hind legs, walking
    upright in a disturbingly human fashion. An adult skeltercat stands just shy
    of 8 feet tall when fully upright, and weighs up to 300 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Many generations ago, a small band of Shoanti warriors lived high in the
    Mindspin Mountains near the headwaters of the Yondabakari River. This band,
    whose name is now long lost, were the first to feel the bite of Chelish
    steel as the southerners began their push into Varisia. These Shoanti fought
    back against the invaders as best they could, but they had no shaman in
    their group, and soon found they were no match for Chelish magic. Though
    they begged the clans of the lowlands to train them in such arts, they were
    repeatedly refused. No clan wanted to share its secrets with the notorious
    raiders of the mountain tribe, and none yet realized the threat the Chelish
    invasion would soon pose.
  - >-
    As a desperate ploy, members of the mountain tribe stole down into the
    lowlands to spy on the druids and shamans of the other tribes, hoping to
    steal the secrets of the magic they had been denied. These spies observed a
    druid from the lowlands wildshaping herself into a mountain lion, and having
    listened carefully to the magic incantations she used, they returned to tell
    the tribe what they had found. Whether by chance or fate, the incantations
    worked, and soon the whole tribe had become fearsome cougars, just as the
    druid had. Only too late did they realize their spies had not learned how to
    reverse the transformation. Try as they might, they were able to become only
    partly human. Trapped somewhere between human and cat forms, the members of
    this reclusive mountain tribe were cursed to become the first skeltercats.
  - >-
    Though created by a magical accident, skeltercats breed true, and a
    skeltercat that mates with a normal cougar invariably produces skeltercat
    offspring. Much like mountain lions, skeltercats are carnivores, though
    unlike mundane cats, they display a distinct preference for humanoid prey.
    Though skeltercats will attack any humanoid, they appear to prefer Chelish
    flesh to any other, perhaps due to some ancestral memory of the original
    skeltercats' conf licts with Chelish invaders. Skeltercats live slightly
    longer than normal cougars, having an average lifespan of 30 to 40 years.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Although skeltercats live throughout the Mindspin Mountains, they are
    especially concentrated in the Bloodsworn Vale. Outside of the vale,
    skeltercats are most often found in and around hill giant camps. The brutish
    giants admire the skeltercats' savage ferocity, and often share their food
    with the cats to
  - >-
    encourage them to remain in the area. For their part, the cats keep the area
    surrounding the giants' camp free from lesser predators and pick off any
    creatures attempting to escape the giants' clutches. Skeltercats may also
    serve as guards for the giants as they sleep through the night, and the last
    thing a group of adventurers may hear when attempting to ambush a band of
    giants is the yowl of a pouncing skeltercat.
  - >-
    The Shoanti have a complicated relationship with skeltercats. Though many
    Shoanti tribespeople have lost their lives to the shapeshifters' claws, the
    Shoanti nonetheless insist that skeltercats act as guardians for their
    people. An obscure Shoanti myth holds that the first skeltercat was once a
    Shoanti warrior who wished to defend her tribe from a demon that inflicted
    terrible madness upon its foes. Seeking a way to protect herself from the
    demon's insanity-inducing gaze, the warrior donned a magical cougar mask
    created by the shaman of her tribe. The mask worked, and the warrior was
    able to drive the demon away. However, she discovered too late that she
    could not remove the mask, and she was cursed to forever roam the land in
    the form of a fearsome mountain lion.
  - >-
    Though this myth is just a mangled retelling of the skeltercat's true
    origins, there may be some truth to it. Skeltercats are inherently immune to
    madness and confusion effects, and some claim that those who wear the hide
    of a skeltercat can gain some measure of this immunity for themselves.
