Description_Visual: >-
  A hulking humanoid cloaked in ragged cloth limps forward, its malformed,
  tumorous arms ending in claws the length of scythe blades. From beneath its
  rags droop lengths of loose flesh and a strangled wheezing issues from its
  deformed lips.

  - name: Repulsive (Ex)
    description: >-
      Thawns find the appearance of themselves and others of their kind
      revolting. As such, most wear heavy cloaks or otherwise obscure their
      countenances. All thawns within 30 feet of an uncloaked thawn must make a
      DC 15 Will save or be sickened for 1 round. This repulsion is all the more
      severe when a thawn sees its own reflection. Should a thawn be confronted
      with its own reflection (such as being presented with a mirror) it must
      make a DC 15 Will save or be sickened for 1d4+1 rounds.
Description:
  - >-
    Grotesque nomads native to wretched plains and barren hills, thawns seem to
    bear the curse of both nature and the divine. Ogre-like in stature and
    dimwittedness, these monstrously ugly humanoids bear fold upon fold of
    sagging, excess flesh, draping them in wrinkled, poxriddled hides. This
    wretched appearance, in tandem with their great size and monstrous claws,
    leads most creatures to shun them. Indeed, even thawns find one another
    repulsive, creating a barely tolerable society of universal mistrust and
    loathing. Thawns average 9 feet tall and their excess skin pushes their
    average weight to 700 pounds. Ecology Often called "mud giants" due to the
    foul, mottled skin that hangs loosely from their misshapen frames, thawns
    are universally malformed and dreadful, though each is quite distinctive in
    its singular monstrousness. Hair only grows in small tufts-thick, oily, and
    black. Their eyes easily pick up the flaws in their appearance, driving them
    to hide their figures as much as possible. Such revulsion of their form has
    led many scholars to hypothesize that thawns once possessed a different one,
    potentially relating them directly to ogres, hill giants, or other humanoids
    victimized by the hands of some more powerful and malicious race. Such
    possibilities remain nothing more than conjecture, however, as the brutes
    have no ability and even less interest in retaining details of their
    history. Even with this overpowering self-loathing, ancient instincts drive
    thawns together for safety and procreation, and no other race tolerates
    their ugliness and savagery. Opportunistic feeders, thawns seek out fresh
    battlefields and the scraps of slain beasts, reluctantly sharing their
    pickings with other parasites and scavengers. Alone as they wander the
    lands, thawns take care of their own needs first and foremost, caring little
    for others of their kind. Disdaining anything like a fair fight, they excel
    at crafting clever decoys and simple traps. Though sizable creatures, thawns
    typically strive to draw as little attention to themselves as possible,
    preferring to craft convincing dummies from mud, stone, and animal carcasses
    while they wait in hiding. Habitat & Society Most thawns collect in nomadic
    groups, wandering grim plains and moody hills more like ravaging gangs than
    tribes traveling out of necessity. While their dim intellects provide them
    the most basic tools to seek out what they need to survive, their lives
    prove pitiful and often violently short. Hateful of themselves and their own
    kind, thawns aspire to no great works. Their nomadism thus comes less from
    need as from indifference, as one ugly hillside or leaking cave proves
    little better or worse than any other. It's their own inhabitance that
    causes most thawns to move on, as once they've despoiled an area, it's then
    time to find new lands. This cycle of pillaging and pressing on proves
    uncomfortable to most thawns, but most lack the foresight to live any other
    way. Groups of thawns prove highly changeable, with members joining and
    leaving with little hesitation. As no love is lost between members, the
    savages drift apart as the whim takes them. Typically such changes in group
    structure go ignored, unless those left behind believe their former kinsman
    possesses some valuable information or reason for departing. Thawns don't
    believe in hoarding material possessions, disdaining most metals and
    valuables in part because shiny surfaces invariably betray their monstrous
    visages to them. They use whatever is nearest at hand to satisfy their basic
    needs, though some carry with them items of simple usefulness or trophies of
    brutal victories. They move away from defended and civilized areas out of
    simple survival instinct, but attack small groups of humanoids if driven to
    desperation. Occasionally some uninformed samaritan attempts to take pity on
    a thawn, believing it cast out merely for its appearance and simplicity.
    Such charity typically proves fatal, though, as in the case of these hulks,
    their outward ugliness matches a dull-witted sadism and raving, violent
    hatred of all living things. Even ogres, with whom they hold many
    similarities, revile thawns as mindless killers and bogeymen, attacking and
    slaying them on sight. If mud giants excel at any one thing, it's physical
    deception. Knowing most creatures' hatred of them and their widespread
    treatment as dangerous lepers, they have learned to hide themselves where no
    sane creature would lurk and deceive eyes that would seek them with
    loathing. Thus, thawns willingly lair and hide amid filth-choked pools,
    muddy ravines, rotting bogs, and worse places. To aid them in their
    ambushes, they often create cunningly hidden pits, similar simple traps,
    and, most notoriously, decoys. With their misshapen frames, it's not
    difficult to mistake a tall, awkward pile of mud and rocks covered in rags
    for a thawn, while the reverse also proves dangerously true. More than one
    wary traveler, sighting a thawn-like shape upon a low hillock or on a dusty
    trail, has circled widely to avoid the dangerous hunter only to blunder into
    the ambush of the true thawn lurking in wait. Treasure Thawns rarely keep
    any possessions other than those which they can carry, these typically being
    crude or foul items even the most desperate wayfarers wouldn't consider
    clothing or food. In filthy sacks or-even more revoltingly- slung in useful
    flesh folds, there is a 40% chance that any thawn possesses 1d4 unsettling
    items, typically scraps of skin, leather, and stolen cloth for the creation
    of new cloaks; trophies of skulls, bones, and hide bound into crude
    fetishes; and rotting animal meat of unwholesome cuts and uncertain origin.
    Such things are typically soiled beyond use and rarely valuable, but often
    suggest what victims the mud giant has recently preyed upon and where their
    foul wanderings have led them.
