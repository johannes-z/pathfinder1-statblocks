  warm light.
Source: Lost Treasures
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alternate Form (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a gold colossus can take the form of an immense
      war monument. Its DR in this form increases to 20/epic, and its aura of
      blazing courage's radius increases to 1,000 feet. While in this form, it
      can't attack.
  - name: Aura of Blazing Courage (Su)
    description: >-
      A gold colossus constantly radiates a warm aura of bravery. Allies within
      30 feet of a gold colossus gain the benefits of bless and remove fear.
  - name: Blessing of the Gilded Host (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per week, a gold colossus can bless an army using the rules for mass
      combat (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign 234), granting the army a +2
      bonus to its Offensive Modifier and on Morale checks until the end of its
      next battle or for 1 week, whichever comes first.
  - name: Selective Antimagic Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Spells with the compulsion or teleportation descriptor are unaffected by
      this field.
  - name: Suppressing Stomp (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a gold colossus deals stomp damage to a target, it reduces the
      target's damage reduction and spell resistance by 2 for 1 minute. Each
      stomp thereafter increases the reduction by 2 (maximum reduction of 10)
      and resets the duration.
Description:
  - >-
    Individually, the component pieces of the Champion of the Gilded Host have
    the same strong magic aura as the intact construct, but possess no
    noteworthy abilities of their own. Any piece with a joint may flex
    occasionally, but without any purpose or significant force. When the pieces
    are brought within 100 feet of one another, they reassemble themselves to
    create a golden colossus. Long-forgotten command words keyed to each piece
    are able to shrink it to a fraction of its full size.
