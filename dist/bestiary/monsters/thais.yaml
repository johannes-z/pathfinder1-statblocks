    She typically appears as a 15-foot-tall, angelic woman, but can change her
    size to be anywhere from 4 feet to 32 feet tall. She is always portrayed
    carrying her signature weapon, a crystalline halberd called Tyranny's Foil

    can use the weapon to open all nonmagical doors and break all nonmagical
    chains within 30 feet.
