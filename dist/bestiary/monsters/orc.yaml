    Along with their brute strength and comparatively low intellect, the primary
    difference between orcs and the civilized humanoids is their attitude. As a
    culture, orcs are violent and aggressive, with the strongest ruling the rest
    through fear and brutality. They take what they want by force, and think
    nothing of slaughtering or enslaving entire villages when they can get away
    with it. They have little time for niceties or details, and their camps and
    villages tend to be filthy, ramshackle affairs filled with drunken brawls,
    pit fights, and other sadistic entertainment. Lacking the patience for
    farming and only able to shepherd the most robust and self-sufficient
    animals, orcs almost always find it easier to take what someone else has
    built than to create things themselves. They are arrogant and quick to anger
    when challenged, but only worry about honor so far as it directly benefits
    them to do so. An adult male orc is roughly 6 feet tall and 210 pounds. Orcs
    and humans interbreed frequently, though this is almost always the result of
    raids and slave-taking rather than consensual unions. Many orc tribes
    purposefully breed for half-orcs and raise them as their own, as the smarter
    progeny make excellent strategists and leaders for their tribes. Orc
    Characters Orcs are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial
    Hit Dice. All orcs have the following racial traits. +4 Strength, -2
    Intelligence, -2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma: Orcs are brutal and savage.
    Darkvision: Orcs can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Ferocity: See universal
    monster rules, page 300. Light Sensitivity: See universal monster rules,
    page 301. Weapon Familiarity: Orcs are always proficient with greataxes and
    falchions, and treat any weapon with the word "orc" in its name as a martial
    weapon. Languages: Orcs begin play speaking Common and Orc. Orcs with high
    Intelligence scores can choose from among the following bonus languages:
    Dwarven, Giant, Gnoll, Goblin, Undercommon.
