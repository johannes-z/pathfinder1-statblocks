Description_Visual: >-
  Surfacing from the depths emerges a colossal slug. Its swollen flesh is a
  hideous mottled greenish-gray and rows of undulating gills line its 30- foot
  long body. Probing with a large set of antennae it gnashes its great mouth
  exposing a gullet lined with rows and rows of serrated teeth.

  - name: Capsize (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant sea slug can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a
      charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the
      result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher.
      For each size category the ship is larger than the sea slug's size, the
      sea slug takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.
Description:
  - >-
    Spending a large portion of its life crawling across the floors of lakes and
    seas, the giant sea slug is rarely encountered, save by accident or
    happenstance. Stories are told of these great monsters surfacing beneath
    ships, tipping them over, and then feasting on the survivors. There is
    little truth to these stories, as the giant sea slug prefers a diet of
    plants and aquatic sea life. Instead, giant sea slugs are docile creatures,
    dieting on aquatic plants such as kelp, seaweed, and coral. They are known
    to surface for air occasionally though they do not require air to breathe.
  - >-
    Most of the stories that speak of these creatures attacking ships are the
    result of a giant sea slug surfacing for air beneath a ship that happened to
    be in the way.
  - >-
    A typical encounter with a giant sea slug occurs when the creature surfaces
    beneath a ship or boat and capsizes it. The giant sea slug isn't really
    attacking, it's just surfacing for air-and once again a ship or boat has
    gotten in its way. They may inadvertently swallow sailors or swimmers who
    are in the water when the giant sea slug opens its mouth.
  - >-
    Non-aggressive, they rarely engage in combat, however if provoked, they
    attack opponents by biting with their sharp, jagged teeth.
