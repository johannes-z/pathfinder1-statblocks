  - name: Fire Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      An old or older gold dragon is surrounded by an aura of fire. All
      creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at
      the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient gold dragon's aura extends
      to 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. The dragon can
      activate or suppress this aura as a free action.
  - name: Luck (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can touch a gem, usually one
      embedded in the dragon's hide, and enspell it to bring good luck. As long
      as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature within a given
      radius of it (10 ft. per age category) receives a +1 luck bonus on all
      saving throws. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature,
      only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours
      per age category of the dragon. This ability is the equivalent of a
      2nd-level spell. Spell-Like

    Gold dragons are the epitome of virtue. Other metallic dragons revere their
    gold cousins as the agents of divine forces and the paragons of dragonkind,
    and often seek them for advice or aid.
