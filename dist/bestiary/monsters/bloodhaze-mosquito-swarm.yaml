  A high-pitched whine issues forth from the haze of this surging crimson cloud.
  Within, thousands of tiny forms whir in agitation, each a tiny insect with a
  needle-like proboscis.

    description: >-
      If a creature leaves a bloodhaze mosquito swarm's square, the swarm takes
      1d6 points of damage as dozens of insects tenaciously cling to the victim.
      A creature with bloodhaze mosquitoes clinging to it takes 1 point of
      Constitution damage at the end of its turn for the next 1d4 rounds. As a
      full-round action, the creature can remove the mosquitoes with a DC 18
      Reflex save or by immersing itself in water. High winds or any amount of
      damage from an area-affecting effect destroys all clinging mosquitoes. The
      save DC is Dexterity-based. Once a group of clinging mosquitoes has dealt
      4 points of Constitution damage, the mosquitoes detach and disperse to
      digest their meal.

      Bloodhaze mosquitoes are bearers of a terrifying and deadly disease common
      to the jungle, known to most locals as sleeping sickness. Sleeping
      Sickness: Swarm-injury; save Fort DC 17; onset 1d2 days; frequency 1 day;
      effect 1d4 Wisdom damage and target is fatigued, cure 2 consecutive saves

Description:
  - >-
    Thousands of species of insects make their home within the shelter of the
    Mwangi Expanse, but few elicit as much dread as the voracious bloodhaze
    mosquito. Migratory in nature, these ravenous insects amass in great
    numbers, forming swarms capable of feasting on the blood of humanoids and
    beasts alike. Perhaps worse, the crimson parasites carry a debilitating
    disease known for sapping the vitality of its victims. Because of this
    potent mix of teeming esurience and virulent pestilence, bloodhaze
    mosquitoes panic almost any community they threaten. Legends describe
    crimson clouds decimating entire populations on their flight from breeding
    pool to jungle interior. Only high winds, drought, and torrential rain
    consistently keep them at bay. Thankfully, the swarms also wax and wane with
    fluctuations in local prey populations. In combination with the mosquitoes'
    relatively short lifespan, competition for food helps keep their numbers
    under marginal control. A typical bloodhaze swarm contains more than 10,000
    flying mosquitoes. Individually, each mosquito is smaller than a child's
    fingernail, yet together they form a terrifying assault. Their iridescent
    wings can refract light, creating a shimmering effect as they move in
    unison. This effect proves disconcerting to most animals, which wisely flee
    such clouds, their panic often alerting other jungle inhabitants to the
    swarm's presence. Ecology Bloodhaze mosquitoes always sate themselves on the
    blood of other animals, using their darkvision and ability to detect
    pheromones to track prey. They typically lie in wait near water sources
    where they can both breed and feed on animals that come to drink.
    Warm-blooded creatures draw their attention more quickly than amphibians or
    reptiles, though even lizards, snakes, and frogs become food sources during
    leaner times. Not only does blood provide sustenance to bloodhaze
    mosquitoes, but the females actually require it to reach egg-laying
    maturity. Females must also have water in which to lay their eggs, though
    even a sewage-filled mud puddle will suffice. A single female mosquito can
    lay up to 100 eggs, which hatch into larvae after 2 days. Many of these eggs
    suffer the predation of fish and other aquatic scavengers during this time
    of vulnerability. The surviving eggs hatch, releasing larvae that molt and
    shed their skins while feeding on organic matter and microorganisms in the
    water. Then they enter a pupal stage, conserving energy as they undergo a
    final transformation before finally emerging as fully grown adults. The
    entire hatching and growth process takes less than a single week. After
    reaching maturity, bloodhaze mosquitoes swiftly take to the air, naturally
    drawn to one another through their pheromones and banding together in swarms
    strong enough to challenge any animal for territorial supremacy. The life of
    a typical bloodhaze mosquito spans only 3 months. They spend that time
    ravenously feeding in their swarms, consuming enough blood that their
    females can continue laying eggs. The mosquitoes possess no maternal or
    protective instincts, however, quickly abandoning their progeny before dying
    out to be replaced by them. Habitat & Society Bloodhaze mosquitoes live in
    tropical wetlands, only venturing farther away when hunting becomes scarce
    or high winds carry them into other regions. Unintelligent predators, the
    mosquitoes give off pheromones to maintain their swarm's cohesion. Specific
    scent markers for distress, mating, and food rule most of their behavior.
    Powerful, false odors or thick and pungent smoke can sometimes mask or
    disrupt this communication, as can immersion in water, leading to traditions
    among many native peoples of coating themselves in sulphurous mud or burning
    reeking torches during the height of the mosquitoes' feeding seasons.
    Although bloodhaze mosquitoes don't feed on other insects, they do prove
    highly territorial. While swarming, a group of the mosquitoes will attack
    and kill any other insects they encounter. Such ferocity can wipe out whole
    hives or nests of insectile jungle inhabitants, potentially having
    farther-reaching ramifications for other creatures speedy or canny enough to
    escape the swarms. In more dramatic instances, swarms might fell massive
    jungle insects or the populations of whole areas, leaving trails of
    crunching insectile corpses to mark their path. Mwangi Menaces Deadly
    beasts, trackless wildernesses, and violent storms typify most explorers'
    visions of travel through the Mwangi Expanse. Yet however real and deadly
    such perils may be, they are hardly the only threats travelers through these
    lands face. Diseases, vermin, parasites, rot, and uncountable other hazards
    unite in an endless assault against those who intrude upon these wild lands.
    Maladies like the sleeping sickness carried by bloodhaze mosquito swarms and
    other insects present just one such danger. While the following details
    present that disease, GMs who seek to make their tropical travels feel
    distinct from adventures elsewhere on Golarion should check out Chapter 1 of
    Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Heart of the Jungle for details on jungle
    maladies and other threats. Sleeping Sickness Endemic throughout the Sodden
    Lands and the Mwangi Expanse, the parasitic aff liction known as "sleeping
    sickness" is spread when flying insects inject tiny parasites into their
    unsuspecting victim's bloodstream, thus inducing fever, headache, joint
    pain, swelling of glands in the back and neck, and most notably fatigue. The
    disease gradually infects the brain, causing confusion, reduced
    coordination, difficulty keeping track of time, and insomnia. While
    exceedingly dangerous, even when administered by a practiced healer, the
    best cure for this disease is dosing the patient with the poison arsenic
    (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 558). If the patient survives, there's a
    cumulative 30% chance per dose that the disease is immediately cured.
