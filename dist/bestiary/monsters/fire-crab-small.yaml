Description_Visual: >-
  At various places in the planes, rifts of special tears appear and allow the
  mundane creatures of one plane to intermix with the creatures of other planes.
  On these occasions, it is most often not the terrible beasts such as demons or
  angels that pour through, but much less powerful (but not harmless) creatures
  mirroring the beasts of the natural realm.

Description:
  - >-
    These small crabs are about the size of a man's fist. They are a deep
    reddish color, tapering to yellow on the underbelly.
  - The fire crab's heat extends roughly 3 to 5 ft.
  - >-
    Fire crabs are omnivorous; they feed on other animals and any plant life
    that survives the fire crabs native environment. The fire crabs may survive
    temperatures lower than 100 degrees for 1 hour per point of Constitution, or
    run the risk of freezing.
