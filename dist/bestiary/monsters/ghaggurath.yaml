Description_Visual: >-
  This massive creature appears to be a pile of brownish-gray flesh covered in
  large eyes. Eight long tentacles sprout from its body, each ending in a mouth
  lined with sharpened fangs. Its large central mass is amoeba-like and oozes a
  foul-smelling liquid.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Thrall worm-injury; save DC 30 Fort; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds;
      effect 1d6 Wisdom damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Resistance to Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      A ghaggurath is highly resistant to poison. Whenever it makes a saving
      throw against poison, it can roll its save twice, keeping the better
      result.
  - name: Spittle (Ex)
    description: >-
      In lieu of biting, a tentacle mouth can eject a fleshy worm, called a
      thrall worm, at a single target to a range of 50 feet. A target that is
      hit is automatically bitten by the worm and subjected to the ghaggurath's
      poison. Regardless of which head fires the worm, a ghaggurath can launch
      only 24 such worms in any 24-hour period. When a thrall worm strikes its
      target, it quickly burrows into the target's body. This worm can be safely
      removed with a successful DC 30 Heal check or by the application of a cure
      spell; otherwise removing the worm deals an extra 1d6 points of damage to
      the target. After 1d4 rounds, the worm works its way so deep into the
      target's body that it can only be removed by cutting open the area
      (dealing 1d8 points of damage to the victim) before attempting a Heal
      check or casting a cure spell. A remove disease spell destroys the worm if
      the caster succeeds on a caster level check against DC 30. As long as a
      thrall worm remains inside a target, the target cannot heal the Wisdom
      damage dealt by the ghaggurath's poison. A creature can only ever have one
      thrall worm inside it at one time; it can however be attacked by and
      bitten by multiple thrall worms. The check DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Thrall (Su)
    description: >-
      A victim whose Wisdom score drops to 0 from the ghaggurath's poison is
      automatically dominated (as by a dominate monster spell, CL 20th). This
      effect lasts until the thrall worm is removed and at least 1 point of
      Wisdom is restored. The ghaggurath does not have to concentrate each day
      to maintain this effect, and a dominated creature does not receive a save
      to break the effects. If the ghaggurath is slain, any thrall under its
      command fall unconscious and remain so until the thrall worm is removed
      and at least 1 point of Wisdom is restored.
Description:
  - >-
    The ghaggurath is a massive subterranean creature feared for its ability to
    enslave others to its will, and feared for its ability to devour just about
    anything it desires. Though the ghaggurath has a seemingly endless hunger,
    it can in fact go up to 6 months without a meal; its body enters a sort of
    hibernation to sustain the creature. During this time, many creatures assume
    the ghaggurath is vulnerable; it isn't. Though the creature appears to be
    hibernating, it is completely aware of its surroundings. Many would-be
    predators and foolish adventurers have stumbled upon a hibernating
    ghaggurath assuming it unaware, only to become the creature's next meal.
  - >-
    Resourceful adventurers who have braved the subterranean worlds tell of huge
    cities governed by ghagguraths and whose entire populations are enslaved and
    under command of these creatures. Other tales speak of an underground race
    of humans that worship the ghaggurath as deities. Most subterranean races
    fear these creatures and avoid them at all costs.
  - >-
    In combat, a ghaggurath lashes out with its tentacles, the mouths biting and
    gnashing its opponents. A grabbed foe is held and subjected to multiple
    bites. Stronger opponents, particularly spellcasters, are of great interest
    to a ghaggurath, and it usually subjects such opponents to its thrall worms,
    attempting to bring them under its control. Controlled spellcasters are
    forced to do the ghaggurath's bidding or carried back to their great
    underground cities, enslaved, and experimented upon. Eventually, when a
    ghaggurath grows weary of the creature, it devours it.
