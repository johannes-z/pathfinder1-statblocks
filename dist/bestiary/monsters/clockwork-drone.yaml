Description:
  - >-
    Imbued with magic that allows it to fly, a drone has an approach typically
    marked by the low buzz of its tiny gears and pistons, which work furiously
    to maintain the magical field that allows it to fly. These clockworks are
    designed to act as observers. When a drone finds an advantageous position
    from which to maintain its watch, it uses a small, metallic claw on its
    underside to attach itself to a surface.
  - >-
    Drones usually avoid combat at all costs. When they are pressed into
    fighting, they prefer to aid their fellow clockworks by distracting their
    enemies.
