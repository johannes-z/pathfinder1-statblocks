Description_Visual: >-
  This creature seems to have no true shape, as its outline flickers and changes
  seemingly at random. At first it appears to have four tentacles, then in a
  flicker eight more appear and waver menacingly before shimmering once more out
  of existence. Its general shape is serpentine, with an uncertain number of
  tentacles dangling beneath it, but the only constants are its six glowing
  eyes, three on each side of what must be its head.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disintegration (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, as a full-round action, a quantum can attack with a
      single tentacle. If it hits, it sets up subatomic vibrations that shake
      apart the molecular structure of its opponent. The target must succeed on
      a DC 32 Fortitude save or take 40d6 points of damage. Even if the save
      succeeds, the target takes 10d6 points of damage. This effect functions as
      a disintegrate spell (CL 34th). A quantum can use this ability when it
      uses its quantum form. Each use by one of its forms counts against its
      daily use limit. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Quantum Form (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day and once per round, a quantum can move in such a way
      as to appear in two places at once, at a distance no greater than 30 feet.
      This is a free action that provokes an attack of opportunity and lasts
      only one round. While occupying two spaces simultaneously, each
      representation of the quantum can perform one independent standard action
      (including using the quantum's special attacks). Using this ability, the
      same quantum could attack two different opponents, or attack one opponent
      while opening a door to escape, and so on. At the end of the round, both
      instances of the quantum return to the space it originally occupied before
      activating this ability.
  - name: Quantum Movement (Su)
    description: >-
      At will a quantum can use the dimension door spell as a standard action
      (CL 34th).
  - name: Unstable Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A quantum has a deflection bonus to its Armor Class equal to its Charisma
      bonus. Further, because it moves by means of short-distance teleportation,
      attacks aimed at a quantum have a 20% miss chance.
Description:
  - >-
    The quantums hail from beyond and between all planes. The first quantum is
    said to have followed a lost band of adventurers back after they became lost
    on a planar journey.
  - >-
    A quantum exists simultaneously in many dimensions at once, which gives it a
    flickering, seemingly insubstantial shape as if some mad god is continually
    creating and re-creating it on a whim. If its form could somehow be
    stabilized into only three dimensions, a quantum would resemble a flattened
    jellyfish with a knob at the top containing six unblinking eyes. It has an
    oblong body with many tentacles radiating out from beneath its body. The
    exact number of tentacles cannot be known, however, since stabilizing a
    quantum's shape is a task yet to be undertaken and may not even be possible.
  - >-
    Quantums move by avoiding space entirely. A quantum hovers like some eerie
    jellyfish but doesn't fly by conventional means. Instead a quantum actually
    teleports short distances too fast for the eye to detect and in this manner
    it appears to be hovering. A quantum can also teleport across greater
    distances. At one moment a quantum can be in one space and then in an
    instant it is somewhere else, having never been at any point between. The
    flickering form of a quantum allows it to attack with one tentacle, two,
    six, as many as it needs. Attack-capable limbs seem to manifest themselves
    as they are needed, then vanish again as if they had never existed.
  - >-
    A quantum lashes out at its foes with its tentacles. Against a particularly
    powerful opponent, it uses its disintegration attack. When facing multiple
    foes, a quantum uses its quantum form to better its odds or make its escape.
