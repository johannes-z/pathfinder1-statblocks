      As a free action, once every 1d4 rounds (but no more than three times per
      day), a gallows tree zombie can breathe a cloud of poisonous, greenish
      spores in a 5-foot cube directly in front of it. A creature caught in the
      cloud must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or be slowed (as the slow
      spell) for 6 rounds. One minute later, the creature must make another
      Fortitude save (same DC) or take 1d3 points of Strength damage. The save
      DC is Constitution-based. Tether-Vine (Ex) A gallows tree zombie is
      connected to the gallows tree that created it by a long, sinewy vine. This
      vine can be lengthened to allow the zombie to move up to 100 feet away
      from the tree. The vine is AC 19 (touch 12) and has 10 hit points. Harming
      the vine deals no damage to the gallows tree zombie or the gallows tree,
      but if severed, does prevent the zombie from using its fast healing
      ability.

      Gallows tree zombies can automatically sense the location of anything
      within 60 feet that is in contact with the same vegetation the zombie is
      touching.
Description:
  - >-
    Gallows tree zombies were once living humanoids slain and devoured by a
    gallows tree and reborn from the seedlings as a minion of said creature.
  - >-
    They serve no purpose in life now other than killing or capturing living
    prey for the gallows tree that created them. These monsters retain small
    memories of their former lives and these scenes sometimes manifest in the
    zombie's mind, causing it great anger which it vents on the nearest living
    creature.
  - >-
    Gallows tree zombies appear as humanoid creatures with deathly graygreen
    skin that feels coarse and rough to the touch. A long, sinewy cord of
    greenish-brown wraps around the zombie's throat and connects it to the
    gallows tree. Gallows tree zombies show no spark of life in their eyes, but
    are not completely mindless. They are not undead even though their name
    suggests otherwise; therefore, they cannot be turned or rebuked.
  - >-
    Gallows tree zombies hang motionless from the tree that created them, being
    lowered to the ground only when a living creature comes within 100 feet of
    the gallows tree they are connected to. They are formidable opponents and
    relentlessly pound their foes with their club-like fists while breathing a
    cloud of choking spores. The zombies prefer uneven odds that favor them, so
    ganging up on an individual is the norm in battle.
  - >-
    Slain foes are dragged back to the gallows tree, devoured by the tree, and
    eventually transformed into a gallows tree zombie to replace any that fell
    in battle.
