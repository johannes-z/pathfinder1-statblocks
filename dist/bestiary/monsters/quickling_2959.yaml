SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Natural Invisibility (Su)
    description: >-
      A quickling is invisible when motionless. It loses this invisibility and
      remains visible for 1 round in any round in which it takes any action
      other than a free action.
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      A quickling is never at risk of poisoning itself when handling poison.
      They usually use kava leaf poison on their daggers.
  - name: Supernatural Speed (Su)
    description: >-
      A quickling moves with incredible speed. Save for when it remains
      motionless (at which point it is invisible), a quickling's shape blurs and
      shimmers with this speed, granting it concealment (20% miss chance). In
      addition, this ability grants the quickling evasion and uncanny dodge (as
      the rogue abilities of the same name).
  - name: Slow Susceptibility (Ex)
    description: >-
      A quickling that succumbs to a slow effect loses its supernatural speed
      ability and is sickened.
Description:
  - >-
    Believed to be the offspring of an elf and a brownie (see that entry), the
    quickling is an evil faerie creature that hates all other races (especially
    the other fey races). How they came to be evil and malign is still a
    mystery, but legend speaks of the first quicklings as being great sorcerers.
    Elven scholars believe these quickling sorcerers unleashed some spark of the
    arcane that was never meant for mortal creatures.
  - >-
    Quicklings resemble small elves with large ears that rise to points above
    their heads. Their skin is pale blue to blue-white and hair is either silver
    or white. They prefer clothes of bright and boisterous colors; reds,
    yellows, silvers, blacks, and blues are among their favorites. Quicklings
    never wear armor.
  - >-
    Quicklings speak Common and Aklo. Both are spoken so quickly that even those
    able to speak one of the languages may still find it difficult to converse
    with a quickling.
  - >-
    Because of their rapid metabolism, quicklings reach adulthood by the age of
    2, middle age at 5, old age at 12, and venerable at age 15.
  - >-
    No creature can match the natural speed and agility of a quickling. It knows
    this, and uses its great speed to its advantage in combat. A quickling often
    rushes an opponent, stabs it with its dagger, and then retreats out of melee
    range before an opponent can react.

    Kava Leaf Poison: Type ingestion or injury; save DC 15; frequency 1/min. for
    2 min.; effect sleep 1 hour; cure 1 save.
