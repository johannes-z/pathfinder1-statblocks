  - name: Duplicate (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a tangtal can create an effect similar to a mirror
      image spell (caster level 12th). This allows the tangtal to create up to
      eight images of itself. The images can move up to 30 feet away from the
      tangtal, but each must be within 10 feet of another image. The tangtal can
      use this ability once per day and it otherwise resembles the mirror image
      spell.
Description:
  - >-
    Tangtals, or dupli-cats, are ferocious and intelligent panthers with the
    ability to produce illusory images of themselves. They roam haunted
    woodlands or plains and often lair near civilized areas.
  - >-
    Tangtals are solitary creatures; no recorded encounter has ever placed more
    than one of these creatures together. Mating season is the only time more
    than one of these creatures is likely to be encountered and sages have
    argued as to exactly when tangtals mate. Tangtal young are unknown and none
    have ever been seen.
  - >-
    Tangtals are carnivores and prefer to dine on small animals such as rats,
    moles, squirrels, and so on. In such instances when food is scarce, it is
    not unheard of for a tangtal to sneak into a civilized area and carry off or
    kill chickens, hens, dogs, cats, and even small children. A tangtal is about
    7 feet long from nose to tail and weighs about 350 to 400 pounds.
  - >-
    Tangtals wait for prey to come within range before leaping to attack with
    their wicked bite and sharpened claws. They use their duplicate ability as a
    defense mechanism against larger or stronger foes, or when they're
    outnumbered. Tangtals are smart enough to know when the day is lost, and if
    combat goes against them, they flee.
