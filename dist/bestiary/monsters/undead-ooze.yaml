    description: >-
      As a full-round action, an undead ooze can expel 1d6 skeletons from its
      mass. Skeletons can act in the round they are expelled, and each skeleton
      conforms to the basic statistics for its size (see the Pathfinder
      Roleplaying Game Bestiary). Slain skeletons are engulfed by the undead
      ooze and can be reanimated and expelled again in 1d2 hours. An undead
      ooze's form holds up to 10 skeletons. These skeletons are included in the
      determination of the undead ooze's CR.
Description:
  - >-
    When an ooze moves across the grave of a restless and evil soul, a
    transformation takes place. The malevolent spirit, still tied to the rotting
    flesh consumed by the ooze, melds with the ooze. The result is a creature
    filled with hatred of the living and an intelligence and cunningness not
    normally known among its kind.
  - >-
    The undead ooze has an advantage over any other ooze: intelligence. It uses
    this new gift to its fullest in combat by attacking from surprise or by
    stalking its prey and attacking when the opportunity presents itself. The
    undead ooze attacks by slamming its body into its prey. It usually engulfs
    its foes or expels its skeleton allies to contend with its enemies.
