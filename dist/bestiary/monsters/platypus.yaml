SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Electrolocation (Ex)
    description: >-
      While underwater, platypuses can sense the tiny electrical currents that
      trigger muscle movement. This allows them to locate living prey and to
      distinguish it from inanimate objects. Treat electrolocation as lifesense
      with a range of 30 feet, but that functions only underwater.

      Spur-injury; save Fort DC 9; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1
      nonlethal damage; cure 1 save.
  - name: Semiaquatic (Ex)
