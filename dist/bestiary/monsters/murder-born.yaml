Description_Visual: >-
  Appearing from nowhere arises a ghostly image with translucent, yet delicate
  features. Its unholy eyes rage with absolute and thorough evil that reflects
  its hatred for the living.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Despondent Wail (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a murder-born can unleash a child-like wail. Any
      living creature within 60 feet that hears the wail must make a successful
      DC 16 Will save or be overcome with supernatural feelings of hopelessness.
      A powerful curse falls upon the victim and they become so despondent that
      they need to make a successful DC 16 Concentration check in order to
      motivate themselves enough to make an attack or cast spell. The curse is
      permanent, though a remove curse or break enchantment (both requiring a
      successful caster level check against DC 18) or a limited wish, wish, or
      miracle can remove the effects of curse. The save DC is Charisma-based.
      Whether or not the save is successful, an individual cannot be affected by
      a murderborn's despondent wail for the next 24 hours.
  - name: Sense Living (Su)
    description: >-
      A murder-born can detect living creatures to a range of 100 feet. This
      functions as a detect evil spell (caster level 8th) except it detects the
      presence of life rather than a particular alignment. There is no chance
      the murder-born to be stunned and it is not blocked by stone, wood, or any
      other material.
Description:
  - >-
    Spawned of hatred when both mother and child are murdered, the rapacious
    soul of the unborn sometimes rises as a foul and corrupt spirit.
  - >-
    It is bent on exacting revenge against its killers and against all living
    creatures it crosses. Driven mad by its unliving existence, the murderborn
    has blurred its senses into believing that every living creature is
    responsible for its current state and it never hesitates to attack any that
    come within range of it.
  - >-
    A murder-born is always encountered within 500 feet of the place it was
    killed, and can never move further away than that. It is a solitary
    creature, though very rarely, when twins are involved, two of these cursed
    creatures may be encountered together. Neither is aware of the other's
    presence; they do not communicate, interact, or even see each other.
  - >-
    They are oblivious to the other's existence. Whether this is because the
    creatures are so driven with rage it blinds them, or because some magical
    and mystical force prevents them from interacting is unknown. Murderborns do
    not speak or communicate but seem to understand a variety of languages.
  - >-
    A murder-born closes quickly when it detects living creatures in its realm.
    Once it and at least one opponent are within 60 feet of one another, it
    unleashes its despondent wail. It then moves to melee range and uses its
    incorporeal touch to destroy its enemies. Unless driven away or its
    opponents flee, a murder-born attacks relentlessly until it is destroyed.
