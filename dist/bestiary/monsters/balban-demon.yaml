SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Double Damage against Objects (Ex)
    description: >-
      A balban's powerful fists are particularly effective against objects. A
      balban deals double damage against an object or structure.
  - name: Pound (Ex)
    description: >-
      A balban that makes a successful grapple check against a foe smaller than
      itself can smash the opponent into nearby solid objects (walls, floor,
      ground, etc.) as a standard action. This deals 2d8+12 points of
      bludgeoning damage to the victim. Further, the victim must succeed on a DC
      22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. A balban can perform this
      action once per round as long as it maintains the grapple. The save DC is
      Strength-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Almost as stupid as the lowly dretches, balbans are hulking monstrosities
    standing over 10 feet tall. Demonic generals use these creatures in
    abundance in their armies, relying on the balban's love for battle, their
    great strength, and their knack for destroying objects and structures.
    Balban squads are brutish, hulking, and hard to control. While many demon
    lords do employ their services, they are deemed highly expendable and are
    thus encountered on the front lines of any great battle. Balbans spend much
    of their life battling, not necessarily for survival, but simply because
    they relish the chaos and bloodshed combat brings. Balbans attack any
    creature they encounter on sight, except those they know are more powerful
    than themselves. Though lacking in the intelligence department, they do not
    attack any demonic officer in the service of a demon lord (unless they know
    the officer is weaker and they can kill him or her and make it look like
    something else was responsible). Balbans have slate gray skin, stand at
    least 12 feet tall and weigh about 4,500 pounds. Their eyes are coal black
    and their tongues violet. A seemingly constant stream of saliva and gastric
    juices oozes from their mouths. A balban employs simple tactics in battle;
    smash an opponent, grab an opponent, pound it into pulp, and devour what's
    left. Against weaker foes they are likely to employ their ability to cause
    fear or confuse opponents by shrouding themselves in darkness. Copyright
