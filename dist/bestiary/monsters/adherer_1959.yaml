SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adhesive (Su)
    description: >-
      A weapon that strikes an adherer becomes stuck fast to the creature's
      adhesive flesh unless the wielder succeeds at a DC 14 Reflex save. A
      creature adjacent to the adherer can attempt to pry off a stuck weapon
      with a DC 17 Strength check, but doing so provokes an attack of
      opportunity from the adherer. The adherer's adhesive flesh gives it a +8
      racial bonus on grapple checks. It can attempt to grapple a foe without
      spending an action whenever a creature successfully hits it with a natural
      attack or an unarmed strike. An adherer does not gain the grappled
      condition when it grapples a foe, nor does it provoke attacks of
      opportunity when it attempts to do so. Fire can temporarily burn away an
      adherer's adhesive coating-whenever an adherer takes at least 10 points of
      fire damage, it loses its adhesive special quality for 1d4 rounds.
      Universal solvent, alchemical solvent, or a similar fluid removes an
      adherer's adhesive quality for 1 hour if it fails a DC 15 Reflex save, or
      for 1d4 rounds if it makes the save. The adherer's skin loses its adhesive
      quality 1 hour after the adherer dies. An adherer can release anything
      stuck to it as a free action. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Adherers look vaguely like embalmed and mummified corpses wrapped in dirty
    linen, but they are in fact otherworldly beings of an entirely different
    nature.
  - >-
    Transformed by hideous processes on the Ethereal Plane, their bodies are
    riddled with tiny, adhesive strands that can stick to anything, allowing
    adherers to bind their enemies' weapons and capture living creatures for
    their depraved rituals.
  - >-
    Though once human, adherers have forgotten all traces of humanity, and now
    hunt their former kindred with gleeful abandon. Adherers digest food
    unusually slowly, and as such can feed on a single creature (humans are
    their favorite meal) for days or even weeks, taking only one or two bites a
    day and forcing their living captives to endure a hellish, drawn-out death.
