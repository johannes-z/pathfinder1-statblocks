Description:
  - >-
    A fire nymph is a very beautiful creature that dwells on the Plane of Fire.
    It is akin to the nymph and dryad, though its origins obviously lie
    elsewhere. Fire nymphs rarely visit the Material Plane, though mages are
    known to request their company on occasion. A fire nymph usually wears
    translucent robes of white or ash.
  - >-
    Fire nymphs avoid combat if at all possible, but if pressed into action they
    rely on their spell-like abilities and seek escape as soon as possible.
