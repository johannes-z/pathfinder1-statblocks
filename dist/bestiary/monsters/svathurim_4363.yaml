Description_Visual: >-
  This hulking creature has the lower body of a massive stallion with eight
  thick legs. Rising from its equine body is the trunk of a muscled humanoid
  with icy blue skin and a prodigious white beard rimed with ice. Piercing blue
  eyes glare beneath beetled brows and a spiraling pair of horns which curl
  upward.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Skyrunner (Su)
    description: >-
      When charging, running, or taking a double move, a svathurim can stride
      across open air as if it were using air walk. This movement is very
      taxing, and a svathurim must succeed at a DC 14 Constitution check at the
      end of each round it uses this ability to avoid being fatigued for 1
      minute. This DC increases by 2 each round after the first. Returning to
      the ground resets the DC to 14, but does not negate any ongoing fatigue or
      exhaustion. A svathurim cannot trample when using this ability.
  - name: Thunderous Trample (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature damaged by a svathurim's trample attack must succeed at a DC
      22 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Undersized Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although a svathurim is Huge, its upper torso is the same size as that of
      a Large humanoid. As a result, it wields weapons as if they were one size
      category smaller than their actual size (Large for most svathurim).
Description:
  - >-
    Ancient tales claim the first svathurims spawned from Thremyr, akin to the
    creation stories of frost giants, ice trolls, winter wolves, and other
    creatures of snow and ice. The stories claim that when Thremyr fell into the
    Steaming Sea, he shed great icebergs that transformed into smaller copies of
    the god himself. The frost giants, spawned from his shedding body, worship
    this slumbering god as their creator, and thus consider svathurims their
    kin. The hindquarters of an adult svathurim are up to 10 feet tall and 16
    feet long, while their giant trunk and head reach up to 18 feet on average.
    Svathurims typically weigh over 5 tons and may live up to 500 years, far
    longer than their frost giant kin.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Svathurims dwell deep in the frozen wastes of the tundra and arctic regions
    of Golarion, amid the great glaciers covering the Crown of the World. They
    occasionally travel along the frozen shores of polar seas, hunting seals,
    walruses, and whales that venture too close to shore or dragging vast nets
    through subarctic shallows during salmon runs. It is uncommon for svathurims
    to live in the vast boreal forests of the north, where their great bulk
    impedes movement among the trees, though some clans do dwell in the high
    mountains, springing from peak to peak in prodigious leaps and using their
    supernatural skyborne gallops.
  - >-
    Svathurims are omnivorous and always hungry, able to subsist on scrub plants
    and kelp in times of great need, or even to eke out bare subsistence on the
    algae and lichen embedded in ice and rocks. However, they greatly prefer
    fresh, uncooked meat, and will devour every scrap of whatever they kill.
    Their grinding teeth are capable of reducing bone to meal, so even the
    toughest of a victim's remains generally end up in a svathurim's gullet. In
    the cold and pitiless environment of the north, nothing can be wasted.
  - >-
    Svathurim males outnumber females by a wide margin, and these creatures are
    indiscriminate in their mating habits. The rare svathurim mares are little
    more selective in their affections than the males, and there is no shortage
    of males willing to court them. Ironically, many adult male svathurim are
    killed or wounded in competition for the attentions of females, either
    maimed and driven off by more dominant males or slain and presented as a
    trophy to prove worthiness to a female. Female svathurim are never
    monogamous, though, as mating with many males confuses the issue of
    parentage enough to keep their offspring safe from the predations of many
    adult males, lest a male inadvertently eradicate a foal svathurim that may
    be his own flesh and blood.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Svathurims live in clans, typically headed by the strongest and most
    accomplished hunter in the group, whether male or female. In some clans,
    svathurims gain status by the number of offspring they produce, though
    parentage is diff icult to prove for males and leads to frequent disputes.
  - >-
    Where females are both strong and fertile, they are able to assert dominance
    both by their own strength and by the loyalty and support of those children
    willing to fight for them. Of course, no svathurim can feel too secure in
    his position, as once-loyal supporters may shift their allegiance on a whim,
    and even faithful children may decide that they have grown strong enough to
    betray their parent to a rival or gather support (often from siblings) to
    take power in their own right.
  - >-
    Svathurims sometimes build large corrals of stone, ice, or rarely bone or
    wood where such materials are available in plenty. Usually unroofed, these
    monolithic barriers serve mostly to keep predators away from their young or
    to protect their stores of treasure or food gathered by the clan from
    raiders. A rare few svathurims build more secure enclosed lodges or delve
    permanent hostels in caves. Svathurims that choose to settle in one area are
    most likely to live among frost giants.
  - >-
    Frost giants view svathurims with a mix of fear, respect, awe, and
    revulsion. Most know well the tale of the svathurims' creation, and while
    not all take this as evidence of pseudo-divinity and a shared creation myth,
    few deny the svathurims' speed, strength, and skill at hunting and killing.
    For some giant clans, satisfying a svathurim's whims is a small price to pay
    for the advantages gained by an alliance with them Svathurims collect
    treasure as frost giants do, favoring precious metals in raw nuggets that
    are then hammered into crude tribal jewelry. Bracelets, armlets, and rings
    and chains they can braid into their hair, beards, and long horse-like tails
    are favored treasures, as are inlays and carvings made of mammoth or walrus
    ivory. Those in subarctic regions collect amber and rare boreal hardwoods,
    polishing the latter to a luxurious shine and engraving them with runic
    inscriptions and genealogies both real and imagined.
