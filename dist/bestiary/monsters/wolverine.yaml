    description: >-
      A wolverine that takes damage in combat flies into a rage on its next
      turn, clawing and biting madly until either it or its opponent is dead. It
      gains +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, and -2 to AC. The creature
      cannot end its rage voluntarily.
Description:
  - >-
    Wolverines are territorial, especially when it comes to food, and have been
    known to defend their kills against much larger predators, such as black
    bears. They are fearsome opponents, launching into a frenzy when wounded.
    They tend to give off a very strong, unpleasant musk smell when angry.
  - >-
    Armed with powerful jaws, strong legs, and a thick hide, wolverines are
    remarkably strong for their size.
  - >-
    They are reckless in battle and throw themselves at their foes, clawing and
    biting furiously.
