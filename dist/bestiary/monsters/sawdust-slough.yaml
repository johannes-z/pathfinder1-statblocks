SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Choking Chaff (Ex)
    description: >-
      A sawdust slough constantly releases particles of plant matter that form a
      cloud of choking dust around it. Creatures beginning their turns adjacent
      to a sawdust slough are coated with this dust, revealing invisible
      creatures (as glitterdust, though without any of that spell's other
      effects) and dazzling creatures as long as they remain adjacent to it and
      for 1d3 rounds thereafter. In addition, creatures that breathe that begin
      their turns adjacent to the sawdust slough are sickened for the same
      duration (Fortitude DC 18 negates). Creatures that hold their breath
      before being exposed to the choking chaff aura are immune to the sickening
      effect for as long as they hold their breath. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. A sawdust slough's choking chaff aura is burned off
      when it takes fire damage, and does not become active again until the end
      of the sawdust slough's next turn.
  - name: Flammable (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sawdust sloughs and the particulate cloud surrounding them are highly
      flammable, causing any damaging flame around them to flare up in gouts of
      fire. Any creature adjacent to a sawdust slough (including creatures
      engulfed by it) when it takes fire damage must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex
      save or take half as much fire damage as that dealt to the sawdust slough.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The vast forests of Andoran have long been prime timberlands, logged and
    exploited for centuries as crucial resources in Andoran's efforts to
    establish itself as a great naval and shipbuilding power. Rather than seek
    to work in balance with the forests, many logging groups have clear-cut vast
    sections of woodland, and such depredations have not been without
    consequence.
  - >-
    As the blood of fey guardians is spilled and spirits of ancient plants and
    wild places are destroyed, the wild power sometimes weaves itself into the
    sawdust and shavings left behind by loggers, spawning mindlessly destructive
    masses of detritus called sawdust sloughs. These creatures are drawn to loud
    noises and vibrations, especially metallic sounds such as chopping and
    sawing. They savagely attack loggers and mills, engulfing and suffocating
    all creatures they encounter and grinding their flesh into bloody paste.
