Description:
  - >-
    With mottled scales of blue and green, water nagas' serpentine beauty belies
    their deadliness. Although doubtlessly intelligent, these nagas have more in
    common with normal snakes than most of their kind, preferring to be left to
    their own devices and lashing out at any creatures that would disturb them.
    A typical water naga measures 10 feet long and weighs 250 pounds.
  - >-
    Where many nagas claim particular lairs as their homes, water nagas
    typically have a number of retreats, migrating from one to the next with the
    changing of the seasons. These nagas keep elaborate summer and winter lairs,
    with several favored shelters positioned between these so they can make a
    circuit of familiar rivers and coasts throughout the year. Fiercely
    territorial when it comes to their lairs, water nagas typically attack any
    that intrude upon their sanctuaries, only bothering to question interlopers
    once such creatures have been weakened by poison, if at all.
  - >-
    As their yearly treks make many water nagas especially well traveled, those
    who live near the serpents' lairs- usually lizardfolk, fey, and human
    tribes-often court the snake creatures' good graces with offerings of rich
    local delicacies, hoping to learn of nearby lands and pass on their own
    stories to distant neighbors. Enjoying flattery, exciting tales, and the
    adoration of those they see as lesser creatures, most water nagas take pride
    in their roles as travelers. However, while rarely malicious, they quickly
    grow bored of repetitive, mundane anecdotes and often embellish the stories
    they've heard with their own fictions-caring little for the repercussions
    such misleading tales might cause for their listeners. The congeniality of
    some water nagas does not extend to the entire race, and many unwary souls,
    even those with only the best intentions, face these serpentine creatures'
    deadly bite.
