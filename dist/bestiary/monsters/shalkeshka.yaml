SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burrowing Charge (Ex)
    description: A shalkeshka can use the charge and run actions while burrowing.
  - name: Feeding (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a free action while a shalkeshka is burrowed beneath the ground, it can
      go into a dormant state and leech nutrients from the soil. During this
      time, the shalkeshka regains hit points at a rate of 5 hit points per
      hour. While in this state, the creature can't move, doesn't have to eat or
      drink, and is considered flat-footed for the first full round of combat if
      interrupted from its dormancy.
  - name: Pit Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shalkeshka can burrow into dirt, sand, or loose soil to lie in ambush 30
      feet beneath the surface. It monitors the area above it using tremorsense,
      awaiting a victim's movement into the area. When it detects prey, the
      shalkeshka can surge to the surface as a standard action and make a single
      bite attack. This action creates a 30-foot-deep pit where the shalkeshka
      was laying in wait. All creatures standing in the area above must succeed
      at a DC 18 Reflex save to jump to safety in the nearest open space to the
      edge of the newly formed pit. Creatures that fail this Reflex save fall
      into the pit, taking damage as normal. The pit's walls have a climb DC of
      25. The shalkeshka (along with any creature it may have grappled) can stay
      above ground by making a successful saving throw, or voluntarily fall back
      into the pit. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A dangerous nuisance in northern Garund, a shalkeshka is a strange burrowing
    predator that inhabits fertile soil near rivers, oases, and (most
    destructively) farmland. This creature's anatomy is reminiscent of an insect
    or some sort of lizard, and when burrowing it tears into the earth with its
    claws, swimming through sand and soil. Since the creatures spend most of
    their time buried underground, their pale, nearly transparent skin is cool
    and clammy to the touch. Shalkeshkas feed on whatever creatures are
    unfortunate enough to tread the ground above them while they nest in the
    earth below. When fighting, a shalkeshka viciously grapples its victim with
    its mandibles, shredding its prey to pieces with its claws.
  - >-
    Squat and powerfully built, a shalkeshka stands only 5 feet tall, but is 8
    feet wide and weighs almost 2,500 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Although shalkeshkas are predators, they have a unique ability to derive
    nutrition from the ground itself if unable to find prey. This serves the
    creatures well in the lands of northern Garund, where desert travelers are
    few and far between and the harsh sun and unforgiving terrain keep roaming
    fauna to a minimum. While burrowed, a shalkeshka can enter a state of
    hibernation wherein it can sustain itself by absorbing minerals from the
    soil. A shalkeshka absorbs nutrients through the tufts of hair distributed
    across its long body, each of which is capable of leeching valuable
    sustenance from the very ground. This method of feeding can sustain a
    shalkeshka for extended periods of time-anywhere from a few hours to weeks,
    or even years-without the need to hunt. A shalkeshka breaks its hibernation
    only when it senses prey or during the rare times it succumbs to the urge to
    reproduce.
  - >-
    A shalkeshka's bristly hairs also serve as one of the creature's sensory
    organs, allowing it to sense subtle vibrations in the ground. Its compound
    eyes provide it with excellent vision, and the third eye on the center of
    its forehead enables it to see in even the darkest of lighting conditions.
    Its enhanced senses ensure that a shalkeshka remains a constant threat to
    those who intrude on its territory, regardless of time of day or whether its
    prey is above or below ground.
  - >-
    A shalkeshka ambushes its prey with impressive speed, bursting from beneath
    the sand and snatching unwary foes with its mandibles. Once engaged in
    combat, a shalkeshka fights with unrestrained ferocity. When it encounters
    groups of prey while hunting, a shalkeshka burrows beneath the ground to
    stealthily follow them until a member splits off from the group. The
    shalkeshka then emerges, grabs the straggler, and dives back into the sand
    to devour its newly acquired meal. If unable to snag its target, a
    shalkeshka remains above ground until it has subdued or slain its prey. They
    are powerful creatures, but lack the intelligence to make strong tactical
    decisions when it comes to engaging a target. However, if the tide of battle
    turns against a shalkeshka, it doesn't hesitate to burrow away to safety.
  - >-
    Shalkeshkas can live for over 300 years, though most of this time is spent
    hibernating underground. Shalkeshkas experience periods of fertility only a
    few times in their lives, during which they lay their eggs in hidden tunnels
    in the desert. Shalkeshkas stay near their eggs during the yearlong
    incubation period, sometimes even letting prey pass by untouched in order to
    conceal the eggs' location. In rare circumstances, however, a pair of
    shalkeshkas that are both about to lay their eggs will tolerate each other's
    presence, instinctually recognizing the need for extra defense during the
    process. Such mutual defenses are dangerous for other intruders in the
    region, as the two shalkeshkas can then work together to bring down larger
    prey.
  - >-
    Once the young hatch, they emerge from their leathery eggs in a larval stage
    that lasts for a year, culminating in a cocoon stage. During their larva
    stage, shalkeshkas subsist solely on nutrients in the soil as their mature
    mouthparts have yet to form. Shalkeshkas feel little kinship with their
    broodmates and soon begin splitting off from the group. As the cocoon stage
    nears, the parent shalkeshkas leave the area, leaving the young to fend for
    themselves. Any shalkeshkas still living in close proximity to their
    broodmates when they reach adulthood often cannibalize their siblings in
    great burrowing clashes until only one or two shalkeshkas hunt in the
    immediate vicinity.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Many wandering shalkeshkas travel throughout the great deserts of Osirion,
    stopping only once they have claimed a lush territory for themselves. Though
    they can live in the deepest desert, shalkeshkas prefer territory with a
    source of water, for prey is more plentiful there, and while lying in wait
    enjoy the abundant nutrients in the soil- the creatures are notorious for
    setting ambushes near riverbanks or in oases. A single small oasis can
    sustain a shalkeshka for its entire life.
  - >-
    When adult shalkeshkas encounter each other, violence soon follows. A
    shalkeshka that has claimed a territory defends it to the death against
    intruding shalkeshkas seeking to claim it; these vicious fights often leave
    both opponents injured. Shalkeshkas also frequently battle ankhegs
    (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 15), as they often share similar environments. Many
    a caravan has had to alter its path after happening upon a clash between
    these two burrowing beasts.
  - >-
    These are not the only times a desert caravan must be watchful of
    shalkeshkas. The creatures grow most aggressive when far from fertile soil,
    and a train of packed camels and their riders driving across the desert
    serves as an enticing meal for shalkeshkas in nutrient-poor lands. These
    attacks inspired the Osirian saying "claimed by the shalkeshka," which is
    used to describe someone who has gone suddenly missing or a caravan contract
    that never pans out.
