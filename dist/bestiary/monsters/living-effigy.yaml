    description: >-
      A living effigy is inhabited by an entrenched spirit that holds on to some
      aspects of its former intellect. A living effigy can choose two Knowledge
      skills, typically Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (religion). These
      Knowledge skills are class skills for the living effigy, and it gains a +4
      racial bonus on checks with these skills.
  - name: Shape Self (Sp)
    description: >-
      Three times a day, a living effigy can shift its facial expression as if
      using stone shape, even though the construct exceeds the volume the spell
      can usually affect and is a creature rather than an object.
  - name: Silent Watcher (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a living effigy can use greater teleport (self only)
      as long as there are no creatures with an Intelligence score higher than 2
      within 150 feet that can see the effigy. When using this ability, the
      living effigy can travel up to 10 miles from its settlement.
  - name: Statue (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living effigy can remain perfectly still and emulate a statue. An
      observer must succeed at a DC 25 Perception check to notice that the
      living effigy is alive. If a living effigy initiates combat from this
      pose, it gains a +6 bonus on its initiative check. Susceptible to
      Mind-Affecting
  - name: Effects (Ex)
    description: >-
      Unlike most constructs, a living effigy isn't immune to mind-affecting
      effects.
Description:
  - >-
    Resting among countless tribes across the world are strange icons and
    statues dedicated to the memories of ancient leaders or spiritual guides.
    Sometimes such figures hide greater intellects, inhabiting essences that
    watch over nearby settlements. Known as living effigies, these stone statues
    are possessed by the spirits of deceased chieftains and shamans who managed
    to partially cheat death by imparting a portion of their souls into stone
    images. Each living effigy is unique in its features-some resemble the heads
    of great giants, while others are busts of other creatures. Twin gems are
    embedded in the eyes of each living effigy; they glow a vibrant color
    whenever the statue uses one of its many magical abilities.
  - >-
    A living effigy's personality is as unique as its countenance, as the souls
    inhabiting the massive stones range from kind protectors wishing to continue
    their vigil over a settlement to brutal tyrants wishing only to reign past
    death. A living effigy stands 15 feet tall and weighs 40 tons.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Despite sharing most of the traits common to other constructs, living
    effigies are sentient creatures that possess a portion of an inhabiting
    soul's intellect. Spells and abilities possessed by the originating soul are
    lost in the transfer, though some knowledge from the soul's past life
    remains. In addition to possessing this knowledge, the living effigy takes
    on the personal characteristics of the spirit that possesses it. In most
    cases, this directly impacts its alignment. The longer an effigy exists,
    though, the more detached it becomes from material concerns, eventually
    adopting an impartial stance on most subjects.
  - >-
    Much of a living effigy's existence is spent in unassuming silence, watching
    over the settlement around it. Unable to move (save for a limited means of
    supernatural travel that typically draws unwanted attention) these effigies
    often learn to appreciate their isolation. Preferring that others see them
    as nothing more than ordinary sculptures, living
  - >-
    effigies act only when their settlements are in danger. Should someone seek
    to harm it or its people, an effigy uses its charming gaze or its calm
    emotions spell-like ability to ease the anger of enemies and members of the
    settlement. Though effigies rarely issue direct commands, their gaze make
    the weak-willed see them in a positive light.
  - >-
    Though living effigies can speak, they rarely do so. Instead, the constructs
    prefer to rely on their mystical abilities to communicate with those nearby.
    Their most common means of direct communication are its dream and nightmare
    spell-like abilities. Living effigies use these abilities to intrude on the
    sleeping minds of leaders to inf luence the direction of their settlements.
    In situations where approval or rejection is necessary, the effigy uses its
    stone shape spell-like ability to alter its facial expression to an
    appropriate emotion.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Transferring from a body of flesh to a monument of stone is a trauma that
    takes a spirit some time to recover from. It takes a living effigy a full
    week to learn its various abilities, and even after this initial adjustment,
    the spirit still needs to cope with the solitary nature of its new
    existence. Cut off from the sensations it once had, a living effigy learns
    to rely on the surface thoughts of those nearby and minor interaction
    through dreams. Its eye gems can attract unwanted attention when it uses its
    charming gaze, but can't be removed until the construct is destroyed.
  - >-
    Settlements guided by living effigies are typically found in remote
    locations, away from the administration of governments or the intervention
    of outside agencies. Because of their nature as silent watchers, such
    effigies are most commonly found in far-f lung communities in the Realm of
    the Mammoth Lords, where they are treated as honored ancestors, and in the
    wilds of the Mwangi Expanse, where they are sometimes seen as ancestral
    spirit gods. Worshipers of most deities find the idea of a living effigy
    worrying, especially if the effigy's settlement has raised a pseudo-religion
    around the idol. While living effigies aren't technically undead, Pharasmin
    priests in particular have problems with them and often oppose them once
    their true nature is discovered, heedless of the protection and aid the
    living effigies offer to their communities.
  - Construction
  - >-
    The construction of the stone effigy requires an appropriate amount of stone
    (at least 40 tons' worth) and a successful DC 20 Craft (stonemasonry) check.
    If the crafter fails the check, the stone is rendered
  - >-
    useless for this purpose and a new block must be obtained. The creation of
    the effigy also requires two gems that are worth at least 500 gp each.
  - >-
    A completed effigy acts as a soul receptacle, sucking in the intended
    target's soul as long as it dies within a mile of the inert statue. It takes
    the soul a full week to adjust to its new home, at which point the effigy
    animates and can use all of its abilities normally. During this transition
    period, the effigy remains a stone statue; it can be destroyed as normal or
    by removing or destroying the eye gems. Other forms of living effigies can
    be made of bone, bronze, wood, or similar materials.
