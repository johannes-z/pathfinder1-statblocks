SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Consume Thoughts (Ex)
    description: >-
      A caulborn can consume the thoughts of a willing, helpless, or fascinated
      creature with a touch attack. If the target fails a DC 18 Will save, the
      caulborn can alter the victim's memory as if using modify memory. This
      process deals 1d4 points of Intelligence and Wisdom damage to the target.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Cooperative Scrying (Sp)
    description: >-
      Three or more caulborn joining hands can scry on a place or creature as if
      using the scrying spell (DC 20), but with no limit to the spell's duration
      so long as at least three of the caulborn involved continue to join hands
      and concentrate. This ability functions at CL 7th (or at the highest CL
      available to the most powerful caulborn in the group). The save DC is
      Charisma-based, adjusted by the modifier of the caulborn with the highest
      Charisma score.
  - name: Hive Mind (Ex)
    description: >-
      As long as there are at least two caulborn within 300 feet of each other,
      if one caulborn in the group is aware of a particular danger, they all
      are. No caulborn in a group is considered flanked or flat-footed unless
      all of them are.
  - name: Psychic Deflection (Su)
    description: >-
      A caulborn adds its Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to its AC. The
      caulborn loses this bonus when unconscious.
  - name: Thoughtsense (Su)
    description: >-
      A caulborn notices and locates living, conscious creatures within 60 feet,
      just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. Spells such as
      nondetection or mind blank make an affected creature undetectable by this
      sense.
Description:
  - >-
    Caulborn are a race of telepathic prophets and historians who subsist on the
    psychic energy of others. They wander the planes in search of new facts and
    concepts to add to the pulsating brain-sacks that serve as their collective
    memories. When a band of caulborn find a particularly interesting site, they
    settle down to dwell there for many years until they feel that they have
    learned all there is to know about the location.
  - >-
    A caulborn is literally a creature of the mind. Its body is self-sustaining,
    and it exists solely to record and catalogue new thoughts. While they are
    not evil, caulborn have little interest in alliances or friendship with
    other races.
