SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Misfortune (Su)
    description: >-
      A chernobue radiates an aura of evil malaise to a radius of 30 feet. All
      lawful or good creatures in this area take a -1 penalty on attack rolls
      and weapon damage rolls. Lawful good creatures take a -3 penalty and upon
      first entering the aura must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be sickened
      for as long as they remain in the area. This ability is Charisma-based.
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures that succumb to a chernobue's horrific appearance become
      paralyzed with disgust for 2d6 rounds; a paralyzed creature gets a new
      save each round to recover from the effect, provided he is no longer aware
      of the chernobue or within 30 feet of it.
  - name: Light Vulnerability (Ex)
    description: >-
      A chernobue within an area of bright light takes 1 point of Constitution
      damage per minute it remains in the area.
  - name: Poison (Su)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2
      Con drain; cure 1 save. The thick, orange poison injected by a chernobue
      is semi-alive. As soon as the poisoned victim is cured of the poison (by
      making a save, being targeted with an effect like neutralize poison, or
      enduring the full duration of the poison), the orange fluid bursts from
      the victim's body, causing 1d6 Charisma damage and rendering the victim
      unconscious for 2d6 rounds unless he makes a final DC 23 Fortitude save.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The chernobue is a living manifestation of the vile fecundity of the Abyss-a
    monstrous, alien pregnancy made flesh. By infecting creatures with the
    Abyssal taint they carry, they spread pain and misfortune wherever they flop
    and writhe-and with their plane shift ability, they are ready to spread
    their filth throughout the multiverse. A chernobue is 13 feet long and
    weighs 500 pounds.
