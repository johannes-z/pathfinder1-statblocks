Description:
  - >-
    Ciratto demons are bred for combat, and as such are often found leading
    other demonic troops in battle. Cirattos can be found on any of the Abyssal
    layers in the employ of numerous lords and nobles. When not carrying out the
    orders of their master, they often spend their time hunting lesser demons
    and adventurers foolish enough to wander into the Abyss.
  - >-
    Ciratto demons are centaur-like demons with the lower torso of a black horse
    and the upper torso of a dark-skinned demon. Its head sports two large gray
    horns and its mouth is lined with small needle-like teeth. Four large
    poisonous dark mottled vipers grow from its back. A ciratto demon stands
    over 8 feet tall and weighs around 2,500 pounds.
  - >-
    Ciratto demons enjoy wading into battle. They attack with an array of
    weapons including maces, morningstars, and spiked clubs. In combat, they
    quickly close ranks with their opponents after unleashing a barrage of
    spell-like abilities so they can use their hooves and poisonous snakes.
    Slain foes are usually devoured immediately. Those not eaten, or parts of
    creatures not eaten, are left for scavengers. Ciratto, while they enjoy
    hunting devils, never eat their flesh, finding it disgusting to both smell
    and taste.
