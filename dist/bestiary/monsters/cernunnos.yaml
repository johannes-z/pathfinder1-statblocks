Description:
  - >-
    Cernunnos is a powerful empyreal lord who embodies the primeval force of
    nature as well as its wildness. He surrounds himself with counselors and
    advisors from all of the celestial races. Although he rarely makes a rash
    decision, he occasionally lets anger overwhelm his better judgment, even
    going so far as to swear personal vendettas against specific demon lords or
    archdevils. A peerless archer and hunter, in such moments of vengeance
    Cernunnos is tempted to visit Hell or the Abyss to personally exact his
    revenge. His preference for decisive action against enemies puts Cernunnos
    at odds with Korada. Though Cernunnos agrees that even the wickedest souls
    can seek redemption, he worries that lives would be lost in the time it
    would take to allow a fiend to seek enlightenment. The Horned Lord appears
    as a tall and muscular humanoid with elven features, tan skin, and a pair of
    antlers growing from his brow. Cernunnos dresses in simple clothes and
    leathers, died in natural colors but typically woven or worked with motifs
    of birds in flight or leaping animals. On Elysium, Cernunnos dwells in an
    expansive palace constructed of interwoven trees and capped with lush
    foliage. Known as Briarbough, this sprawling complex of gardens and pools is
    his seat of power and a place of healing where celestials and good mortals
    come to have their most grievous wounds tended. Beyond lies hundreds of
    miles of pristine forest and plains; animals killed here are reborn the next
    day, fully healed. In times of war, Briarbough serves as a headquarters and
    hospital for good outsiders. When not in Elysium, Cernunnos works with other
    celestial races to stem the spread of evil throughout the cosmos.
    Recognizing that-despite his power-he is still only one person, the Horned
    Lord uses his abilities to strengthen and bolster those already allied
    against darkness, training marshals and emissaries to work as his agents in
    the mortal and fey worlds. He favors druids and rangers-archers in
    particular-among his devotees. In combat, Cernunnos uses stealth and range
    to draw enemies to terrain of his choosing. The Empyreal Lord then uses his
    magic to further shape the battlefield to hamper his foes before closing for
    melee.

    CERNUNNOS'S FAITH Good fey, intelligent plant creatures, and mortal rangers
    and druids worship Cernunnos. Elven fighters and rogues often view him as a
    patron of luck and good fortune, but others pray to him for strength against
    evil. His sacred places are secluded groves, waterfalls, and deep forests.
    Cernunnos's holy symbol is the head of a stag, ram or similar horned
    creature with torcs or rings hanging from its horns. His favored weapon is
    the longbow. He grants access to the Animal, Chaos, Good, and Plant domains,
    and access to the Azata, Feather, Fur, and Growth subdomains.
