Description_Visual: >-
  This comely man is clad in fine silken robes. His eyes smolder with infernal
  flames.
Source: Inner Sea Gods
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Death (if 6 HD or less) or 6d6 damage and panicked for 2d4 rounds (7 HD or
      more), range 30 feet, Will DC 25 negates the death or panicked effect.
      This gaze is a mind-affecting fear effect that causes its targets to
      perceive Basileus as the most terrifying thing that it can imagine. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Terror Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      While using his gaze ability, Basileus manifests one to five monstrous
      limbs that can make slam attacks.
  - name: Veil of Forms (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures see Basileus as a powerful and attractive member of their
      own race. While using this ability, Basileus's gaze ability is suppressed.
      He can activate or suppress this ability as a free action.
Description:
  - >-
    An infernal paradox at once wondrous and terrifying, tempting and
    blasphemous, Basileus serves as the herald of Asmodeus and the harbinger of
    Hell's will. Few who have met him survive the experience unchanged, for he
    is the very word of Hell.
