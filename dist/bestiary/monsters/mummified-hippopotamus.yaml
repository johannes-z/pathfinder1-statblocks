    description: >-
      A hippopotamus can overturn a boat of its size or smaller by ramming it as
      a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25 or the
      result of the boat captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is
      highest.
Description:
  - >-
    Much like with elephants, the process for mummifying hippopotamuses is
    expensive and difficult; thus, only significant people are interred with
    these creatures. They are placed in tombs to protect against bad fortune.
    Because of their association with rivers, these protectors are often found
    in tombs near such waterways.
  - Creating a Mummified Animal
  - >-
    "Mummified animal" is an acquired template that can be added to a creature
    of the animal type. A mummified animal uses all the base creature's
    statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
  - >-
    Challenge Rating: HD 4 or fewer, as base creature; HD 5 to 10, as base
    creature +1; HD 11 or more, as base creature +2.
  - 'Alignment: Neutral evil.'
  - >-
    Type: The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate BAB, saves,
    or skills.
  - 'Senses: A mummified animal gains darkvision 60 ft.'
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: A mummified animal gains damage reduction based on its
    Hit Dice: one with 5 or fewer Hit Dice gains DR 2/-, one with 6-10 Hit Dice
    gains DR 5/-, and one with 11-20 Hit Dice gains DR 10/-.
  - >-
    Speed: Winged mummified animals can still fly, but their maneuverability
    drops to clumsy. Retain all other movement types.
  - >-
    Special Attacks: A mummified animal retains all special attacks except those
    dependent on a living body to function, such as a snake's poison or a
    skunk's revolting musk. A mummified animal also gains the following special
    attack.
  - >-
    Servant's Curse (Su): Once per day, a mummified animal can touch a creature
    or hit a creature with one of its natural attacks to deliver a curse. Any
    living creature struck by this attack must succeed at a Will save or take
    1d3 points of Dex and Wis damage. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the
    mummified animal's Hit Dice + the mummified animal's Charisma modifier.
  - >-
    Abilities: A mummified animal loses its Constitution score, and its Charisma
    score becomes 14.
