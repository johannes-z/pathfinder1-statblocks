SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sadistic Strike (Su)
    description: >-
      Cambions are particularly cruel, and they excel at causing pain and
      anguish. A cambion always treats any weapon he attacks with (including
      natural weapons and spells that require attack rolls to hit) as if the
      demon had the Improved Critical feat for that weapon, increasing the
      weapon's threat range as appropriate.
  - name: Sinfrenzy (Su)
    description: >-
      Every cambion carries within his being an excessive capacity for one of
      the seven classical sins-this focus is determined at the moment of the
      cambion's birth and depends on the nature of his humanoid parent's
      greatest sin. Once per day for a number of rounds equal to his Hit Dice, a
      cambion can turn himself over to his sin and enter into a frenzied state
      as a free action. While a cambion is in this frenzy, his land speed
      increases by 10 feet and he gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves and attack
      rolls. These bonuses do not stack with those granted by haste or similar
      effects, but if the cambion has at least 1 level in the class listed for
      his specific sin, the sinfrenzy grants an additional effect as summarized
      below. Envy (cleric): Cambion clerics covet the power of the gods
      themselves. While an envious cambion is in a sinfrenzy, his channeled
      energy effect increases by 1d6. Gluttony (alchemist): Cambion alchemists
      take great pleasure in drinking their extracts, potions, mutagens, and
      even poisons. While a gluttonous cambion is in a sinfrenzy, his bombs deal
      an additional die of damage. Greed (rogue): Cambion rogues are obsessed
      with gathering as much wealth and power as they can. While a greedy
      cambion is in a sinfrenzy, he deals an additional die of sneak attack
      damage. Lust (bard): Cambion bards seek to dominate and control as many
      hedonistic slaves as they can through magic and intimidation. While a
      lustful cambion bard is in a sinfrenzy, the effects of his inspire
      courage, inspire competence, inspire greatness, and inspire heroics
      abilities increase by 1. The save DCs of the cambion's bardic performances
      also increase by 1 when he is in this state. Pride (wizard): Cambion
      wizards believe their magic is greater than all others. While a prideful
      cambion is in a sinfrenzy, his spell save DCs increase by 1. Sloth
      (fighter): Cambion fighters carry the essence of sloth within, so much so
      that even their very blood seems to flow slowly from cut veins. While a
      slothful cambion fighter is in a sinfrenzy, he gains 2 bonus hit points
      per Hit Die. Wrath (ranger): Cambion rangers charge their attacks with
      savage hatred. While a wrathful cambion ranger is in a sinfrenzy, his
      favored enemy bonuses increase by 2.
Description:
  - >-
    Not all demons are formed from the sinful souls of mortals sent on to the
    Abyss. Demons are nothing if not fecund, as the widespread presence of tief
    lings, half-fiends, and fiendish creatures attests, yet these tainted and
    corrupted spawn are not true demons. Cambions are unusual fiends in that
    they merge these two methods of demonic creation, resulting in a nearly
    humanoid but wholly fiendish creature capable of rising to great heights of
    power in time.
  - >-
    A cambion is in small part a humanoid, but in practice this aspect applies
    almost entirely to his physical appearance, for a cambion is a true
    outsider, a creature whose body and soul are one. The majority of cambions
    have red skin, horns on their heads, and cloven hooves for feet-while the
    same variety exists among cambions as it does among humans, the fiendish
    aspects of cambions' appearance don't range as widely as those of tief
    lings. A typical cambion stands 6 feet tall and weighs 190 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    A cambion is born when an incubus impregnates a humanoid female in the Abyss
    and the humanoid carries the child to term without leaving the Abyss. While
    gestating, the child absorbs the plane's chaotic evil energies and
    transforms completely. Rather than being a half-fiend (as would be the case
    if the mother gave birth or was impregnated on a plane other than the
    Abyss), a child born under such circumstances is always born a cambion, and
    always born male. Only humanoids can give birth to cambions, and the
    majority of cambions' mothers are humans. Birthing a cambion is particularly
    painful and dangerous, and in most cases the mother dies during childbirth.
  - >-
    Cambions are unusual among demons in that they enter life in the Abyss not
    as fully formed demons, but as infants. And while cambions mature
    quickly-reaching adulthood over the course of only 6 painful months- they
    remain relatively helpless for much of this time, requiring someone to rear
    them. The Abyss's denizens are not known for their caring and nurturing
    natures, so despite the insatiable urges of their incubus fathers, few
    cambions live to see adulthood. And while cambions do not need to remain in
    the Abyss during the period of their maturation, it's rare for someone to
    spirit such a child out of the Worldwound.
  - >-
    Once fully grown, a cambion attains its full demonic powers. When the first
    day of its seventh month of life dawns, a cambion gains his spell-like
    abilities and sinfrenzy power. Unlike other demons, cambions as a whole
    aren't associated with a specific sin; some revel in their fathers' lustful
    natures, and other embrace pride, envy, and so on (this need not match their
    sinfrenzies).
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Few places in the Abyss provide safe harbor for a newborn cambion to
    mature-the most notable of these are Nocticula's Midnight Isles. Here,
    Nocticula rewards those who take upon themselves the stewardship of a
    cambion infant, but only if that cambion, upon reaching maturity, chooses to
    award its foster parent the honor of being named its "warden." A cambion has
    a month to bestow this honor, and does so by uttering the following prayer
    to Nocticula: "By the grace of Our Lady in Shadow do I name thee,
    (creature's name), my warden." By Nocticula's decree, cambions are free to
    name anyone warden, so anyone who seeks this honor is well advised to give
    her cambion fosterling no reasons to betray her.
  - >-
    Once a warden is so chosen, the nature of the boon Nocticula grants varies;
    it might be a monetary reward, a magical gift, an enhancement to body or
    mind, or (in rare cases) even a moment of dalliance with Nocticula herself.
    Entire societies on the Midnight Isles exist for the sole purpose of raising
    cambions and seeking out such boons.
  - >-
    Cambions often rise to great power by advancing in class level, particularly
    in classes associated with their favorite sins. It is rare for a cambion to
    take class levels in a class that is not associated with its sinfrenzy
    ability, but not unheard of.
  - >-
    When encountered on the Material Plane, cambions most often already have a
    number of class levels. These cambions are in charge of groups of cultists,
    where they serve as demonic generals and powerful spellcasters. They always
    come to the Material Plane with grand plots and recruit others to help them
    sow sin. Cambions in these roles are often in service of a demon lord-or
    even Lamashtu herself. It is unusual for more than a handful of cambions to
    work together, as their inf lated egos lead to arguments and internal
    bickering.
