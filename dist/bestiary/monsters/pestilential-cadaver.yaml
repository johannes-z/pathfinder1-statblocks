SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease Aura (Ex)
    description: >-
      A pestilential cadaver exudes a putrid aura in a 30-foot radius around
      itself. Creatures entering or caught in the area must succeed on a DC 15
      Fortitude save or contract one of the diseases listed on the table below.
      A creature that saves is immune to the disease aura of that pestilential
      cadaver for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based. 1D8 DISEASE 1 Blinding
      sickness 2 Cackle fever 3 Filth fever 4 Mindfire 5 Red ache 6 Shakes 7
      Slimy doom 8 Roll twice, ignoring any results of 8
  - name: Fast Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A pestilential cadaver's fast healing only works if it is within 30 feet
      of a fresh corpse. A fresh corpse is defined as any living creature killed
      within the last 24 hours.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A pestilential cadaver is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that
      allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted: A magical attack that deals
      fire damage dazes a pestilential cadaver (as the daze spell) for 3 rounds
      (no save). A magical attack that inflicts disease heals the cadaver of 1d6
      hit points per level of the spellcaster. A remove disease spell deals 1d6
      points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to a pestilential
      cadaver. The creature can attempt a Fortitude save to reduce the damage by
      half. A heal spell functions as a harm spell against a pestilential
      cadaver.
  - name: Sickness (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living creature hit by a pestilential cadaver's slam attack must succeed
      on a DC 15 Fortitude save or become sickened for 2d6 rounds. A creature
      that fails its save by 5 or more is must immediately attempt another DC 15
      Fortitude save or be subjected to one of the diseases above just as if it
      had been affected by the cadaver's aura. A creature that succeeds on the
      second Fortitude save is not subject to the disease effects of this
      ability for one day, even if it fails any subsequent Fortitude saves by 5
      or more. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The pestilential cadaver is literally a walking disease, a construct formed
    from the bodies of those who died of plague and fever. It is ever active,
    seeking to spread its contagion to all who live. It rots constantly, losing
    flesh to decomposition, but gaining material from those it slays.
  - >-
    Although it moves awkwardly, in fits and jerks, the pestilential cadaver is
    as swift and dexterous as a healthy man, even capable of running (though it
    rarely does so). It stands about 6 feet in height, and weighs roughly 150
    pounds.
  - >-
    The pestilential cadaver engages in combat primarily as a means of infecting
    new victims and absorbing their diseased remains once it slays them. It is a
    straightforward combatant, deadly even to those it does not touch.
