SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A vemerak's acidic breath weapon has no effect on inorganic or undead
      material. If the breath weapon deals damage to a living fleshy creature,
      the acid creates a transparent cloud of foul-smelling vapor that fills
      that creature's space and persists for 1 round. Any creature in or passing
      through the cloud must make a DC 24 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4
      rounds. This cloud is a poison effect. The save DCs are
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Earthquake (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a vemerak can burrow its tentacles, legs, and
      mouth into the ground-this action does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
      At the start of the next round, it creates an effect identical to an
      earthquake spell (CL 17th). A vemerak can maintain this zone of trembling
      earth indefinitely, as long as it continues to take full-round actions to
      maintain the effect.
  - name: Spore Cloud (Su)
    description: >-
      A unique form of magic-resistant mold grows upon the body of a vemerak.
      This mold is the source of the vemerak's spell resistance. When the
      vemerak moves, the mold exudes a cloud of spores in a 30-foot radius that
      acts as a targeted greater dispel magic (CL 17th) against the highest
      caster level magical effect the cloud touches as part of the vemerak's
      move that turn.
Description:
  - >-
    Huge and otherworldly, the vemerak is a monster known as much for its
    disturbing appearance as its violent and cruel disposition.
  - >-
    A vemerak is 10 feet tall and 20 feet long, its tentaclelike tails adding a
    further 15 feet to its length. It weighs just over 6 tons. Caverns that
    serve as lairs to these creatures invariably possess disturbing shrines
    where the creatures offer up portions of every meal to dark gods that dwell
    deep below the sane world-as a result, many believe that vemeraks exist as
    the physical manifestation of the will of a particularly violent and insane
    deity.
