Description:
  - >-
    Bladecoins are tiny constructs fashioned by tricky spellcasters hoping to
    fool and detour would-be thieves. They are often constructed by spellcasters
    for others, such as merchants, local rulers, and sold to the client at a
    somewhat reasonable price.
  - >-
    At rest, a bladecoin swarm appears to be nothing more than a pile of brass
    or copper coins. When it senses intruders entering the area it is tasked
    with guarding, it swirls into a cyclone form and moves to the attack,
    slashing its opponents with its razor-sharp edges.
  - Construction
  - >-
    A bladecoin's body is constructed from melted brass and copper coins with a
    total value of at least 1,000 gp.
