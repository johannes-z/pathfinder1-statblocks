  - name: Attach (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a volt hits with bite, it latches onto the opponent's body, anchoring
      it in place. An attached volt is effectively grappling its prey. The volt
      loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 13, but holds on with
      great tenacity and inserts its proboscis into the grappled target's flesh.
      A volt has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is
      attached. An attached volt can be struck with a weapon or grappled
      itself-if its prey manages to win a grapple check or Escape Artist check
      against it, the volt is removed.
  - name: Shock (Su)
    description: >-
      A volt delivers an electrical charge when it hits with its tail slap,
      dealing 2d4 points of nonlethal damage. An attached volt can attack the
      grappled opponent with its tail slap with a +4 bonus in the same round.
Description:
  - >-
    The origin of the volt is unknown and has eluded even the most learned of
    scholars. Referred to as bolt wurms in certain old grimoires for their
    ability to deliver a "bolt from the blue" with their whip-like tail, volts
    were once thought to be from another plane or planet, though evidence of
    late suggests they are in fact of this world. Other than that bit of
    information, the volt remains much of a mystery.
  - >-
    Volts inhabit underground caverns and caves, preferring to lair in areas
    dampened by water. A typical grouping consists of up to 20 creatures, though
    it's anyone's guess which are male and which are female (if such a thing
    among volts actually exists).
  - >-
    A volt's spheroid body is about 3 feet across. Its tail is nearly 3 feet
    long and formed of semi-hardened tissue. Its mouth, unseen at first by those
    viewing it, is located near the underside of its body and is filled with
    rows of needle-like teeth.
  - >-
    Volts are very aggressive and attack by latching onto a foe and draining its
    blood. An attached volt strikes with its tail and maintains its hold until
    either it or its opponent is dead.
