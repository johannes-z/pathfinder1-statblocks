    description: >-
      A witherweed looks like normal grass and weeds when at rest; it takes a DC
      20 Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in
      Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of
      Perception to notice the plant. Dwarves can use stonecunning to notice the
      subterranean version.
  - name: Death Smoke (Ex)
    description: >-
      A witherweed that takes at least 1 point of damage from a fire effect
      releases a cloud of deadly smoke that billows forth and quickly fills a
      20-foot radius surrounding it. Creatures within the area must succeed on a
      DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage. One minute
      later, another Fortitude save (same DC) must be made to avoid another 2d6
      points of Constitution damage. The save DCs are Constitution-based. The
      cloud remains for 1 round per HD of the witherweed but a strong wind (21+
      mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round.
Description:
  - >-
    Witherweeds resemble large patches of dry grass and weeds and are most often
    found in areas where their natural makeup allows them to blend in with their
    surroundings. A subterranean version of this monster exists and makes its
    lair in desolate caves and caverns.
  - >-
    Hidden among the creature's body are many long, sinewy strands that it uses
    to trap its foes. The average witherweed covers an area of 10 square feet,
    though specimens as large as 60 square feet have been encountered by a few
    dungeon delvers.
  - >-
    A witherweed attacks any living creature that comes within 10 feet of it,
    slashing and striking with its fronds. Slain creatures are devoured as the
    witherweed releases enzymes to break down its food and absorbs the
    nutrients.
  - >-
    A witherweed has one frond for each HD it possesses (thus, the typical 5 HD
    witherweed has 5 fronds while a 10 HD witherweed has 10 fronds).
