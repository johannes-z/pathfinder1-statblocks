SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid Fountain (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action every 1d4 rounds, a fountain fungus can spray acid
      into the air. This acid quickly falls and covers a 10-foot-radius burst
      around the fountain fungus. Creatures in the area take 7d6 points of acid
      damage. A DC 21 Reflex save reduces the damage by half. The save is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    description: >-
      Since a fountain fungus looks like a normal moss-covered fountain when at
      rest, a DC 20 Perception check is required to notice it before it attacks
      for the first time. Anyone with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature)
      can use either of those skills instead of Perception to notice the plant.
Description:
  - >-
    A fountain fungus is a semi-intelligent plant creature that enjoys luring
    other creatures to their doom and then devouring them. While it appears to
    be an ordinary fountain carved of stone and covered with mold and
    vegetation, the fountain fungus is 100% vegetable matter through and
    through. The gray coloration of its central body lends to its deception.
  - >-
    Fountain funguses can be found just about anywhere save the coldest of
    climates. Many are encountered underground as these creatures seem to have a
    particular like for the dampness and darkness that dungeons and caverns
    provide. Fountain funguses subsist on a diet of blood, so regardless of
    where they lair, they always make sure a supply of fresh food is readily
    available (e.g., a popular dungeon perhaps where adventurers like to
    explore). When a fountain fungus's food supply dwindles it simply rolls
    itself into a ball and moves to another location.
  - >-
    A fountain fungus is about 10 feet in diameter. Its central body is stone
    gray with many vines, leaves, and mushroom-like growths of varying greens
    covering it. Somewhere in this tangled mass are four tentacles that look
    like thick rugged vines.
  - >-
    A fountain fungus's tactics are simple: spray acid on foes, slap and whip
    foes with its tendrils, and finally grab an opponent and attempt to swallow
    it. Creatures killed by a fountain fungus are wrapped in its vines and
    pulled into its body. The fountain fungus spends the next few days absorbing
    all fluids and nutrients from its prey before ejecting a dried out husk of
    its victim onto the ground.
