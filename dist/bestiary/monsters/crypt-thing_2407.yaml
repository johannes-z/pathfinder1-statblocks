    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a crypt thing can teleport all
      creatures within 50 feet of it to a randomly determined location. An
      affected creature can attempt a DC 20 Will save to negate the effects. The
      save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. An affected
      creature is teleported in a random direction (roll 1d4: 1, north; 2,
      south; 3, east; 4, west) and a random distance (1d10 x 100 feet) away from
      the crypt thing. Roll randomly for each creature that fails its saving
      throw. A teleported creature arrives in the closest open space at the
      determined destination. A teleported creature can arrive in mid-air rather
      than on a solid surface, if the crypt thing wishes. A creature that
      arrives in mid-air takes falling damage when it contacts a solid surface
      (unless it has some means to prevent falling, such as the ability to fly,
      or a feather fall spell).
Description:
  - >-
    Crypt things are undead creatures found guarding tombs, graves, crypts, and
    other such structures. They are created by spellcasters to guard such areas
    and they never leave their assigned area. A crypt thing never initiates
    combat. It is content to sit (or stand) in its assigned area so long as
    intruders do not disturb it or anything in the assigned area. At the first
    sign of disturbance however, a crypt thing springs to life. Its first order
    of business is to attempt to remove the interlopers from its assigned area
    by using its teleport other attack. Opponents that successfully resist are
    attacked by the crypt thing that uses its claws to rake and slash its foes.
    A crypt thing's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose
    of overcoming damage reduction. Crypt Guardian There exists in some parts of
    the world (and perhaps only truly in legend; sages aren't sure) a variant of
    the crypt thing known as a crypt guardian. This variant has all the same
    abilities and powers as a normal crypt thing, with the following changes.
    The variant does not possess the teleport other ability. Instead, it
    possesses an ability known as cloak other. Cloak Other (Su) Once per day as
    a standard action, a crypt guardian can simultaneously paralyze and turn
    invisible all creatures within 50 feet. An affected creature can make a DC
    20 Will save to negate the effects (only one save is required; if it
    succeeds, both effects are negated). The save DC is Charisma-based and
    includes a +2 racial bonus. Affected creatures remain paralyzed and
    invisible for 2d4 days. A new save is allowed each day until the effects are
    broken, dispelled, or the duration ends. Create Crypt Thing School

    corpse Duration instantaneous Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no This
    spell allows you to animate a single Medium or Large corpse of a creature 18
    HD or less into a crypt thing. This spell must be cast in the area the
    creature is to guard or it fails. The corpse must be mostly intact and must
    be humanoid-shaped and have a skeletal system or structure. Only one crypt
    thing is created with this spell, and it remains in the area where it was
    created until destroyed. The black gem is placed inside the mouth of the
    corpse. When the corpse animates, the gem is destroyed. Credit The Crypt
    Thing originally appeared in the First Edition Fiend Folio (© TSR/Wizards of
    the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission. According to an article by Don
    Turnbull in Dragon #55 (© TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981), the Crypt Thing
    was never intended to be an undead creature, though somehow it evolved into
    that over the years. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene, based on original
