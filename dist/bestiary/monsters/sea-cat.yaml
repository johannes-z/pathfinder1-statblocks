Description:
  - >-
    The feral sea cat (sometimes referred to as the sea lion, sea tiger, or sea
    leopard) is among the most vicious and ubiquitous of coastal predators in
    tropical oceans. The upper body of a sea cat is that of a typical great
    cat-a lion, tiger, leopard, or cheetah-complete with a pair of clawed paws
    capable of rending the flesh from its prey. In place of back legs, however,
    the sea cat has a sleek and powerful tail that allows it to move quickly and
    silently through the water. While only the back half of a sea cat looks
    fishlike, its entire body from the neck down is covered in fine scales and
    fins. Among individual sea cats, these scales vary greatly in color and
    pattern, often inf luenced by the primary habitat of a given specimen; the
    most common sea cats, have bright coloration in striped or spotted patterns.
    A typical sea cat is 12 feet long and weighs upward of 800 pounds.

    Sea cats can survive in both fresh and salt water, though most live in the
    ocean, where they can hunt a varied and consistent supply of food. A sea
    cat's diet typically consists of fish, crustaceans, and aquatic mammals
    (including seals and otters), but the creature's overpowering predatory and
    territorial instincts often lead it to attack ocean birds, humanoids, and
    even other aquatic predators like sharks and crocodiles. Coastal fishermen
    in areas where sea cats are known to dwell watch vigilantly for the
    predators, because the beasts have learned that netted or hooked prey is
    easier to kill and steal from the line. Sea cats breathe air, not water.
    When not hunting they can be found on coastal rocks, coral islands, or even
    isolated beaches sunning themselves and digesting their most recent meals.
    Whether hunting or protecting its territory, a sea cat generally attacks
    immediately upon discovering a target, even when faced with a much larger or
    more dangerous foe. The sea cat's low intelligence and high level of
    ferocity make it incredibly difficult to train or domesticate, though
    pirates and aquatic races have been known to try, with limited success.
