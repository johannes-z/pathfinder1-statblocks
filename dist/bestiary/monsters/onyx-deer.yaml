Description_Visual: >-
  This creature looks like a deer about 5 feet tall at the shoulders with a dark
  brown head and chest changing to light brown on the rest of its body. A large
  white patch is prevalent across its back and rump. It has huge antlers at
  least as wide as a typical human is tall.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bellow (Su)
    description: >-
      Twice per day, an onyx deer can unleash a rumbling bellow that instills
      fear in any creature within 100 feet that hears it. All creatures in the
      area must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be shaken as long as they remain
      within the area and for 2d4 rounds afterward. A creature that succeeds on
      its saving throw is immune to the bellow of that onyx deer for 24 hours.
      The save DC is Charisma-based. Onyx deer are immune to their own bellow
      and that of other onyx deer.
  - name: Onyx Bite (Su)
    description: >-
      An onyx deer's bite deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage against a
      living creature if it fails a DC 18 Fortitude save. A living creature
      reduced to Constitution 3 or less transforms into onyx, resembling nothing
      more than a statue. A stone to flesh spell returns a transformed creature
      to its original form, though if it was reduced to Constitution 0 by the
      onyx deer's bite it immediately dies upon returning to its natural form.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Other than being larger than most common deer, an onyx deer resembles its
    (thought to be distant) lesser cousin. These creatures are found in
    temperate and warm forested lands in the same general habitat as their
    normal counterparts though onyx deer do not associate with ordinary deer.
    Onyx deer are herd animals, congregating in groups of up to 20 individuals.
    Among the adults, the males outnumber the females by nearly a 2-to-1 ratio.
    Young (called does) make up the rest of the herd (their total number usually
    equals the number of adults in the herd).
  - >-
    Mating season for onyx deer comes in the fall. During this time males within
    the herd often clash with one another. Such clashes see the animals square
    off and charge headlong into each other crashing their antlers together and
    slashing with their sharp hooves. When one falls, the battle ends. The loser
    of the battle usually survives, but always leaves the herd.
  - Females give birth to 1d3 young in the early summer months.
  - >-
    Onyx deer stand 5 to 6 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh more than 800
    pounds.
  - >-
    Onyx deer are generally passive creatures and only attack when threatened or
    when their herd is threatened. If a herd is molested, both male and female
    onyx deer defend the young does to the death. An onyx deer begins combat by
    releasing a loud bellow in an attempt to scare off any would-be attackers.
    Those who stand their ground are met with either a gore attack and hooves or
    a ferocious bite and hooves. The bite of an onyx deer transforms the wound
    and flesh surrounding it into a gem-like stone that resembles onyx.
