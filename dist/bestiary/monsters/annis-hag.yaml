Description:
  - >-
    Also known as black hags or iron hags, annis hags are the largest and most
    physically intimidating of their foul brood. Known for their iron-hard,
    wart-covered skin that varies from shades of deep blue to black and their
    claws like rusty blades, annis hags forgo much of the cunning and
    deceptiveness of their kind to revel in the more visceral evils of torture
    and slaughter. The typical annis hag stands just over 8 feet tall and weighs
    upward of 300 pounds.

    Dwelling in dark caves, tangled hollows, and cursed ruins deep within frozen
    swamps or icy moors, annis hags stalk forth by night to sow fear and hunt
    the unwary. Although possessed of cunning minds, annis prove more decadent
    than most other hags, frequently indulging in their taste for living flesh
    and the music of pleading screams. Unlike green hags, they use their ability
    to assume humanoid form via alter self not to infiltrate societies but to
    lure victims into a false sense of security before attacking-often posing as
    travelers in need of aid or pilgrims seeking to share a camp.
  - >-
    Annis hags find the flesh of children, young animals, and the pure of heart
    particularly pleasing, both for the tenderness of such meals and for the
    sorrow such murders spread. After gorging themselves, these hags delight in
    stripping the skin from their victims, often garbing themselves in the
    grisly trophies. They are also known to retain and even preserve
    identifiable portions of their victims (such as heads) for later use in
    spreading misery. An annis who eats the children of a local farmer might
    keep the heads (or at least the faces) handy to return to the victims'
    parents, for example-often in the guise of an anonymous gift. The most
    insidious of annis hags present these gifts in ways that implicate friends
    or family in the victim's death.
  - >-
    Like most hags, annis sometimes join covens of their repulsive sisters,
    though many prove resistant to such cooperation. They are particularly
    unlikely to join covens that already include other annis, though groups of
    related annis-typically horrible triplets-are not unknown. A typical annis
    coven consists of one annis leader along with two green hags or sometimes
    even a witch or two. Annis covens often seek to recruit additional creatures
    as guardians and are particularly fond of trolls and ogres for such roles.
