Description:
  - >-
    Boarfolk are giant humanoids standing some 9 to 10 feet tall, weighing
    nearly 700 pounds. They possess boar-like features, including large tusks
    that protrude from their mouths.
  - >-
    Boarfolk are created by the sorceress, Circe, on the Isle of the Phoenix, in
    the Land of the Dead. There she uses her powers to transmute travelers that
    are unfortunate enough to cross her path. Once transmuted the boarfolk grow
    enthralled by her beauty and charisma, and serve her without question.
  - >-
    Boarfolk speak an offshoot of Common, but so thickly accented as to make it
    a separate language.
  - >-
    The boarfolk live in nomadic, tribal fashion. Should the influence of Circe
    ever depart, the boarfolk would turn to infighting and barbaric tribal law;
    the strongest would rule, and the rest of the boarfollk would split into
    warring tribes.
