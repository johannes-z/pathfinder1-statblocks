Description_Visual: >-
  A rustic hut stands here, its timber walls hung with bundles of drying herbs
  and etched with eerie symbols. From beneath its splintering wooden porch
  extends a pair of legs, like those of a fifteen-foot-tall chicken with
  gigantic talons caked in mud but sharp as razors.

  - name: Immortal Structure (Ex)
    description: >-
      Reducing the Dancing Hut to 0 hit points causes its legs to buckle,
      bringing the hut itself toppling to the ground. Such a defeat has no
      effect on the hut's extradimensional interior or any creatures inside the
      hut. The hut remains immobile and unresponsive to its owner's commands to
      move or use any of the special abilities described in its creature stat
      block for 24 hours, though the transportive abilities of the hut and its
      cauldron can still be employed. The hut cannot be reduced to fewer than 0
      hit points, no matter what damage, circumstances, or environment it might
      be subjected to after its defeat. After 24 hours, the hut regains half its
      hit points (94 hp) and its fast healing ability reactivates. It may then
      use its special abilities to escape from nearly any situation it finds
      itself in. The Dancing Hut can only be destroyed by the method detailed in
      the artifact's destruction entry.
  - name: Swallow Whole (Ex)
    description: >-
      If the Dancing Hut successfully grapples a creature with its slam attack,
      the victim is scooped up by the hut's front door and flung inside. The
      target appears within the extradimensional space inside the hut-the layout
      of which depends upon the hut's physical location (see the map on page 23
      for a sample layout of the hut's interior). Being inside the hut is not
      necessarily dangerous, unless one of Baba Yaga's guardians is there or
      Baby Yaga herself is home. A swallowed creature can attempt to escape by
      breaking open the front door, a deceptively sturdy barrier with hardness
      15 and 100 hit points that also benefits from the hut's fast healing
      ability. The hut can expel swallowed creatures as a full-round action,
      flinging them from its open door. It must make a combat maneuver check
      against creatures that don't wish to leave, with failure meaning the
      target is able to hold on to the pitching and warping interior. The hut
      may choose which creatures it wishes to expel and which to keep inside.
