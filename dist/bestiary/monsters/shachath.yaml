Description_Visual: >-
  This winged abomination is a horrid mix of demonic and angelic features, as if
  two bodies were carelessly fused into one. Its fanged, inhuman face is frozen
  in permanent contempt, while a beautiful visage with an expression of horror
  bulges from the back of its skull.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blasphemous Influence (Su)
    description: >-
      A victim that falls under the effects of a shachath's merge with host
      ability becomes chaotic evil. Divine spellcasters subject to a shachath's
      merge with host ability temporarily lose connection with their faith, and
      now gain their divine powers from the Abyss or a demon lord the shachath
      serves. Though they can still cast the spells they had prepared, they
      cannot cast spells with the lawful or good descriptor. If the victim of a
      shachath's merging had access to the Good domain, that access changes to
      the Evil domain. If the victim had access to the Law domain, that access
      changes to the Chaos domain. If the victim had access to a subdomain
      associated with the Good or Law domain, that subdomain changes to the
      Demon subdomain. These changes last as long as the shachath remains merged
      with the victim. Other domain choices are not adjusted. If the victim is
      rescued from the shachath's influence and the merge ends without the
      victim's death, the victim remains chaotic evil-this may result in the
      victim losing some or all class abilities. An atonement spell can restore
      the victim's alignment at no additional cost, at which point lost class
      abilities are restored.
  - name: Lingering Doubt (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a shachath can use a touch attack to affect a creature with
      lingering doubt. The target must be able to cast divine spells, be able to
      channel positive energy, or have the lay on hands ability. If the target
      fails a DC 20 Will save, all augury, commune, divination, and similar
      spells cast by the target automatically fail. In addition, using divine
      spells and spell-like abilities, channeling positive energy, or using lay
      on hands has a 20% chance of failure. This curse is permanent, but can be
      removed normally. The target cannot detect the curse on itself, but other
      creatures may detect the curse normally. A shachath may use scrying on the
      cursed creature as if it knew the target well, and doing so requires only
      a full-round action. A shachath may only curse one creature at any given
      time. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Merge with Host (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, a shachath
      can merge its body with that of a helpless creature and control it if the
      victim fails a DC 20 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is not
      subject to the same shachath's merge with host ability for 24 hours. While
      merged with a victim, a shachath gains control of the body and may use it
      as its own, as if it controlled the target via dominate monster.
      Misdirection or similar effects can hide the victim's alignment change.
      The shachath has full access to all of the host's defensive and offensive
      abilities, and the shachath can still use its own spell-like abilities as
      well. As long as the shachath occupies the host, it knows (and can speak)
      the languages known by the victim and basic information about the victim's
      identity and personality. It can learn specific memories or knowledge from
      the victim by telepathic communication as needed. Damage dealt to a host
      body does not harm the shachath, and if the host body is slain, the
      shachath emerges and is dazed for 1 round. A shachath can choose to
      abandon a host body as an immediate action, but doing so causes the host
      to be dazed for 1 round, and the shachath must wait 24 hours before
      attempting to use merge with host again on any target. A shachath can be
      ejected from a host through the use of break enchantment (against CL
      13th), dispel chaos, or dispel evil. Merge with host is a mind-affecting
      possession effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Subtle Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a shachath targets a creature with a spell, spell-like ability,
      or supernatural ability, and that spell or ability has no obvious physical
      effects, the targeted creature has no sense of having been the target of a
      magical effect after making a successful saving throw against the effect.
      If the ability requires a touch attack but the target is unaware of being
      threatened, the shachath can attempt an opposed Bluff or Sleight of Hand
      check to touch the target without arousing suspicion or being noticed.
  - name: Trophy Taker (Su)
    description: >-
      A shachath that takes a personal item from a prospective target can wield
      greater power over that creature. The item must be something that the
      target considers its own possession and carries with it most of the time
      (for example, a piece of jewelry, a favored weapon, a holy symbol, or some
      other memento). The shachath gains a +2 bonus to the saving throw DCs for
      all of its supernatural or spell-like abilities that target the owner of
      the trophy. This bonus increases to +4 if the trophy is the target's holy
      symbol. A shachath can only have one trophy at any time, and it loses any
      benefit from an existing trophy if it takes a new one.
Description:
  - >-
    A shachath's duplicitous nature is ref lected in its physical form. It is
    literally two-faced, and sees and speaks easily from either side of its
    skull. One face is angelic and the other horrific, but a shachath is a
    single being of pure malevolence. Shachaths are concerned with the
    destruction of mortal faith in anything, and are most often found in the
    service of Baphomet, Pazuzu, Sif kesh, or Socothbenoth. A typical shachath
    is 7-1/2 feet tall and weighs 320 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Shachaths are living embodiments of blasphemy. They form in the Abyss from
    truly blasphemous souls-those who actively work against true believers.
    Their merged forms can be inverted at their whims; at one moment, the
    demonic face might be carrying on a conversation, and in the next, with a
    folding of flesh and a cracking of bones, the shachath can bring its angelic
    face to the fore.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Shachaths that reside in the Abyss typically act as advisors and counselors
    to more powerful demons that seek their unique insight into good gods,
    outsiders, and the mortal condition itself. Others are skilled at
    interrogating and breaking good-aligned prisoners. On the Material Plane,
    shachaths dedicate their efforts toward the corruption of mortal faith. This
    can represent an attack upon a devout cleric or an entire community-or both,
    if they can manage.
