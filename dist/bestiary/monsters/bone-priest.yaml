SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Drink (Su)
    description: >-
      When a bone priest reduces a creature to 0 hit points or fewer with a
      melee attack or coup de grace, it can use death knell against that
      creature as a free action. It doesn't need to be touching the creature to
      use this ability. Spells A bone priest casts spells as 3rd-level cleric.
      It also gains domain spells from the Madness domain, but none of the other
      domain abilities or cleric abilities.
  - name: Unnerving Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      A bone priest can make a gaze attack that strikes fear into the hearts of
      all creatures within a 30- foot radius that can see the bone priest. These
      creatures must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw or be shaken for 1d4
      rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Bone priests are undead servants of evil gods, condemned to continue serving
    for decades or centuries after death. In life, bone priests were acolytes or
    underpriests who failed at some difficult test or fell in battle against
    powerful enemies of the faith. Their dark gods have rewarded their
    fanaticism by giving another chance to demonstrate their worthiness.
  - >-
    Bone priests retain the spellcasting ability and some of the domain spells
    they possessed in life. A typical bone priest casts spells as a 3rd-level
    cleric and has the bonus spells of one of the domains it had
    originally-usually Darkness, Death, Destruction, Evil, or Madness (the bone
    priest presented here possesses the Madness domain).
  - >-
    While bone priests occasionally arise with no outside intervention other
    than the will of their gods, they are normally created through a profane
    ritual that culminates in the casting of a create undead spell by a caster
    of at least 11th level.
