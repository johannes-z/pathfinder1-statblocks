SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ball Lightning Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      A sea drake can, as a standard action, breathe a ball of electricity that
      strikes one target first, then arcs to other targets like chain lightning.
      This attack has a range of 100 feet, and deals 6d6 points of electricity
      damage (DC 17 Reflex half) to the primary target. After it strikes, the
      ball lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to the sea
      drake's Hit Dice (usually 7) within 20 feet of the primary target. The
      secondary bolts each strike one target and deal as much damage as the
      primary bolt. Once a sea drake has used its ball lightning breath, it
      cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The Reflex save is Constitution-based.
  - name: Capsize (Ex)
    description: >-
      A sea drake can attempt to capsize a boat or ship of its size or smaller
      by ramming it as a charge attack and making a combat maneuver check. The
      DC of this check is 25 or the result of the boat captain's Profession
      (sailor) check, whichever is higher.
  - name: Speed Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a swift action, a sea drake may draw on its
      draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional
      move action in that round.
Description:
  - >-
    While obviously the product of draconic inbreeding, the heritage of sea
    drakes is less clear than that of other drakes. Among the strongest of the
    drakes, sea drakes still lack the mental acuity of their true dragon
    forebears, though they remain as brutally cunning as other drakes.
  - >-
    Although amphibious, sea drakes spend the majority of their time in shallow
    coastal waters.
  - >-
    Sea drakes are up to 14 feet long from their noses to the tips of their
    powerful tails. They weigh 2,000 pounds.
  - >-
    The most solitary of all drakes, sea drakes prefer to hunt alone.
    Occasionally, however, they band together in packs to hunt larger prey. Such
    rampages can be a significant danger to coastal shipping.
