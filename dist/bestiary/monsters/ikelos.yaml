SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Phased (Su)
    description: >-
      An ikelos is typically invisible. Creatures that are fatigued or under the
      effects of see invisibility can see an ikelos, but its nature is partially
      obscured. An ikelos gains the benefit of partial concealment against such
      creatures. In addition, its claws deal 3d6 points of damage to such
      creatures, instead of 2d6. Creatures that are exhausted or under the
      effects of true seeing can see the ikelos clearly. They suffer no miss
      chance when striking the ikelos. However, an ikelos's claws deal 4d6
      points of damage to such creatures, instead of 2d6.
  - name: Fear Dependency (Ex)
    description: >-
      An ikelos is a creature of nightmares, and it depends completely on fear
      for its sustenance. An ikelos doesn't recover hit point damage naturally
      and cannot heal by any means other than its feed on fear ability.
  - name: Feed on Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      Anytime an ikelos is within 15 feet of a dying creature or a creature
      subject to a fear effect, it gains fast healing 5.
  - name: Frightful Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures within 30 feet that meet an ikelos's gaze must succeed at a DC
      17 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1 round. This is a
      mind-affecting fear effect and a paralysis effect. A creature that
      succeeds at this saving throw is immune to the frightful gaze of that
      ikelos for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Lethargy Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      An ikelos exudes an aura that makes nearby creatures increasingly
      lethargic. Creatures that fail a DC 17 Fortitude save become fatigued.
      Fatigued creatures that fail a DC 17 Fortitude save become exhausted. The
      effects of the aura end 10 rounds after an affected creature exits the
      aura. An ikelos can suppress or reactivate its aura as a free action.
      Ikeloses are immune to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Ikeloses are monsters that lurk just out of the sight of insomniacs; they
    are nightmares that freeze the body even as the mind recoils in horror.
  - >-
    To those who are fully awake, an ikelos remains unseen, a silently invisible
    nightmare that can travel undetected wherever it pleases. Only supernatural
    vision or drowsy eyes perceive these creatures. Ikeloses are painted in the
    colors of dreams-constantly warping hues that cannot be reproduced with
    light or pigments, and as such are impossible to accurately remember.
  - >-
    An ikelos is frightening in aspect, appearing as a distorted humanoid with
    large eyes and elongated limbs. Its flat, ovoid face has the barest hint of
    a nose, and its mouth is a barely noticeable seam until distended to reveal
    row upon row of sharp teeth. An ikelos's short wings are unnecessary for its
    flight, but when unfolded, they give the creature the illusion of size. Many
    a dream-addled victim has mistaken an ikelos for a sinister fiend or an
    avenging angel.
  - >-
    Ikeloses are commonly the size of a human, though both larger and smaller
    members of their kind exist. As incorporeal beings, they are entirely
    weightless.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Ikeloses are born in dreamscapes in the Dimension of Dreams. They begin as
    recurring nightmares. When they've fed on enough fear, they create bodies
    from planar gossamer that can survive even as their dreamscapes crumble each
    morning. Eventually, a mature ikelos rides its dreamer back to the Material
    Plane, usually drawing its first meal from the unwitting "parent."
  - >-
    Although they don't need to eat or breathe in the conventional sense,
    ikeloses draw sustenance from fear. They use fear to mend their wounds and
    replenish their dream-spun forms. Deprived of this emotional fuel, they
    eventually waste away to nothing.
  - >-
    An ikelos's frightful gaze is often enough to extract the emotion it needs.
    By returning to a victim several times a week, it can, in theory, sustain
    itself without killing the victim. In practice, however, such unfortunate
    souls often die of fright or sleep deprivation, or else seek means to ward
    off
  - >-
    their tormentors. Against a victim that resists its paralyzing gaze, an
    ikelos resorts to violence. The resulting corpses usually foment more fear
    and sleeplessness in others.
  - >-
    An ikelos could rely solely on its aura of lethargy to tire its victims and
    quickly extract their fear. But being born from nightmares, ikeloses see
    such direct tactics as inelegant, and take pride in creative plans that
    slowly drive their victims mad. As a few surviving victims remember from the
    monster's taunts, ikeloses claim that fear tastes better when it has time to
    ripen. When an ikelos is threatened, it doesn't hesitate to unleash its aura
    of lethargy and viciously claw apart whoever stands in its way.
  - >-
    Ikeloses usually prey on insomniacs, those most prone to weariness and
    paranoia. In a pinch, they drift around invisibly during the day, searching
    for anxious individuals to target. They prefer to torment prey with alien
    whispers and intrusive thoughts-which become increasingly diffficult to
    dismiss as days pass into weeks-before revealing their true forms. Many
    ikeloses dislike that diviners can grant themselves and others the ability
    to see them, and target these spellcasters out of spite. Magic that pierces
    invisibility reveals ikeloses but, as with fatigue, makes the viewer more
    susceptible to ikeloses's malignancies.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Ikeloses exist wherever sentient creatures dream, especially poor urban
    areas where hopes die and anxieties run high. Though they don't need to
    sleep, ikeloses become torpid during the day, anticipating their nocturnal
    games.
  - >-
    An ikelos's alien mind is ever turned toward finding suitable prey and
    devising new and unexpected ways to horrify. Typically loners, ikeloses
    sometimes form packs-not for companionship, but to aid in their hunting.
    Like a wolf pack, ikeloses surround their prey, increasing the chance that
    the victim will be paralyzed or unable to flee. Interactions between such
    ikeloses are usually contests of dominance. While food and mating are of no
    concern to these creatures, the dominant ikelos makes most of the decisions
    for the group; ikeloses crave autonomy as much as any living thing hungers
    or lusts. Acts of deviousness and depravity are the usual measure of
    standing. Knowing it can't heal in a normal fashion, an ikelos almost always
    avoids committing violence against others of its kind, unless it can do so
    without anticipation of reprisal.
  - >-
    Ikeloses don't interact with living creatures except to harvest their fear.
    Even were they not often invisible and intangible to most beings, they have
    little desire to socialize with creatures they consider food. However, as
    parasites, they can be found living invisibly amid all manner of creatures.
    An ikelos might seek to defend its "cattle" from other predators-whether
    monsters preying on its human stock or adventurers slaying its hobgoblin
    victims-or
  - >-
    else seek to harvest a new source of fear. Creatures who are immune to fear
    cannot sustain an ikelos's unnatural existence, and thus hold little
    interest for these stalkers.
  - >-
    Occasionally, ikeloses encounter creatures similar to themselves, such as
    house-haunting undead or soul-harvesting night hags, and choose to form
    temporary alliances. Such a creature might complement the ikelos's
    abilities, and an ikelos has no use for its victim's bodies or souls.
    However, such alliances can prove tenuous and dangerous for both sides.
    Perhaps the creature most similar to an ikelos is an animate dream
    (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 29). While animate dreams are nonspecific
    fragments of a single dream, ikeloses are specific figures that build up
    strength across multiple dreams. Ikeloses and animate dreams each believe
    themselves to be superior manifestations, and when an ikelos and an animate
    dream set their sights on the same prey, the conf lict typically ends in
    violent confrontation.
