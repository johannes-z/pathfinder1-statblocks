Description:
  - >-
    Monadic devas are stoic watchers of the Ethereal Plane and the Elemental
    Planes. They search those planes for fiendish enclaves, battle evil planar
    monsters such as xills, and act
  - >-
    as celestial liaisons to the genies and elementals. They have been known to
    broker temporary peace between warring elemental factions, often using their
    inherent magic to end hostilities long enough for negotiations to take
    place. In the armies of the good planes, they are leaders and officers, and
    after centuries of service to a deity, they may be transformed into astral
    devas.
  - >-
    Monadic devas like giving their maces names and proudly announcing them in
    battle with evil foes. Many of these weapons have seen battle for thousands
    of years and are quite battered. Younger devas may lend their weapons to
    good churches on the Material Plane so they can be used by great mortal
    heroes, though the angels eventually reclaim them after no more than a year
    and a day.
  - A monadic deva is 7 feet tall and weighs 220 pounds.
