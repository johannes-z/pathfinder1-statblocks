SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bend Bolt (Su)
    description: >-
      By expending one use of mythic power, a mythic blue dragon can bend the
      line of its breath weapon once up to 90 degrees, and cause any creature
      that fails its save against the breath weapon to be stunned for 1 round.
  - name: Desert Thirst (Su)
    description: >-
      A blue dragon can cast create water at will (CL equals its HD).
      Alternatively, it can destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot
      burst. Unattended liquids are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based
      magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must
      succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be destroyed. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Dust Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sand and dust swirls around a mythic blue dragon's body, attracted by its
      natural electrical charge. This provides the dragon with concealment but
      doesn't interfere with the dragon's senses or attacks in any way.
  - name: Persuasive Whisper (Sp)
    description: >-
      A mythic blue dragon can expend one use of mythic power to use charm
      person or suggestion. Its caster level for these abilities is equal to its
      Hit Dice.
  - name: Sound Imitation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has
      heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive
      check.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic blue dragon has powers over weaker minds, allowing it to inf luence
    events far from its lair. Its magic also inf luences sand and dust, giving
    it mastery over the aspects of its desert home.
