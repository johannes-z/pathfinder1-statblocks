Description:
  - >-
    This nasty water-dwelling creature is a particular bane to fisherfolk in
    tropical seas, occasionally getting caught up in their nets and striking
    angrily at unwary sailors as they spill their catch out onto the deck. The
    sea snake tends to follow schools of fish and pick off stragglers, choosing
    to hunt smaller prey instead of larger foes and only attacking more
    formidable enemies if it feels threatened. A sea snake's anatomy is
    particularly well adapted to its environment, and its single lung takes up
    its entire length.
  - The average sea snake is 4 feet long from tail to head and weighs 10 pounds.
