SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      An inverted giant can channel arcane energy into its fists whenever it
      makes a successful claw attack, dealing 1d6 points of energy damage (cold,
      electricity, or fire, chosen when the inverted giant attacks) in addition
      to the damage its claws normally deal.
  - name: Runes (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a rune giant is affected by a spell or spell-like ability, it can
      cause the runes covering its body to flash with light. All creatures
      within 10 feet of the giant must make a DC 21 Fortitude save or be blinded
      for 1 round. The saving throw is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Perhaps one of the most disturbing of the runelords' creations was the
    inverted giant, a hideous monstrosity created when a runelord was displeased
    with a particular giant minion. Through despicable arcana long lost to the
    ages, giants were ritually bound and transformed so that they would continue
    to live and think, but only as monstrous caricatures of themselves, their
    bodies turned inside out in the most painful and gruesome of punishments.
    Needless to say, few inverted giants tried their masters' patience again,
    and the unimaginable pain they suffered throughout the rest of their days
    served as a maddening punishment that would remind them of their insolence
    until their merciful deaths.
  - >-
    Before the Starstone fell and obliterated Thassilon, many of the runelords
    and their servants enchanted their inverted giant minions, freezing the
    tormented creatures in stasis so that centuries later they would continue to
    protect their masters' holdings, their mutilated organs providing sensory
    information among cunningly-looped entrails and viscera preserved by rune
    magic. Those who find themselves exploring Thassilonian dungeons and ruins
    sometimes stumble upon such horrors, inadvertently releasing the monsters
    and restoring them to raging life and madness, the pain of their mutilated
    bodies having long since driven them to insanity and burning hatred.
  - >-
    No two inverted giants look the same, though some features remain fairly
    consistent between them. Instead of a head, most possess little more than a
    gaping maw the size of their neck, jagged bones and bits of skull serving as
    teeth for a monstrous mouth. They have no true eyes-what oracular systems
    they once had are now embedded somewhere near their sternums-but instead
    possess an innate sense of direction, and through the dark arcana that
    surges through their beings they can sense the location of their prey
    perfectly. Their moist, splotched bodies are marked with runes, and their
    muscles and bones are often visible through their translucent flesh.
  - >-
    Inverted giants understand speech, but their deformed mouths rarely work
    well enough for them to be understood by others. The average inverted giant
    is over 20 feet tall and weighs 1,400 pounds.
