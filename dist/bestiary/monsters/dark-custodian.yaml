Description_Visual: >-
  A dark robed and hooded figure moves across the floor effortlessly, almost as
  if floating. Its hands are tucked away in the sleeves of its cassock, and
  where its face should be is only the blackness of the pit.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Devour (Su)
    description: >-
      Any living creature that is pinned by a dark custodian's grapple gains two
      negative levels per round that the hold is maintained rather than the
      standard one negative level of its energy drain. Any creature slain by the
      dark custodian's energy drain is left a steaming, bloody skeleton, all of
      its soft tissues having been consumed by the undead.
  - name: Incorporeal Grab (Su)
    description: >-
      If a dark custodian hits with an incorporeal touch, it can then attempt to
      start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
      opportunity. During the course of this grapple, the dark custodian becomes
      partially corporeal and its opponent becomes partially incorporeal. This
      has no game effect other than allowing the dark custodian to use its
      Strength bonus in its CMB. If it wins the grapple, it establishes a hold
      at which point its opponent becomes completely incorporeal, as well, along
      with the dark custodian. The dark custodian automatically begins to devour
      the held opponent each round he is held. The opponent remains incorporeal
      until he manages to break the grapple at which time he becomes immediately
      corporeal. If this occurs within a solid object, the opponent is
      forcefully ejected from the object's nearest surface, and the opponent
      takes 1d6 points of damage in the process. The dark custodian must then
      try to hit with its incorporeal touch attack again to try to reestablish
      the grapple. Once the dark custodian has an opponent pinned, it attempts
      to drag him away to devour him in peace.
  - name: Lifesense (Su)
    description: >-
      A dark custodian notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just
      as if it possessed the blindsight ability. It also senses the strength of
      their life force automatically, as if it had cast deathwatch. Walls less
      than 5 feet thick are no impediment to this ability.
  - name: Silence of the Grave (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action a dark custodian can use its silence of the grave
      ability. This creates a silence effect as the spell in a 20-foot radius
      for 7 rounds. This silent zone acts as a desecrate spell giving the dark
      custodian a +1 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls and saving
      throws, as well as, imposing a -3 profane penalty on turn checks. Any
      living creature within the area of affect must succeed on a DC 19 Will
      save or become dazed for 1 round. A new save is allowed each round. This
      is a sonic mind-affecting compulsion effect. Because it takes place in an
      area of silence, it cannot be counteracted by bardic music. A creature
      that successfully saves cannot be affected by the daze effect of the same
      dark custodian's silence of the grave for 24 hours. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)
    description: >-
      Dark custodians are powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight
      spell) and flee from it. A dark custodian caught in sunlight cannot attack
      and can take only a single move action or attack action in a round.
  - name: Unnatural Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Animals, whether wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of
      a dark custodian at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach
      nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as
      long as they are within that range.
Description:
  - >-
    Dark custodians are the undead remains of evil clerics tasked to remain
    behind after death and guard the sacred places of their vile worship. They
    hate all living things and seek to devour any who come within their guarded
    precincts. They do not require these feedings for sustenance but rather
    merely take pleasure in the carnage and brutality.
  - >-
    A dark custodian's true form is hidden beneath its ghostly burnoose with a
    lightless black void where its face should be. Only in combat are its hands
    seen, appearing pale with thickened, clawlike nails. They understand the
    languages they knew in life, but cannot speak.
  - >-
    A dark custodian prefers to attack from ambush, leaping through a solid wall
    to make an incorporeal grab before dragging its prey back through with it.
    When attacking in groups they usually surround their prey and use their
    silence of the grave abilities before trying to grab and drag individual
    opponents in different directions to be consumed.
