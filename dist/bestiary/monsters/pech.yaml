SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Earth Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A pech gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage bonus if both it and its foe
      are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the
      pech takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are
      not included in the statistics block.)
  - name: Light Blindness (Ex)
    description: >-
      Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as sunlight or a daylight spell)
      blinds a pech for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long
      as they remain in the affected area.
  - name: Stone Knowledge (Ex)
    description: >-
      The extensive knowledge of stone that a pech possesses grants it a +1
      racial bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures made of stone or
      earth (such as earth elementals, stone golems, and so on).
Description:
  - >-
    A pech is a fey creature believed to have its origins on the Elemental Plane
    of Earth. On the Material Plane, pechs dwell deep underground in places
    rarely even seen by dwarves, drow, or other subterranean races. They are
    excellent stonemasons and are sometimes employed by other subterranean races
    for their skill at stoneworking (if such subterranean races can actually
    find the pech's lair). They are generally an isolated race and rarely
    venture far from their lairs. Pechs never wear armor and most are arrayed in
    nothing more than a simple loincloth of brown or black fur. Pechs speak
    Terran. Some pechs speak Common or Undercommon as well. Pechs are generally
    noncombative, preferring to avoid such encounters if possible. If forced
    into combat, a pech relies on its pick and spell-like abilities to dispatch
    its opponents. Multiple pechs often work in concert with one another using
    their wall of stone ability to instantly erect a barrier that either traps
    their opponents or allows the pechs a means of escape. Credit The Pech
