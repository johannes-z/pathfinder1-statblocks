Description_Visual: >-
  The water churns and splashes as a small, stocky humanoid surges forth,
  gnashing rows of needle-like teeth, its eye sockets merely deep gouges. As if
  it were one with the water itself, it darts quickly forward, shouting curses
  and swinging its fists.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: s Torment (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a tikoloshe can curse another living creature. As a standard
      action, the tikoloshe makes a melee touch attack and unless the target
      makes a DC 15 Will save, the target is treated as if under the effect of
      bestow curse, except that the curse's duration is only 24 hours. A
      creature can only suffer from one tikoloshe's curse at a time. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
  - name: Water Diffusion (Ex)
    description: >-
      When in water at least 2 feet deep, a tikoloshe's body seems to diffuse
      into and become part of the water, granting it concealment (20% miss
      chance) as if under the effect of blur. This effect ends immediately upon
      entering shallower water or setting foot on land.
  - name: Waverider (Ex)
    description: >-
      Up to 3 times per day, a tikoloshe can swim up to 30 feet as a swift
      action. It does not provoke an attack of opportunity for this movement.
Description:
  - >-
    Cruel and spiteful, tikoloshe (singular and plural) are small undead that
    haunt tropical waterways and jungles, preying on travelers and villagers
    alike with their magical abilities and appetite for harm. Tikoloshe stand no
    higher than a gnome or a human child, but their bodies are dense and
    muscular; many have large potbellies and arms long enough for their knuckles
    to score the dirt as they walk. Their creation leaves them with blackened,
    eyeless sockets, but tikoloshe can "see" using their giant, bat-like ears.
    Their skin is smooth and shines whether wet or dry. Tikoloshe are
    genderless; they stand about 4 feet tall and weigh almost 150 pounds.
    Ecology Tikoloshe are created from the corpses of the dead, but are not
    mindless like some zombies or skeletons. Creating a tikoloshe requires a
    ritual wherein a spellcaster places a newly dead humanoid body in a
    specially crafted clay basin of shallow water and then bores a hole through
    the corpse's eyes with a red-hot poker. As the creator casts magical fire
    through this aperture, the surrounding water is rapidly drawn into the body.
    As it does, the corpse shrinks and changes, casting off all vestiges of its
    former features and replacing them with those of all tikoloshe. The conf
    licting forces of fire and water animate the tikoloshe and instill it with
    its well-known hostility. The tikoloshe's creator can exact one service from
    its new creation, but afterward has no control over the creature. A
    tikoloshe's undead traits and resistance to fire make it an ideal servant
    for many tasks. Some are forced to mine rare minerals deep underwater or to
    capture exotic elemental creatures on fiery planes. Other creators use
    tikoloshe as sinister pawns to curse or even kill hated adversaries. Once
    released from servitude, tikoloshe prefer to inhabit waterways and shallow
    seabeds where they can rest undisturbed and where they can surprise
    travelers, fisherfolk, and swimmers. When partially submerged, a tikoloshe's
    body merges with the surrounding water, making it difficult to see and
    battle. When not near water, tikoloshe dwell in shallow holes under rocks
    and large trees, and even under porches and raised buildings in small
    villages. While their bodies do not require food to sustain themselves,
    tikoloshe enjoy stalking and eating smaller creatures like birds, frogs, and
    rabbits. They particularly relish killing monkeys, as they enjoy the nearly
    human screams the unfortunate animals make. Tikoloshe will sometimes make
    ghastly fetishes of their kills and leave them on the fences or doorsteps of
    local settlements to hint at their presence and cause fear among those they
    seek to torment. As a result, many jungle tribes place rare or semiprecious
    stones on the thresholds of their homes as an offering for tikoloshe to eat,
    claiming that doing so protects that home against the creature's wrath.
    Although some scholars dismiss such practices as abject superstition, druids
    and clerics of the Mwangi Expanse assert that by ingesting a potent fragment
    of earth, tikoloshe are able to soothe the opposing elemental forces within
    them and thus still their malevolent nature. Habitat & Society Tikoloshe
    form gangs and clans whenever possible, knowing that their ability to cause
    mayhem is greater in numbers. Individually, they haunt inhabited areas using
    their invisibility to cause strange, uncanny incidents like unlocking doors
    to animal pens, moving and breaking household objects, and spoiling food.
    Tikoloshe often use their curse to bestow bad luck on those that they haunt.
    Watching from their invisible perches, from beneath beds, and even from
    inside closets and cupboards, the tikoloshe take spiteful glee in observing
    those whom they have rendered suddenly clumsy, weak, or otherwise inept as
    they fumble even the simplest of tasks. Many tikoloshe use their powers for
    more than mischief, however, and can prove a serious threat to both
    residents and travelers of the Mwangi Expanse. When fighting as a pack or
    clan, tikoloshe use their rapid swimming to close with foes, quickly
    swarming a single target and dragging it underwater. On land, groups of
    tikoloshe use invisibility to get close to opponents, seeking to curse as
    many enemies as possible before losing the element of surprise. They are
    cunning enough to use physically debilitating curses on heavily armed folk
    and mind-harming curses on those who they think might be spellcasters.
    Individual tikoloshe always try to flee when faced with organized
    resistance. If tracked or cornered, tikoloshe plead for their lives by
    offering a service to their captors, usually the same one that was exacted
    from them upon their creation. Those who accept a tikoloshe's offer may
    indeed benefit from the creature's service, but they must also be very
    cautious, as tikoloshe are not bound by any promises they make once their
    original commitment to their creator has been fulfilled. Cunning tikoloshe
    are known to barter their services for their lives, but only to buy enough
    time for their new masters to turn their backs. Variant Tikoloshe Depending
    on the ritual used and the quality of the materials, some tikoloshe look
    different than the standard dwarf-gremlin variety. Some look like horrid
    Small werebears in hybrid form, or like a worm-like creature with a dog's
    head and golden tongue. These variants may or may not have the burned-out
    eyeholes of the "standard" tikoloshe. Creating Tikoloshe The process of
    creating a tikoloshe is more complex than for animating most undead
    creatures, but requires the same fundamental magic. Ultimately, the creation
    process culminates in the casting of the spell create undead. In addition to
    the normal components of the spell, creating a tikoloshe requires the
    equipment and process previously noted, adding 1 day of effort and 100 gold
    pieces to the typical requirements of the spell. Typically, a caster loses
    control over a tikoloshe after the undead performs one service for him,
    though creators of level 15 or higher retain control. Tikoloshe in Mythology
    The tikoloshe is an evil zombie or water spirit depicted as a trickster in
    tales throughout Southern Africa. Able to hurl curses and turn invisible by
    swallowing pebbles, tikoloshe are described as playing all manner of
    poltergeist-like tricks on people, although some tales depict them
    assaulting sleeping women or biting off toes during the night, giving the
    creatures a more sinister quality. Descriptions of the tikoloshe vary from
    myth to myth, but most emphasize its gremlin-like features, small stature,
    and the burned-out holes where its eyes should be. Cultural historians claim
    that the latter links the creature definitively to Zulu mythology because of
    the importance of fire in most Zulu legends. To this day, the tikoloshe is
    synonymous with misfortune, and the creature's name is invoked whenever a
    person suffers bad luck.
