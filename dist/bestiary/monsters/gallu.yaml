Description_Visual: >-
  This horned, winged, wolf-headed demon has bone-white flesh onto which have
  been riveted plates of spiky armor.
Group: Demon
Source: The Worldwound
IsTemplate: 0
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Armor Plating (Su)
    description: >-
      The armor plates covering much of a gallu's body grant it a +8 armor
      bonus. They also function as armor spikes during grapples, but cannot be
      used as off-hand weapons. In addition, these armor plates can possess one
      additional armor special ability chosen from the following options: acid
      resistance 20, cold resistance 20, fire resistance 20, ghost touch,
      moderate fortification, or sonic resistance 20. A gallu demon can switch
      the active armor special quality once per hour as a swift action-as a
      general rule, the gallu demon keeps the armor plating set to moderate
      fortification. These armor plates do not encumber the gallu or impose
      armor check penalties, maximum Dex bonuses, or arcane spell failure
      chances. They cannot be removed, sundered, or destroyed while the gallu
      lives, and they rust away into nonmagical fragments of iron upon the
      gallu's death.
  - name: Aura of Havoc (Su)
    description: >-
      A gallu's presence wreaks havoc, infusing battlefields with elements of
      chaos and entropy that disrupt careful coordination and tactical plotting
      by manipulating fate and chance. This aura extends to a 30-foot radius
      around the gallu. The aid another action can never grant bonuses in this
      area, nor does flanking grant bonuses to hit in the affected area
      (although flanked foes remain susceptible to sneak attack damage). A
      creature summoned into this area by any creature other than a demon must
      succeed at a DC 26 Will save to avoid being confused for 1d4 rounds.
      Paladins and creatures with the lawful subtype must make a DC 26 Will save
      each round they begin their turn in this aura to avoid being nauseated for
      1 round. Demons ignore the effects of a gallu's aura of havoc. The save
      DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Rain of Blood (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once per minute, a gallu can command the wounds of
      all creatures within 30 feet to erupt into a gory deluge of blood; any
      wounded creature in the area of effect immediately takes 3d6 points of
      damage from the rain of blood and must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude saving
      throw. Failure indicates that the damage becomes bleed damage and the
      affected creature becomes staggered from the pain as long as the bleed
      damage continues. Creatures that are immune to bleed damage are immune to
      this ability's effects. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Wounding Blood (Su)
    description: >-
      The spikes that hold a gallu's armor plates in place extend as far into
      the demon's body as they do outside of it, causing rivulets of blood to
      constantly run from the creature's flesh. This continual bleeding does not
      inconvenience or harm the gallu; instead, it grants the wounding special
      ability to all manufactured weapons wielded by the gallu. The dripping
      blood does not affect the gallu's natural attacks.
Description:
  - >-
    On the endless battlefields of the Abyss, the demon lords' vast armies clash
    and tear at each other in horrific displays of warfare and bloodshed. These
    conflicts often
  - >-
    arise from border disputes between demonic realms, or when one demon lord
    finds an excuse to attack another. But many of these immense wars have no
    good reason at all, for gallus eagerly foment war for war's sake; they are
    master engineers of martial strife. These hateful, destructive demons arise
    from the souls of warmongers and war profiteers-nefarious leaders, corrupt
    priests, or subversive merchants who used their power to perpetuate existing
    wars or even to trigger new ones, all for the express purpose of personal
    gain or sadistic pleasure.
  - >-
    Known to some as warmonger demons, the gallus are not as enormous as many of
    the other powerful demons; despite their near-human size, however, they are
    among the deadliest of demonkind. Standing 8 feet tall and weighing 450
    pounds, these creatures have wolf like (but hairless) horned heads, batlike
    wings, and pale flesh. Their feet end in hooves, and their tails resemble
    those of lions. Gallus can assume humanoid shape as well, and typically do
    so when interacting with mortals, allowing them to more easily sow seeds of
    war among those they interact with.
  - >-
    These demons are relatively difficult to summon- gate spells can conjure
    them from the Abyss, but few other mortal spells can call them forth. As a
    result, most gallus encountered outside the Abyss have traveled there via
    portals or similar methods. Gallus are innately crafty creatures; when
    coming to a new world, they resist their natural urges to destroy in favor
    of infiltration. Extraordinarily patient, they can spend decades or more in
    disguise as they subtly build their inf luence and acquire positions of
    power; they then use those positions to incite government officials and
    other powerful individuals to wage war on their neighbors. Only when the
    hostilities have completely devastated their host, leaving it in smoking
    ruins, do gallus shed their human flesh and appear in their true form to
    gloat and torment the conflict's few survivors before moving on to seek
    fresh victims.
  - >-
    In the Worldwound, gallus serve an additional role as commanders in the
    numerous demonic armies. Many control multiple divisions, each led by a
    marilith general, and report in turn to one of the Worldwound's leaders,
    like Khorramzadeh, Areelu, or Aponavicius. But not all of the Worldwound's
    gallus command armies. Those who serve Baphomet primarily utilize their
    deceptive natures to infiltrate various Mendevian mercenary orders, Mammoth
    Lord barbarian tribes, settlements on the fringes of more civilized lands,
    and other factions arrayed against the Worldwound. From within those groups,
    they serve as advisors, urging those they've infiltrated into launching
    ill-timed or poorly planned attacks on their demonic foes. These gallus
    occasionally feed their humanoid "allies" legitimate intelligence about
    demonic fortifications or troop movements, knowing that a little truth can
    go a long way in encouraging mortals to act upon their more violent urges.
