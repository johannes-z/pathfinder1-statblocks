SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Alien Dread (Su)
    description: >-
      A neshmaal's presence is deeply disturbing. Any creature that comes within
      20 feet of a neshmaal must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or become shaken
      for 2d4 rounds. If a creature is within the auras of multiple neshmaals,
      only a single save is required, but the save DC increases by 2 for each
      additional neshmaal (for example, the presence of two neshmaals increases
      the usual save DC to 25). Arcane spellcasters are especially vulnerable to
      this aura. The DC to cast spells defensively within the aura increases by
      4, and the neshmaal can make an attack of opportunity against an arcane
      caster who fails to cast defensively. This secondary effect occurs even if
      the arcane caster succeeded at her save against the shaken condition. Once
      a creature is exposed to a neshmaal's aura, it is immune to this effect
      for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Dominate Person (Sp)
    description: >-
      A neshmaal can dominate only one target at a time when using its dominate
      person spell-like ability. If a neshmaal uses its dominate person
      spell-like ability on a new target while already dominating another
      creature, the previous target is immediately released from the neshmaal's
      control. This occurs whether or not the new attempt is successful.
  - name: Kiss of the Void (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a neshmaal may forgo using energy drain on one of its
      three tendril attacks in a round and instead imbue the touch with the icy
      coldness of deep space. This attack deals an additional 6d6 points of cold
      damage and paralyzes the target for 1d4-1 rounds. A successful DC 23
      Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the paralysis. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Vulnerability to Sonic (Su)
    description: >-
      Neshmaals are native to the noiseless void of deep space or their own
      alien dimension and, as a result, are especially vulnerable to sonic
      damage. Magical attacks that cause sonic damage bypass the neshmaal's
      spell resistance, and they take half again as much damage (+50%) on a
      failed save (normal full damage on a successful save). If a neshmaal fails
      a saving throw against an effect that deals sonic damage, it has a 25%
      chance of being stunned for 1 round.
Description:
  - >-
    The vast, dark spaces between the stars hold horrors aplenty, skulking in
    the unholy blackness with their aberrant desires and unspeakable appetites.
    Some of these beings exist simultaneously in two worlds, half in the
    emptiness of space and half in some other dimension of which mortals dare
    not even dream. The neshmaals are such a race, aliens of such inscrutable
    malice and hunger that even most other denizens of the darkness avoid them.
    These strange beings view the humanoids populating the universe as either
    cattle to eat or playthings to manipulate like marionettes.
  - >-
    A neshmaal's body is formed of a tangle of writhing tentacles that is
    roughly 9 feet across. As they are incorporeal outside of their home
    dimension, the creatures have no weight.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Neshmaals are incorporeal in the Material Plane. They may be corporeal in
    their own dimension, but no one has journeyed there and returned to verify
    this. In the Material Plane, neshmaals spend most of their time in the empty
    darkness of deep space, where extremes of temperature are commonplace and
    the varieties of weather found on terrestrial worlds have
  - >-
    no impact on these strange creatures. Due to this exceptional form of
    adaptation, neshmaals can be found virtually anywhere. Neshmaals have no
    need to breathe, so they are unaffected by inhaled poisons and can dwell
    underwater without restriction. Despite their many immunities and
    resistances, they are especially vulnerable to damage from sonic attacks,
    perhaps because they are accustomed to the silence of the void. Since
    outsiders don't normally need to eat, the neshmaals' ravenous hunger for the
    energy of all living creatures suggests that they manifest in the Material
    Plane only to gain sustenance. Neshmaals satisfy this hunger by draining the
    life force from living creatures, though it's assumed they also derive some
    nourishment from psychic energies from sentient beings as well, fear in
    particular.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Neshmaals, which exist at once on the Material Plane and in a dimension of
    their own, seem to have no interest in congress with other species, though
    they speak passable Aklo and possess telepathy. What little information
    exists about their culture is contradictory, though their endless appetites
    for raw life force support the theory that they are scavengers created by
    the Great Old Ones to cleanse worlds of sentience.
  - >-
    Neshmaals are occasionally found in the service of much more powerful
    otherworldly beings from the Dark Tapestry. Some scholars believe these
    creatures to be agents of the mysterious Dominion of the Black. This is a
    reasonable assumption, as they have similar inscrutable methodologies to the
    creatures that make up the Dominion, and neshmaals have been recorded in
    texts that deal with various creatures that make up the Dominion of the
    Black. The role neshmaals might play in that dark hierarchy is unclear.
  - >-
    Humanoid conjurers on the Material Plane have summoned these inscrutable
    beings to gain knowledge of the inky depths of the universe and beyond,
    though doing so places the conjurer's sanity in terrible jeopardy. The
    process is maddening, and the conjurer's safety is not diminished once the
    neshmaal is called to service. Attempting to obtain the service of a
    neshmaal is very dangerous, unless such service aligns with the neshmaal's
    goals, and only the mad can discern the nature of those goals. Neshmaals
    constantly modify the original agreement, and they often manipulate those
    they serve. A neshmaal's most common request is a never-ending chain of
    humanoids for them to drain of their life force.
  - >-
    It's unusual to find more than a few of these otherworldly creatures in one
    place, making it difficult to calculate their total numbers. Neshmaals
    employ telepathy to communicate with others of their kind; while doing so,
    they intertwine their tentacles and tendrils in a manic, lascivious embrace.
    The book Secrets of the Dreaming Dark (which is thankfully rare) provides
    the ritual to summon neshmaals. The tome also reports that neshmaals are
    somehow connected to, seeking, or fleeing from something cryptically
    referred to as the "Black Alluvion Dream." Even occult scholars,
    astronomers, and other seekers of secrets tend to steer clear of this
    esoteric and dangerous topic, given that those few who have pursued its
    study now occupy carefully guarded cells in asylums across the Inner Sea
    Region.
