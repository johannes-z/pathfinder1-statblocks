Description:
  - >-
    More so than its smaller kin, the human-sized giant porcupine is a
    foul-tempered creature that is just as content chewing on carrion as on
    living creatures. Worse, giant porcupines are notorious in their almost
    foolhardy bravery, and have been known to attack creatures much larger than
    their own size. This unexpected aggression, when combined with their tangle
    of spearlike quills, makes the giant porcupine a dangerous foe.
