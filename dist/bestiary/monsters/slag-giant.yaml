Description:
  - >-
    Magically crafted and crossbred from fire giants and stone giants by ancient
    wizards, slag giants are among the foremost artisans and crafters of
    giantkind. Proportioned more like stone giants than fire giants, slag giants
    have long limbs with lean muscles; they stand 14 feet tall and weigh 3,000
    pounds. Slag giants' skin color ranges from a deep and ruddy hue to a rusty
    orange. Their hair is black, gray, or white, though males and females both
    tend to keep their hair cropped close or shaved off. Slag giants can live to
    be 400 years old. Slag giants usually evince a cold, detached attitude about
    everything other than their work. Their inherent understanding of
    metalworking and resistance to fire allow them to craft arms and armor from
    inside their huge forges, sometimes working the metal with their bare hands.
    Small families of slag giants often ally with clans of other giants,
    providing masterwork armor and weapons in exchange for ore and the freedom
    to practice their crafting skills in peace. Even militaristic fire giants
    (who pride themselves on their strength and martial prowess) respect the
    fine work of the weaker slag giants, and usually attempt to ally with the
    artisans rather than enslaving them. Slag giant settlements usually consist
    of several stone homes (built from or surrounded by forge slag) with
    built-in forges and large, smoking chimneys. Most are in hills or mountains,
    but they can be found anywhere there is a ready supply of iron ore. Although
    they prefer creation to combat, slag giants are brutal and efficient
    fighters, capable of destroying an enemy's weapons or armor in a few precise
    blows. They often let opponents retreat if it gives the giants the
    opportunity to collect any broken weapons and armor as salvage. If
    approached peacefully, they are willing to barter or sell their goods,
    though they usually don't have human-sized items on hand. Trespassers who
    carelessly or wantonly destroy a slag giant's work or foul its forge usually
    end up in the fire. Most settlements have several giant-sized breastplates
    the residents can don if they expect a serious fight.
