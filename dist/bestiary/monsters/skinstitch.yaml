    description: >-

  - name: Repair (Ex)
    description: >-
      A skinstitch can repair itself by sewing additional fabric, leather, or
      hide to its body. Doing so requires at least 1 square foot of material and
      a full-round action, which restores 1 hit point to the skinstitch.
Description:
  - >-
    A skinstitch is a crude construct made of cloth, leather, hides, and skins
    sewn together into a roughly ogre-like shape and stuffed with hay.
    Skinstitches are usually created by a spellcaster lacking the power, talent,
    or gold to craft a flesh golem. A skinstitch's stuffing juts out of gaps in
    the sewing and the mouths and eye-holes of its component faces, giving it a
    horrifying, ragged look. Swarms of vermin and other creatures often find
    refuge within the straw, and the magic of this construct grants swarms
    nesting within its body amazing regenerative powers. Despite its appearance,
    a skinstitch is strong, tough, and agile, though its components make it
    susceptible to fire.
