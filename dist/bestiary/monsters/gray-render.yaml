  - name: Double Damage Against Objects (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gray render that makes a full attack against an object or structure
      deals double damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Standing over 9 feet tall and weighing in excess of 4,000 pounds, a gray
    render is a solitary and savage predator. Renders are gifted with immense
    strength, and some reports claim to have witnessed a gray render uprooting a
    fully grown tree and tearing it to splinters in order to catch prey hiding
    within.
  - >-
    Gray renders actively avoid forming groups or communities with their own
    kind, and perhaps only tolerate the presence of other renders when it is
    time to mate. Some sages claim they are asexual, but it is more likely they
    are hermaphrodites able to self-fertilize, and reproduce only rarely.
  - >-
    Despite its solitary existence, a gray render often develops an affectionate
    bond with other creatures, typically a herd of herbivores or a small tribe
    of humanoids, but in some cases a solitary denizen of its swamp. The render
    acts as a guardian for this creature or creatures, never straying more than
    a mile away, running to protect them if they are attacked, and providing an
    offering of meat once each day, as might a domesticated cat. A gray render
    never harms its protected creatures, and retreats in confusion if they
    attack it. Most animal "pets" grow to accept its presence, and primitive
    humanoid "pets" often believe their guardian is a sign of favor from the
    gods. A render's bond may last from a few months to as long as 10 years,
    after which it wanders to a new territory and ignores its former favorites.
  - >-
    Renders are generally not malicious, and only attack if hungry or if they or
    their pets are threatened. A render protecting its pets fights to the death.
