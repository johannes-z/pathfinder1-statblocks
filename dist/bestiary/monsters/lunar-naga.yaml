      Once per day, by weaving and coiling its body and hissing as a standard
      action, a lunar naga can cause its scales to shimmer and glow with
      moonlike radiance. All creatures within 30 feet who can see the naga must
      make a DC 17 Will save to avoid becoming fascinated. The lunar naga can
      maintain this fascination effect as long as it concentrates; fascinated
      creatures follow the still-glowing naga if it moves as long as it
      maintains the effect by concentrating. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Description:
  - >-
    Lunar nagas are patient watchers of the night sky. They enjoy cosmology and
    believe strongly in astrology, maintaining a handful of complex zodiacs. A
    few lunar nagas even bear knowledge of the unspeakable things from the dark
    spaces between the stars. A lunar naga stretches over 10 feet from its pale
    face to the tip of its tail, and weighs close to 200 pounds.
  - >-
    Nocturnal creatures, lunar nagas often live in ruined towers or atop
    mountains-any place open to the sky at night. There they peer through
    astrological devices, closely monitoring passing celestial markers, eager to
    decipher more of the universe. Those living underground make nightly trips
    to the open sky when they can. Cloudy nights make lunar nagas agitated, and
    a creature is more likely to run afoul of a lunar naga on these dark
    evenings.
  - >-
    Lunar nagas sometimes lead small cults of sky-watchers. These followers aid
    the nagas in recording tome upon tome of calculations of the stars and
    planets moving through the inky black of the night sky. In small doses
    tempered with water, fruit juices, and alcohol, lunar naga venom is mildly
    hallucinogenic. The nagas' cultist allies often take the substance as a
    ritualistic drug.
