Description_Visual: >-
  This creature appears to be a decayed humanoid whose body still shows signs of
  trauma. Its flesh, where it still exists, is pulled tight over its skeletal
  frame. Its eyes are now hollow sockets of darkness.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Grip (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bhuta deals 1d8+5 points of damage with a successful grapple check each
      round the hold is maintained. Because it seizes its victim by the throat,
      a creature in its grasp cannot speak or cast spells with verbal
      components.
  - name: Find Target (Sp)
    description: >-
      So long as the bhuta and its killer are on the same plane of existence, it
      can find its target unerringly as though guided by discern location
      (caster level 9th).
  - name: Gentle Repose (Ex)
    description: >-
      When it first rises from the dead, a bhuta is preserved as if by gentle
      repose for a period of 14 days. After that time, its body begins to decay
      and it takes on an appearance similar to that of a ghoul or zombie.
Description:
  - >-
    When a person is murdered, the spirit sometimes clings to the Material
    Plane, refusing to accept its mortal death. This spirit possesses its
    original body and seeks out those responsible for its murder. It will never
    rest until those responsible are sought out and slain.
  - >-
    Since the transformation into unlife is almost instant (occurring within 1-2
    hours after death), the bhuta appears as it did in life. Close inspection
    (DC 16 Perception check) reveals slight decay, and the body still shows
    signs of any trauma suffered prior to death (wounds, disease, burns, or the
    like), but outwardly, the bhuta for the most part appears as a normal
    creature of its race. In its undead state, the bhuta sustains itself on a
    diet of flesh, preferring that of humans and elves.
  - >-
    A bhuta attacks with its claws in combat. If facing its killers, it uses its
    death grip attack on the one who actually killed it (the one who delivered
    the killing blow) and usually only releases its hold when either it or its
    target is dead. If combat goes against it, a bhuta does not hesitate to
    retreat, picking a more opportune time in the future to exact its revenge.
