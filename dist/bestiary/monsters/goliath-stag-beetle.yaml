Description:
  - >-
    Making its home in tropical and subtropical forests across the globe, the
    goliath beetle is among the largest species of giant beetle. While its
    diminutive cousins are primarily herbivores, the goliath stag beetle is
    carnivorous, hunting herd animals, humanoids, and even giants with ease.
    They typically use their trample attack against creatures smaller than
    themselves, returning after this punishing assault to pick off anything
    that's still moving with swift and deadly bites.
  - A goliath stag beetle is 25 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds.
