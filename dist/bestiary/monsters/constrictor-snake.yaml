Description:
  - >-
    Be they jungle-dwelling pythons or swampdwelling boas like the anaconda,
    constrictor snakes are among the most deadly predatory animals of the
    tropical wilds.
  - >-
    Fortunately, these large snakes are relatively passive, save for when they
    are preparing to shed their skins or are particularly hungry. Nevertheless,
    the sinuous creatures are held in fear by many societies who often ascribe
    fiendish qualities to them.
  - The constrictor snake presented here is a relatively small one.
