Description_Visual: >-
  Slithering from the snow emerges a 40-foot long serpent with glossy-white
  scales and a bluish-white underbelly, its long, slender, icy-blue tongue
  flickering. Its vertical-slit pupils glow an otherworldly greenish-blue and
  rows of sharpened teeth line tremendous mouth.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Paralyzing Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Paralysis 1d6 +4 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 22 negates. The save is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Paralysis (Su)
    description: >-
      Alternately, a slorath can use its Gaze to Ray feat to release a ray of
      paralysis (range of 30 ft.) as a ranged touch attack. After using its gaze
      attack in this manner, the slorath cannot use its paralyzing gaze for 1d4
      rounds and it is disoriented during this time (-2 penalty on attack rolls,
      saves, skill checks, and ability checks). The save is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The great sloraths are found only in the coldest and most desolate regions,
    though close enough to civilization to hunt and stage raids against humanoid
    settlements when the slorath goes hunting. Highly intelligent and aware, the
    slorath is a fierce predator that defends its hunting ground with precision
    tactics and power. Small villages within a slorath's territory sometimes
    strike deals with these creatures; offering sacrifices in return for the
    protection the slorath can offer.
  - >-
    Slorath are generally nocturnal carnivores. They exist on a diet of white
    dragons, polar bears, frost men (see entry in this book), and barbegazi (see
    entry in this book). They are particularly fond of white dragon meat and
    often go out of their way to hunt for such creatures. Frost giants often
    strike deals with frost giants so it is not uncommon for the two to be
    encountered together working toward a common goal.
  - >-
    Slorath lairs are either enormous tunnels deep under the ice and snow or
    abandoned white dragon lairs. Encounters are almost always with a solitary
    creature. In rare instances young sloraths or eggs might be found in a lair.
    Young slorath resemble their parent in all respects. Slorath eggs are stark
    white in color.
  - >-
    A slorath usually begins an encounter by hiding under the snow waiting for
    prey to wander by, or by lying unmoving on the snow itself where its
    coloration offers it camouflage against the white background. When prey
    comes within range, the slorath assaults it with its paralyzing gaze.
  - >-
    Helpless creatures are then attacked with its powerful bite. Those that
    attempt to avoid its gaze witness the slorath project its gaze as a ray of
    blue energy (using the Gaze to Ray feat).
  - >-
    Continued aggression against a slorath results in it unleashing a cone of
    cold or ice storm on its foes. If faced with particularly powerful foes, it
    uses its ice storm and glacial storm special abilities. A slorath does not
    fight to the death and flees if combat goes against it. Note however, if
    young slorath are present and they are threatened, a slorath fights to the
    death.
