SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a myrmecoleon is slain, its body explodes, releasing the acids that
      churn within it. All creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst take 4d8 acid
      damage (Reflex DC 20 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Scalding Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a myrmecoleon can eject a 60-foot cone of acidic
      chemicals from its mouth. Creatures caught in the blast take 8d6 points of
      acid damage and are blinded for 10 minutes (Reflex DC 20 half damage and
      negates blindness). Following the initial blast, the chemicals vaporize
      into a thick and noxious cloud 20 feet high with a 40-foot radius. Within
      the cloud, all sight is obscured beyond 5 feet. Furthermore, any living
      creature within the area of effect must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save
      or become nauseated for as long as it remains in the cloud and for 1d4+1
      rounds after it leaves the cloud. Any creature that succeeds at its save
      but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on the
      myrmecoleon's turn. This is a poison effect. The save DCs for this ability
      are Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    This monstrous, insectlike beast resembles a huge beetle with gleaming black
    armored plates. Around its head and neck the chitin forms a great mane of
    jagged spikes. Its insides swirl with acidic juices. Myrmecoleons live in
    remote areas where they claim large territories of wilderness as their
    hunting grounds. They're often drawn to far-f lung ancient ruins and sites
    of mythic power, and sometimes act as guardians of such places. This has led
    some sages to theorize that some myrmecoleons aren't born but are
    spontaneously created by sites thrumming with mythic power. These creatures
    only rarely interact with others of their kind-and these interactions
    usually end in brutal and destructive death matches. Myrmecoleons are
    cannibals and readily eat those they defeat. When fighting, these insects
    put on great displays to intimidate rivals or other threats. Myrmecoleons
    are known to roll in the corpses of their prey, impaling the bodies upon
    their carapaces and leaving them there to rot. Why they perform this
    gruesome act remains unknown. Those who have studied the creature to
    understand its r u d ime nt a r y i nt e l l i g enc e hypothesi ze that it
    might be some sort of a display to showcase its strength to others of its
    kind, or even be one part of an elaborate mating ritual.
