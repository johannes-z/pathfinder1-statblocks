      A chicken flies in short bursts, and can't use its fly speed to hover.
      When it flies, a chicken must end its move action by landing or perching
      on a solid surface.
Description:
  - >-
    While not particularly useful to travelers as combatants, chickens are
    prized for the hearty breakfast meals they provide if properly fed and cared
    for. Chickens are highly social creatures that raise their young communally.
    They're picky about the spots where they roost, and a hen rarely strays from
    a particular nest once she's laid her eggs there. A fertilized chicken egg
    hatches into a chick after roughly 3 weeks of incubation.
  - >-
    In addition to their quick reproductive cycles, chickens have the ability to
    thrive on simple foods, and they are valued in both rural farming
    communities and metropolitan areas for their delicious and nutrient-rich
    eggs and meat. A hen bred for laying eggs can produce up to one egg every 24
    hours.
