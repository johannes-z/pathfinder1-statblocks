    description: >-
      A mountain troll gains a +4 racial bonus on all Will saving throws. In
      addition, if the troll fails a saving throw against a charm or compulsion
      effect, it can immediately attempt a second saving throw against the same
      effect on the next round to end the duration of the effect early.
Description:
  - >-
    Though grotesque, charmless, and prone to fits of violence, mountain trolls
    are not inherently evil, nor do they always attack intruders on sight. A
    mountain troll prefers to withdraw and observe before entering combat,
    lumbering forth to attack only if intruders make clear their intentions to
    harm it or its allies, or if the newcomers seem to be encroaching upon the
    troll's territory rather than simply passing through. Once enraged, a
    mountain troll is a savage opponent, calling upon its native strength and
    alliances with elementals to bury its opponents in stone or spread their
    entrails across the slopes.

    Mountain trolls prefer to live in narrow ravines or shallow caves that allow
    them to look out over the landscape. They sometimes knuckle-walk like a
    gorilla, but when angered they rear up to their full height of nearly 30
    feet.
  - >-
    Mountain trolls have a close association with the First World, similar to
    that possessed by gnomes, which grants them magical abilities and unusual
    patience. They are quick to forge alliances with fey, and while they see
    smaller trolls as sadists, they nonetheless feel a sort of familial
    responsibility. Lesser trolls often capitalize upon mountain trolls'
    generosity, but take care to abide by their larger cousins' rules when
    sheltering in their homes. Mountain trolls have even been known to aid
    explorers or give advice, provided they are treated with respect.
