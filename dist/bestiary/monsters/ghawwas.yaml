  - name: Rough Hide (Ex)

      Ghawwas have rough hides studded with jagged barbs and spiny protrusions.
      Any creature striking a ghawwas with a natural weapon or an unarmed strike
      takes 1d6 points of slashing and piercing damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Full of poison and treachery, ghawwas foul the seas and seek to bring ruin
    to those who dwell there. Ghawwas resemble a mixture of hulking humanoid,
    prehistoric fish, and poisonous bottom-feeder. While most ghawwas live in
    salt water, they sometimes teleport to oases to defile them or suck them
    dry. Although they see all mortals as enemies, ghawwas bear a particular
    grudge against peaceable, water-breathing creatures such as merfolk and
    locathah.
  - >-
    All ghawwas find the tolling of bells insufferable, the sound filling them
    with rage and driving them to seek out the source and destroy either the
    bell or those ringing it.
  - The typical ghawwas stands 12 feet tall and weighs close to 1,200 pounds.
