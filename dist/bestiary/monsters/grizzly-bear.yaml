Description:
  - >-
    A large, powerful omnivore, the grizzly bear inhabits many of the world's
    forested hills. Equally happy consuming nuts, berries, fish, or small
    mammals, the grizzly is nonetheless fiercely territorial, and will chase
    off-or, failing that, kill and eat-any intruders it views as competition.
  - >-
    When faced with a foe or small group of threats, the grizzly attempts to
    subdue or kill with its claws.
  - >-
    When it can, the bear tries to grab a single target to deal continual damage
    until that target is dead, unconscious, or escapes.
