  - name: Shell Retreat (Ex)
    description: >-
      A turtle can retreat within its shell as a swift action, gaining a +2
      enhancement bonus to its existing natural armor. While in its shell, a
      turtle cannot take any action except to end the retreat. The turtle can
      end its retreat with a free action on its turn.
Description:
  - >-
    Turtles are slow-moving reptiles with hard shells that they can retreat into
    when threatened. Many turtles have flippers and are better suited for
    swimming than walking.
  - >-
    These statistics can also be used for tortoises, which have feet instead of
    flippers and live in arid regions.
