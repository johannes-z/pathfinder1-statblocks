    Most giant toads live in dryer areas after maturing, returning to the water
    only to mate and give birth.
  - >-
    Giant toad companions are identical to giant frog companions (Pathfinder RPG
    Bestiary 135), save that they lack the frog's tongue and pull abilities.
  - Instead, they gain the poison skin ability at 4th level.
