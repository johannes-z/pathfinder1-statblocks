Description:
  - >-
    Magnimar has few laws for a city its size, but it still employs a sizable
    force of guards, centralized within the towering Arvensoar. Guards walk the
    streets regularly, policing the various quarters and maintaining peace
    throughout the city, though the wealthier districts see noticeably more
    protection than areas such as the Shadow. Magnimar's city guards are trained
    to detain criminals and keep the peace without needless violence, using
    nonlethal force in all but the most extreme cases.
