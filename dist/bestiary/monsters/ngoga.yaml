    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a ngoga can summon a burst of energy in order to
      move twice its base speed in a single move action.
Description:
  - >-
    In the tropical rainforests of the Kaava Lands and the Mwangi Jungle lurk
    animalistic offshoots of the cyclopes that once dominated the region. Known
    as ngogas, these half-orangutan, half-cyclops hybrids are infamous in the
    folktales of the Mwangi peoples, who fear them for their unpredictability
    and unnatural agility.
  - >-
    In cyclops legends, the ngogas were a gift to the Ghol-Gani from their
    otherworldly patrons near the collapse of the empire, magical beings infused
    with the brutality and insight afforded cyclopes, but lacking the
    intelligence that would make them viable competitors. Ghol-Gani soldiers
    often trained these beasts to follow them into battle and fight alongside
    them, and present-day cyclopes who encounter ngogas inevitably feel a sort
    of kinship to the similarly monocular beasts, enticing them with gifts of
    fruit and meat in order to gain an ally in their destructive conquests.
  - >-
    Since the fall of Ghol-Gan, ngogas have proliferated throughout the dense
    jungles of central Garund, and many of their kind can be found as deep as
    Usaro, where the destructive Gorilla King trains them as war-mounts for his
    smaller minions and relies on their bestial speed to stage ambushes against
    any who would dare t o intrude upon his realm.
