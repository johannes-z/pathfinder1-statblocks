Description:
  - >-
    Giant seahorses are larger versions of the common seahorse that spend their
    days swimming slowly along feeding on crustaceans and other such aquatic
    life. The average giant seahorse is about eight feet long and weighs 300
    pounds. Giant seahorses eat a variety of aquatic life, including plants,
    shrimp, and other small aquatic life. They are slow swimmers and never
    pursue their prey. Giant seahorses reproduce through internal fertilization
    and do so four times each year (once per season). During reproduction, the
    female giant seahorse lays between 300 and 700 eggs in the male's incubation
    pouch (which resembles the pouch of a kangaroo). After 20 days, the eggs
    hatch, and the young remain in the pouch until they are capable of swimming
    on their own (about ten days). Newborn giant seahorses are about 1-foot long
    and reach maturity in 8 months. About 30% of all young seahorses die before
    birth (either the eggs don't hatch or the young die before emerging from the
    pouch). Giant seahorses are monogamous and mate for life. A giant seahorse
    is about 8 feet long from the top of its head to the tip of its tail. Its
    body is covered in fine scales and its head is horse-like with a long snout.
    Its back is lined with small dorsal fins. (These aid it in swimming.) Near
    the base of its head are pectoral fins that help the giant seahorse turn
    while swimming. A giant seahorse ranges in color from yellow to dull green
    or brown. Its eyes are almost always brown with the occasion giant seahorse
    having blue eyes. Giant seahorses are not aggressive creatures and only
    attack if cornered or if a member of the herd is threatened. In combat, a
    giant seahorse butts an opponent with its bony head. Most however simply
    flee when confronted. Training a Giant Seahorse A giant seahorse requires
    training before it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a giant
    seahorse must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be
    achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a seahorse as an
    aquatic mount requires six weeks of work and a successful Handle Animal
    check (DC 25). Riding a seahorse requires an exotic saddle. A seahorse can
    fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or
    she succeeds at a Ride check. Seahorse eggs are worth 2,000 gp apiece on the
    open market, while young are worth 4,000 gp each. Professional trainers
    charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a giant seahorse. Carrying Capacity: A
    light load for a giant seahorse is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301-600
    pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds. A giant seahorse can drag 4,500
    pounds. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
