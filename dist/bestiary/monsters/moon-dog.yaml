SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bay (Su)
    description: >-
      A moon dog can produce one of the following effects when it howls or
      barks. Each effect functions as the spell of the same name (caster level
      12th). The save DCs are Charisma-based. Fear: All evil creatures within 80
      feet must make a successful Will save or be affected as by a fear spell.
      This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. If the save is successful,
      that creature cannot be affected by the fear effect of that moon dog's bay
      for 24 hours. Dispel Evil: This effect works like the spell, and affects
      one evil extraplanar creature within 80 feet. Dismissal: This effect works
      as the spell, except that it targets one evil extraplanar creature.
  - name: Keen Senses (Ex)
    description: >-
      Moon dogs can see twice as far as humans in low-light and normal light
      conditions.
  - name: Lick (Su)
    description: >-
      By licking a target, a moon dog may use one of the following abilities:
      cure light wounds, delay poison, remove disease. Each is usable at will by
      the moon dog, but only once per day per recipient. Each is caster level
      12th.
  - name: Plane Shift (Su)
    description: >-
      A moon dog can enter the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, or Material Plane.
      This ability resembles the spell of the same name (caster level 12th).
  - name: Shadow Weave (Su)
    description: >-
      When in shadows, a moon dog can move in such a way as to affect evil
      creatures within 60 feet as though by hypnotic pattern (DC 16 Will save,
      caster level 12th). Any good-aligned creature in the area of the shadow
      weave will be affected as though by protection from evil (caster level
      12th). The shadow weave is a full-round action, and the moon dog must
      concentrate to maintain it.
Description:
  - >-
    The moon dog is a large wolfhound from the outer planes (believed to have
    its origins on the plane of Elysium). Moon dogs often enter the Material
    Plane when evil has grown to an immeasurable level in an area.
  - >-
    Otherwise, they are found in the employ of deities, solars, planetars, and
    the most powerful devas. Moondogs forepaws are prehensile and resemble human
    hands. Though moon dogs can move on two legs in a bipedal fashion, most do
    not do so, preferring the speed and grace they gain by moving on all fours.
  - >-
    A moon dog attacks with its powerful bite. If faced by particularly powerful
    or evil opponents, the moon dog opens combat with its bay attack. Moon dogs'
    prehensile hands could facilitate the use of weapons, though none have ever
    been encountered wielding such items.
  - >-
    A moon dog's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated
    as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
