SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Rage (Ex)
    description: >-
      A werewolverine in hybrid or animal form that takes damage in combat flies
      into a rage on its next turn, clawing and biting madly until either it or
      its opponent is dead. The creature cannot end its rage voluntarily.
Description:
  - >-
    In their humanoid forms, werewolverines are wiry, muscular folk with broad
    shoulders and powerful hands. Their faces are almost always contorted into a
    twitchy sneer. Quick to anger and slow to calm, werewolverines are seemingly
    always on the brink of a powerful emotional outburst. When angered, a
    werewolverine screams and howls in a raspy voice that speaks of violent,
    primal rage.
  - >-
    Instinctively brutal, werewolverines make the ideal strong-arms for bandit
    gangs.
  - >-
    Note that the statistics presented here for werewolverines assume that the
    creatures are in their barbarian rage - if the creatures are encountered at
    another time, simply adjust their statistics accordingly.
