SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Detect Thoughts (Su)
    description: >-
      A rakshasa can detect thoughts as the spell (CL 18th). It can suppress or
      resume this ability as a free action. When a rakshasa uses this ability,
      it always functions as if it had spent 3 rounds concentrating and thus
      gains the maximum amount of information possible. A creature can resist
      this effect with a successful DC 20 Will save. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Modify Memory (Sp)
    description: >-
      A mythic rakshasa can expend one use of mythic power as a swift action to
      modify the memory of a creature whose mind it is reading, as the modify
      memory spell (CL 18th). The creature can resist with a successful DC 20
      Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Telepathic Dodge (Su)
    description: >-
      A mythic rakshasa gains an insight bonus to its AC against creatures whose
      minds it can read. It doesn't need to use its detect thoughts ability to
      gain this bonus. The rakshasa doesn't gain this bonus against creatures
      that are mindless or whose minds can't be read (such as from a mind blank
      spell).
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic rakshasa is a natural mind reader and uses its abilities to tempt
    great heroes into failure and ruin-all toward to ultimate goal of seeding an
    entire civilization's destruction.
