SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Entrapping Vines (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mythic vrock can expend one use of mythic power as a swift action to
      release a cloud of spores from its body, affecting all adjacent
      non-demons. The spores deal 2d8 points of damage on the first round as
      they grow into ugly vines; for the next 10 rounds, they deal 1d6 points of
      damage and entrap the affected creatures (DC 21, 10 rounds, hardness 5, hp
      10). The vines can be destroyed by casting bless on the creatures or by
      sprinkling them with holy water. This is a disease effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Greater Stunning Screech (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per hour, a mythic vrock can emit a shrill screech. All non-demons
      within a 30-foot-radius spread must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or
      be stunned for 1 round. If the vrock expends one use of mythic power, any
      creature that fails its save is staggered for 1d6 rounds after the stun
      ends. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Manic Dance of Ruin (Su)
    description: >-
      A mythic vrock can expend one use of mythic power to dance and chant as a
      full-round action, after which it releases a crackling wave of energy,
      dealing 5d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures within 100 feet
      (Reflex DC 17 for half). Each additional vrock that joins in the dance
      adds 1 to the DC and an additional 5d6 points of damage, up to a maximum
      of 20d6. The dance immediately ends and must be started anew if any of the
      participating vrocks is slain, stunned, or otherwise prevented from
      dancing. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic vrock is a violent creature of unrestrained rage that takes out its
    anger on anything weaker than itself.
