    description: >-
      When a leprechaun uses any of its spelllike abilities to deceive, trick,
      or humiliate a creature (at the GM's discretion), the spell-like ability
      resolves at caster level 8th rather than 4th. If a leprechaun uses its
      spell-like abilities in this manner, it has a bonus of +11 on
      concentration checks.
Description:
  - >-
    Leprechauns are small, fun-loving tricksters. They are most commonly found
    in forests and share the close connection with nature that is possessed by
    most fey creatures. Leprechauns love playing tricks on unknowing
    passersby-almost as much as they love a fine bottle of wine and a plateful
    of hot food in their bellies. They often steal something of worth from
    adventurers just to provoke a chase. Using their ability to disappear at
    will to its full potential, they wait until their victims appear to be about
    to give up the chase before reappearing once more to let the chase resume.
    They are not greedy creatures, and eventually drop what they've stolen,
    slipping away while their angry pursuers claim the lost property. The
    exception is gold- leprechauns love gold and often hoard it in secret,
    hidden places. It is rumored that a person who finds a gold coin in the
    forest and returns it to the leprechaun that dropped it will be granted a
    wish as a reward. Unfortunately, these rumors are false-likely perpetuated
    by the leprechauns themselves in order to trick others into bringing them
    gold.
  - >-
    Leprechauns prefer not to kill other creatures unless the ones attacking
    them are malicious or known enemies of the forest or fey. They often use
    their powers to befuddle and annoy evil folk, tricking creatures such as
    goblins and orcs into thinking a forest is haunted.
