  sickening forms of dead soldiers who walk once more among the living. Its
  heavy fumes shift and swirl as if alive.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Trench Zombie (Su)
    description: >-
      A trench mist can animate any corporeal creature slain while engulfed
      within its form. The victim rises as a trench zombie (see facing page) in
      1d4 rounds and is under the control of the trench mist that created it. A
      trench zombie becomes free-willed if it is separated from its parent
      trench mist. A trench mist can animate a number of trench zombies whose
      Hit Dice total does not exceed more than twice its own Hit Dice.
  - name: Engulfing Mists (Ex)
    description: >-
      A trench mist can engulf foes (see the engulf special ability on page 296
      of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2). A creature engulfed by a trench mist does
      not gain the pinned condition and may move normally-such a creature is not
      in danger of suffocating, but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, it
      automatically takes 4d6 points of acid damage and 4d6 points of negative
      energy damage. A trench mist's vapors obscure all sight, including
      darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment (attacks
      have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment
      (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate targets). The
      save DC to avoid the engulfing mists is Constitution-based.
  - name: Gaseous (Ex)
    description: >-
      A trench mist has a body composed of foul, mustard-colored vapors. This
      form grants the amorphous defensive ability and allows it to pass through
      small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with no reduction to its
      speed, but it cannot enter water or other liquids. A trench mist doesn't
      have a Strength score. It can't manipulate or wear objects, and it is
      treated as a creature three size categories smaller than its actual size
      (Medium for most trench mists) for the purposes of how wind affects it.
  - name: Trench Zombie Symbiosis (Su)
    description: >-
      Because of its symbiotic relationship with the trench zombies it creates,
      a trench mist shares senses with its animated creatures when they are
      engulfed within its form, granting them lifesense and making them immune
      to the concealment the trench mist grants to creatures within and outside
      of its foggy form.
Description:
  - >-
    Trench mists are created anywhere that deadly gas attacks are used for the
    wholesale slaughter of troops, whether attacks of a mundane poisonous
    nature, or from the magical effects of spells such as acid fog. Under
    mysterious circumstances likely born of the horrors of war and the final
    throes of young soldiers dying before their time, these mists linger over
    the battlefield, absorbing the departing souls of the slain. This
    commingling of loosed life energy and strange chemicals grants the miasma a
    sly, malevolent sentience. Once so born, the trench mist then seeks only to
    impart misery and share its singular fate with those fortunate enough to
    have escaped the poisonous attacks that birthed the creature in the first
    place. As it preys upon the living it absorbs the aff licted into its
    growing horde of shambling servants. Victims of its acidic mist rise as
    hateful zombies under the creature's control, and a trench mist that gains a
    horde of zombies is a dangerous foe indeed. On battlefields where trench
    mists are known to have arisen, wise commanders arrange cease-fires during
    which both sides abandon the site, lest their troops succumb to the
    horrifying fate of their comrades.
  - >-
    Part of the trench mist's self-awareness comes from the symbiotic trench
    zombies it gains as it slaughters its victims, as the zombies under the
    mist's control retain the abilities they had in life as well as some
    snippets of their former memories, which all feed into the collective
    consciousness of the trench mist. This allows the mist to learn and adapt,
    granting it a relatively keen intelligence compared to other similar
    creatures, and allowing it to make canny combat decisions and cleverly
    manipulate its surroundings.
  - >-
    Trench mists wander battlefields looking for prey so they can add more
    shambling zombies to their collective hordes. Occasionally they might even
    enter inhabited areas to seek out fresh ammunition and armaments for those
    of their symbiotic undead who may have exhausted their weaponry. When bereft
    of such foul company, trench mists often persist for years after the tides
    of war have receded, settling into the soil and slumbering until fresh prey
    arises. The lifespan of trench mists is unknown, though through this sort of
    hibernation they very well may be immortal, reemerging without warning at
    the scenes of ancient battles centuries after they have taken place, whether
    turned up by an unsuspecting farmer's plow or war waged anew.
