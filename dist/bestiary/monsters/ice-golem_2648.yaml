Description:
  - >-
    The ice golem is a humanoid formed of roughly chiseled ice, standing 10 feet
    tall and weighing around 800 pounds. Ice golems at rest appear to be normal
    ice sculptures and are often mistaken as such (DC 20 Perception check to
    notice the creature is alive). An ice golem usually opens combat with its
    breath weapon. An ice golem never uses weapons or wears armor, preferring to
    attack with its powerful fists. Fire is an effective means of combating
    these creatures. Construction An ice golem's body must be constructed from a
    single block of ice weighing at least 1,000 pounds. The ice is treated with
    magical powders and unguents worth at least 500 gp. ICE GOLEM CL 12th; Price
