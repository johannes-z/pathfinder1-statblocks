      Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against an
      abasheen.
Description:
  - >-
    Abasheens are genies from the Plane of Air and serve the nobles of that
    plane as diplomats, couriers, and emissaries. Some of the less scrupulous
    serve as spies and insurgents. They are extremely clever and often let their
    arrogance interfere with their assignments. Abasheen look down on all
    creatures from the Material Plane.
  - >-
    Abasheens and common djinn tolerate each other, but that is as far as it
    goes. They rarely work together and when they do, such pairings often
    degenerate into quarrels. The society structure of the abasheen is unknown
    but it is believed to be vastly different than that of the other genies. No
    abasheen nobles are known to exist and the entire race seems to be servitor
    to the race of djinn.
  - >-
    An abasheen stands about 8 feet tall and is always dressed in flowing robes
    colored to denote their current station. Their skin is dark and their build
    powerful. All have dark hair, either black or brown, and most wear their
    hair braided or pulled into a ponytail, tied with ribbons of gold or silver.
  - >-
    Abasheens rely on their physical attack and spell-like abilities in combat.
    When combat starts, an abasheen commands one of its opponents (usually the
    one closest to it) to drop or flee (see the command spell).
  - >-
    On its next action it either bashes an opponent with its fists (if one is
    close enough) or attempts to charm an enemy spellcaster.
  - >-
    During combat, an abasheen rarely touches the ground, preferring to remain
    airborne and above its opponents. They rarely fight to the death. Should
    combat turn against an abasheen it always attempts to escape, usually by
    plane shifting away.
