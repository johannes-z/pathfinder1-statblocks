Description:
  - >-
    Flinds are slightly larger, more intelligent, and of a stockier build than
    gnolls, and it's a common misconception that flinds are an entirely separate
    race. Though interbreeding may one day make them so, flinds are actually the
    product of controlled breeding practices by the dominant females of gnoll
    packs.
  - >-
    The slyest and largest female gnolls sanctified by the chosen of Lamashtu
    are paired with the most savage males, and a little more than half the time,
    the resulting litter includes at least one flind. The flind pup is often
    female. A breeding female flind produces only flinds, though flinds' litters
    tend to be smaller than those of normal gnolls. Male flinds who breed with
    female gnolls produce a litter with a flind about three quarters of the
    time.
  - >-
    More capable of focus, cunning, and planning than gnolls, flinds are
    typically found in leadership roles within gnoll bands and tribes, and
    frequently lead hunting parties. Like gnolls, flinds use ambush tactics and
    often make slaves of surviving foes, yet a flind is more likely to go on the
    offensive when the odds are closer to even. Flinds still prefer the
    advantage of attacking in numbers-they just don't need the advantage to be
    overwhelming. In addition to using intimidation against enemies, flinds
    embrace flanking tactics and specialized uses of their unusual weapon, the
    flindbar.
  - >-
    Flinds assign gnolls lower in the pack hierarchy the task of crafting
    flindbars (see page 93). Flinds are very particular about these weapons, and
    a gnoll who fails to properly weight and polish a flindbar can expect a
    savage mauling from the flind who demanded the weapon.
  - >-
    A flind is roughly 7 feet tall and weighs between 280 and 315 pounds. Flinds
    have brindled or spotted fur, and are primarily russet in color with patches
    of black.
