SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Yellow Musk Zombie (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a yellow musk creeper can bore dozens of tendrils
      into the brain of a helpless creature within reach, such as a creature
      entranced by its pollen. This attack inflicts 1d4 points of Intelligence
      damage per round. When a creature is reduced to 0 Intelligence, it dies,
      and the tendrils break off inside its brain. One hour later, the creature
      animates as a yellow musk zombie (see below).
  - name: Pollen Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a yellow musk creeper can spray a cloud of pollen at
      a single creature within 30 feet. It must make a +4 ranged touch attack to
      strike the target, who must then succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be
      entranced for 1d6 rounds. An entranced creature can take no action other
      than to move at its normal speed into a space within the yellow musk
      creeper's reach, at which point an entranced creature remains motionless
      and allows the creeper to insert tendrils into its brain. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The yellow musk creeper is a hideous plant that grows in haunted graveyards,
    grisly battlefields, and other places where death hangs heavy in the air and
    thick in the soil. The yellow musk creeper's method of procreation is
    singularly frightful-it slays the living, infests them with its seeds and
    pollen, then animates them as zombies. These zombies serve the plant as a
    guardian for several days, but when new zombies are created, older ones
    wander off into the surrounding wild, collapsing and breaking apart within
    2d6 days to give seed to a new yellow musk creeper. Yellow Musk Zombie A
    yellow musk zombie is a rotting creature from which wet green vines have
    sprouted. Treat a yellow musk zombie as a standard zombie, but with this
    special quality. Plant Traits (Ex) This zombie's animation is provided not
    by necromancy but by the plant that grows throughout its body. Yellow musk
    zombies lack undead traits, but gain plant traits. They are treated as
    plants, not undead, for the resolution of magical effects and attacks.
    Channel energy cannot harm a yellow musk zombie, for example, nor does
    negative energy heal a yellow musk zombie.
