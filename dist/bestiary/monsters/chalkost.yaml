SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Copper Boar Form (Su)
    description: >-
      When a chalkost uses its change shape ability, it can turn into a boar
      with metallic flesh, coppery bristles, and glistening steel tusks. In this
      form, a chalkost retains its damage reduction and energy resistances. The
      copper boar has the same statistics as a normal boar, but its natural
      armor bonus is +6 and its gore attack deals an extra 1d6 points of
      electricity damage on a successful hit.
  - name: Dwarf Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      A chalkost counts as a dwarf for any effect related to race, and has the
      hardy, slow and steady, and stability dwarven racial traits.
  - name: Shock Cestus (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a chalkost can summon or dismiss a masterwork cestus on
      one of its hands. While wielded by the chalkost, the cestus deals an extra
      1d6 points of electricity damage on a successful hit. If the cestus is
      given away or taken, the chalkost loses this ability until it reclaims its
      weapon.
Description:
  - >-
    A chalkost is a perfect dwarven soul that serves as a laborer and crafter in
    Torag's divine realm. Blessed with hardiness, fine weapons, and an
    incorrigible spirit, a chalkost is a tireless and loyal servant, capable of
    forging new arms for angels or defending the plane against fiendish
    invaders. Said to have been created from the souls of particularly skilled
    and heroic dwarves, each chalkost shares a mutual affinity for one mortal
    dwarven clan, observing and guiding its members like an honored ancestor. So
    close is this relationship that the name of a particular chalkost is often
    passed down from priest to priest and family to family, so that some of
    these divine beings have aided clans for generations. Chalkosts have a close
    relationship with dwarven paladins and other noble dwarven warriors, and it
    is considered a special honor for mortal dwarves to ride a boar-form
    chalkost into battle.
  - >-
    A chalkost looks like an attractive, copper-haired dwarf wearing an
    open-faced helm with stylized boar tusks and armed with a hammer-tipped
    cestus. Male chalkosts have long beards, while females have long braids. The
    gender of a chalkost associated with a given dwarven clan generally matches
    the gender of the clan's leaders.
  - Chalkosts stand just over 5 feet tall and weigh about 230 pounds.
