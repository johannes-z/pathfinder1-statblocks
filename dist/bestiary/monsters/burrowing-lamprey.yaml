SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Attach (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a burrowing lamprey hits with a bite attack, its suckered mouth
      latches onto the target, anchoring it in place. An attached burrowing
      lamprey is effectively grappling its prey. The burrowing lamprey loses its
      Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 13, but holds on with great
      tenacity. A burrowing lamprey has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its
      grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached burrowing lamprey can be
      struck with a weapon or grappled itself-if its prey manages to win a
      grapple check or Escape Artist check against it, the burrowing lamprey is
      removed.
  - name: Flesh Burrow (Ex)
    description: >-
      At the start of its next turn, the round after it attaches to its prey, a
      burrowing lamprey burrows into the target's flesh and subjects it to its
      poison. Applying flame to the point of entry deals 1d6 points of fire
      damage to both the host and the burrowing lamprey. Cutting the lamprey out
      works, but the longer the lamprey remains in the host, the more damage
      this method does. Cutting a lamprey out requires a slashing weapon and a
      DC 20 Heal check, and deals 1d6 points of damage to the host per round the
      lamprey has been inside it. If the Heal check succeeds, one lamprey is
      removed. Remove disease instantly kills any burrowing lampreys inside a
      host.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Flesh burrow-injury; save DC 14 Fort; effect 1d2 Constitution damage; cure
      -. The save DC is Constitution-based. The lamprey's poison liquefies the
      host's organs. A successful saving throw can prevent Con damage for that
      round, but the only cure is to remove the burrowing lamprey from the host.
Description:
  - >-
    The burrowing lamprey is an eel-like fish that attaches to its prey, and
    then burrows into its body, feasting on blood and the rich vital organs.
    They are a danger to fish and aquatic mammals, and can be as deadly as a
    school of piranha when encountered in large numbers. Burrowing lampreys
    resemble eels three to four feet long, with sphincter-like mouths positioned
    within hardened cartilaginous beaks.
  - >-
    Although they are usually marine creatures, burrowing lampreys breed in
    coastal freshwater swamps and rivers, and thus can be found in both fresh
    and saltwater environments.
  - >-
    They prefer to either ambush prey by hiding along the ocean floor or in
    rocky crevices, or swarm around a target if traveling in numbers. However,
    it is possible that they can be encountered inside a dead creature's
    remains, feeding on its vital organs.
  - >-
    Medium- and large-sized burrowing lampreys are less common, but sometimes
    found in the deeper sea, where they may attack large sharks or even small
    whales.
  - >-
    Burrowing lampreys seek out targets at least equal to their size category,
    and up to three sizes larger, if they can, though a starving lamprey attacks
    just about anything. They attack with their bite, then immediately attempt
    to burrow into their victim.
