Description_Visual: >-
  This slithering mass of bubbling red ooze extrudes a nest of long, thin
  tendrils, as if tasting the air in search of prey.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adaptive Defenses (Su)
    description: >-
      After being damaged by any magical effect that deals cold, electricity,
      fire, or sonic damage, a riftcreeper's body instantly adapts to become
      immune to that form of energy. A riftcreeper can only adapt to one of
      those four types of energy at a time-if it adapts to a new energy type, it
      loses its immunity to the previous type. Otherwise, the immunity lasts for
      1 hour.
  - name: Gelatinous Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per minute as a standard action, a riftcreeper can extrude a
      protoplasmic tendril of ooze to attach to any vertical surface within 120
      feet. It can then transfer its entire bulk along that tendril as part of
      that move action to change its location to the surface to which it's now
      attached. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Any
      creatures along its line of travel are subjected to a bull rush attempt.
  - name: Strands (Ex)
    description: >-
      A riftcreeper can extend up to six thin, sticky strands from its body at a
      time as a standard action, launching them to a maximum range of 120 feet.
      These attacks resolve as ranged touch attacks. On a hit, a strand deals
      2d4 points of acid damage to its target and attaches to the creature.
      These strands are quite strong, but any amount of slashing damage severs
      them (a strand has AC 25). As long as a strand remains attached to a
      target, that creature takes an additional 2d4 points of acid damage at the
      start of its turn. A riftcreeper can automatically absorb the strands into
      its body if it uses its gelatinous surge ability (and, in doing so, it
      releases any attached creatures).
Description:
  - >-
    Heaving masses of unnatural protoplasm known as riftcreepers prowl the
    Worldwound's shattered canyons. Despite their name, these intelligent,
    malevolent oozes are quite agile and swift, slithering up and down canyon
    walls or swimming through even the foulest water. Natives of the Abyss,
    riftcreepers have adapted disturbingly well and quickly to the Worldwound.
    Although smart enough to understand Abyssal, riftcreepers have little
    interest in conversing with their food.
