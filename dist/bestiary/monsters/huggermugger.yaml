SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Confusion Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A group of three or more huggermuggers can, as a free action, create an
      aura of confusion. Anyone within 40 feet of the huggermuggers must succeed
      at a Will save (DC 12, +1 per huggermugger in the group) or be affected as
      by a confusion spell for 5 rounds. All huggermuggers in the group must be
      within 30 feet of each other to create this aura. Each huggermugger may
      contribute to the confusion aura once per day. A creature that makes a
      successful save cannot be affected by the confusion aura of any
      huggermuggers in that group for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Natural Cunning (Ex)
    description: >-
      Huggermuggers possess innate cunning and logical ability. This makes them
      immune to maze spells, prevents them from ever becoming lost, and enables
      them to track enemies. Further, they are never caught flat-footed.
Description:
  - >-
    Huggermuggers are small, underground dwelling humanoids that relish in
    chaos, disorder, trickery, and the fine art of thieving. These degenerate
    humanoid creatures have only been encountered in large cities with extensive
    sewer systems, but it is not known how their race has spread or how it
    developed. Most compare them to rats for swarming up from the filth to feed
    on human society like great parasites. A few fear-mongering city dwellers
    loudly speculate that the huggermuggers maintain vast tunnel complexes that
    connect all of the large cities of the world, and that some day the vile
    race will issue up from the depths as an invading army. Huggermuggers do not
    speak, other than the incessant chattering and mumbling they seem to
    constantly indulge in. Their language has yet to be translated by sages, so
    what they call themselves remains a mystery. The name "huggermugger" is a
    nonsense word akin to "boogeyman," being a name used in stories to scare
    children into remaining close to home and not exploring the sewers and dark
    alleys of the city. Curiously, their skin is pale and cold to the touch,
    regardless of the actual temperature in the surrounding area. A band of
    huggermuggers slowly circles its opponents, chattering and mumbling so as to
    cause confusion. Each round they circle a foe, one huggermugger moves in,
    attacks with its hook-blade, and then falls back into the circle as another
    prepares to attack. If outnumbered or outclassed, huggermuggers prefer to
    attack from ambush, confusing their opponents before robbing or slaying
    them.

    Hook-Blade (Exotic Light Melee Weapon) The hook-blade is 13 inches long with
    a wooden handle and finely sharpened, curved blade on one end. A smaller
    blade protrudes from the other side of the weapon. It resembles a kama with
    a smaller curved blade opposite the main blade. Hook-Blade: Cost 7 gp;
    Damage 1d4 (S), 1d6 (M); Crit x2; Weight 2 lb.; Type slashing; Special
    disarm.
