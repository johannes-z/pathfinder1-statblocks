Description_Visual: >-
  The figure that crawls up from the grave may have once been a living man, but
  it is now wholly a monster. Its flesh crawls with worms and seeps with decay,
  allowing bones and internal organs to slip through hideous tears here and
  there. Its jaw distends and a long tongue whips out, almost like a tentacle.
  Its legs have been severed at the knee, forcing it to scrabble forward on all
  fours like some deranged beast.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Daytime Invisibility (Su)
    description: >-
      During the day, a tuyewera is invisible as long as it doesn't attack. This
      effect functions as the invisibility spell, but lasts for the entire day.
      If a tuyewera takes any action that would negate its invisibility (such as
      attacking), it remains visible until it takes a full-round action to
      reactivate its invisibility.
  - name: Lure (Su)
    description: >-
      If a tuyewera possesses a stolen tongue (see steal tongue ability), it can
      lure creatures into a trancelike state and compel them to approach as a
      standard action. When a tuyewera uses its lure, it must target an
      intelligent creature within 120 feet to which it has line of effect (but
      not necessarily line of sight). The tuyewera must concentrate to maintain
      the lure's effects. It then calls out to the creature, beckoning it to
      approach. The target can resist this lure by making a successful DC 15
      Will save, after which that target is immune to that tuyewera's lure
      ability until the tuyewera gains a different tongue. If the tuyewera uses
      the target's name during the lure, the target suffers a -2 penalty on the
      Will save. If the target fails, she becomes fascinated and attempts to
      approach the tuyewera by the shortest, safest route possible. Once the
      target is adjacent to the tuyewera, she remains motionless and offers no
      resistance to the undead's attacks (although once the tuyewera attacks, it
      ceases concentration and the victim is free to act, assuming she survives
      the monster's attack). This is a sonic mindaffecting charm effect. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Suffocation (Su)
    description: >-
      A tuyewera does not breathe itself, but it can attempt to steal the breath
      of a helpless, fascinated, or stunned adjacent creature as a standard
      action. When the tuyewera attempts this, it moves its mouth next to the
      victim's mouth and inhales, drawing the victim's breath out of her body.
      The victim can attempt to resist this attack by making a DC 15 Fortitude
      save. If she fails, the victim is stunned for 1 round and begins to
      suffocate. The victim falls unconscious on the second round, drops to -1
      hit points on the third, and dies of suffocation on the fourth. Each
      round, the victim may attempt a new DC 15 Fortitude save to end the
      suffocation effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Steal Tongue (Su)
    description: >-
      A tuyewera does not possess a tongue of its own when it is created-it must
      steal a tongue from a recently slain (no more than 1 day ago) creature
      before it can speak, attack with its tongue, or use its lure or
      constriction attacks. Stealing a tongue is a full-round action, after
      which the stolen tongue merges with the tuyewera's jaw. The tuyewera gains
      the ability to speak and understand all of the languages known by the dead
      body from which the tongue was harvested, and its voice sounds exactly
      like that of the dead creature while it still lived. The monster's new
      tongue is a dangerous weapon as well, and can extend to a length of nearly
      5 feet to attack and constrict foes. A stolen tongue only lasts until the
      next sunrise, after which it rots away to corruption in a single round,
      forcing the tuyewera to seek out a replacement before it regains its
      speech and attacks.
Description:
  - >-
    The tuyewera is a hideous creation designed to serve not only as a stealthy
    minion but also as a monstrous assassin. Invisible during the day, a
    tuyewera can be sent into an enemy's lair to perform any number of missions
    desired by its creator or master. A tuyewera that lacks a master is a
    free-willed undead-in wilderness regions, it wanders aimlessly, constantly
    searching for signs of civilization. If it finds such signs, it invariably
    seeks out a graveyard and lurks in hiding, waiting for a new body to be
    buried so that it can burrow into the grave and steal the corpse's tongue at
    the first opportunity. The tuyewera then stalks the region, looking for
    mourners of the dead person to lure into a secluded area and suffocate,
    before stealing their tongues to repeat the process. Variant Tuyeweras The
    statistics presented on the facing page are for a typical tuyewera created
    from the body of a Medium humanoid creature, but there are methods by which
    tuyeweras can be created from the bodies of smaller or larger humanoids as
    well. While in theory, one should be able to create a tuyewera from a
    non-humanoid creature, so far necromancers have been unable to achieve this
    feat. Something to do with the preparation method and the medicines used
    simply doesn't translate to non-humanoid bodies-although the unique undead
    created by such methods could have a variety of powers, they are not truly
    tuyeweras. Guidelines for statting up smaller and larger tuyeweras appear
    below. Smaller Tuyeweras: Tuyeweras created from the bodies of gnomes, half
    lings, or even children of larger humanoids can be statted up by applying
    the young creature simple template. Larger Tuyeweras: A tuyewera created
    from the body of a giant can be Large or larger. You can simply apply the
    giant creature simple template, but a better solution in this case is to
    rebuild the tuyewera with all of the appropriate changes to its
    stats-whenever a tuyewera's Hit Dice grant it an ability score increase, it
    increases its Charisma score. A Large tuyewera has 10 HD and is CR 6. A Huge
    one has 14 HD and is CR 8. A Gargantuan one has 18 HD and is CR 11. The
    largest, Colossal tuyeweras, have 22 HD and are CR 14. Creating a Tuyeweras
    A tuyewera can be created via the create undead spell, so long as the caster
    undertakes a specialized ritual as part of the casting. The body to be
    transformed into a tuyewera must be that of a humanoid the caster has
    himself slain at some point in the last 3 days. The spellcaster must be at
    least 13th level to create a tuyewera. Before the spellcasting begins, the
    caster must prepare the body by removing the corpse's tongue and severing
    its legs at the knees. The actual casting of the spell requires the caster
    to anoint the tuyewera's severed limbs and tongue with special medicines.
    These discarded body parts must then be burnt to ashes so that when the
    tuyewera rises from the dead, it does not recognize its missing limbs and
    tongue (if it does, it immediately attacks its creator). When the spell is
    complete, the newly created tuyewera is loyal to its creator and follows his
    spoken commands as long as the caster wears or carries a small pouch
    containing a handful of the ashes from the tuyewera's burnt limbs and tongue
    on his person. If the caster ever loses this pouch, the tuyewera becomes
    uncontrolled. If a tuyewera ever sees the ashes, it immediately recognizes
    them and seeks out its creator unerringly (as if via locate creature, but
    with no range limitation) and attempts to kill him- preferably as the
    creator sleeps.
