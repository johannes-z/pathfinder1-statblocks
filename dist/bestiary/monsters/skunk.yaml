    description: >-
      Once per round, and no more than 5 times per day , a skunk can release a
      cloud of stinking musk that quickly fillsa 5-foot area in front of it. A
      creature within or entering the area must succeed on a DC 10 Fortitude
      save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. One round later a second Fortitude
      save must be made (whether the first one succeeded or not) or the affected
      creature is blinded for 1d4 rounds. The save DCs are Constitution-based .A
      delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the
      sickened creature, but does not remove the blindness. Creatures immune to
      poison are unaffected by the sickened effect but can still be blinded if
      they fail their save, and creatures resistant to poison receive their
      normal bonus on both saving throws. The stench is highly potent, and short
      of magical means of cleaning, all cloth and such material continue to reek
      for 1d6 months. The odor is so strong that it doubles all chances for
      random encounters and imposes a -6 penalty on Stealth checks attempted
      while wearing clothing contaminated with a skunk's musk. Flesh, leather
      goods, metal goods (weapons, armor, and the like) must be washed in a
      concentrated mixture of vinegar over period of 1d3 days . Otherwise, the
      stench clings for at least one week, imposing the same modifiers to random
      encounters and Stealth checks.
Description:
  - >-
    The stats here describe the common nonaggressive skunk. Skunks squirt their
    musk at potential predators in hopes of forcing the predator to flee. If
    this fails, the skunk looks for the quickest route possible for itself to
    escape. If cornered, a skunk bites its opponents.
