SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Engulf (Ex)
    description: >-
      Though it is a Tiny monster, the hood can drop onto the head of a Medium
      or smaller creature as a standard action. If the hood's attack succeeds,
      it can immediately make a grapple check to grab its target and constrict.
      The hood's crawling tendrils wrap themselves tightly around its victim,
      seeking entry into the creature's ears, nose, and throat, making it
      difficult to remove. Any attacks against the hood deal half damage to the
      hood and its grappled target inside.
  - name: Strangle (Ex)
    description: >-
      A grappling executioner's hood entirely covers its opponent's head with an
      airtight grip. A creature that is grappled by the hood cannot speak or
      cast spells with verbal components and must hold its breath (see
      Suffocation, Pathfinder Core Rulebook) unless it doesn't speak or breathe
      through its head.
  - name: Vulnerability to Alcohol (Ex)
    description: >-
      Strong alcohol harms the hood. Every quart poured on it causes 1 point of
      damage. Four quarts of alcohol incapacitates it and forces it to release a
      grappled target.
Description:
  - >-
    The executioner's hood is a deadly monster, black in color and 1 inch thick,
    that resembles an actual executioner's hood or a small black bag.
  - >-
    It has two eyeholes that can be used to see into or out of the monster (if
    some unfortunate soul happens actually to pick it up-or worse, put it on).
  - The executioner's hood is sometimes used to guard valuable belongings.
  - It does so unerringly as long as a constant supply of food is available.
  - >-
    The executioner's hood clings to the ceiling, waiting for prey to pass under
    it. When prey passes by, the hood drops and attempts to engulf the victim's
    head. Slain victims are slowly devoured by the hood.
