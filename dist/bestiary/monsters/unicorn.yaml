SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Magic Circle against Evil (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability continually duplicates the effect of the spell. The unicorn
      cannot suppress this ability.
  - name: Magical Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      A unicorn's gore attack is treated as a magic good weapon for the purposes
      of damage reduction.
  - name: Wild Empathy (Su)
    description: >-
      This works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except the unicorn
      has a +6 racial bonus on the check. Unicorns with druid levels add this
      racial modifier to their wild empathy checks.
Description:
  - >-
    Unicorns are fierce, intelligent creatures of the forest, noble beasts who
    keep their own counsel and typically appear only to defend their homes
    against evil. They universally shun all creatures except for good-aligned
    fey, good-aligned humanoid women, and the woodlands' native animals, though
    they may fight alongside other good creatures against common enemies. A
    typical unicorn is 8 feet long and 5 feet tall at the shoulder, weighing
    1,200 pounds.
  - >-
    Unicorns mate for life, and the pairs generally make their homes in specific
    glades or dells within the vast forests they protect (these regions can
    cover anywhere from a few dozen square miles to hundreds). They allow good
    and neutral creatures to pass through, hunt for food, or reside in their
    woods unharmed, but evil creatures and those who damage the local ecosystem
    more than necessary through sport hunting or commercial logging are swiftly
    driven out or killed. On rare occasions, lone unicorns without mates or
    whose partners have been slain have been known to adopt young women of
    exceptionally pure virtue as surrogates, allowing the women to ride on their
    backs and becoming their guardians and protectors for life. This bond
    generally ends amiably if the woman becomes more committed to someone
    else-such as a lover or child-giving rise to the myth that unicorns only
    befriend virgins.
  - >-
    A unicorn's horn is the focus for its powers, and in order to use its
    spell-like abilities on other creatures the unicorn must touch them with it.
    Evil creatures greatly value unicorn horns as reagents for healing potions
    and other dark rites, and a single powdered unicorn horn counts as 1,600 gp
    when used as a component for crafting healing magic.
