Description_Visual: >-
  This rosy-haired woman is completely nude except for the mass of vines and
  leaves that cover her lower body. The plant matter silently weaves about her
  frame seemingly of its own volition, and consists of flourishing vines
  bursting with blooming flowers as well as wilted leaves covered with a silvery
  sheen of hoarfrost.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Autumnal Embrace (Su)
    description: >-
      At will, a veranallia can strike any creature within 30 feet barren or
      sterile. The target must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude save or lose any
      ability it had to reproduce or bear children. This effect can only be
      removed by a heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell. Creatures that
      magically reproduce are not affected by this ability. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Rebirth (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a veranallia can reincarnate a creature she deems worthy of
      the honor. The creature's original body decays and sinks into the ground,
      affecting the surrounding area in a 1/2-mile radius as though with plant
      growth (enrichment). Over the course of 1d4 days, a white, flowery cocoon
      emerges from the affected ground and splits open, revealing the newly
      reincarnated creature inside. Creatures reincarnated by a veranallia
      always return to life as aasimars. This ability otherwise functions as the
      reincarnate spell. Spells Veranallias cast divine spells as 20th-level
      clerics and have access to some druid spells. They do not gain access to
      domains or other cleric abilities.
  - name: Winter Sickle (Ex)
    description: >-
      At will as a free action, a veranallia can create a jagged blade from her
      hoarfrost-covered vines that acts as a +3 icy burst sickle. One round
      after it leaves the veranallia's grasp, the weapon melts into a small
      puddle of water.
Description:
  - >-
    Veranallias are among the most powerful azatas known and embody the changing
    of the seasons, from blossoming spring to dormant winter. They command the
    growth and decay of plants, control various aspects of the weather, and
    enrich soil with the remains of fallen foes. A veranallia stands 8 feet tall
    and weighs about 350 pounds.
  - >-
    Beautiful and majestic, the queenly veranallia possesses a form that
    combines aspects of a feylike woman and the subtle power of nature. A
    veranallia appears humanoid from the waist up, but where her thighs and legs
    should be, sprout countless vines, leaves, and various kinds of plant matter
    instead. These flora represent the life of plants throughout all stages of
    the year, continually shifting from blooming, verdant colors and textures to
    crisp, withered specimens and back in a matter of seconds.
  - >-
    Veranallias hail from the wildest regions of Elysium, primeval realms where
    few but the mightiest azatas dare tread. They are creatures of transition,
    preferring the unpredictable maelstroms of weather at Elysium's edges to the
    more temperate or consistent regions of that plane. They also have a
    particular appreciation for areas where one element transitions into
    another, such as coastlines, geysers, hot springs, and underground lakes.
    Many among their kind can be found in the lush Field of Broken Tyrants or
    various heavily wooded forests throughout Elysium; as many as a dozen
    veranallias are reputed to dwell among the ever-changing trees and plants of
    the Painted Forest, and it is thought their annual tribunals are actually
    the source of the eldritch woodland's transformative climate and continually
    shifting composition.
  - >-
    At first glance, a veranallia's lower body may appear to be made of living
    plants that wrap themselves around her, but these vines are in fact a part
    of the azata's strange physiology. Despite this, she is not subject to
    blight or similar plant-affecting magic, and attempts to use such abilities
    to hinder her inspire a veranallia's ire like little else. A veranallia's
    vines are incredibly strong and can entwine and crush an enemy as easily as
    a python would crush a field mouse. These vines often change appearance
    based on the veranallia's environment, but not always in any predictable or
    sensible manner.
  - >-
    Veranallias prefer the company of other azatas, and may have any number of
    faithful bralani or ghaele followers. Their fickle natures make it difficult
    for most other creatures, even other azatas, to interact with them. Lillends
    are not inspired by the dangerous power of veranallias, and brijidines'
    belief in the cleansing power of fire does not make friendship with the
    verdant veranallias easy. While most other celestials concede that
    veranallias have only the best intentions, most would still rather deal with
    more predictable members of the celestial planes. Archons in particular find
    it almost impossible to speak to veranallias, and the noble angels and
    agathions have trouble following a veranallia's leaps in logic and rapidly
    shifting moods.
  - >-
    Due to their power and inf luence, it takes a force of great evil to slay
    veranallias. When a veranallia does die, however, her body explodes into a
    fine glittering dust that covers a radius of up to a mile. This area becomes
    exceedingly fertile and subject to indeterminate weather. Storms, snowfalls,
    heat waves, and gentle showers come by turns regardless of the region's
    usual climate. Veranallias who have died on the evil Outer Planes have left
    such fertile areas behind, but the soil inevitably becomes corrupted again,
    giving rise to vile creatures such as sards and spawning vicious weather
    patterns.
  - >-
    Hardy plane-traveling adventurers speak of ancient veranallias living in the
    remotest corners of Elysium, and claim that these unique azatas possess even
    greater mastery over the elements than their more commonly encountered kin.
    Veranallias with the ability to shower entire mountains with lightning or
    cause heat waves so intense that they turn lakes to sand are spoken of in
    arcane texts in the Great Library of Harmonious Scripture of Heaven.
