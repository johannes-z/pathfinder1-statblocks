Description:
  - >-
    A mythic greater barghest is a near-divine offspring of one of the barghest
    gods. Infused with the power of foul planes, it leads great tribes of
    goblins, scaring their minions into something approaching discipline. Its
    presence is enough for hobgoblins and bugbears to treat goblins almost as
    equals, having seen the barghest's wrath at disobedience and infighting.
  - Mythic Barghest
  - >-
    Only exceptional barghests that feed on mythic humanoids can become mythic
    greater barghests. To create a mythic barghest, add the agile mythic simple
    template (see page 224) to a non-mythic barghest (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary
    27).
  - >-
    If the mythic barghest uses its feed ability on a mythic humanoid's corpse,
    it gains a mythic growth point instead of a growth point. If a mythic
    barghest reaches 4 growth points, it transforms into a greater barghest with
    the agile mythic simple template and loses its mythic growth points. If a
    mythic barghest gains 4 mythic growth points, it transforms into a mythic
    greater barghest and loses the agile mythic simple template.
