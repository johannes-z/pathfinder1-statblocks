Description_Visual: >-
  Moving with deadly grace, this brutal, thickly furred humanoid figure's head
  is that of a lioness with dead black eyes.
Group: Div
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 3
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Consume Essence (Su)
    description: >-
      A shira's deadliest attacks drain away a portion of its victim's essence.
      Whenever a shira hits with a coup de grace attack using its bite, or
      confirms a critical hit with its claws or bite, the target must succeed at
      a DC 23 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution drain. The save
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Dusty Pelt (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shira collects and produces copious amounts of dust and ash within the
      coarse hairs of its furry hide. As a move action, it can shake itself,
      creating a cloud of dust that fills its space, providing it concealment.
      Any attack that deals at least 10 points of bludgeoning, piercing, or
      slashing damage to the shira (before DR) automatically activates this
      ability. The dust cloud lasts for 1 round. A light wind disperses this
      cloud immediately.
Description:
  - >-
    Bestial stalkers, shiras live to hunt and feed. Resembling anthropomorphic
    lionesses, these divs use their powerful builds, keen senses, and deadly
    instincts to track the proudest mortals and slay the most formidable foes.
    They embody the deadly nature of the wilds and the dispassion with which
    beast and land might turn against mortals, delighting in proving to
    civilized beings how small and helpless they are in the face of a savage
    world.
  - >-
    Shiras prefer hunting alone, keeping company with even others of their own
    kind only long enough to form temporary hunting bands. With a hunger for
    intelligent prey, they savor the taste of mortal souls, savaging not just
    victims' bodies but also their vital essences. Despite being the most feral
    of all divs, shiras sometimes serve as scouts and assassins for div hordes.
    Such arrangements usually prove to be temporary, however, lasting only until
    the shiras' savage instincts or lust for the hunt again takes hold.
  - >-
    Shiras never go after an easy kill, and instead target the most obviously
    powerful of the possible targets. When acting on this compulsion, a shira
    weighs its chances for survival and the glory of its intended kill, planning
    its tactics carefully and not necessarily charging savagely forth. Though
    savage, a shira is also a cunning hunter and might wait weeks for the
    perfect opportunity to bring down its chosen prey.
  - Most shiras stand 10 feet tall and weigh approximately 1,200 pounds.
