SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ice Glide (Su)
    description: >-
      A burrowing ice elemental can pass through nonmagical ice and snow as
      easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no
      tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its
      presence. A control water spell cast on an area containing a burrowing ice
      elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1
      round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.
  - name: Icewalking (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the
      elemental climbs must be icy. The elemental can move across icy surfaces
      without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or
      charge on ice.
  - name: Numbing Cold (Su)
    description: >-
      When an ice elemental deals cold damage to a creature, that creature must
      succeed on a Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round. The save DC is
      listed in the elemental's stat block and is Constitution-based.
  - name: Snow Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      An ice elemental can see perfectly well in snowy conditions and does not
      take any penalties on Perception checks while in snow.
Description:
  - >-
    Ice elementals are creatures made of animated snow and ice. They form in
    especially cold parts of the Plane of Water and along its border with the
    Plane of Air, where giant icebergs careen off of world-high waterfalls into
    the open sky. Ice elementals vary in their exact appearance.
