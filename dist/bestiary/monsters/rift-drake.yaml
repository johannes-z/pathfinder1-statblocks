SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Clinging Corrosion (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a rift drake can spit a ball of caustic gas that
      bursts into a cloud upon impact. This attack has a range of 60 feet and
      deals 5d10 points of acid damage to all creatures within the resulting
      15-foot-radius spread. Additionally, any creature damaged by this attack
      is affected as though by the spell slow for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 20
      Reflex save halves the damage and negates the slowing effect. Once a rift
      drake uses its breath weapon, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Savage Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A rift drake applies 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to damage dealt with
      its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.
  - name: Speed Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a swift action, a rift drake can draw on its
      draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that allows it to take
      an additional move action that round.
Description:
  - >-
    Creatures of the badlands and regions scarred by the gods, rift drakes are
    as savage and brutal as the lands they hunt. Their strength and savagery
    often make them seem like mere deadly beasts, but rift drakes simply delight
    in battle more than most drakes, frequently clashing even with other members
    of their own kind. They rarely deign to talk with other creatures, often
    doing so only as a cruel game in which they make more and more outrageous
    demands until their victims realize the drakes are toying with them or the
    manipulative drakes grow bored.
  - >-
    A rift drake rarely stays on land for long, preferring to circle high above
    near ominous peaks or spires and roosting in the crevices of the same. When
    a rift drake spies prey from such heights, it breaks from its flight to dive
    onto victims, scattering groups and sowing terror with its sudden emergence.
    With particularly agile foes, a rift drake will use its breath to slow
    victims first, then pick them off one by one. Rift drakes enjoy the taste of
    blood, and focus their attacks on the fleshiest-looking creatures.
  - >-
    A rift drake is around 14 feet long, end to end. Its burly, spiky body
    weighs about 2,500 pounds.
