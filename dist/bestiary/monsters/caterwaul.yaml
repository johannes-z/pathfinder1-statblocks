      1d8 points of sonic damage to all creatures within 60 feet that hear it. A
      creature that makes a successful DC 16 Fortitude save takes no damage. The

Description:
  - >-
    Caterwauls are semi-intelligent bipedal felines that possess great speed.
    They are natural predators and use their speed to stalk prey. The
    caterwaul's lair is most often a cave littered with sticks, twigs, and
    leaves, with walls covered in scratch marks where the beast has honed its
    claws.
  - >-
    A caterwaul is about 6 feet long (or tall if on two legs). It weighs about
    250 pounds.
  - >-
    A caterwaul begins combat by utilizing its screech attack. After that, it
    uses its claw and bite attacks each round. By dropping to all fours, it can
    increase its movement speed.
