SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Consume Life (Su)
    description: >-
      When a nabasu creates a ghoul with its gaze attack, it gains a growth
      point. It gains a bonus equal to its growth point total on attack rolls,
      CMB rolls, saving throws, caster level checks, and skill checks. Its
      maximum hit points increase by 10 for each growth point, and its caster
      level for spell-like abilities increases by 1. For every 2 growth points,
      its natural armor bonus, SR, and CR increase by 1. Every time it gains a
      growth point it makes a DC 30 caster level check-success indicates it
      matures (gaining both the advanced and the giant simple templates) and
      plane shifts to the Abyss in a burst of smoke. A nabasu can have a maximum
      of 20 growth points-it automatically matures if it has not done so already
      when it reaches 20 growth points. Death-Stealing
  - name: Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action once per day per growth point (minimum of 1/day), a
      nabasu can activate its deathstealing gaze for a full round. All living
      creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or gain a
      negative level. A humanoid slain in this manner immediately transforms
      into a ghoul under the nabasu's control. A nabasu's gaze can only create
      one ghoul per round-if multiple humans perish from the gaze in a round,
      the nabasu picks which human becomes a ghoul. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Nabasus are birthed directly into the Material Plane from the Abyss, where
    they feed on innocent souls to mature. Only when finally sated can a nabasu
    return to the Abyss. Rumor holds that even then the nabasu's lifecycle does
    not change, and that further developments await them as they continue to
    grow. These vile demons form from the souls of evil gluttons, particularly
    from cannibals, blood-drinkers, and those who prefer the tang of undead
    flesh.
