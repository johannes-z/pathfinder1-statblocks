SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Egg Cracker (Ex)
    description: >-
      A skittergoat's horns are able to crack through the tough shells of ankheg
      eggs. When a skittergoat charges, its gore attack is resolved against the
      target's touch AC. In addition, when breaking an object, a skittergoat
      ignores 1 point of the object's hardness.
Description:
  - >-
    This breed of small goats, which dines almost exclusively on ankheg eggs,
    was only recently discovered living among the low hills and valleys of the
    Skittermounds. The skittergoats have adapted to life alongside the ankhegs
    with whom they share their environment: their agility allows them to slip
    through small spaces in search of eggs, and their speed makes them quite
    adept at escaping the grasp of angry ankheg mothers. Their relatively docile
    nature and ability to pierce ankheg eggs with their sharp horns have led to
    high demand for domesticated skittergoat companions among rangers searching
    for ankheg nests.
  - >-
    Skittergoats don't often form large herds, since foraging for ankheg eggs is
    most effectively done alone. A mating pair of skittergoats will generally
    pair for life, with the female ranging out in search of food while the male
    stays near the den to protect the young. Mothers regurgitate food for their
    young after returning from a hunt.
