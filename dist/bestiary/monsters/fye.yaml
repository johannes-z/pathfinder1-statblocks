SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Despair (Su)
    description: >-
      A fye continually emanates an aura of despair in a 10-foot radius. Any
      creature within or entering this area must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or
      take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability and skill
      checks, and weapon damage rolls for as long as they remain within the
      area. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the aura of despair
      of that fye for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Possession (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round by making a successful incorporeal touch attack, a fye can
      merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is
      similar to a magic jar spell, except that it does not require a
      receptacle. The target can resist the possession by succeeding on a DC 15
      Will save. If the save fails, the fye disappears and enters the target's
      body. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    When a traumatic event occurs within the vicinity of a temple or other holy
    place, energy often lingers in the area polluting and contaminating an
    object or the ground itself. This sometimes leads to the formation of a
    mindless entity-the fye. A fye has no memories because it was never alive,
    nor does it feel emotions toward any creature living, dead, or undead. Fye
    do not communicate nor reason, they simply exist. Though it is not bound to
    the area where it was created, a fye rarely moves more than 100 feet or so
    away from its "birthplace". A fye appears as a translucent humanoid about 6
    feet tall whose lower torso tapers off around the knees into vaporous
    nothingness. Its face always has the appearance that the creature is
    screaming or howling though it never utters any sound. A fye usually does
    not enter combat unless it is directly approached or molested. In combat, a
    fye uses its cause fear spell-like ability against its closest target,
    followed in the next round by its feeblemind ability. If opponents continue
    to harass the fye it uses its incorporeal touch and possession ability.
