Description:
  - >-
    Fomorian titans were the first titans created by the gods. In their pride,
    the titans intruded on the domain of their masters and created life of their
    own, so they too might be worshiped. The gods were forced to battle their
    creations, and though they won, they could not bring themselves to destroy
    the fomorians, and instead shackled the titans in armor that hid their
    beauty and imprisoned them in secret prisons across the multiverse.
