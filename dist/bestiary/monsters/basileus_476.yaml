Description_Visual: >-
  This comely young man is clad in fine silken robes and gold thread, with hair
  the color of sunbeams. He smiles slyly, and his eyes smolder with Hellish
  flames and the suggestion of power and terror beyond mortal reason.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Terror (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, Basileus can surround himself with a terrifying
      illusion that to all viewers appears as a unique and violent manifestation
      of the most terrifying thing their minds can conjure. This horror can only
      be seen by each individual onlooker, with even Basileus being unaware of
      what his viewers see. Those within 30 feet of Basileus must make a DC 25
      Will save. Those with 6 or fewer Hit Dice who fail instantly die from
      fear, while those with 6 or more Hit Dice are panicked and take 6d6 points
      of damage. Those who save are immune to Basileus's death or panic effects,
      but still take damage. Those who remain within 30 feet of Basileus, even
      after making their saves, take 6d6 points of damage every round as long as
      Basileus continues to take standard actions to maintain the terror. The
      death and panic aspects of this ability are a mind-affecting fear effect,
      with even creatures immune to such effects still being affected by the
      ability's damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Terror Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      While making use of his terror ability, Basileus can manifest one to five
      additional, monstrous limbs. These take on terrible appearances dictated
      by the terror ability, and deal 2d6+8 damage. When Basileus ceases the use
      of terror, these additional natural weapons vanish.
  - name: Veil of Forms (Su)
    description: >-
      Basileus appears as a powerful and attractive member of the same race as
      any creature looking upon him. His appearance is always appealing, with
      subtle illusory alterations that differ from viewer to viewer. Basileus is
      not aware of the specifics of his appearance to other creatures, though he
      may alter specifics as per the spell alter self. This is an illusion that
      is in effect anytime he is not using his terror ability, and grants him a
      +8 racial modifier on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks. Should a creature
      be able to see past the illusion, Basileus does not gain this racial
      modifier on opposed checks against that creature.
Description:
  - >-
    An infernal paradox at once wondrous and terrifying, tempting and
    blasphemous, the entity called the Son of Suns, Prince of Paradises, Jadros
    Voax, Baphon, Vexsoul, or simply Basileus serves as the herald of Asmodeus
    and harbinger of Hell's will. Few who have faced the messenger of the
    Archfiend survive the experience unchanged, for he is the very word of Hell.
    Typically appearing as a youth of stunning beauty and of the same race as
    those who look upon him-even when appearing before those of multiple
    races-little in the herald's comely appearance, finery, or proud bearing
    sets him apart from the vainglorious princes of countless mortal nations. In
    his radiant eyes, though, dance hellfire flames and a hint of the power he
    bears himself and often offers. To encounter Basileus is to know the
    interest or ire of the lord of Hell himself. Like his master, the herald
    knows no love for mortalkind, striving only to fulfill the worlds-spanning
    master schemes of the Prince of Darkness and draw souls into the grip of
    Hell by the legion. As such, he most often serves as an envoy between
    Asmodeus and other deities and extraplanar figures of note, rarely deigning
    to set foot upon the raucous and uncouth Material Plane. When his master's
    will dictates he travel to the mortal realm, though, his words bear all the
    weight of Hell, and typically offer temptations few souls can hope to
    refuse. Occasionally his master bids him answer the summons of the few
    mortals who hold the Prince of Darkness's favor, but even these forays
    typically prove subtle steps toward some greater infernal goal. In his
    humanoid form, Basileus appears as a 6-foottall mortal of surprising but
    unnatural beauty, with a languid voice like warm wine over silk. Although
    typically of male gender, this is not always the case, though he always
    appears before his lord in masculine form. Much of his form is an illusion,
    though, and a highly subjective illusion at that. Those who can see past
    Basileus's shrouds of innate deception find a human-like figure resembling
    the idealized form he presents, though still appearing somehow hollow. The
    most daring and ancient fiends have suggested that Basileus bears a
    resemblance to Baalzebul before Asmodeus punished the archdevil by stripping
    him of his angelic appearance-a rumor that leads the lord of the seventh to
    loathe his master's herald even more than he despises most creatures. A
    Thousand Terrors Through the millennia, dozens of immortal beings have
    served as heralds of the Prince of Darkness-even Baalzebul holding this
    position for a time before his cursed advancement to archdevil. Yet without
    fail, each herald has eventually overstepped his bounds and garnered
    Asmodeus's disfavor, facing a quiet, ignominious, and likely torturous end
    within Nesus's depths. Yet even after his past heralds' march of
    disappointments, Asmodeus holds Basileus as the most perfect of all his
    emissaries, for rather than elevating the messenger from among the ranks of
    his diabolical legions, the lord of Hell personally crafted his servant to
    meet his every expectation. An infernal automaton of sorts, Hell's herald is
    a being zealously devoted to the Prince of Darkness, even beyond the
    allegiances of devilkind, archdevils, or the Pit itself. Many among Hell's
    infernal hierarchy have whispered of their lord's herald's true nature,
    suggesting that he is a terrible amalgam, drawn from the painwracked
    nightmares of the Archfiend's past emissaries; a being shaped from the
    deepest proto-stuff of Hell itself; or even a vaporous being distilled from
    a measure of Hell's collective suffering. Regardless, the ever-changing
    physical nature of Asmodeus's herald and his unwavering loyalty to his
    master are widely known throughout the planes and beyond. On the Material
    Plane, Basileus has become a legend in his own right. Although rarely
    visiting the worlds of the mortal realm, wherever he treads he takes the
    form of the greatest terror of the age. Such leads to highly varied reports
    of the herald's form and nature, even among Asmodeus's worshipers, and the
    confusion and apprehension seem to please both Basileus and his master
    greatly. Among the Prince of Darkness's enemies, Basileus is a thousand
    horrors known by a thousand names. Tales of his appearance across Golarion
    have granted him a dozen terrible names: the Bleeding Oliphaunt, Baphon
    Reborn, and the Seventh Spawn being among those most often heard in fearful
    whispers. Each of these titles and countless more have been recorded by
    scholars of the divine outside the church of Asmodeus, with such
    disparities, though inaccurate, still capturing the deceit inherent in the
    herald's form and a measure of the horror that is Basileus.
