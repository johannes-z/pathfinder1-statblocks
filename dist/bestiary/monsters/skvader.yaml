      When a skvader hits with its bite attack, it automatically grapples its
      foe, dealing automatic bite damage each round. An attached skvader loses
      its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 12.
Description:
  - >-
    A combination of hare and grouse, skyvaders boast features and mannerisms of
    both animals. At first glance, a skvader appears to be a common hare, though
    its shorter ears distinguish it from the longer-eared rabbits. Its wings,
    hindquarters, and tail usually have a coloration similar to its fur, and its
    birdlike features are only easily distinguishable up close. Skvaders are
    twitchy and nervous, constantly on the lookout for predators. They switch
    between standing stock still upon sensing danger and quickly bolting to
    escape. While generally docile, skvaders become dangerous if cornered. A
    skvader is about 1-1/2 feet long and weighs around 10 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Skvaders live primarily in temperate forests, though they are also found in
    hillier regions with enough vegetation to provide them easy sustenance.
    They're also drawn to open, low-lying areas, particularly farm fields and
    plains covered in an abundance of tall grasses upon which they can feed.
    Their high metabolisms give these herbivores voracious appetites, which
    force them to consume such large quantities of plants that they pose
    significant threats to farmers' livelihoods. A family of skvaders infesting
    a farmer's fields can lay waste to his crops in just a couple of weeks. Once
    they've destroyed the vegetation in an area, the skyvaders move on to nearby
    farms and continue feeding. If cornered, a skvader emits a shrill screech
    that can be heard as far as a mile away. Other skvaders in the area
    immediately rush to its aid, causing a confrontation with a lone skvader to
    quickly escalate into a fight with a ferocious group of the creatures. When
    in combat, a skvader prefers to single out a threat and attach itself to
    that target. Scholars postulate that skvaders are a lesser form of their
    wolpertinger cousins, a variant that never fully developed into the greater
    threat the wolpertinger is. Others believe that the skvader is a distant
    precursor to the owlbear, citing the combination of mammalian and avian
    features, though on a much smaller scale. These scholars believe skvaders
    might have been an early experiment to combine two creatures into one,
    undertaken by the same lunatic wizard who supposedly created the owlbear.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    To protect themselves and secure a safe birthing environment, skyvaders
    often dig small burrows. A large enough skvader population frightens off
    other small herbivores, which leave their burrows behind for the skvaders to
    claim. They sometimes have to spend some time expanding the burrow's size,
    particularly if one or more wolpertingers are among the pack. In skvader
    families, adult females care for the young and the males dig the burrows,
    patrol for predators, and offer protection when their mates deliver a
    litter. Skvaders mate for life, though if one of a mated pair dies, the
    other seeks a new mate after a mourning period. Skvader young often stay
    with their parents for the first year of life. Multiple skvader families in
    the same region generally coexist peacefully. If one family grows
    significantly larger than the others, the smaller family simply moves on to
    new feeding grounds.
  - Skvaders and Wolpertingers as Familiars
  - >-
    While most skvaders and wolpertingers prefer the company of their families
    and packs, occasionally the more adventurous among them come to serve as
    familiars. Service to a powerful spellcaster brings with it protection and
    long-term companionship, which these creatures take advantage of. A neutral
    spellcaster can gain a skvader as a familiar at 3rd level by taking the
    Improved Familiar feat, and a neutral spellcaster can gain a wolpertinger as
    a familiar at 5th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat.
