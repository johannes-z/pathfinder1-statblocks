Description:
  - >-
    Common in a variety of environments and climates, dire weasels are larger
    relatives of normal weasels. They're relentless predators known for their
    fearless nature and killing frenzies, and are dangerous to farmsteads and
    settlements-they not only prey on cattle and horses, but also target
    humanoids. Those that do often become obsessed with the taste of that flesh
    and hunt such prey exclusively. Sometimes, dire weasels are trained to be
    mounts by evil humanoids- usually by bugbears or hobgoblins. Measuring 12
    feet long, a dire weasel stands 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs
    around 900 pounds.
