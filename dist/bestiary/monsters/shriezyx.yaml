SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear of Fire (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shriezyx within 30 feet of a fire the size of a torch or larger becomes
      shaken as long as it remains within that range. If damaged by fire, a
      shriezyx must make a successful Will save (DC equals the amount of fire
      damage dealt) or become frightened for 1 round.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2
      Str; cure 1 save.
  - name: Slowing Toxin (Su)
    description: >-
      A shriezyx's web is coated with a supernatural toxin that numbs and
      deadens the nerves on contact. Any creature struck by a shriezyx's web
      must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or become slowed (as the slow
      spell) for 1 minute. Each round, a victim may attempt a new DC 14
      Fortitude save to end the effect early. This toxin fades quickly from spun
      webs-it can only affect targets on the round the web is spun. Existing
      webs remain sticky and tangled, but do not have this slowing effect. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Devised by a cabal of ancient wizards to serve as guardians for monuments
    and laboratories, shriezyx are horrific spiderlike aberrations created in
    arcane vats out of the flesh of many different creatures. Having outlived
    their creators, they continue to lurk in ruins, caves, and the deep places
    of the world, spreading far beyond the original city where they were
    created. Shriezyx have no natural place in the Ecology, but easily fill the
    niche of any predator of comparable strength. They can subsist on rats and
    other vermin for long periods of time, but relish the opportunity for a more
    substantial meal. Derros, drow, and other subterranean races sometimes use
    them as guards or mounts, or subject them to torturous experimentation.
    These races use bribes of food and the threat of fire to keep the creatures
    in line. Shriezyx can reproduce with their own kind or lay unfertilized eggs
    that hatch into identical copies of their parent. Eggs remain viable for
    years, hatching after exposure to water, fresh air, or consistent warmth. A
    typical shriezyx is 3 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds.
