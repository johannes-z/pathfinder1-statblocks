SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adaptive Strike (Su)
    description: >-
      An ourdivar's natural weapons count as magical and chaotic for the
      purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Once per round as a free action,
      an ourdivar can change the damage type of its natural weapons to
      bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing, thereby allowing it to overcome damage
      reduction of those types as well.
  - name: Warpwave Exit (Su)
    description: >-
      An ourdivar that is killed or that lives out the length of its summoned
      time on the Material Plane erupts in a wave of chaotic energy. Upon the
      death of an ourdivar or when any spell or effect summoning or calling an
      ourdivar ends, 1d4+1 corporeal creatures within 15 feet of the ourdivar
      are affected by a minor warpwave (see the sidebar on page 87). Targets can
      resist the warpwave's effects with a successful DC 15 Fortitude save. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Considered lesser proteans (though greater than voidworms), ourdivars are
    spontaneously formed from and given sentience by the chaotic energies of the
    Maelstrom when spellcasters call them forth. Ourdivars toil at the behest of
    their summoners, acting as tools of chaos across the planes. At the end of
    an ourdivar's brief existence, it departs in a furor of riotous energies,
    warping the area around it as its energy is reabsorbed into the Maelstrom.
  - >-
    Sitting upon a powerful serpentine tail instead of legs, an ourdivar's upper
    body looks akin to that of a bestial humanoid, but its iridescent skin
    constantly changes hue. The ends of both arms shift frequently between
    different weaponlike forms and basic hands that permit the protean to
    inflict a variety of terrible wounds on its opponents. An ourdivar is 12
    feet long and weighs 700 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Ourdivars are a common form of lesser proteans, brought into existence as a
    vessel of chaotic life energies bound into a stable yet temporary form. Only
    powerful spellcasters can summon greater proteans from the Maelstrom, so
    neophyte magic users instead bring forth these temporary creatures.
  - >-
    Ourdivars' humanoid upper bodies differ from the more serpentine outlines
    common to other proteans. Tusked facial features along with strong
    musculature give these proteans an intimidating countenance reminiscent of
    an orc with the build of an ogre. Using its inherent magical abilities, an
    ourdivar can take on the shape of humanoids of various races, often doing so
    to blend in with the allies or enemies of its creator.
  - >-
    The lower arms of an ourdivar mutate in shape, switching from blunt fists to
    razor-sharp blades and giving it the ability to bypass enemy defenses in
    combat. The shape of these weapons changes according to the ourdivar's whim
    to keep opponents off balance and wondering what sort of attack the ourdivar
    will make next.
  - >-
    Of all their powers, the barely contained anarchic energies that infuse
    ourdivars are the most deadly. Upon the destruction of an ourdivar-or at the
    end of the spell or effect that gave it form-the protean detonates in a
    surge of energy known as a minor warpwave. The chaotic outburst of an
    ourdivar is still able to wreak havoc, be that after the ourdivar falls to
    enemies on the battlefield or after it reports back to the peaceful home of
    the one who summoned it.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    The life of an ourdivar is a solitary and often brief affair, as its entire
    existence is based on the whims of those who call it. Unless summoned as
    part of a larger group, ourdivars have little relationship with others of
    their kind, working together with other proteans only if their summoners
    wish it. Unbound greater proteans tend to regard ourdivars and other lesser
    proteans with a mixture of disdain and pity, albeit in their typically
    erratic and unpredictable manners.
  - >-
    Even though they are creatures of pure chaos, ourdivars obey the wishes of
    their creators. Even ourdivars brought into existence by potentially
    long-lasting spells such as planar binding seem content to serve the whims
    of their masters. Perhaps the only divergence from this odd loyalty is that
    of an ourdivar near the end of its lifespan; ourdivars on the verge of death
    move to ensure that their warpwave exit ability affects the greatest
    possible number of targets. Some believe that the fact that ourdivars'
    willingness to serve spellcasters, coupled with the fact that they're easily
    summoned, protects the Maelstrom and its greater inhabitants from the
    interference of spellcasters, and that these outsiders thus serve as an
    immune system of sorts for the Maelstrom.
  - >-
    Binding& Summoning Ourdivars can be found on any plane of existence where
    spellcasters can call them. Most summoners bring forth ourdivars onto the
    Material Plane to serve their immediate needs. When called forth through a
    planar ally spell, ourdivars eagerly negotiate with spellcasters. As the
    first true action of its life, an ourdivar enthusiastically acquiesces to
    its potential master's demands and often accepts reduced payments (but never
    less than 75% of the normal required amount by the spell) in order to
    continue its existence. When an ourdivar does accept a smaller offering, it
    makes sure to return to its master upon the completion of its mission,
    ensuring that the summoner is within range when its task is officially
    complete so the spellcaster will be struck by its departing warpwave.
  - >-
    Chaotic neutral spellcasters able to cast summon monster V can add the
    ourdivar to the list of creatures they can summon with this spell; when
    casting summon monster V in this way, the spell is chaotic.
