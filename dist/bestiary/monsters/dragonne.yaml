SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Roar (Su)
    description: >-
      A dragonne can unleash a devastating roar every 1d4 rounds as a standard
      action. All creatures except dragonnes within 120 feet must succeed at a
      DC 17 Fortitude save or become fatigued. Those within 30 feet who fail
      their saves are also deafened for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic effect. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Possessing the savage instincts of lions with the cunning of brass dragons,
    dragonnes combine the fiercest features of these noble creatures into
    predators both awe-inspiring and deadly.
  - >-
    The origin of dragonnes generates endless speculation. The odds of these
    creatures being direct crossbreeds of dragons and lions are quite remote,
    for numerous reasons: the two creatures rarely share the same territories;
    few creatures as clever as brass dragons would choose to mate with simple
    lions; and dragonne abilities differ significantly from those of metallic
    dragons. While otherworldly breeding experiments and magical mishaps remain
    possibilities, few satisfying explanations make themselves apparent.
  - >-
    Although many creatures rightly fear these ferocious hunters, few dragonnes
    are blatantly evil-most are just highly territorial and seek to defend their
    homes and hunting grounds from interlopers. Creatures that draw too close to
    a dragonne's lair are typically met by the resident's fearsome roar,
    followed by its claws and fangs if this warning is ignored. Those who
    attempt to settle in a dragonne's territory find themselves harassed
    constantly until they decide to leave or the dragonne is slain. These
    intimidating predators spend the majority of their time on the ground, even
    when in combat, since their wings prove somewhat ungainly. They typically
    search for prey and intruders from the air, then land nearby to charge and
    pounce.
  - >-
    Despite their deadliness, dragonnes form strong bonds with those they
    consider members of their pride, sometimes even adopting creatures of other
    races. A character with the Leadership feat can take a dragonne as a cohort.
    Such characters must have an effective leadership level of 10th. Most
    dragonne cohorts gain levels in barbarian, fighter, or ranger.

    A dragonne measures between 10 and 12 feet long and weighs up to 1,200
    pounds.
