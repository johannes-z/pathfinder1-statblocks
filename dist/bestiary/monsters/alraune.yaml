  sweet-smelling flower.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Calming Fragrance (Su)
    description: >-
      A supernaturally sweet perfume that calms the nerves and blunts aggression
      constantly surrounds an alraune to a radius of 60 feet. Any creature in
      this area of effect must make a DC 24 Will save at the start of its turn
      to avoid falling under the effects of calm emotions for 1 round. Creatures
      that could be attracted to the alraune's current apparent gender take a -2
      penalty on this Will save, while all other creatures gain a +2 bonus on
      the save. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Feed (Ex)
    description: >-
      An alraune's roots can feed on a helpless or willing target. At the end of
      an hour of feeding, the victim takes 1d6 points of both Constitution and
      Intelligence drain, and the alraune heals 3d6 points of damage.
Description:
  - >-
    An alraune relies on its supernaturally soothing odor to render enemies
    incapable of making hostile acts against it-even if the alraune attacks a
    foe, its calming scent can wipe away any thoughts of violence from its prey.
    At rest, an alraune appears to be merely a large thorny plant with a single
    enormous and brightly colored flower at its center.
  - >-
    When an alraune attacks, its thorny vines lash out and its flower blooms,
    revealing an attractive, green-skinned humanoid form within. An alraune's
    apparent gender can vary even from encounter to encounter, for the plant can
    reshape its humanoid portions as it desires to increase the likelihood of
    setting its victims at ease. Regardless of the plant's apparent gender, it
    is itself asexual and reproduces (typically once or twice per decade) by
    budding a single offspring over the course of a spring season.
  - >-
    Despite their appearance, alraunes are quite mobile (capable of walking
    almost like a spider upon their numerous long roots and thorny vines). They
    hunt by using commune with nature to locate potential prey, preferring
    humanoid flesh over all others. When an alraune needs prey, it uses its
    mind-affecting abilities to convince foes to dig their own graves and bury
    themselves-once a foe is helplessly buried in the soil, the alraune can feed
    from it via its flesh-burrowing roots, converting the victim's blood and
    memories into the strange nutrients it so craves.
