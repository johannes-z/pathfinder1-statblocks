  - name: Watersense (Ex)
    description: >-
      A pelagos can pinpoint the location of anything within 60 feet that is
      touching the water.
Description:
  - >-
    This great sea spider makes its home in the deep ocean never venturing close
    to the coast or shorelines. Its lair is often made in sunken ships or
    underwater caverns and caves. It sustains itself on a steady diet of fish
    and aquatic plants.
  - >-
    A pelagos is thought to be the creation of an ancient sea god set upon the
    world to either guard or harass ships and waterborne travelers. Many
    cultures revere the great pelagoses as sea gods themselves and often make
    sacrifices to them to ensure a safe ocean journey (or to bring about a curse
    upon the heads of pirates, buccaneers, or other water bandits who have
    wronged the community).
