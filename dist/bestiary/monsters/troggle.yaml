Description:
  - >-
    These dim-witted creatures are a mongrel cross between a troll and an ogre,
    combining the worst features of each. They usually act like animals and move
    on all fours, but can rear up on their hind legs to attack with their sharp
    claws and vicious bites. Some ogres keep them as pets, treating them as
    exceptionally stupid but hilarious kinfolk. Trolls usually kill troggles on
    sight, and have been known to band together to wipe out entire ogre clans
    that possess troggles.
