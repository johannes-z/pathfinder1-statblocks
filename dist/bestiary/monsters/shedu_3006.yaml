  - name: Ethereal Jaunt (Su)
    description: >-
      A shedu can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a free
      action, and shift back again as a move-equivalent action. This ability is
      otherwise identical with the ethereal jaunt spell (caster level 18th).
Description:
  - >-
    Shedus are good creatures found roaming the Material Plane seeking out evil
    and destroying it wherever and whenever they encounter it.
  - >-
    Shedus aid good creatures in need and never knowingly associate with evil
    creatures. They are on good terms with lammasu and ki-rin. Shedu found on
    the Material Plane make their homes in abandoned and ruined temples and
    shrines dedicated to gods of law and good.
  - >-
    Shedu rarely enter combat, but always come to the aid of good creatures in
    need. Shedu relentlessly attack evil on sight, using a combination of their
    hooves and spell-like abilities.
  - >-
    Priests and holy men sometimes seek the advice and wisdom of a shedu and
    will journey great distances to find the knowledge they seek. Some ancient
    cults even worship and pray to the shedu holding them up as deities in their
    culture.
  - A typical shedu is about 8 feet long and weighs about 500 pounds.
