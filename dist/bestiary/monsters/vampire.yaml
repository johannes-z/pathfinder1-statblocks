Description:
  - >-
    Vampires are undead humanoid creatures that feed on the blood of the living.
    They look much as they did in life, often becoming more attractive, though
    some have a hardened, feral look instead. Creating a Vampire "Vampire" is an
    acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more
    Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most vampires were
    once humanoids, fey, or monstrous humanoids. A vampire uses the base
    creature's stats and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base
    creature + 2. AL: Any evil. Type: The creature's type changes to undead
    (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. Senses: A
    vampire gains darkvision 60 ft. Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +6.
    Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected.
    As undead, vampires use their Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit
    points (instead of Constitution). Defensive Abilities: A vampire gains
    channel resistance +4, DR 10/magic and silver, and resistance to cold 10 and
    electricity 10, in addition to all of the defensive abilities granted by the
    undead type. A vampire also gains fast healing 5. If reduced to 0 hit points
    in combat, a vampire assumes gaseous form (see below) and attempts to
    escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly
    destroyed. (It can normally travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.) Additional
    damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at
    rest, the vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is
    no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per
    round. Weaknesses: Vampires cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and
    will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from mirrors or
    strongly presented holy symbols. These things don't harm the vampire-they
    merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet away
    from the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks
    against that creature. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action.
    After 1 round, a vampire can overcome its revulsion of the object and
    function normally each round it makes a DC 25 Will save. Vampires cannot
    enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the
    authority to do so. Reducing a vampire's hit points to 0 or lower
    incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see fast healing). However,
    certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlight
    staggers it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the
    second consecutive round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of
    immersion in running water inf licts damage on a vampire equal to onethird
    of its maximum hit points-a vampire reduced to 0 hit points in this manner
    is destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless vampire's heart
    instantly slays it (this is a full-round action). However, it returns to
    life if the stake is removed, unless the head is also severed and anointed
    with holy water. Speed: Same as the base creature. If the base creature has
    a swim speed, the vampire is not unduly harmed by running water. Melee: A
    vampire gains a slam attack if the base creature didn't have one. Damage for
    the slam depends on the vampire's size (see pages 301-302). Its slam also
    causes energy drain (see below). Its natural weapons are treated as magic
    weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Special Attacks: A
    vampire gains several special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2
    vampire's HD + vampire's Cha modifier unless otherwise noted. Blood Drain
    (Su): A vampire can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the vampire
    establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of
    Constitution damage. The vampire heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit
    points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to
    its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood. Children of the
    Night (Su): Once per day, a vampire can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1
    bat swarms, or 2d6 wolves as a standard action. (If the base creature is not
    terrestrial, this power might summon other creatures of similar power.)
    These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.
    Create Spawn (Su): A vampire can create spawn out of those it slays with
    blood drain or energy drain, provided that the slain creature is of the same
    creature type as the vampire's base creature type. The victim rises from
    death as a vampire in 1d4 days. This vampire is under the command of the
    vampire that created it, and remains enslaved until its master's
    destruction. A vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice
    its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become
    free-willed undead. A vampire may free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave
    a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved
    again. Dominate (Su): A vampire can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a
    standard action. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or
    fall instantly under the vampire's inf luence, as though by a dominate
    person spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet. At the
    GM's discretion, some vampires might be able to affect different creature
    types with this power. Energy Drain (Su): A creature hit by a vampire's slam
    (or other natural weapon) gains two negative levels. This ability only
    triggers once per round, regardless of the number of attacks a vampire
    makes. Special Qualities: A vampire gains the following. Change Shape (Su):
    A vampire can use change shape to assume the form of a dire bat or wolf, as
    beast shape II. Gaseous Form (Su): As a standard action, a vampire can
    assume gaseous form at will (caster level 5th), but it can remain gaseous
    indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.
    Shadowless (Ex): A vampire casts no shadows and shows no ref lection in a
    mirror. Spider Climb (Ex): A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though
    under the effects of a spider climb spell. Ability Scores Str +6, Dex +4,
    Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a vampire has no Constitution
    score. Skills Vampires gain a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Perception, Sense
    Motive, and Stealth checks. Feats Vampires gain Alertness, Combat Ref lexes,
    Dodge, Improved Initiative, Lightning Ref lexes, and Toughness as bonus
    feats. Vampire Spawn A vampire can elect to create a vampire spawn instead
    of a full-f ledged vampire when she uses her create spawn ability on a
    humanoid creature only. This decision must be made as a free action whenever
    a vampire slays an appropriate creature by using blood drain or energy
    drain. A vampire spawn's statistics are identical to those of a wight, save
    for the following changes. • It gains the blood drain and dominate vampire
    special attacks. • It gains channel resistance +2, DR 5/silver, resist cold
    and electricity 10, fast healing 2, and the vampire qualities listed above
    (gaseous form, shadowless, and spider climb). • It does not gain the Create
    Spawn ability. • A vampire spawn gains all of the standard vampire
    weaknesses. • A vampire spawn is CR 4.
