Description_Visual: >-
  A miasmal form roils as barbed tentacles emerge from the central mass,
  coalescing into razor-sharp talons and claws.
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 2
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gaseous (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mihstu can pass through small holes, even cracks, without reducing its
      speed.
  - name: Deadly Embrace (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mihstu that pins an opponent completely surrounds that creature and
      deals 1d2 Constitution damage every round as it siphons away blood, tears,
      and other vital fluids. Maintaining a pin is a free action for a mihstu
      and it does not gain the grappled condition (allowing it to attack other
      creatures with its tentacles).
  - name: Susceptible to Cold (Ex)
    description: >-
      Magical cold stuns a mihstu rather than damaging it. If the creature fails
      its save against a magical cold effect, it is stunned for 1 round and then
      staggered for an additional 1d4 rounds.
  - name: Wind Defense (Ex)
    description: >-
      The churning winds of a mihstu's body automatically deflect nonmagical
      projectiles (such as arrows, bolts, and sling stones). All other ranged
      weapons (including magical projectiles and thrown weapons) have a 20% miss
      chance. Weapons of significant size, such as giant-thrown boulders, siege
      engine projectiles, and other massive ranged weapons are not affected by
      this ability.
Description:
  - >-
    The deadly mihstus hail from the Plane of Air. When they come to the
    Material Plane, they prefer to inhabit dank dungeon corridors, abandoned
    ruins, and the forgotten corridors of lost civilizations. Scholars dispute
    what drives the ambitions of these creatures, or even what they seek on the
    Material Plane, but all agree that they are deadly combatants and merciless
    hunters. Their semi-solid bodies appear to be composed of a strange, white
    smoke, and they can shape their vaporous bodies at will to seep through
    small cracks and openings in pursuit of prey. When attacking, they coalesce
    the tips of their misty tentacles into wickedly barbed talons, slashing at
    opponents with these razor-sharp appendages.
  - >-
    Mihstus rely on their insubstantial nature to close with opponents quickly,
    engulfing the nearest threat while continuing to attack any who seek to
    deprive them of their chosen victim. When a mihstu manages to embrace a foe
    with its body, it drains away the creature's vital fluids at an alarming
    rate. These fluids churn in the creature's body for a few rounds before
    spattering against nearby walls or on the floor-the mihstu seems to gain no
    nourishment from these fluids, so this attack may be nothing more than a
    favorite method of cruelty.
  - >-
    Mihstus are immortal unless slain by violence, and if properly bargained
    with, these deadly outsiders can actually be intriguing sources of
    information. Mihstus are normally interested in little more than stalking
    and consuming prey, and as a result only tend to provide reliable
    information or cooperate when supplied with intriguing victims to pursue and
    destroy. Nefarious creatures such as rakshasas and evil cloud giants often
    utilize mihstus as trackers and assassins, or sometimes employ them as
    guards in the forgotten corridors of their lairs.
