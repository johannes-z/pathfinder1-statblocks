SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Courage (Su)
    description: >-
      A pavbagha is immune to fear, magical or otherwise. Each ally within 10
      feet of it gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects.
      This ability functions only while the pavbagha is conscious, not if it's
      unconscious or dead.
  - name: Fade (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a pavbagha can fade from sight, as invisibility, for
      up to 10 rounds per day. These rounds need not be consecutive.
  - name: Stunning Claw (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability functions like the Stunning Fist feat, except the pavbagha
      uses a claw attack instead of an unarmed strike. The servitor can use this
      ability five times per day. A successful DC 15 Fortitude saving throw
      negates this effect. The save DC is Wisdom-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A pavbagha is the reincarnated soul of an enlightened mortal worshiper of
    Irori transformed into the shape of a white tiger. Having lived one full
    mortal lifetime (if not more), it is patient, calm, and wise. It prefers to
    draw on its experience to guide and instruct mortals on ways to better
    themselves. Many enemies mistake a pavbagha's inner peace for weakness or
    pacifism, but the servitor was a warrior and a fierce predator in previous
    lives, and it quickly leaps into battle to defend its students or confront
    those who would dare destroy knowledge.
  - >-
    Pavbaghas patrol the borders of Irori's realm, alert for disturbances in the
    Serene Circle or forbidden natives of Axis who venture too close to the
    god's territory. Fulfilling the roles of guardians in the mortal world
    pleases pavbaghas, whether they're looking after a special person or
    watching over a sacred site. Although they don't need to eat, they enjoy the
    challenge and exercise of hunting and stalking prey. Rather than killing its
    catch, a pavbagha usually lays a single paw upon its target before allowing
    the creature to run away, secure in its triumph.
  - >-
    Some pavbaghas serve in temples and monasteries dedicated to Irori, where
    they help in training students in physical combat, particularly in how to
    deal with monsters and other dangerous beasts. Others guide students in
    meditation, helping them unravel those quandaries they might have on the
    path to perfection. Still other pavbaghas that make their homes in
    monasteries on the Material Plane focus their efforts on attending to those
    who visit Iroran shrines and temples looking for divine assistance.
  - >-
    A pavbagha measures about 10 to 12 feet long and weighs between 750 and 900
    pounds.
