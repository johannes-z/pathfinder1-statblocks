Description_Visual: >-
  This giant, squid-like beast has thirty to forty tentacles, each about 30 feet
  long. At the end of each tentacle stares a small, round, lidless eye with a
  stark blue pupil. The creature's glossy flesh is inky-black with a slightly
  paler underside centered upon a vicious looking, monstrously-sized, hooked
  beak.

Description:
  - >-
    The gloom crawler is a solitary creature resembling a giant squid with
    blackened skin and a large mass of writhing squid-like tentacles. It makes
    its lair in underground caves, dungeons, and other such subterranean
    complexes far away from the daylight of the surface world and spends most of
    its time dormant, waking every so often to eat.
  - >-
    The gloom crawler moves along its underground world using the suction cups
    on its tentacles to pull itself along. The average gloom crawler has
    anywhere from thirty to forty tentacles, each averaging 15 to 30 feet long.
  - >-
    In addition, each tentacle has a small eye near the tip that allows it to
    see in any direction at any time if it wishes. When prey is encountered the
    gloom crawler brings as many tentacles to bear on a foe as it can, using its
    smaller tentacles to move around during combat.
  - >-
    Gloom crawlers are omnivorous creatures sustaining themselves on a diet of
    subterranean plants, mosses, rodents, and other subterranean fauna. They do
    not, however, turn down the chance for a larger meal, such as that offered
    by a foolhardy adventurer that stumbles into a gloom crawler lair.
  - >-
    When an opponent first approaches a gloom crawler, it lashes out with its
    tentacles attempting to grab a foe. If successful, it hangs on and
    constricts that opponent while fighting off other foes with its other
    tentacles. A held foe is also pulled in close so the gloom crawler can bite
    with its beak. A gloom crawler can bring up to five tentacles to bear on a
    single 5-foot space.
