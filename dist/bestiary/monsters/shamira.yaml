SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Divine Deception (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day while Shamira uses her change shape ability, she can choose
      to emulate a different alignment for the purpose of divination spells that
      reveal auras (such as detect evil). This effect persists as long as she
      carries a holy symbol of a deity of the same alignment she wishes to
      emulate. This holy symbol must have been given to her within the previous
      hour by a worshiper of that deity; Shamira typically secures these symbols
      via mind control. This effect last for 2d6 hours, after which point the
      holy symbol crumbles to ashes. While it lasts, spells and other magical
      effects treat her alignment as if it were the feigned alignment, not her
      true alignment of chaotic evil. If she uses a symbol of Sarenrae to appear
      neutral good, this effect lasts for 24 hours before the symbol crumbles to
      dust.
  - name: Dream Haunting (Su)
    description: >-
      Shamira can use her energy drain attack, mind-affecting spell-like
      abilities, and profane benediction abilities on any creature she
      successfully affects with her nightmare spell-like ability while that
      ability is in effect. Once she uses one of these abilities against her
      target, the nightmare spell ends-she can only use one of these abilities
      per use of nightmare.
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      Shamira's energy drain ability functions like that of a succubus, except
      that it drains 2 levels per use. As a free action as part of this attack,
      she may choose use her burn special attack with her energy drain. With a
      successful DC 36 Will save, a character resists the suggestion implanted
      by this attack, and a successful DC 36 Fortitude save negates the negative
      level after 24 hours. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Fiery Passion (Su)
    description: >-
      Shamira's passions and fires are one. A creature must be immune to both
      fire and mind-affecting effects in order to be immune to fire damage
      caused by Shamira. Creatures immune only to fire instead take fire damage
      as if they instead had fire resistance 10. Creatures with fire resistance
      and no immunity to mind-affecting effects take fire damage from Shamira's
      attacks as if they had no fire resistance.
  - name: Firebow (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, Shamira can conjure a +5 flaming burst unholy composite
      longbow that creates arrows as she fires it. In addition, arrows fired
      from her firebow can inflict her burn special attack. Nascent Demon Lord
      Traits In addition to many of the defenses and abilities incorporated into
      Shamira's statistics above, her weapons (natural and manufactured) are
      treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of resolving damage
      reduction. Also, she can grant spells to her worshipers-she grants access
      to the domains of Chaos, Charm, Evil, and Nobility and the subdomains of
      Demon, Leadership, Love, and Lust.
  - name: Profane Benediction (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as the succubus's profane gift ability, except it
      grants a +4 profane bonus to an ability score of the target's choice
      rather than a +2 bonus. If the target is a worshiper of Sarenrae, the
      target also gains immunity to fire as long as the profane benediction
      persists, even if the worshiper at some point later abandons her faith in
      Sarenrae (as is often the case with those who are eager to keep their
      profane benedictions).
  - name: Summon Demons (Sp)
    description: >-
      As a nascent demon lord, Shamira can summon any demon or combination of
      demons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works,
      and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell.
Description:
  - >-
    Shamira, the Ardent Dream, is the nominal ruler of the isle of Alinythia,
    and by extension the city of Alushinyrra, but with the honor of ruling the
    largest of the Midnight Isles comes with an unwritten caveat-Nocticula's
    palace overlooks the city from its own isle. While this position is one that
    Shamira revels in, and one that has afforded her no small amount of inf
    luence (indeed, it's helped to propel her into the ranks of nascent demon
    lords), the Ardent Dream knows that her mistress watches over her always,
    and surely regards her not only as a valued lover, companion, and minion,
    but also as the closest thing Nocticula has to competition. Of course,
    Shamira does keep an eye out for any opportunity she has to erode some of
    Nocticula's power, for someday she hopes to wear Nocticula's crown.
  - >-
    Shamira is unique in her appearance. Even before she became a nascent demon
    lord, her burning wings and flowing crimson hair marked her as a succubus of
    power. Close-lipped about her history, she appeared in Nocticula's palace
    one moonrise and seduced the Lady in Shadow, thus earning the position of
    Lady of Alinythia. (Nocticula banished Shamira's predecessor, an incubus
    named Ziforian, to the sewers below the city, where he may yet lurk.) None
    in the Abyss recall this majestic and unmistakable succubus in the city
    before her arrival in Nocticula's boudoir. Shamira does little to quell
    rumors that her previous home was a much loftier place than the Abyss, and
    her resemblance to the deity Sarenrae provides endless speculation.
