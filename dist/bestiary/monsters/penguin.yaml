  - name: Toboggan (Ex)

      On snow- or ice-covered terrain, a penguin can move at a rate of 30 feet

Description:
  - >-
    Many varieties of penguins exist, though most display similar
    characteristics. The penguin's most distinctive trait is the tuxedo-style
    coloration of its feathers, which acts as camouf lage while the penguin
    hunts for fish underwater; the black back and flippers allow the penguin to
    blend in with the water when viewed from above, while its white belly
    resembles the bright sky when seen from below water.
  - >-
    A penguin of the most common variety stands roughly 3 feet tall and weighs
    70 pounds. Larger species of penguin can grow to heights of 4 feet and weigh
    as much as 100 pounds.
