  imprinted with a permanent, non-changing smile. Its skin is pinkish-white.

  - name: Immunity to Earth Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      Lava children are immune to all spells and effects with the earth
      descriptor and all spells of the Earth domain.
  - name: Immunity to Metal (Ex)
    description: >-
      Lava children are completely immune to any metal object or weapon and its
      effects (swords, armor, doors, walls, for example). Metal simply passes
      through the lava child as though it did not exist. Metal items are not
      destroyed, just ignored. Any metal weapon (including magic weapons) that
      strikes a lava child deals no damage and simply passes through its body.
      Likewise a lava child can simply walk through metal doors or walls as
      though they did not exist. All attacks against a metal-armored foe are
      considered melee touch attacks as the lava child's attacks simply pass
      through the metal armor.
Description:
  - >-
    Lava children make their lairs deep underground and usually in warmer
    climates. Some lava children build their communities in dying or burned out
    volcanoes as well. Their society as a whole is reclusive, and rarely do lava
    children have dealings with outside races (magmin and fire elementals being
    the exception). Lava children attack with their clawed hands and vicious
    bite. They direct their attacks against the most heavily armored foe (as
    their attacks can pass through armor) in an attempt to weaken their
    opponent's strongest (and probably front line) combatants. Lava Children as
