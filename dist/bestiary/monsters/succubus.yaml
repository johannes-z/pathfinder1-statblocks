SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A succubus drains energy from a mortal she lures into an act of passion,
      such as a kiss. An unwilling victim must be grappled before the succubus
      can use this ability. The succubus's kiss bestows one negative level. The
      kiss also has the effect of a suggestion spell, asking the victim to
      accept another act of passion from the succubus. The victim must succeed
      on a DC 22 Will save to negate the suggestion. The DC is 22 for the
      Fortitude save to remove a negative level. These save DCs are
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Profane Gift (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a full-round action, a succubus may grant a profane gift
      to a willing humanoid creature by touching it for 1 full round. The target
      gains a +2 profane bonus to an ability score of his choice. A single
      creature may have no more than one profane gift from a succubus at a time.
      As long as the profane gift persists, the succubus can communicate
      telepathically with the target across any distance (and may use her
      suggestion spell-like ability through it). A profane gift is removed by
      dispel evil or dispel chaos. The succubus can remove it as well as a free
      action (causing 2d6 Charisma drain to the victim, no save).
Description:
  - >-
    Among the demon hordes, a succubus can often rise to incredible heights of
    power through her manipulations and sensual charms, and many a demonic war
    has raged due to the subtle machinations of such creatures. A succubus is
    formed from the souls of particularly lustful and rapacious evil mortals.
