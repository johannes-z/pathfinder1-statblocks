SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      A fossil golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and abilities function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. • A transmute rock to
      mud spell slows a fossil golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no
      saving throw. • A stone to flesh spell negates its damage reduction and
      petrification ability for 1 round.
  - name: Petrification (Su)
    description: >-
      The attacks of a fossil golem gradually turn living flesh to stone. Each
      time the golem hits a target with one of its natural attacks, the target
      must make a DC 19 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity drain. A
      creature that is reduced to 0 Dexterity by this attack turns completely to
      stone, as if by a flesh to stone spell. Casting stone to flesh on the
      creature removes all Dexterity drain caused by this attack. The save DC is
      Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    A fossil golem is constructed of the stony bones of long-dead dinosaurs and
    other prehistoric creatures. These bones are generally not assembled with
    any attempt to accurately model the original creature-usually, the skulls of
    powerful predatory dinosaurs (such as tyrannosauruses) serve in the place of
    hands, granting the fossil golem a pair of devastating bite attacks. The
    magical energies that infuse a fossil golem create an additional peril-they
    transform fossilization into a terrible form of contagion that can affect
    any creature they damage.
  - >-
    Fossil golems are often used to guard caverns and other natural
    fortifications. A fossil golem at rest might look to the untrained eye like
    nothing more than a strange display of bones. A fossil golem is 20 feet tall
    and weighs 8,000 pounds.
  - Construction
  - >-
    A fossil golem must be constructed from the fossilized skeletons of at least
    two creatures of Huge size or greater. The fossilized bone making up the
    golem requires extensive preservation and reassembly with alchemical
    solutions at a cost of 5,000 gp.
