Description_Visual: >-
  This massive creature appears to be a 30-foot long sleek black centipede with
  a long segmented body and many slender legs. Its huge mandibles are serrated
  and razor-sharp, and its eyes are multi-faceted. A ring of chitinous bone
  protects its oversized head.

  - name: Rend Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a tunnel worm grapples an opponent wearing armor, it attempts to chew
      away the armor with its powerful mandibles. With a successful grapple
      check it deals double its regular bite damage to the opponent's armor.
      Creatures not wearing armor are unaffected by this special attack. Armor
      reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed.
Description:
  - >-
    The tunnel worm is a burrowing creature related to the monstrous centipede.
    It is a very aggressive predator and hunter, though it can sustain itself by
    scavenging. Its preferred food is fresh, raw meat. Tunnel worms are very
    aggressive and attack anything that enters their territory.
  - >-
    Tunnel worms live in mazelike complexes of burrows connected by passages
    they have chewed out over time; these burrows are often filled with the
    rotting remains of past prey, used by the worm to incubate its offspring.
    The favored tactic of the tunnel worm is to lurk beneath the surface of the
    ground or behind a wall until it senses a creature moving by, whereupon it
    burrows out to surprise and attack its prey (treat this attack as a charge
    attack). A tunnel worm that has taken more than half its hit points in
    damage retreats to its lair unless it is cornered, in which case it fights
    to the death.
  - A typical tunnel worm is 30 feet long, but can grow to a length of 60 feet.
