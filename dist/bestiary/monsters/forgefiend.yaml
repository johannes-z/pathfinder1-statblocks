SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adamantine Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      A forgefiend's bite attacks are treated as adamantine for the purposes of
      overcoming damage reduction.
  - name: Rend Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a forgefiend hits with a bite attack, it chews any armor worn by the
      target-this grants the forgefiend a free sunder attempt against armor worn
      by the target if the victim fails a DC 22 Reflex save. A forgefiend also
      gains Greater Sunder and Improved Sunder as bonus feats. The save DC is
      Strength-based.
  - name: Searing Spew (Su)
    description: >-
      A forgefiend can belch forth a searing pile of slag from its body maw as a
      standard action once every 1d4 rounds. This blob of molten metal affects
      any 10-foot-square area adjacent to the forgefiend. Any creature in this
      area takes 14d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 22 halves). The slag
      quickly cools, forming a rugged pile of worthless scrap and misshapen
      metal that is treated as difficult terrain-this stuff crumbles to powder
      in 1 hour. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Scanderigs, more commonly known as "forgefiends," look like large, heavily
    armored, barrel-shaped giants, with enormous mouths in their bellies in
    addition to the normal-sized ones in their heads. They are native to the
    Plane of Earth, but sometimes make their way through subterranean portals
    onto the Material Plane, where they gorge themselves on rich and relatively
    uncontested mineral veins. A forgefiend might live quite happily inside a
    mountain's heart for centuries, only causing trouble when the ore runs out
    or interlopers attempt to mine its territory.

    Forgefiends are particularly feared in many dwarven societies. In addition
    to their penchant for destroying deep forges, they are often portrayed as
    boogeyman-like figures for frightening dwarven children and instilling good
    smithing habits-for it is said, "For every scrap of slag you waste, a
    scanderig is making haste. Those who use excessive ore find forgefiends
    scratching at their door!"
