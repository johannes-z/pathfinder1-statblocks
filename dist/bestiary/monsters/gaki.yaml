SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aversion to Sun and Moon (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gaki takes 1d4 points of fire damage every round it's exposed to the
      light of a full moon. It takes 1d4 points of cold damage every round it is
      exposed to direct sunlight.
  - name: Compulsive Hunger (Ex)
    description: >-
      Despite being undead, a gaki is plagued by an insatiable hunger, and
      believes it can gain a normal body or rest in peace if it consumes the
      right mixture of flesh, food, and drink. A gaki that finds a corpse or is
      offered food, wine, holy water, or flowers must succeed at a DC 20 Will
      save or spend one turn trying to grab and consume it. Its narrow neck
      prevents it from swallowing more than a tiny amount, and it gives up after
      1 round of attempting to do so. A gaki that consumes holy water in this
      way is not harmed by it.
Description:
  - >-
    When an especially jealous or greedy evil person dies, it sometimes returns
    as a gaki-a misshapen creature with a supernatural hunger for things of the
    material world. Mistakenly called "hungry ghosts" because of their ability
    to fly and turn invisible, gakis believe that if they consume the right
    material-typically meat, wine, blood, flowers, and souls-they can form a new
    body resembling their former mortal shapes. Its long, thin neck restricts
    how much it can eat, and the creature is perpetually starving. It prefers to
    consume evil creatures, believing it gains more sustenance from a sinful
    being than a righteous one, but it won't pass up any mortal flesh. Some
    gakis believe they must consume flesh from demons or undead, and fixate on
    these creatures to the aversion of all others. Gakis are cursed, pitiable
    creatures with nothing to lose, which makes them very dangerous. Some that
    have existed for many years as undead grow desperate and try consuming
    earth, sewage, or more vile substances in an attempt to find the missing
    ingredient for their transformation. Particularly unfortunate ones bear an
    onerous curse that causes anything they try to eat to burst into flame or
    wither away into dust. These creatures have short memories and little sense
    of perspective. They're smart enough to pursue what they want cannily, but
    fail at making long-term plans. Most gakis wander alone, pursuing their
    search for nourishment in solitude. When they do form packs, they use their
    numbers to surround and bring down large animals or groups of people, but
    then throw cooperation aside to squabble and shove as each one greedily
    tries to claim the entire prize they've taken. Strangely, gakis are scorched
    by moonlight and frozen by sunlight. Because of this, they're forced to lurk
    in the shadows of ruins. Some wander the deep caves and tunnels below the
    surface, scrounging whatever meals they can find. In urban areas, they group
    together to stalk the slums, often leaping upon victims, tearing away small
    morsels of flesh before they retreat, leaving victims bleeding and
    disoriented. They find hiding places- often in abandoned buildings or
    sewers- to stay during the day, turning invisible and biding their time till
    the dark of night comes.
