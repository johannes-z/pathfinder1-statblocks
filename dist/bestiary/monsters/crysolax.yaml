SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Petrifying Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      The bite of a crysolax deals 1d6 points of Dexterity damage. A creature
      reduced to Dex 0 is turned to crystal (as the stone to flesh spell)
      permanently if it fails a DC 25 Fortitude save. The save DC is
      Constitution-based and includes a +2 bonus from the crysolax's Ability
      Focus feat.
  - name: Scintillating Aura (Ex)
    description: >-
      As long as there is a light source present within 30 feet of it, the
      crysolax constantly radiates an aura that duplicates the effects of a
      rainbow pattern spell (CL 15th). The save is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A terrifying predator native to the Plane of Earth (and also a pocket
    dimension known as the Demiplane of Crystal), the crysolax is a hunter,
    active most often during the daylight hours. During the day, natural
    sunlight refracts from the crysolax causing it to appear to be a multitude
    of different colors. It uses this natural sunlight to activate its aura when
    hunting or in combat.
  - >-
    A crysolax spends its days hunting creatures native to the Plane of Earth,
    while at night, the creature is usually found in its lair, a large and
    complex maze of twisting corridors, caverns, and spiraling tunnels located
    deep within the rocky earth of its native plane. A crysolax lair usually
    consists of 2-4 adults and twice that number in smaller noncombatant
    crysolax. The female lays 4-8 large crystal eggs usually once per year.
    These eggs usually hatch within 60 days and a crysolax reaches maturity
    within two years. Its lair is also scattered with any treasure it may have
    gathered. Though not a creature known for collecting treasure, a crysolax is
    quite fond of gemstones, and as such a large amount of said treasure usually
    can be found in its lair. While a crysolax has no need to eat, some do enjoy
    ingesting certain gemstone (the exact type seems to vary between each
    crysolax).
  - >-
    A crysolax attacks with its bite, attempting to petrify the strongest
    opponents first. It also rakes and slashes with its razor-sharp claws or
    grabs a foe and repeatedly subjects it to its bite attack, knowing that
    eventually the victim will succumb to its petrifying nature.
