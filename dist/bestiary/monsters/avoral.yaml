SpecialAbilities:

    description: >-
      This ability works like the spell (caster level 14th), except it only
      affects the avoral, the avoral must concentrate for 1 full round before it
      takes effect, and it remains as long as the avoral concentrates.
Description:
  - >-
    Avorals are generally human-shaped, but their upper limbs are great wings
    with a human-like hand at the end of each, allowing avorals to use tools and
    weapons, though in battle they prefer to attack from the air and slash with
    the large claws on their feet and buffets from their great wings. An
    avoral's head has a feathery cowl instead of hair, typically brown, white,
    gray, or golden, and its facial features are bird-like, with a large nose
    and piercing eyes. Its bones are hollow but strong, making it ideal for
    flying. Like eagles, avorals have phenomenal vision, and can see fine
    details even at great distances.
  - >-
    Though on their home plane they are content to soar among the clouds and
    challenge each other to diving contests among the mountain peaks, in war
    avorals are the scouts, spies, and messengers of the agathions. With their
    incredible speed, phenomenal eyesight, and magical powers, they can sneak
    into an area, spy on whatever lives there, silently converse with the local
    fauna for additional information, and fly or teleport out again with a
    comprehensive report. They are experts at hit-and-run attacks and are often
    responsible for ferrying other celestial soldiers to battle.
  - A typical avoral is 7 feet tall but weighs only 120 pounds.
