Description:
  - >-
    Warden jacks are miniscule metal objects in the shape of a ball covered in
    sharp spikes. These things are able to move on their own by retracting their
    spikes, and rolling along the ground. They are commonly used as guardians by
    wizards and nobles who fear the intrusion of thieves.
  - >-
    Warden jacks never attack their creator and can be programmed to avoid
    specific individuals or types of individuals, or to attack only specific
    types of individuals, or attack only under specific conditions as specified
    by the creator.
  - >-
    These constructs are capable of guarding an entire floor or area, but are
    unable to climb up stairs and are stopped by closed doors or other
    impassable objects that they cannot fit through. They can, however, fall
    down stairs or navigate even the steepest of slopes.
  - >-
    Warden jacks resemble caltrops somewhat, and typically range from 1-3 inches
    in diameter.
  - >-
    Warden jack swarms have two modes of attack: as moving caltrops, or as
    rolling marbles. They set themselves up for combat by rolling into the path
    of their opponents and extending their spikes. Once combat begins, most of
    them roll around continually, extending their spikes and attempting to wound
    an opponent. Some remain in spheroid form in order to get under the feet of
    a foe and bring it to the ground. Extending or retracting spikes is a free
    action for the warden jack swarm.
  - >-
    Construction Individual warden jacks are formed from hardened steel and
    molded into their spherical shape. The steel used must be of high quality
    and cost at least 1,000 gp.
