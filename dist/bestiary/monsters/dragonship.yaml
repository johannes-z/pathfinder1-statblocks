    description: >-
      A captain merely has to whisper into the ear of the dragon-head and make a
      Profession (sailor) check (DC 15) to get the dragonship to understand its
      course. A dragonship never gets lost on an ocean voyage, and has a 50%
      chance of automatically being aware of any safe coastline, seaside towns
      and villages, and hidden ocean dangers such as reefs and sandbars (it only
      knows of such dangers if they are in the volume of sea charts used in its
      creation).
  - name: Winds (Su)
    description: >-
      At will, a dragonship can cause winds to fill its sails. This operates as
      the control winds spell (caster level 10th) with the restriction that it
      can only increase the wind's force for the purposes of propulsion. The
      winds are generated from a point beyond and slightly above the
      dragonship's stern. A dragonship cannot use these winds to attack; their
      sole purpose is propulsion.
Description:
  - >-
    A dragonship is an animated sailing vessel-essentially a massive wood golem
    in the form of a longship. It is identical to a longship in every way except
    that it is only 20 feet long. It has a standard square-rigged sail, and 10
    oars (5 on each side). Using its oars or its ability to generate winds on
    its own, a dragonship is rarely at the mercy of the weather. It has an
    instinctive understanding of local sea charts and navigation routes. Its
    primary function is as a transport that needs no crew; it can be told one's
    destination and it will sail there by the quickest route possible.
  - >-
    Although generally used as a warship, a dragonship's primary function is
    that of a sailing vessel. A dragonship is not particularly adept at combat
    and it cannot maneuver to defend itself if it is beached; in such cases it
    relies on its crew for defense. A dragonship bites and breathes fire with
    its dragon-like head, and can use up to four oars to slap at foes that
    approach from the flanks.
  - >-
    As a sailing vessel a dragonship can carry up to 30 passengers and up to 35
    tons of cargo. Its speed is that of a normal longship.

    Construction A dragonship's body is a constructed similar to a normal
    longship fitted with a dragon-head mounted on the bow. The ship costs 10,000
    gp and the figurehead costs 1,000 gp. Also required is a volume of sea
    charts and maps (total value at least 200 gp), to be burned in the mouth of
    the dragonship's head upon completion of its construction. Consumed in the
    fire, the distilled knowledge of the sea charts provides the dragonship with
    its ability to navigate.
