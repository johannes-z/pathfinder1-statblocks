SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adaptive Learning (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gearsman has a number of skill points equal to 4 + its Int modifier per
      Hit Die, and treats Craft and Profession as class skills beyond those
      possessed by all robots. In addition, a gearsman has a number of bonus
      skill ranks equal to its Hit Dice that can be reprogrammed to apply to any
      skill-these ranks cannot be split among multiple skills and must all apply
      to one skill. A gearsman may change what skill these bonus ranks apply to
      up to once per day by concentrating for 1 minute, during which time it can
      take no other actions. Rather than spend these bonus ranks on a skill, a
      gearsman can choose to devote them to weapon knowledge, gaining
      proficiency with a single weapon instead of bonus ranks in a skill. All
      gearsmen are automatically proficient with all simple weapons.
  - name: Charge Weapon (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any metal melee weapon wielded by a gearsman becomes charged with
      electricity and deals +1d6 points of electricity damage on a hit.
      Self-Repair (Ex) A gearsman's nanites heal it of damage at the rate of a
      number of hit points per hour equal to its Hit Dice (4 hit points per hour
      for most gearsmen). Up to once per day, as a full-round action, it can
      heal any robot it touches of 4d6 points of damage-if a gearsman uses this
      ability on itself, it automatically heals the maximum amount: 24 points of
      damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Of all the impossible artifacts of Silver Mount, none has been a greater
    boon to the Technic League than the fabled gearsmen. For reasons known only
    to themselves, many of these robots serve the artificers of the Technic
    League as shock troops and guards, performing their tasks with mechanical
    detachment and coldly logical efficiency. Yet they serve a purpose beyond
    Numeria, disobeying their putative masters whenever orders contradict their
    mysterious internal directives. When questioned about their lapses, a
    gearsman answers only with endlessly patient silence.
