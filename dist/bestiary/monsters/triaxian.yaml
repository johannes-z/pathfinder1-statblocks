      Triaxians suffer no harm from being in hot or cold environments depending
      on whether they are Summerborn or Winterborn. Summerborn Triaxians can
      exist comfortably in conditions between 90 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit
      without having to attempt Fortitude saves. Winterborn Triaxians can exist
      comfortably in conditions between 40 and -20 degrees Fahrenheit without
      having to attempt Fortitude saves. When in conditions of severe cold or
      heat, Triaxians only have to attempt Fortitude saves once per hour instead
      of once every 10 minutes. Transitional Triaxians do not have this ability.
Description:
  - >-
    Triaxians are the dominant race on the planet Triaxus, a world whose erratic
    orbit causes exceptionally long and disparate seasons. Though eerily similar
    to humans, elves, and the other mammalian humanoids common on Golarion,
    Triaxians have developed certain adaptations to their environment that mark
    them as indisputably alien.
  - >-
    Just like human ethnicities, Triaxian populations vary in size, weight, and
    other distinguishing physical characteristics, based primarily on the
    geographical regions in which they reside. Most Triaxians, both males and
    females, are around 6 feet tall but somewhat lean compared to humans, rarely
    weighing more than 200 pounds. Their ears are elongated, but rather than
    being pointed like elves or half lings, these appendages are instead notched
    in a feathered or comblike pattern. The flaps created by these notches
    constantly move to adjust the ear's shape, operating both consciously and
    unconsciously to help Triaxians focus on specific sounds, not unlike the
    maneuverable ears of dogs, cats, and other such animals.
  - >-
    Like many creatures on their world, Triaxians have evolved to shift along
    with their environment, resulting in differences between generations of the
    same family that would seem bizarre to humanoids from Golarion. In the warm
    summer years, Triaxians are completely hairless, with skin that ranges from
    deep red to coffee-colored to charcoal black. This configuration allows them
    to better survive in the sweltering heat of the planet's tropical summers,
    with the increased melanin in their dark skin protecting them from the sun's
    intense rays. These Summerborn Triaxians, as they are known, breed true for
    many generations-yet as the planet begins its rapid seasonal shift, so do
    the Triaxians. Newborn Triaxians begin to evince new adaptations to the
    cooling environment, and by the time winter has come on in full, Triaxians
    change markedly: their pale bodies are covered in fine, insulating white fur
    like that of an ermine, while their eyes narrow to elongated slits to
    protect against snowblindness. These new traits similarly breed true until
    the seasons begin to change once more, at which point the eyes widen and fur
    recedes, starting the cycle anew.
  - >-
    Just as Triaxians differ physically depending on which season they're born
    into, so do their cultures and customs change. Winterborn Triaxians are
    defined by the hardship of a world whose very environment seeks to starve or
    freeze them. They tend to be stolid, hardworking people, with an ironclad
    sense of honor stemming from the knowledge that in a Triaxian winter, a
    broken promise can mean death for a whole clan. Even within large
    communities, the focus remains on survival for one's family and friends,
    with individuals willing and ready to share, serve, and die to protect the
    group. Oaths of friendship are serious affairs; once given they are rarely
    transgressed, and doing so risks a blood feud. With the exception of those
    nomadic hunter tribes that migrate in pursuit of herd animals, most
    settlements are permanent and fortified against the predatory horrors that
    stalk the blinding blizzards.
  - >-
    Summerborn Triaxians, by contrast, are born into a world of plenty. With
    forests full of fruit and game, and glaciers receding to reveal vast tracts
    of fertile earth, the attachment to cold stone fortresses and cramped cities
    weakens, and Triaxians spread out across the landscape. For many, it is a
    time of nomadism, living in small bands and temporary structures, or else
    participating in great waves of land-grabs as homesteaders. Though they
    still have the weight of history to remind them of the hardships of their
    ancestors-and those yet to come for their descendants- Summerborn Triaxians
    tend to be an easy-going, generous people, quick to accept outsiders, to
    break with their clans and families and strike out on their own, and to
    challenge convention in pursuit of greater goals. They are simultaneously
    less hardened and more likely to go to war, for with the business of
    survival taking less energy and new territory constantly being settled,
    leaders have more time and resources to dispute borders and jockey for
    power. Historically, Summerborn Triaxians are those most likely to visit
    other planes or worlds, as the drive to explore their newly thawed planet
    also leads them to look beyond it.
  - >-
    Transitional Triaxians occupy a much smaller portion of the Triaxian
    adaptation cycle than either the Summerborn or Winterborn-usually no more
    than a generation each orbital year-and often play an uncomfortable role in
    their society. To Summerborn Triaxians, a Transitional child is an ill
    omen-a sign that winter approaches, and that the time of plenty is drawing
    to a close. The first such individuals to appear are often hidden or slain
    by their parents, and vilified by those rebellious fools and leaders who
    believe that Transitional children actively bring on the winter, or who
    simply don't want to begin the long and arduous process of preparing for
    future generations' survival. Transitional children born at the tail of
    winter, on the other hand, are often treasured and held up as hopeful signs
    of a golden era to come. Yet even these may face persecution by those
    dynasties that fear change, or whose leaders expect a loss of power once
    their people are free to spread beyond their reach. In both cases,
    Transitional Triaxians find themselves in a society where they are visibly
    different from both their parents and their children, and where their very
    existence is a weighty portent.
  - >-
    Strangely, while Triaxians' mutable nature is perfectly adapted to their
    planet's erratic orbit, the cycle of physiological changes seems keyed to
    internal clocks rather than external indicators. Even in situations where
    these adaptations would be disadvantageous, the small populations of
    Triaxians who have set up residence on other worlds or planes continue to
    change in time with their kindred on Triaxus.
  - >-
    Beyond their obvious adaptations to their environment, Triaxians are
    remarkably human. Their basic biology, social structures, cultures, and
    philosophy-while sometimes surprising to outsiders-all fall well within the
    bounds of what might be encountered in a humanoid race on Golarion, thus
    making them one of the least "alien" civilizations in Golarion's solar
    system. Though the statistics above represent a typical initiate training to
    become a Dragonrider of the Skyfire Mandate, this is by no means the
    standard for the race-outside of broad strokes, it's as impossible to
    describe Triaxians' myriad traits and predispositions as it would be to do
    so for humanity itself. Triaxians are good and evil, warlike and peaceful,
    magical and mundane, and everything in between.
