SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      Vishkanyas are skilled with poison and never accidentally poison
      themselves when using or applying poison.
  - name: Toxic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A number of times per day equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum
      1/day), a vishkanya can envenom a weapon that it wields with its toxic
      saliva or blood (using blood requires the vishkanya to be injured when it
      uses this ability). Applying venom in this way is a swift action.
      Vishkanya Venom: Injury; save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 the vishkanya's Hit Dice +
      the vishkanya's Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds;
      effect 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save.
Description:
  - >-
    Vishkanyas are a race of exotic humanoids known for their guile and affinity
    for poisons of all kinds. A vishkanya's flesh is made up of fine scales that
    from a distance of even a few feet look just like particularly smooth skin.
    These scales are usually a single dark color, although some of them have
    complex patterns like stripes or even spirals. A vishkanya's tongue is
    forked like a serpent's tongue, and its eyes lack visible pupils.
  - >-
    Although legends abound that the merest touch from a vishkanya can slay a
    mortal humanoid, these tales are patently false. A vishkanya's skin is no
    more poisonous than that of any human, but it is true that their blood,
    spit, and other bodily fluids can be dangerous. Vishkanyas are skilled in
    using their own spittle or even their blood to envenom their weapons, and
    those who fight them should be wary of exposure to the vishkanya's poison. A
    vishkanya is 6 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds.
