SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Curse of Stone (Su)
    description: >-
      Curse-touch; save Fort DC 17; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6
      Dex. A creature afflicted by the curse of stone slowly turns to stone, its
      skin turning an ashen gray and hardening into a stony texture. For every 3
      points of Dexterity damage taken, the victim gains a +1 natural armor
      bonus. The curse of stone can only be cured by removing the curse followed
      by a stone to flesh spell to undo the damage it has done. If the curse is
      not removed first, stone to flesh only restores 1d3 points of Dexterity,
      though these can be lost again as the curse continues to spread. The save
      DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Petrified Body (Ex)
    description: >-
      The stony flesh of a petrified maiden reacts to certain spells and effects
      as noted below. • A transmute rock to mud spell deals 1d6 points of damage
      per caster level to a petrified maiden, with no saving throw. • Transmute
      mud to rock immediately heals any and all damage taken by a petrified
      maiden. • A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the petrified
      maiden's structure, but negates its damage reduction and spell resistance
      for 1 round.
  - name: Reconstitution (Su)
    description: >-
      As long as Geb's original curse that first afflicted the petrified maidens
      remains unbroken, any petrified maiden (animate or not) that is damaged or
      destroyed slowly returns to its undamaged form, even if parts of it were
      utterly destroyed or carried away. For a relatively undamaged petrified
      maiden, this slow process can be completed in a week or so. For a
      petrified maiden reduced to rubble, it might take years. If a petrified
      maiden is destroyed while under the effects of a stone to flesh spell, it
      cannot reconstitute and is permanently destroyed.
  - name: Weapon Expertise (Ex)
    description: >-
      A petrified maiden is proficient with any one martial weapon. It gains a
      +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with this weapon.
Description:
  - >-
    Petrified maidens are the remains of the army of warrior women led by the
    pirate queen Mastrien Slash in her failed invasion of southern Geb. The
    wizard king Geb himself cursed the warriors, turning them to stone and
    creating what is now known as the Field of Maidens. While a petrified maiden
    appears at first glance to be a construct, it has in fact been animated by
    the restless undead spirit of the warrior maiden it once was. The nature of
    Geb's curse remains mysterious even today-it is simply known that
    occasionally the spirits of the slain inhabit their stony corpses and lurch
    to vengeful unlife. When this occurs, the maiden's stone weapon changes to
    steel (though it remains fused within the maiden's grasp). The weapon can be
    recovered when the maiden is destroyed.
  - >-
    Connected to one another by some unknown force-perhaps a side effect of
    Geb's curse-those petrified maidens whose remains have been removed from the
    Field of Maidens do everything in their power to rejoin their sisters.
