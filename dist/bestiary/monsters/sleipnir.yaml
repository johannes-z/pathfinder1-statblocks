SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a sleipnir can exhale a 30- foot cone of shimmering,
      rainbow-colored light. Every creature in the area is randomly struck by
      one or more beams, as a prismatic spray spell (DC 22 half or negates). The
      sleipnir may use this ability once every 1d6 rounds, up to 3 times per
      day. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Sleipnirs are a legendary breed of magical, eight-legged horses. Most
    sleipnirs have jet-black coats and long, flowing manes and tails, though
    occasionally a sleipnir
  - >-
    foal is born with a white or shimmering silver coat. Such rare sleipnirs
    sometimes display additional abilities beyond those of their darker kin. A
    typical sleipnir stands 6 to 7 feet tall at the shoulder, measures about 12
    feet long, and weighs upward of 1,600 pounds.
  - >-
    Believed to be descended from the mystical steeds of gods, sleipnirs have
    spread throughout the Material Plane. While sleipnirs cannot actually fly,
    they are able to walk on air as easily as on land, and spend much of their
    time galloping across the skies of their homes. Although sleipnirs lack the
    ability to travel between planes themselves, riders have brought them as
    mounts far beyond the Material Plane, and populations of sleipnirs can be
    found on several of the more hospitable Outer Planes as well.
  - >-
    Sleipnirs are highly prized as steeds, but as intelligent magical beasts,
    they cannot be trained using the Handle Animal skill, and those trying to do
    so find them intractable and even violent. Although they cannot speak,
    sleipnirs understand Auran, and one seeking a sleipnir as a mount must
    convince the creature to serve using Diplomacy, Intimidate, or other means.
    Sleipnirs are generally indifferent to most creatures, meaning they can be
    found serving as steeds to creatures of all alignments, from good to evil.
  - >-
    Riding a sleipnir requires no equipment other than a normal saddle, and they
    are well trained in combat from birth. A rider does not need to make a Ride
    check to control a sleipnir in battle, but must make a Ride check to attack
    in the same round that the sleipnir attacks. A sleipnir can carry 519 pounds
    as a light load, 1,038 pounds as a medium load, and 1,560 pounds as a heavy
    load.
