    description: >-
      Tomb giants can cast make whole as a spell-like ability, but only for the
      purposes of creating undead creatures. For example, a tomb giant can use
      this ability to aid in the creation of a necrocraft (Pathfinder RPG
      Bestiary 4 200), to restore armor to be used for the creation of a phantom
      armor (Bestiary 4 213), or even to repair the armor of a graveknight
      (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 138).
  - name: Energy Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A tomb giant can channel its energy drain attack through any melee weapon
      it wields.
  - name: Sinister Synergy (Su)
    description: >-
      Multiple tomb giants can combine their efforts to gain the ability to
      create undead. When two or more tomb giants are within 30 feet of each
      other, they can work together to use create undead as a spell-like ability
      (caster level 13th). Three or more tomb giants working in unison in this
      way can use greater create undead as a spell-like ability (caster level
      15th). Every additional tomb giant beyond the third who participates in
      this synergy increases the caster level of this effect by 1.
Description:
  - >-
    Since the time Urgathoa first fled the Boneyard, there have been living
    creatures that have given their allegiance to powers that offer the promise
    of existence eternal.

    Tomb giants are an entire race of humanoids who have given themselves over
    to necromancy, and in so doing have gained sinister powers. These giants are
    born as the living agents of undeath, and they show great skill in creating
    all manner of undead creatures-even from their own kind. Tomb giants fully
    expect to be transformed after they die, though most don't have to worry
    about the cost of sacrificing their experiences and memories, for they know
    their brothers and sisters can raise intelligent undead much greater than
    shambling zombies or clattering skeletons.
  - >-
    Tomb giants possess an alabaster complexion. They are devoid of all body
    hair and have smooth, rounded features and marbleized skin. Tomb giants
    often tattoo their pale skin with arcane symbols in stark black ink. The
    sclerae of their eyes are jet black, and ghostly white pupils glow in the
    centers. They move with an eerie, silent grace for humanoids of their size,
    and rarely talk unless it is necessary. Tomb giants favor simple clothing,
    typically wearing togas at home and hooded cloaks when they emerge from
    their shadowy lairs. The average tomb giant stands 11 to 13 feet tall and
    weighs approximately 1,300 pounds. Tomb giants can live for up to 400 years.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Tomb giants were created as an offshoot of taiga giants, forged by a
    Runelord of Gluttony during Thassilon's rule. When this ancient necromancer
    discovered the taiga giants' ability to sense and direct the life energy
    that pulses through every living creature, he hid a number of them away a
    secret complex deep beneath Golarion's surface. Using a now-lost ritual, the
    runelord altered the essence of these specimens to create the first tomb
    giants. He wanted to use the new species of giants as a deadly army of
    necromancers against the other runelords, but the conniving Runelord of
    Gluttony died before he could enact his plan, and his project was lost to
    the mists of time. The tomb giants lingered in their isolation for
    generations before they began to spread throughout the Darklands.
  - >-
    These days, tomb giants are born rather than created, though it would be a
    misnomer to call their procreation natural. The giants' adaptation to their
    unwholesome powers has come at a cost, for tomb giants have trouble
    conceiving except during a small window of time (not much longer than an
    hour) after they have drained a portion of the life energy from another
    living creature. It is therefore common for tomb giants to take prisoners
    and keep them on hand for when they wish to conceive children.
  - >-
    Although tomb giants possess inherent powers of necromancy, they are not
    undead. They aren't particularly troubled by sunlight (aside from their
    tendency to sunburn), but they have an instinctual dislike of bright
  - >-
    light and open spaces. They are omnivorous and have no qualms about
    consuming sentient humanoids. By the time tomb giants are 10 years old, they
    are as large as an adult human and are capable of hunting and fighting. They
    reach maturity by age 50 or 60, when they gain full use of their magical
    abilities. When tomb giants die, their families or friends often transform
    them into sentient undead creatures or use the deceased giants' parts in the
    creation of other undead abominations. Tomb giants view their mortal life
    spans much as humans view puberty: as merely one stage in the development of
    the individual. An undead tomb giant is likely to be valued as a family
    elder.
  - >-
    For tomb giants, sentient undeath represents the perpetual continuation of
    self-identity, and is the highest hope for those still alive. Thus, some of
    the most feared tomb giant punishments consist of execution followed by the
    offender's transformation into a mindless undead. Such unfortunates are
    often turned into an eternal servant, and are sometimes passed down from
    generation to generation within families.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Tomb giants prefer enclosed spaces and underground lairs. While tombs and
    crypts can serve as lairs, tomb giants are more commonly found in renovated
    cave systems near the surface and in scattered pockets in the Darklands.
  - >-
    Tomb giants have no compunction about living among undead, but are
    circumspect about their own safety and well aware that some undead have no
    loyalty to the living. It's common to create undead horrors from the corpses
    of lesser creatures to use as servants or guards-smaller undead are often
    used as components for necrocrafts.
  - >-
    Tomb giants are a secretive race, and go to extraordinary lengths to pursue
    and capture anyone they catch spying on them. Surrounding themselves with
    undead creatures (most of which are under their control) has provided the
    giants the secrecy they crave, as the dead don't utter secrets. Some
    folktales speak of silent, pale folk of impossible height who come out of
    the night in pursuit of a victim who has "seen something no one should see."
    These stories have a grain of truth to them, and invariably end with the
    foolhardy individual vanished from his home, never to be seen again. Those
    few fortunate enough to have escaped with their lives bear scars of their
    interactions with the sinister giants, and survivors tell tales of pale
    giants who made light conversation with their victims while preparing to
    cook them. Darker tales hint at the tomb giants' perverse mating rituals,
    wherein chained victims are drained of their life force and left hanging on
    the walls, bearing witness to the giants' frenzied couplings before the pale
    creatures eat their weakened captives alive. Wherever these alabaster fiends
    tread, horror and madness is sure to follow.
