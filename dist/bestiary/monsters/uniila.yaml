Description_Visual: >-
  The curves of a shapely maiden define the outline of a mysterious figure
  wrapped in mist and strips of ancient robes. From beneath the rune-embroidered
  tatters stretch four, corpse-pale arms, each bearing either a blade or some
  mysterious arcane device. Hidden within the cowl of its hood shimmer the
  faintest outlines of a veiled face and a pair of eyes flickering with barely
  restrained energy.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dread Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      All spells an uniila casts draw upon terrible infernal eddies and the
      torment of damned souls. As such, all of an uniila's spells (not her
      spell-like abilities) are strange and terrible to behold. This increases
      the Spellcraft DC required to identify an uniila's spell as it is being
      cast by +5. In addition, at will, an uniila can choose to make a spell she
      casts particularly frightening. Any creature forced to make a saving throw
      to resist a spell cast by an uniila must make an additional Will save at
      the same DC or be shaken for 1 round. This effect can potentially increase
      the severity of other fear effects. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
  - name: Infernal Arcana (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, after spending a minute whispering strange formulas and
      cosmic truths, an uniila can grant an adjacent mortal spellcaster
      additional profane insight into the ways of magic. This counts as a bonus
      spell prepared or spell per day of 6th level or lower, which is
      immediately accessible by the target in addition to all its regular
      spells. The uniila chooses what spell to grant the target. It need not be
      a spell already known by the target, though it must be of 6th level or
      lower and of a level he can cast or from his class's spell list. This
      spell remains available to the target for 24 hours. The spell can be any
      arcane or divine spell. An uniila can never use this ability on herself or
      non-mortal targets. Once a target chooses to make use of this spell, it is
      cast at the uniila's caster level (typically 8th) and is treated as having
      the evil subtype. In addition, as the uniila chooses, she may
      spontaneously add the effects of any metamagic feat to the spell (without
      the spell being treated as though it were of an increased spell level).
      Typically, uniilas use this ability to compel magic users to rely on them
      for more powerful magic, though they might also use effects like Widen
      Spell to affect unintended targets.
  - name: Scroll Mastery (Su)
    description: >-
      All uniilas possess Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat. An uniila is treated as
      knowing all spells of 6th level or lower in the Pathfinder RPG Core
      Rulebook and can create scrolls of any of those spells. Whether an uniila
      knows rarer magic is decided by the GM.
  - name: Summon Devil (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, an uniila can attempt to summon 2d4 imps with a 55% chance
      of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.
  - name: Witch Token (Su)
    description: >-
      By spending an hour in concentration, an uniila can create a token of
      arcane power. This token may take any form that takes up an item slot, and
      typically appears as a subtly fiendish ring, amulet, or similar piece of
      jewelry. While it is worn by a mortal, all of the DCs of any spells the
      wearer casts increase by +1 (this effect stacks with Spell Focus).
      However, while wearing a witch token, the bearer takes a -5 penalty on all
      saves made to resist spells and effects cast by the token's creation.
      Also, while the token is being worn, the uniila can effectively scry
      through the token at will and without the wearer's knowledge as long as he
      remains on the same plane. Spells and effects that typically bar or
      confound scry also affect the witch token. As a standard action, an uniila
      can cause her witch token to erupt in a burst of destructive magic that
      deals 10d6 points of damage to the wearer. An uniila can only ever have
      one witch token in existence at a time and must destroy a previously
      created token before creating a new one. The damage of this effect is
      based on the uniila's Hit Dice. All witch tokens are also under effects
      similar to magic aura, and are detected as possessing auras of moderate
      universal magic. Those who use identify or a similar spell must succeed at
      a DC 20 Will save to receive correct information (that the token sheds an
      aura of strong divination). Detect evil reveals no aura from a witch
      token. The saving throw is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The tools devils use to ensnare the minds and ultimately the souls of their
    victims vary incredibly, from the most blatant of infernal corruptions to
    enticements that seem not like temptations at all. The elusive cabal devils,
    or uniilas as they are known by diabolists, employ one of the most seductive
    drugs in existence in their snares: magic. Mistresses of the arcane with an
    understanding of the cultic arts-both arcane and divine-that rivals even
    that of many greater fiends, these mysterious and aloof sages haunt the most
    ancient ruins and moldering depths of Stygia, the fifth layer of Hell,
    researching arcana and puzzling over formulae destined to shake the cosmos.
    When conjured forth or left to their own devices upon the Material Plane,
    uniilas make no untoward offers or forceful demands of their mortal hosts;
    they merely offer greater magical power in any of the various ways they
    might do so. Should the ease with which such might is granted pollute a
    mortal's ambitions or lead him to rely upon a devil for his power, such
    ultimately proves the student's fault, not the eager teacher's. So too does
    the resulting damnation at the end of the mortal's short life prove more of
    his own doing than any overt diabolical trap, making uniilas' methods all
    the more sinister for their subtlety. Summoning Cabal Devils Uniilas eagerly
    seek passage to the Material Plane and as such welcome summons by mortal
    casters. Whether to experiment with spells, seek out new magic, or corrupt
    mortals with their knowledge, what plots an uniila holds often prove
    inscrutable and of secondary interest to a summoner. Tempering their desire
    to reach the mortal plane, an uniila's vanity prevents it from serving a
    witless or hopeless summoner. Thus, uniilas turn the act of summoning about
    on those who call upon them via a planar binding spell, requesting that such
    mortals demonstrate their spellcasting prowess. If the mortal effectively
    casts a spell the uniila does not know (not one of those spells she
    possesses as a sorcerer spell or spell-like ability), or performs a spell of
    5th-level or higher, the caster gains a +2 bonus on the opposed Charisma
    check made to bind the devil. Occasionally, an uniila purposefully remains
    to serve an inferior spellcaster, or one that fails his opposed Charisma
    check. Granting the inept tools they should never possess amuses the devils,
    and even the most incompetent "masters" might prove useful in seeking out
    components of an uniila's ongoing projects in Hell.
