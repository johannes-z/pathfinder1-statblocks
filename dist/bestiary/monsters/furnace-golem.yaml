SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Interior (Ex)
    description: >-
      A furnace golem can try to shove a grabbed opponent up to two sizes
      smaller than itself into its interior by making a successful grapple
      check. An opponent thrown into the furnace golem's interior is trapped as
      a metal grating closes over the opening in the same round. A trapped
      creature automatically takes 2d6 points of fire damage each round.
      Escaping the creature's interior requires a successful Strength check (DC
      30) to bend the bars. Alternately a trapped creature can escape by dealing
      at least 25 points of damage to the bars (AC 22). Note, the golem's damage
      reduction applies to all attacks against the bars. A Huge furnace golem's
      interior can hold 2 Medium, 8 Small, or 16 Tiny or smaller creatures.
  - name: Heat (Ex)
    description: >-
      A furnace golem's entire form is extremely hot. Any slam attack deals fire
      damage. Creatures attacking a furnace golem unarmed or with natural
      weapons take this same fire damage each time one of their attacks hits.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A furnace golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature as noted below. A magical attack that
      bypasses its cold resistance slows a furnace golem (as the slow spell) for
      3 rounds, with no saving throw. A magical attack that deals fire damage
      breaks any slow effect on the furnace golem and heals 1 point of damage
      for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount
      of damage would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it
      gains any excess as temporary hit points.
Description:
  - >-
    Furnace golems are most often used to guard some arcane secret or treasure,
    though some are programmed to seek out objects or individuals. Those used as
    guards stand motionless, appearing as nothing more than a giant black iron
    statue, until activated. Furnace golems, like other constructs, obey their
    creator's commands to the best of their ability. Should the creator die, or
    should the golem's commands be unattainable, the furnace golem becomes
    rogue. That is, it is still completely functional but follows no commands or
    orders from anyone. Furnace golems open combat using their breath weapon
    before moving to pulverize their opponents with their massive fists. Grabbed
    opponents are shoved into the golem's burning interior where they are
    trapped until they break free or die. The fires powering a furnace golem are
    magical in nature, i.e. it needs no source of natural fuel to power it and
    they cannot be extinguished, though if a furnace golem is destroyed, the
    fires in its innards burn out. Construction A furnace golem's body is
    constructed from 8,000 pounds of iron mixed with rare ingredients and
    chemicals totaling 12,000 gp. FURNACE GOLEM CL 16th; Price 180,000 gp
