    description: >-
      A doppelganger is proficient in all weapons, armor, and shields. In
      addition, a doppelganger can use any spell trigger or spell completion
      item as if the spells were on its spell list. Its caster level is equal to
      its racial Hit Dice.
  - name: Perfect Copy (Su)
    description: >-
      When a doppelganger uses change shape, it can assume the appearance of
      specific individuals.
Description:
  - >-
    Doppelgangers are strange beings that can take on the shapes of those they
    encounter. In its natural form, the creature looks more or less humanoid,
    but slender and frail, with gangly limbs and half-formed facial features.
    Its flesh is pale and hairless, and its eyes are vacant and white.
  - >-
    Doppelgangers prefer infiltrating societies where they can gather wealth and
    inf luence, and see little point in forming cities of their own kind.
    Younger doppelgangers practice their skills by taking over small orc or
    goblin tribes, then move to more complicated societies like dwarven, elven,
    and human communities. Rather than making themselves targets by taking
    positions of leadership, they prefer to be the power behind the throne, or
    use multiple identities to manipulate inf luential citizens or entire
    guilds.
  - >-
    Doppelgangers make excellent use of their natural mimicry to stage ambushes,
    bait traps, and infiltrate humanoid society. Although not usually evil, they
    are interested only in themselves and regard all others as playthings to be
    manipulated and deceived. They are particularly fond of invading human
    societies in order to indulge in their desires-some enjoy the complex dance
    of politics while others seek constant change in the race and gender of both
    themselves and their romantic companions.
  - >-
    While not standard, it is those doppelgangers use their gifts for cruel and
    sadistic purposes that are most notorious, and these shapeshifters are the
    primary cause of the race's sinister reputation. Certainly, a creature
    capable of changing its shape has a handy way to avoid capture for its
    crimes, and some particularly malicious doppelgangers enjoy disrupting
    relationships by posing as unfaithful lovers.
  - >-
    Rumors persist of even more powerful doppelgangers capable of not only
    shifting their appearance, but also skills, memories, and even the
    extraordinary and supernatural abilities of creatures whose forms they
    choose to mimic.
  - >-
    These doppelgangers' change shape ability functions like the spell polymorph
    rather than alter self.
