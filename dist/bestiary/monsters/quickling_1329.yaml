SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Natural Invisibility (Su)
    description: >-
      A quickling is invisible when motionless. It loses this invisibility and
      remains visible for 1 round in any round in which it takes an action other
      than a free action.
  - name: Supernatural Speed (Su)
    description: >-
      A quickling moves with incredible speed. Save for when it remains
      motionless (at which point it is invisible), the quickling's shape blurs
      and shimmers with this speed, granting it concealment (20% miss chance).
      In addition, this ability grants the quickling evasion and uncanny dodge
      (as the rogue abilities of the same names).
  - name: Slow Susceptibility (Ex)
    description: >-
      A quickling that succumbs to a slow effect loses its supernatural speed
      ability and is sickened as long as the effect persists. This sickened
      condition persists for 1 round after the slow effect ends.
Description:
  - >-
    Few creatures can match the speed of a quickling. These malicious fey
    creatures delight in striking with blinding speed and accuracy, often
    killing their victims without ever fully revealing themselves; the victim
    simply spurts blood and falls over dead, with no witnesses to the
    quickling's deed. Though related to brownies and grigs, quicklings share
    none of their kin's generosity or merriment, choosing instead to live a life
    of cruelty and viciousness. Quicklings pride themselves on insults and
    brutality, and frequently stalk and harass their quarry until the victim
    gives up the chase. While quicklings are naturally invisible when
    motionless, they rarely contain themselves, and bob and twitch while
    standing and talking to other creatures. Quicklings hate every other race of
    creature, particularly elves, gnomes, and other kinds of fey. They barely
    tolerate their own kind, and rarely work together for longer than a few
    weeks.
  - Quicklings stand just over 2-1/2 feet tall and weigh 15 pounds.
