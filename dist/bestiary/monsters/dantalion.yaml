Description:
  - >-
    Dantalion is a Duke of Hell and commands 30 legions of barbed devils in
    service to Baalzebul, Lord of the Seventh Hell. He is a highly charismatic
    creature and rules by wits and wile more than by might and power. Those who
    know him however, know he is capable of much more than he appears, and none,
    especially those serving him, dare cross him.
  - >-
    Dantalion once served as viceroy to Lucifer, millennia ago when Lucifer
    ruled the Nine Hells. When the battle for rulership came, Dantalion first
    showed loyalty to his master and fought against the armies of Asmodeus and
    Mephistopheles. Feeling the tide turning, Dantalion betrayed Lucifer at
    crucial moment in the war and switched allegiances, forever pledging fealty
    to Asmodeus. When the war ended, Asmodeus rewarded him by appointing him
    Duke under Baalzebul. Lucifer, now an outcast, would like nothing more than
    to see Dantalion's devilish smile wiped from his face and his head at the
    end of Alastor's greataxe.
  - >-
    Dantalion's fortified black stone keep rests atop a craggy mountain within
    the seventh Hell. Many barbed devils guard the only passage leading to his
    castle, killing any who do not have Dantalion's permission to traverse the
    road. A large company of barbed devils, rumored to be several hundred in
    number, make their home beneath the keep. There they stand guard, awaiting
    Dantalion's orders should the castle walls ever be sieged.
