SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cold (Ex)
    description: >-
      A glacial ooze's form is extremely cold, dealing 1d6 cold damage with its
      slam attack. Creatures attacking a glacial ooze unarmed or with natural
      weapons take this cold damage each time one of their attacks hits.
  - name: Freezing Embrace (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a glacial ooze can encase an engulfed opponent in ice. A
      frozen creature takes 2d4 points of cold damage each round. A frozen
      creature can break free of the ice by making a successful DC 19 Strength
      check. The ice is AC 10, hardness 0, and has 10 hit points per 5-foot
      section. A frozen creature cannot use a weapon to break free even if it
      was holding it when it was frozen. Spells with verbal, material, or
      somatic components cannot be cast by a creature encased in ice. The check
      DC is Strength-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.
  - name: Transparent (Ex)
    description: >-
      A glacial ooze is hard to identify, even under ideal conditions, and it
      takes a DC 20 Perception check to notice one. Creatures who fail to notice
      a glacial ooze and walk into it are automatically engulfed.
Description:
  - >-
    This creature appears as translucent bluish-white icy sludge about 10 feet
    on each side (though larger specimens have been encountered). This ooze is
    conjectured to be a relative of the gelatinous cube, though a link between
    the two has yet to be established.
  - >-
    The glacial ooze is at home in or out of the water, and is often encountered
    inhabiting frozen or partially frozen lakes and rivers. It gains nutrients
    from water and snow, absorbing them into its gelatinous form and digesting
    them. Like many oozes, the glacial ooze is a scavenger and feeds on the
    carcasses of once living creatures that have frozen to death.
  - >-
    Rather than completely digesting such creatures, the glacial ooze absorbs
    all bodily fluids and liquids from a corpse, leaving behind a frozen and
    rotted husk.
  - >-
    A glacial ooze attacks by forming a pseudopod and pummeling a foe. Against
    creatures smaller than itself, it simply moves across them, absorbing them
    into its form and holding them until they freeze to death.
