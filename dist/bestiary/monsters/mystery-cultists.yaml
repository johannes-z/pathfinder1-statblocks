Description:
  - >-
    Just as the legendary Mistress Ordellia Whilwren once prayed to a mysterious
    angel to save Magnimar from a devastating deluge, other dwellers of the city
    have likewise devoted themselves to holy figures, including angels, azatas,
    and agathions. Called "mystery cultists" by most Magnimarians because of
    their small numbers and esoteric manner of worship, the dedicated followers
    of the empyreal lords keep to themselves and rarely proselytize. Most
    mystery cults hold at least one of Magnimar's numerous monuments in high
    esteem, whether for their importance in local traditions or their part in
    Varisian legends. Practitioners of these religions often congregate around
    structures such as the Arvensoar, the Irespan, or the Mistress of Angels to
    practice their faith, sometimes forming assemblies of over a hundred
    worshipers. Although the cults' gatherings can occasionally be disruptive to
    the flow of traffic throughout the City of Monuments, Magnimar's leaders do
    little to dissuade the cults' practices, which are almost wholly harmless
    and serve to promote life, freedom, and other righteous virtues.
  - >-
    Three of the most commonly worshiped figures among the mystery cults of
    Magnimar are the empyreal lords Ashava, Soralyon, and Ylimancha (see page 25
    for more information on these empyreal lords), though smaller cults to other
    celestial beings are not uncommon in the City of Monuments.
