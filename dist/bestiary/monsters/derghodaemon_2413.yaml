SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Feeblemind (Su)
    description: >-
      Twice per day, by clattering its mandibles together, a derghodaemon can
      affect all creatures within 30 ft. as if by a feeblemind spell. Daemons
      are immune to this effect, but all other creatures must make a DC 18 Will
      save to resist its effects. The effect lasts for 6 rounds. This is a sonic
      mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charismabased.
  - name: Tear (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a derghodaemon grapples an opponent, it automatically hits its opponent
      with all of its melee attacks each round following that it maintains its
      hold.
Description:
  - >-
    The derghodaemon is one of the strongest of the daemon races, but its low
    intelligence has relegated it to a position of brute warrior and little
    more.
  - A derghodaemon stands 8 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds.
  - >-
    The derghodaemon opens combat with its feeblemind attack. Opponents are then
    subjected to a barrage of claws or weapons, or a combination of both.
  - >-
    A derghodaemon's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
    treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
