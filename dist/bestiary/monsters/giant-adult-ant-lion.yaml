Description:
  - >-
    When a giant ant lion reaches maturity, it creates a cocoon of sand and dirt
    around itself. Over the course of a month, the ant lion undergoes a dramatic
    metamorphosis-when it emerges, its body has become elongated and thin and it
    has gained a set of enormous, lacy wings. Depending on the region, giant
    adult ant lions are often called giant lacewings, giant damself lies, or
    giant spindlef lies, but regardless of their regional name, they remain
    ravenous and deadly, replacing the sand trap cunning of their larval form
    with swift flight and greater battlefield mobility.
