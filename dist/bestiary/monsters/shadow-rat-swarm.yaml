Description:
  - >-
    Shadow rats are essentially undead rats that can assume an incorporeal form.
    Other than their semi-translucent form, they resemble their earthly
    counterparts in all respects. A shadow rat swarm is simply a massive number
    of shadow rats that have cluttered or banded together for survival or food.
    Shadow rat swarms can be found just about anywhere, but are most commonly
    encountered near graveyards, ruined temples, and haunted sewers. Copyright
