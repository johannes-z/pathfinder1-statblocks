  and reddish blazing eyes moves toward you. Their semi-translucent skin shows

Group: Shadow Rat
Source: Tome of Horrors Complete
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Filth fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 15; onset 1d3 days; frequency
      1/day; effect 1d3 Dex damage and 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Incorporeal Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A shadow rat swarm can, as a standard action, assume an incorporeal form
      for up to 1 hour per day. In this form, the swarm loses its natural AC
      bonus but gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC. While in this form, the
      shadow rat swarm is AC 16 (+2 deflection, +2 Dex, +2 size), touch 15,
      flat-footed 13. The shadow rat swarm can still swarm attack corporeal
      opponents while in its incorporeal form, but its attack only inflicts
      Strength damage and cannot distract foes or cause physical damage. The
      shadow rat swarm gains the incorporeal subtype while using this ability.
  - name: Shadow Blend (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shadow rat swarm can disappear into the shadows as a move action,
      gaining total concealment in all levels of illumination save bright light.
  - name: Strength Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      A shadow rat swarm deals Strength damage to living foes over which it
      swarms. A creature reduced to 0 Strength cannot move but does not die-at
      least, not until the swarm's physical damage takes its toll.
Description:
  - >-
    Shadow rats are essentially undead rats that can assume an incorporeal form.
    Other than their semi-translucent form, they resemble their earthly
    counterparts in all respects. A shadow rat swarm is simply a massive number
    of shadow rats that have cluttered or banded together for survival or food.
    Shadow rat swarms can be found just about anywhere, but are most commonly
    encountered near graveyards, ruined temples, and haunted sewers. Copyright
