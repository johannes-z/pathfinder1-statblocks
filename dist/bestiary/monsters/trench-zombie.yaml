SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Trench Warfare (Ex)
    description: >-
      Starting at 3rd level, a trench fighter can select one specific type of
      firearm (such as a machine gun, revolver, or rif le). He gains a bonus
      equal to his Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of
      firearm. Every 4 levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), the trench
      fighter picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those
      types as well. Furthermore, when behind partial, normal, or improved
      cover, a trench fighter gains an additional +2 AC bonus from the cover.
      This ability replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  - name: Symbiote (Ex)
    description: >-
      A unique relationship with trench mists grants trench zombies immunity to
      acid. In addition, when a trench zombie reaches 0 hit points and is
      destroyed, the mustard-colored mist that animates the creature bursts
      violently from its damaged form. All creatures adjacent to the trench
      zombie are exposed to the toxic gas and take 4d6 points of acid damage. If
      the trench zombie is enveloped within the fog of its parent trench mist
      when this death burst occurs, the mist's fast healing ability increases by
      1 for a number of rounds equal to the Hit Dice of the destroyed trench
      zombie. The effects of the deaths of multiple symbiotic trench zombies
      stack.
Description:
  - >-
    A trench zombie is a rotting creature leaking sulfurous fumes from beneath
    its acid-burned, peeling skin, and bristling with the armaments it possessed
    in its horrifying death. Retaining many of the memories and skills it
    possessed in life, a trench zombie contributes its intelligence into a sort
    of hive mind for the trench mist that originally spawned it, creating a true
    symbiosis between the two-a gift the trench zombie repays upon its
    destruction, when the horrific fumes that granted it unlife go back to the
    trench mist that birthed it. Trench zombies are foul and vengeful, and are
    canny enough to lurk within the nurturing embrace of their mother mist,
    which provides them concealment without impairing their senses. Those
    seeking trench zombies' destruction typically must enter the engulfing body
    of a trench mist if they are to ward off the zombies' ranged attacks. Trench
    zombies are created using the juju zombie template (Bestiary 2 291), but
    they lose the juju zombie's immunity to magic missile, which is replaced by
    immunity to acid. Trench zombies also gain the following special ability
    Symbiote (Ex).
