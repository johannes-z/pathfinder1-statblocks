Description:
  - >-
    A juju zombie is an animated corpse of a creature, created to serve as an
    undead minion, that retains the skills and abilities it possessed in life.
    Creating a Juju Zombie "Juju zombie" is an acquired template that can be
    added to any living corporeal creature, referred to hereafter as the base
    creature. CR: As base creature +1. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The creature's
    type changes to undead. It retains any subtype except for alignment subtypes
    and subtypes that indicate kind. Armor Class: A juju zombie gains a +3 bonus
    to its natural armor over the base creature's natural armor bonus. Hit Dice:
    Change all the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from
    class levels remain unchanged. As undead, juju zombies use their Charisma
    modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution). Defensive
    Abilities: Juju zombies gain channel resistance +4, DR 5/magic and slashing
    (or DR 10/magic and slashing if it has 11 HD or more), and fire resistance
    10. They are immune to cold, electricity, and magic missile. Speed: A winged
    juju zombie's maneuverability drops to clumsy. If the base creature flew
    magically, its fly speed is unchanged. Retain all other movement types.
    Attacks: A juju zombie retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon
    attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam
    attack that deals damage based on the juju zombie's size, but as if it were
    one size category larger than its actual size. Abilities: Increase from the
    base creature as follows: Str +4, Dex +2. A juju zombie has no Con score; as
    an undead, it uses its Charisma in place of Constitution when calculating
    hit points, Fortitude saves, or any special ability that relies on
    Constitution. Feats: A juju zombie gains Improved Initiative and Toughness
    as bonus feats. Skills: A juju zombie gains a +8 racial bonus on all Climb
    checks.
