Description:
  - >-
    Foxes are opportunistic eaters with a diet that consists of mice and voles,
    rabbits, birds, eggs, amphibians and small reptiles, fish, mollusks,
    earthworms, carrion, and plants. Foxes are also known to scour garbage and
    refuse in settled areas. The statistics above describe the common red fox,
    but can be used for other foxes such as the grey fox or arctic fox. Arctic
    foxes gain an additional +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks in snowy
    surroundings.

    The fox is a very territorial creature and spends about one-third of its day
    hunting for food (most hunting is performed at night). Foxes are excellent
    hunters and have even been known to bring down prey much larger than
    themselves. When prey is encountered, the fox leaps at it and dispatches it
    with a series of quick bites.
