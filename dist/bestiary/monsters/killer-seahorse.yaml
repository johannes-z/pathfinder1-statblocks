Description:
  - >-
    These specially bred offshoots of the giant seahorse are used by aquatic
    creatures as guard animals. Vicious and territorial, they prefer larger prey
    and have been known to eat giant crabs and careless handlers. Killer
    seahorses are too unruly for use as mounts and only accept riders or baggage
    if magically controlled. Killer seahorses have been known to crush other
    creatures into a bloody pulp just before giving birth, ensuring a good meal
    for their newborns (called "fry"). A killer seahorse fry is the size of a
    human hand and is an aggressive swarm feeder, like a piranha. A light load
    for a killer seahorse is up to 2,500 pounds, a medium load is 4,900 pounds,
    and a heavy load is 7,400 pounds. A killer seahorse can drag 36,800 pounds.
