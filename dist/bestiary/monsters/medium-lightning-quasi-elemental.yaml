SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Electricity (Ex)
    description: >-
      A lightning quasi-elemental is composed entirely of electricity and deals
      electricity damage each time it hits. A creature striking the lightning
      quasi-elemental unarmed, or a creature striking the lightning
      quasi-elemental with a weapon take this same electricity damage each time
      one of their attacks hits. Metallic creatures or creatures using metal
      weapons take an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage each time one of
      their attacks hits.
  - name: Globe (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a lightning quasi-elemental can discharge one globe
      of electricity per HD it possesses once per round. Globes hover by the
      quasi-elemental and move with the creature. An opponent that moves within
      5 feet of a lightning quasi-elemental discharges a globe and takes the
      electricity damage shown on the table below. An affected creature can make
      a Reflex save to reduce the damage by half. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Once a globe discharges, it is destroyed and a
      lightning quasi-elemental cannot recreate it for 4 hours.
  - name: Vulnerability to Water (Ex)
    description: >-
      A lightning quasi-elemental takes 1d8 points of damage per gallon of water
      it contacts. Pouring water onto a lightning quasi-elemental requires a
      successful ranged touch attack. Water from other sources, such as spells
      or effects that create water but do not specify an amount in gallons, deal
      1d4 points of damage per caster level to a lightning quasi-elemental
      within its area of effect. Damage from water-based attacks, like the slam
      attack of a water elemental, is increased by 50% against a lightning
      quasi-elemental.
Description:
  - >-
    Lightning quasi-elementals are native to the Plane of Air, the Positive
    Energy Plane, and a rumored elemental plane situated in between (the
    Quasi-Plane of Lightning). They are sometimes summoned to the Material Plane
    by wizards or clerics, but more often than not slip through a rift between
    the Material Plane and elemental plane during a lightning storm. A lightning
    quasi-elemental can release small globes of electricity that hover around
    its body. An opponent that moves within 5 feet of a globe causes it to arc
    and discharge. Credit The Lightning Quasi-elemental originally appeared in
