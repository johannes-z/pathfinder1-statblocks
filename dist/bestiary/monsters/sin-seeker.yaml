SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Honesty (Su)
    description: >-
      Sin seekers radiate an aura of honesty out to 10 feet. All creatures in
      the area take a -2 penalty on Bluff, Sleight of Hand, and Escape Artist
      checks. Creatures that succeed at a DC 13 Will save resist the effects of
      this aura, though they must attempt a new saving throw each time they use
      one of the listed skills in the area. This is a mind-affecting effect and
      the save DC is Wisdom-based.
  - name: Detect Alignment (Sp)
    description: >-
      At will, a sin seeker can use detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, or
      detect law. Only one of these can be active at any given time.
Description:
  - >-
    Believed to have been bred centuries ago by zealous priests and inquisitors,
    sin seekers are living creatures with a supernatural ability to detect the
    scent of varying degrees of morality. Originally small forest swine known
    for their acute senses of smell, these unfortunate creatures were subjected
    to a magical mutation similar in practice to fleshwarping. The priests' goal
    was to use these new creations to sniff out the supporters of rival faiths,
    identifying them by their hidden sins.
  - >-
    In the centuries following their initial creation, various sects throughout
    Golarion maintained small sin seeker breeding programs. Many of these were
    aimed at culling impious members from the ranks of the clergy, though many
    evil sects used sin seekers as torture and interrogation aids. Today, small
    populations of sin seekers still survive in monasteries throughout Golarion,
    and adventurers of all alignments continue to keep them as familiars. Sin
    seekers are usually about 12 to 18 inches long, with a 2-foot wingspan. They
    weigh between 3 and 5 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Centuries of selective breeding have improved the sin seekers' magical
    abilities, granting them the ability to sense other creatures' motives and
    alignments. They are capable of instantly sensing whether a creature is good
    or evil, and they also have a knack for tracking creatures by their auras.
    Once in close contact with a creature, sin seekers have a host of tools for
    discerning whether that creature is lying or manipulating information. In
    addition to the aura of honesty that surrounds them, each seeker has a small
    arsenal of spell-like abilities that help it glean the truth from
    weak-willed creatures.
  - >-
    Though graced with an above-average intelligence, sin seekers are poor at
    handling logistics and practicalities. They make excellent judges of
    character, and easily pick up on subtle social cues that could indicate
    dishonesty. While sin seekers are able to draw distinctions between various
    motives, they have no inherent alignment, and don't place moral judgments on
    the information they gather. Like bloodhounds sniffing for a trail, sin
    seekers happily delve for information without regard for what it means. This
    moral ambivalence makes them equally useful for benevolent or malicious
    purposes.
  - >-
    Sin seekers lack any natural instincts and rely entirely on reciprocal
    relationships with larger creatures for protection and sustenance. Sin
    seekers are omnivores who can survive on almost any kind of food, though
    they are healthiest when fed a vegetable-heavy diet. They can eat anything,
    but they're poor at regulating their own nutrition-if left to their own
    devices, sin seekers gorge themselves to the point of nausea, especially
    when offered rich, fatty foods. While they acclimate quickly to new cultures
    and eating habits, they are susceptible to unfamiliar diseases and poisons.
  - >-
    Though sin seekers can be found throughout Golarion, they are best suited
    for the moderate climates of the Inner Sea region, northern Casmaron, and
    coastal Tian Xia. While their small frames are well padded by a layer of
    fat, they are mostly hairless and lack sufficient body mass to survive
    frigid temperatures for long. They fare no better in extreme heat, as they
    easily become dehydrated and are vulnerable to sunburn. Luckily, their
    susceptibility to the elements is counterbalanced by their suitability for
    indoor living. Despite their porcine aspect, they live cleanly, and can
    easily be trained to use lavatories. They have an inherent respect for
    personal space and are happiest when provided with a small nesting area to
    call their own. Sin seekers are quiet living companions, except during
    mating season, during which time they utter grotesque, mewling cries. In
    all, sin seekers are finicky creatures who require more upkeep than most
    animals, though their unique skill set makes them worth the extra effort.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Sin seekers are wholly domestic creatures incapable of surviving long in the
    wild. Like any domestic animal, sin seekers are acclimated to humanoid
    contact, and integrate well into humanoid cultures. Though slightly
    repulsive in appearance, they are affectionate creatures with good social
    skills. Unfortunately, their inability to properly defend themselves and
    inability to regulate their eating make them high-maintenance travel
    companions, especially when contrasted with self-sufficient familiars like
    cats, monkeys, and rodents. Sin seekers are easy prey, and their
    sightlessness makes them especially vulnerable to quick predators such as
    hawks, wolves, and foxes. Sin seeker familiars require constant guardianship
    and physical protection.
  - >-
    The difficulty of keeping such delicate creatures alive and healthy has
    often proven worth the trouble for religious sects throughout Golarion.
    While each sect breeds its sin seekers with different magical abilities,
    they all use the creatures as lie detectors and moral litmus tests. Clergy
    from good-aligned sects, like those that worship Iomedae or Sarenrae, often
    use sin seekers as penitential aids. These sects see sin seekers as living
    reminders of the priests' shortcomings and often use them to witness ritual
    oaths. Evil sects, like those that worship Norgorber or Asmodeus, often use
    sin seekers as interrogation and inquisitional instruments. Such sects
    combine the use of sin seekers with traditional torture techniques to
    persecute nonbelievers or to weed out seditious forces within their ranks.
  - >-
    Once trained, sin seekers make excellent familiars, and form strong bonds
    with their keepers. They are both affectionate and loyal, and quickly adopt
    their keepers'
  - >-
    personalities. Their high intelligence and lie-detecting abilities make them
    favored familiars of detectives, interrogators, and negotiators. Sin
    seekers' ability to track creatures by following their auras make them
    popular among rangers, paladins, and inquisitors who specialize in tracking
    evil creatures. Unfortunately, while sin seekers are incredibly useful,
    their auras of honesty and repulsive appearances can sometimes be a
    hindrance to adventuring parties. Charismatic rogues and bards find the
    creatures both off-putting and inconvenient. Any character of 5th level or
    higher with the Improved Familiar feat may take a sin seeker as a familiar.
  - Variant Sin Seekers
  - >-
    While the description above represents the most common variant of sin
    seekers, some sects breed the creatures with abilities that more closely
    align with their religious aims. Sin seekers from good-aligned temples often
    have the ability to cast protection from evil instead of confessAPG.
    Congregations that revile the undead sometimes breed their seekers to cast
    detect undead instead of zone of truth, or speak with dead instead of
    comprehend languages. Evil sects, meanwhile, sometimes breed into their sin
    seekers the ability to cast interrogationUM instead of seek thoughtsAPG, or
    touch of idiocy instead of comprehend languages.
