Description_Visual: >-
  This hulking mountain of fur and fangs looks like a white-furred bear of
  immense proportions with ten legs, each ending in massive, jet-black claws.
  Its head, with slavering jaws and a tongue dripping silvery foam, sits at the
  end of a long yet thickly muscled neck. Its dead black eyes are small but
  infinite pits of malice.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blizzard Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      A kokogiak's breath weapon is a polar gale so bitterly cold that it saps
      vigor from those it touches. Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a
      kokogiak can expel a 60-foot cone of blistering arctic winds, dealing 8d6
      points of cold damage to all creatures struck. A successful DC 23 Reflex
      save halves this damage. Any creature damaged by this attack must then
      succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or become fatigued (or exhausted if it
      was already fatigued). The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Forlorn Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a kokogiak can lock its black eyes on a target
      within 60 feet to fascinate the creature. A successful DC 20 Will save
      negates this effect. Creatures that fail the save are fascinated and they
      see they kokogiak as a lost loved one, trusted friend in danger, or ally
      in desperate need. Once a creature is fascinated, the kokogiak can compel
      the creature to move toward it. Once adjacent, the creature is flat-footed
      against the kokogiak's attacks, but the creature receives a new saving
      throw at the beginning of its turn to break the fascination. This is a
      mind-affecting effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Ice Walker (Ex)
    description: >-
      A kokogiak takes no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics, Climb, or Stealth
      checks in snowy or icy terrain or weather conditions. It can walk across
      snow crusts or thin ice without breaking through. In addition, a kokogiak
      can choose to not leave tracks when moving in this type of terrain.
  - name: Penetrating Sight (Ex)
    description: >-
      A kokogiak's sight is not affected by its own fog cloud or solid fog
      spell-like abilities. In addition, a kokogiak does not take any penalties
      on Perception checks while its snowing.
  - name: Sound Imitation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A kokogiak can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a
      successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check.
Description:
  - >-
    The kokogiak (called qupqugiaq by some tribes) is a deadly predator of the
    far northern wastes. At first glance, it appears to be a simple ravening
    beast or an enormous, unnaturally deformed polar bear, yet its raw power and
    cunning are legendary in the tales of northern nomads. Its name in some
    places is synonymous with cabin fever or deep-winter hallucinations that
    drive folk to desperation and madness, rushing out into the frozen wild in
    pursuit of some long-lost lover only to become lost themselves, victims of
    the kokogiak's dreadful might. Kokogiaks have an elongated neck, and are
    nearly 20 feet long from tail to nose. Over a dozen feet high at the
    shoulder, kokogiaks weigh between 6 and 8 tons.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Kokogiaks are amphibious in their habits, comfortable in and out of the
    water, though they are not able to breathe water as well as air. They spend
    a great deal of their time in the water, hunting seals, walruses, squids,
    and even whales in coastal waters and beneath the winter ice. While
    kokogiaks must surface periodically to breathe, their powerful claws enable
    them to rip through floating pack ice and make air holes nearly wherever
    they wish. Creating such air holes is actually a hunting technique- they lie
    in wait near the holes for seals and their ilk to surface to breathe,
    snatching their prey in their jaws and dragging it up onto the ice to feast.
    Kokogiaks also use the same trick in reverse, lurking underwater just below
    gaps in the ice and seizing prey traversing the ice above, or along rocky
    coastlines when the pack ice recedes. Even predatory creatures like polar
    bears and winter wolves might be dragged into the water to be drowned and
    devoured, and desperate kokogiaks are even known to scale arctic sea cliffs
    during spring thaws to feast on newborn seabirds and eggs, lapping up entire
    nests in a single flick of the tongue.
  - >-
    While they are well adapted to hunting in and around coastal icepacks,
    kokogiaks also roam far inland to prowl continental ice sheets. The same
    tactics kokogiaks use for hunting along the water's edge serve them well in
    the deep snowdrifts and icy spires and crevasses of the polar reaches.
    Kokogiaks scale rocky and icy peaks to lair in dens inaccessible to most
    creatures. From such high vantage points, they observe passersby; then,
    calling upon supernatural blinding fogs, they either descend upon their prey
    from above, snatching a target and dragging it to their elevated lairs, or
    burrow underneath and burst up from below, hauling prey into their frigid
    dens.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Kokogiaks live in cold arctic regions, though in winter they sometimes
    wander into the subarctic tundra and occasionally even into the colder
    latitudes of temperate climes. Those venturing so far south make their homes
    amid the glaciers and alpine wilderness of high mountains. While most return
    to the forever-winter of the arctic after taking their fill of warmer
    climes' abundant prey, a few make their homes permanently below the arctic
    circle, where their predations lend their mountain homes a deadly
    reputation. Such alpine kokogiaks descend with the winter storms into the
    huddled villages in the valleys below, luring the unwary to their doom and
    leaving a trail of death and terror in their wakes. In communities near a
    kokogiak's mountain, when the first heavy storms of winter strike, locals
    sometimes stake animals (or even rarely an unlucky member of the community,
    chosen by lottery) out in the cold in an attempt to propitiate the
    kokogiak's hunger and turn aside its wrath from the rest of the community.
  - >-
    Kokogiaks are more common in the subarctic and arctic, however, and they
    show no loyalty or preferential treatment to any that cross their path. They
    occasionally enter into alliances with creatures that will hunt for them and
    bring them living victims to torment and eviscerate at their leisure. They
    are cruel and capricious masters apt to turn on those who displease them in
    any way or just to ensure that others serving them do not doubt their power.
    More often, kokogiaks extract tribute from arctic and tundra dwelling
    tribes, sometimes in treasure but more often in the form of sacrifice. When
    refused, a kokogiak seeks to punish the unwilling by using its magic to
    inveigle members of that tribe to wander off from their homes and into the
    kokogiak's waiting clutches. Victims lured away in this fashion may simply
    be devoured, but the cruel beast often leaves behind bloodstained clothes or
    more grisly trophies torn from its victims' remains, artfully displayed for
    the friends and family of the deceased to find. So does the kokogiak remind
    them of the price of defiance.
  - >-
    Kokogiaks are mostly solitary, though mated pairs do sometimes join forces
    to spread terror wherever they roam or to take down powerful rivals.
    Kokogiak cubs are usually encouraged to fight one another for survival,
    struggling to show their dominance until only one remains. Weaklings are
    killed and eaten or driven out into the snows to survive or not. When the
    strongest cub approaches maturity, the kokogiak parents are faced with a
    choice: drive out the youngling when it is strong enough to survive but not
    yet strong enough to challenge its elders, or be prepared to face its
    challenge within the family group. Such challenges are usually directed at
    the parent of its own gender, as the youth seeks to drive out and take the
    place of its father or mother, proving its worthiness to take its surviving
    parent as its own mate.
