Description:
  - >-
    Nosferatu are savage undead who may be the progenitors of the common, more
    refined vampires. The curse of the nosferatu lacks the elegance and romance
    of its modern form, harkening to a forgotten age of verminous hunger and
    eerie powers. Granted immortal life but not immortal youth, nosferatu are
    withered, embittered creatures unable to create others of their kind, as
    they somehow lost that ability long ago. Their ancient sensibilities still
    ref lect the cruelty of epochs past, and their age-spanning plots are
    untethered by the modern aff liction of morality. Nosferatu resent common
    vampires (which they call "moroi," an ancient term from a lost language) for
    their beauty, whereas those vampires scorn the nosferatu as bestial relics
    of an earlier age, best hidden away in remote ruins so as not to sully the
    charismatic reputation of "true" vampires. Because nosferatu can't create
    spawn, any nosferatu in existence are very old-created long ago in a time
    before they lost the ability to infect others with their undead curse. Most
    nosferatu live in isolated places with few visitors, and a nosferatu could
    be a thousand years old and yet have fewer than a dozen character levels
    because it lacks sufficient foes to challenge it or the initiative to train
    itself.
  - CREATING A NOSFERATU
  - >-
    "Nosferatu" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature
    with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most
    nosferatu were once humanoids, fey, or monstrous humanoids. A nosferatu uses
    the base creature's stats and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as
    the base creature +2.
  - 'AL: Any evil.'
  - >-
    Type: The creature's type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate
    class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.
  - 'Senses: A nosferatu gains darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision, and scent.'
  - 'Armor Class: Natural armor improves by 8.'
  - >-
    Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected.
    As an undead, a nosferatu uses its Charisma modifier to determine its bonus
    hit points (instead of Constitution).
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: A nosferatu gains channel resistance +4 and DR 5/wood
    and piercing (this includes all wood-shafted weapons such as arrows,
    crossbow bolts, spears, and javelins, even if the weapon's actual head is
    made of another material). It also gains resistance 10 to cold, electricity,
    and sonic. A nosferatu gains fast healing 5. If reduced to 0 hit points in
    combat, a nosferatu assumes its swarm form (see below) and attempts to
    escape. It must reach its coffin within 1 hour or be utterly destroyed. (In
    swarm form, it can normally travel up to 5 miles in 1 hour.) Additional
    damage dealt to a nosferatu forced into swarm form has no effect. Once at
    rest, the nosferatu is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then
    is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per
    round.
  - >-
    Weaknesses: A nosferatu can't tolerate the strong odor of garlic, and won't
    enter an area laced with it. Similarly, it recoils from mirrors or strongly
    presented holy symbols. These things don't harm the nosferatu-they merely
    keep it at bay. A recoiling nosferatu must stay at least 5 feet away from
    the mirror or holy symbol and can't touch or make melee attacks against that
    creature. Holding a nosferatu at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round,
    a nosferatu can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally
    each round it succeeds at a DC 25 Will save. A nosferatu cannot enter a
    private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to
    do so. Reducing a nosferatu's hit points to 0 incapacitates it but doesn't
    always destroy it (see fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay
    nosferatu. Exposing any nosferatu to direct sunlight staggers it on the
    first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive
    round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in running
    water deals an amount of damage to a nosferatu equal to one-third of its
    full normal hit points-a nosferatu reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is
    destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless nosferatu's heart
    instantly slays it (this is a full-round action). However, it returns to
    life if the stake is removed, unless its head is also severed and anointed
    with holy water.
  - >-
    Speed: Same as the base creature. If the base creature has a swim speed, the
    nosferatu is not harmed by running water.
  - >-
    Melee: A nosferatu gains two claw attacks if the base creature didn't have
    any (1d4 points of damage for a Small nosferatu, 1d6 points of damage for a
    Medium one).
  - >-
    Special Attacks: A nosferatu gains several special attacks. Its save DCs are
    equal to 10 + 1/2 the nosferatu's Hit Dice + the nosferatu's Cha modifier
    unless otherwise noted.
  - >-
    Blood Drain (Ex): A nosferatu can suck blood from a helpless, willing, or
    grappled living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check.
    If it pins the foe, it drains blood, draining 1d4 points of Constitution and
    Wisdom each round the pin is maintained. On each round it drains blood, the
    nosferatu gains 5 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour (up to a maximum
    number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points).
  - >-
    Dominate (Su): A nosferatu can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a
    standard action. Anyone the nosferatu targets must succeed at a Will save or
    fall instantly under the nosferatu's inf luence, as though by a dominate
    person spell (caster level 12th). This ability has a range of 30 feet. At
    the GM's discretion, some nosferatu (such as a very old one or with an
    unusually strong bloodline) might be able to affect different creature types
    with this power. Telekinesis (Su): As a standard action, a nosferatu can use
    telekinesis (caster level 12th).
  - 'Special Qualities: A nosferatu gains the following.'
  - >-
    Spider Climb (Ex): A nosferatu can climb sheer surfaces as though under the
    effects of a spider climb spell. Swarm Form (Su): As a standard action, a
    nosferatu can change into a bat swarm, centipede swarm, rat swarm, or spider
    swarm. The nosferatu gains the natural weapons and extraordinary special
    attacks of the swarm it has transformed into. The swarm has the same number
    of hit points as the nosferatu. While in swarm form, a nosferatu can't use
    its claw attacks or any of its special attacks. It retains the defensive
    abilities, weaknesses, and special qualities it gains from being a
    nosferatu, counts as an undead creature, and can use any of the swarm's
    abilities and defenses. It can remain in swarm form until it assumes another
    form or until the next sunrise.
  - >-
    Telepathy (Su): A nosferatu can communicate telepathically with any creature
    within 60 feet that speaks the same language it does. In addition, a
    nosferatu can use this ability to communicate with any animal, magical
    beast, or vermin.
  - >-
    Ability Scores: Str +2, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +6, Cha +4. As an undead
    creature, a nosferatu has no Constitution score.
  - >-
    Skills: A nosferatu gains a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense Motive, and
    Stealth checks.
  - >-
    Feats: A nosferatu gains Alertness, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes,
    and Skill Focus (in two different skills) as bonus feats.
