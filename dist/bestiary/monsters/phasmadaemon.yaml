Description_Visual: >-
  Little can be seen of this fiend, its body cloaked in a shroud of perpetually
  shifting, ghastly illusions and phantasms. Beneath its shimmering veil, it has
  glossy black flesh, a bleached white face, and twisted horns. Its long caiman
  muzzle perpetually gapes, but other than that, its face is void of sensory
  organs, save for two orbs that move below the surface of its flesh. This
  creature flows rather than moves, and its flexible body lacks a definite
  skeletal structure except for a long, bony tail.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Consume Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a phasmadaemon that begins its turn with a grappled
      opponent can attempt to feed on the creature's mortality and innate
      terror. Any creature that does not succeed at a DC 27 Will save takes 1d6
      points of Charisma drain and becomes shaken for 2d4 rounds; in addition,
      the phasmadaemon gains 5 temporary hit points for every point of Charisma
      drain dealt this way. If the creature being grappled is already panicked
      at the beginning of the phasmadaemon's turn, it must save instead on a DC
      27 Fortitude save or be slain instantly by the phasmadaemon, which gains a
      +1 profane bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and checks for every 2
      points of Charisma its victim had before dying; the profane bonuses last
      for 24 hours. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
  - name: Tangible Horror (Su)
    description: >-
      A phasmadaemon's illusion abilities are partially real at a level above
      and beyond those normally conjured forth by similar illusion spells. If a
      creature succeeds at its Will save to disbelieve either a phasmadaemon's
      greater shadow conjuration or greater shadow evocation spell-like ability,
      the conjured or evoked spell has 80% the normal effect or is 80% likely to
      occur, rather than 60%.
Description:
  - >-
    Among the most powerful members of daemonkind, the phasmadaemons personify
    death by fright, and conjure powers of illusion so terrifying that they
    steal the life from their victims. A freakish creature of rubbery flesh, the
    phasmadaemon is capable of twisting its body like a hellish contortionist,
    and its ivory face is often the last thing its victim sees. Though capable
    of savaging foes with its fangs and claws, it prefers to torment them first
    with illusory enemies, unreal terrors, and false terrain before finally
    closing in as the victims' hearts race and finally fail. When a phasmadaemon
    does confront its prey physically, it prefers to grapple and constrict it to
    death, looking the victim directly in the face and watching the fear fill
    its eyes as the blood drains from its cheeks. A phasmadaemon rarely shows
    its true form all at once, masking itself in illusions or eerie porcelain
    masks, and it delights in unnerving even its own daemonic allies.
  - >-
    A phasmadaemon is 25 feet long from muzzle to tail- though if it desires, it
    can stretch almost half again that length thanks to its flexible, elastic
    anatomy-and weighs 1,000 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Phasmadaemons sometimes form from the type of soul that exemplifies extreme
    evil, namely those who inf lict or suffer from extreme fear, such as
    deranged illusionists,
  - >-
    schizophrenic serial killers, and corrupt mortals who died at the hands of
    other creatures that excel at captivating victims' dreams and fears. In
    other instances, phasmadaemons are merely among the most fearful of the
    hunted souls of Abaddon, souls who eventually learn to exult in the terror
    they feel as a soul-devouring daemon stalks them; eventually, these vile
    souls may transform from the hunted into the hunters-daemons seeking the
    thrill of the hunt for the horror-stricken faces of their prey.
  - >-
    Whether in the chasms of Abaddon or on other planes, phasmadaemons hunt for
    souls via stealth, following from a distance to study their prey for
    prolonged periods. They create elaborate illusions, leading their targets
    into believing in entire fictional environments and creatures, all dependent
    on the victims' most feared imaginings. They extract each soul's intrinsic,
    underlying fears, using the figments as weapons against their owners.
    Phasmadaemons do not seek souls that are merely easy prey-they adhere
    strictly to their own method of destroying souls, reveling in the grotesque
    pleasure of striking mortal souls dead with fear-induced heart attacks and
    other physical maladies. The connection between fear and mortality is
    something that continually fascinates the morbid curiosities of
    phasmadaemons, who mix fears like alchemists, conducting experiments and
    concocting ever more terrifying combinations of horrific imaginings.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Phasmadaemons tend to hunt alone, preferring to develop their own unique
    styles of torment and horror to unleash upon their victims. While some would
    suggest that the freakishly complex traps of crucidaemons or the cocooned
    feeding of sangudaemons rank as the most dreadful and frightening killing
    tactics among daemonkind, the terrors manifested by phasmadaemons exceed
    them both. A phasmadaemon extracts a mortal's own fears and turns the
    figments against their creator, not enjoying the torment the horrors induce
    so much as appreciating the effects of fear within its victim before the
    thing's last fatal gasp-the tiny hairs standing upright, the racing heart,
    jerking muscles, paralysis. Such reactions spawn immense pleasure within a
    phasmadaemon, which continually seeks ways to fill its victims with dread.
    Among phasmadaemons, the buying and selling of fears is in itself something
    of a market, much like the economy of souls within the rest of Abaddon. The
    fiends exchange their own horrific new imaginings with one another, creating
    a collection of terrors unfathomable by mortals.
  - >-
    Phasmadaemons do not often serve a single Horseman exclusively, their skills
    not necessarily a boon to any particular facet of death. They tend to
    traverse the outskirts of societies both within Abaddon and outside of it,
    preying on travelers in the dead of winter nights or seeking out hermits in
    order to haunt their isolated homes. The tension before the kill is almost
    as thrilling to a phasmadaemon as the kill itself, and the foul beings
    wallow in the fear they create before swooping in for the final blow. When
    they travel in groups, phasmadaemons use their powers to create great
    multitudes of illusionary images in order to terrorize entire groups or
    crowds of closely situated people, such as causing heart-stopping incidents
    in the middle of a playhouse's performance, situating horrific conjurations
    in the middle of packed bazaars, and positioning frightful images at the
    gallows at a crowded execution.
