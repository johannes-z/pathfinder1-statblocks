Description:
  - >-
    Half-dragons are only rarely the result of dragons mating with other
    creatures-most are the result of strange magical experiments. In most cases,
    a successful creation breeds true with others of its kind, as with the
    dreaded dracolisk. Creating a Half-Dragon "Half-dragon" is an inherited or
    acquired template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature
    (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A half-dragon retains all the
    base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR:
    Same as the base creature + 2 (minimum 3). Type: Creature type changes to
    dragon. Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves. Armor Class: Nat. armor
    improves by +4. Special Qualities and Defenses: A half-dragon gains
    darkvision 60 feet; low-light vision; and immunity to sleep, paralysis, and
    energy of the same type as its breath weapon. Speed: A half-dragon has
    wings. Unless the base creature has a better fly speed, the half-dragon can
    fly at twice the creature's base land speed (average maneuverability).
    Melee: A half-dragon has two claw attacks and a bite attack. If the base
    creature can use manufactured weapons, the half-dragon can as well. A new
    claw or bite attack deals damage as appropriate for the half-dragon's size
    (see "Natural Attacks" on pages 301-302). Special Abilities: A half-dragon
    retains all the special attacks of the base creature and gains a breath
    weapon usable once per day based on the dragon variety (see below). The
    breath weapon deals 1d6 hit points of damage per racial HD possessed by the
    half-dragon (Ref lex half; DC 10 + 1/2 creature's racial HD + creature's Con
    modifier). Dragon Variety Breath Weapon Black or copper 60-foot line of acid
    Brass 60-foot line of fire Blue or bronze 60-foot line of electricity Gold
    or red 30-foot cone of fire Green 30-foot cone of acid Silver or white
    30-foot cone of cold Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows:
    Str +8, Con +6, Int +2, Cha +2. Skills: A half-dragon with racial Hit Dice
    has skill points per racial Hit Die equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier.
    Racial class skills are unchanged from the base creature's.
