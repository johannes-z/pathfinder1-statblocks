Source: PFRPG Bestiary 2
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      1d4 negative levels, 30 feet; Fortitude DC 18 negates. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. A humanoid slain by a bodak's death gaze rises as a bodak
      24 hours later. This is a death effect.
  - name: Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bodaks loathe sunlight, for its merest touch burns their impure flesh.
      Each round of exposure to direct sunlight deals 2d6 points of damage to a
      bodak.
Description:
  - >-
    When mortal humanoids find themselves exposed to profound, supernatural
    evil, a horrific, occult transformation can strip them of their souls and
    damn them to the tortured existence of a bodak. Changed into a twisted,
    misanthropic husk, a bodak wanders the endless tracts of evil-aligned
    planes, periodically stumbling into other realms by passing through portals
    or otherwise being conjured elsewhere. Possessing only fragmented memories
    of its former existence, the bodak is driven by profound emptiness,
    sorrowful longing, and vengeful hatred of all life.
  - >-
    A bodak's appearance is profoundly disturbing. Its flesh looks dried, taut,
    and desiccated, though it possesses a strange, otherworldly sheen. Its body
    is disproportionate and distinctly androgynous. Hairless and with only vague
    hints of facial structure, the bodak's eyes are deep set in their sockets
    and constantly weep foul-smelling smoky vapors. A planes-wise traveler who
    recognizes its shape knows to flee, for most travelers can outrun the
    relatively slow bodak.
  - >-
    Bodaks vehemently despise all living creatures and immediately seek to
    destroy any they encounter.
  - >-
    A bodak retains the ability to speak one language it knew in life (typically
    Common), but it rarely engages in conversation, instead spitting out an
    incomprehensible stream of vile accusations, curses, and threats. On
    occasion, a bodak might wield weapons, but most rely primarily upon the
    effects of their deadly gaze.
  - Bodaks are rarely encountered outside of the Abyss.
  - >-
    As they are slow-witted, powerful evil creatures such as liches and nabasu
    demons sometimes use bodaks as thralls, assassins, or guardians. Bodaks
    encountered on the Material Plane exude extreme malevolence when forced to
    confront the realization of their abhorrent transformations. So great is
    their desire to inf lict their fate upon others that many attempt to drag
    off the bodies of their slain victims and guard them until they rise as
    undead.
  - >-
    A 20th-level spellcaster can use create greater undead to create a bodak,
    but only if the spell is cast while the spellcaster is located on one of the
    evil outer planes (traditionally the Abyss).
