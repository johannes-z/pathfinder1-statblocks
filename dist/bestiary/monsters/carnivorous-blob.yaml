Description_Visual: >-
  Rolling and twitching like a massive wad of translucent ooze, this crimson
  blob reaches out amorphous pseudopods in all directions.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Absorb Flesh (Ex)
    description: >-
      A carnivorous blob cannot eat plant matter or inorganic matter, but it
      devours living flesh with a voracious speed by dealing Constitution drain
      on creatures it slams or constricts. Whenever the blob deals Constitution
      drain in this manner, it heals 10 hit points for each point of
      Constitution it drains. Excess hit points above its normal maximum are
      gained as temporary hit points. As soon as a carnivorous blob has at least
      50 temporary hit points, it loses those temporary hit points and splits as
      an immediate action.
  - name: Reactive Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a carnivorous blob takes damage, it reflexively lashes out with a
      slam attack. This ability effectively grants the carnivorous blob an
      attack of opportunity against any adjacent foe that deals it damage. These
      attacks of opportunity do not count against the normal limit the creature
      can make in a round. Attacks that deal sonic or slashing damage do not
      trigger a reactive strike-rather, they cause the creature to split.
      Whenever a carnivorous blob takes cold damage, the creature cannot use its
      reactive strike ability until after it takes its next action in combat.
  - name: Vulnerable to Cold (Ex)
    description: >-
      A carnivorous blob takes half again as much damage (+50%) from cold
      attacks.
Description:
  - >-
    While sages debate whether the first carnivorous blobs were created by a mad
    wizard, formed in foul fleshwarping vats in some sinister city, or traveled
    to this world trapped in the core of a meteor, there is one thing they all
    agree on-none wish to get close enough to study the monstrosity.
  - >-
    Carnivorous blobs move like a typical ooze, rolling out blobs of its fleshy
    material in haphazard directions, and pulling its bulk across the ground, up
    walls, and even through the water. If a carnivorous blob goes for more than
    24 hours without a source of food, it drops into a sort of hibernation,
    resembling nothing so much as a pool of gelatinous blood. The creature
    springs to life quickly and hungrily as soon as any living prey comes within
    range of its senses.
