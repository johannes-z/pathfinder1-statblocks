Description:
  - >-
    Found skittering through forgotten tombs, crawling through deep forests, and
    filling damp caverns, exoskeletons are animated carapaces of arthropods and
    other vermin. Most exoskeletons are the intentional creations of
    necromancers, but some of these undead monstrosities arise spontaneously
    from places awash with negative energy or are created by malfunctioning
    artifacts. Even though exoskeletons are just as mindless as they were when
    they were living, they now attack all living creatures on sight, exploding
    in a burst of dusty remains when they are destroyed.
  - >-
    A spellcaster can create an exoskeleton using animate dead. An exoskeleton
    can be created from a mostly intact dead vermin that has an exoskeleton.
    This includes arachnids, insects, crustaceans, and even some mollusks, but
    not soft-bodied vermin such as jellyfish and leeches.
  - Creating an Exoskeleton
  - >-
    "Exoskeleton" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal
    vermin that has an exoskeleton (referred to hereafter as the base creature).

    Type: The creature's type changes to undead. It retains any subtype except
    for alignment subtypes (such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind (such
    as giant). It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base
    creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

    Hit Dice: An exoskeleton retains the number of Hit Dice the base creature
    possessed, and gains a number of additional Hit Dice as noted on the
    following table. If the base creature has more than 20 Hit Dice, it can't be
    made into an exoskeleton by the animate dead spell. An exoskeleton uses its
    Charisma modifier (instead of its Constitution modifier) to determine bonus
    hit points.
  - Exoskeleton Size Bonus Hit Dice
  - Tiny or smaller -
  - Small or Medium +1 HD
  - Large +2 HD

  - >-
    Speed: An exoskeleton retains all movement speeds. However, its
    maneuverability for flight drops to clumsy.
  - >-
    Attacks: An exoskeleton retains all of its natural weapons. If the base
    creature didn't have any natural weapons, it gains a slam attack that deals
    damage based on the exoskeleton's size, but as if it were one size category
    larger than its actual size.
  - >-
    Special Attacks: An exoskeleton loses all of its special attacks that rely
    on a functioning biology (such as poison), but retains any others.
  - >-
    Abilities: An exoskeleton's Strength increases by 2. The exoskeleton has no
    Constitution or Intelligence score, and its Wisdom and Charisma scores
    change to 10.
  - 'BAB: An exoskeleton''s base attack bonus is equal to 3/4 of its Hit Dice.'
  - >-
    Skills: Though most vermin are mindless and have no skill ranks, the
    exoskeleton loses all skill ranks if it had any, and it doesn't retain any
    racial bonuses it had.
  - >-
    Feats: An exoskeleton loses all feats possessed by the base creature, and
    doesn't gain feats as its Hit Dice increase, but it does gain Toughness as a
    bonus feat.
  - >-
    Special Qualities: An exoskeleton loses most special qualities of the base
    creature. It retains any extraordinary special qualities that improve its
    melee or ranged attacks. An exoskeleton gains the following special quality.
  - >-
    Burst (Ex): When an exoskeleton is destroyed, its desiccated husk bursts,
    releasing the dusty remains of the vermin into the surrounding air. Any
    creature adjacent to an exoskeleton when it bursts must succeed at a
    Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round as it coughs and sneezes.
    Creatures that don't need to breathe are immune to this effect. If the
    exoskeleton possesses 10 or more Hit Dice, the victim is nauseated instead.
    The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the exoskeleton's HD + its Cha modifier.
