SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Improved Rock Catching (Ex)
    description: >-

      to catch a thrown rock with rock catching. This ability otherwise works
      like the rock catching ability (see page 303).
Description:
  - >-
    Stone giants prefer thick leather garments, dyed in shades of brown and gray
    to match the stone around them. Adults are about 12 feet tall, weigh about
    1,500 pounds, and can live to be 800 years old. Stone giants fight from a
    distance whenever possible, but if they can't avoid melee, they favor
    gigantic clubs chiseled out of stone. A favorite tactic of stone giants is
    to stand nearly motionless, blending in with the background, then move
    forward to throw rocks and surprise their foes. Stone giants prefer living
    in enormous caves in highaltitude, rocky peaks. They rarely live more than a
    few days' travel from other bands of stone giants, and even raise shared
    herds of goats and other livestock between tribes. Older stone giants tend
    to wander away from the tribe for a signif icant period of time in their
    later years, either living in seclusion somewhere or attempting to merge
    into other humanoid civilizations. After decades of this self-imposed exile,
    those who return do so as stone giant elders. Stone Giant Elders Some stone
    giants develop special abilities related to their environment. Called
    elders, these stone giants have Charisma scores of at least 15 and three
    spell-like abilities (CL 10th). Once per day they can use stone shape, stone
    tell, and either transmute rock to mud or transmute mud to rock (DC 17). The
    save DC is Charisma-based. One in 10 elders is a sorcerer, usually of 3rd to
    6th level. Stone giant elders add +1 to their CR.
