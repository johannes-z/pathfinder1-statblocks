Description:
  - >-
    The scylla is one of the more nightmarish aberrations to blight the mortal
    world. Conf licting tales of her origins abound, from demonic flesh-crafting
    and arcane experiments to a divine curse handed down by a vengeful deity.
    The most popular stories cast the first scylla as the monstrous spawn of a
    union between a mortal and a god. Whatever the case, scyllas are fortunately
    quite rare, enough so that many consider them nothing more than tall tales
    told by sailors deep in their cups.
  - >-
    Scyllas dwell along major shipping lanes, often near coastlines, where they
    use their spell-like abilities to lure entire ships to their doom. The
    hideous monsters are intelligent creatures, though half-mad with hunger and
    self-loathing. They normally do not use weapons, but when they do, they
    prefer to fight with light weapons wielded by their human-sized upper arms.
    However, they much prefer to keep their hands free to utilize magic items
    like wands, staves, and other powerful devices.
