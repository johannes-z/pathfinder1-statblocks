Description:
  - >-
    Tieflings are humans with demonic, devilish, or other evil outsider blood in
    their ancestry. Often persecuted for their strange appearance and unnatural
    mannerisms, most Tieflings disguise their nature or are forced to live on
    the fringes or underbelly of civilized society. Though they are not born
    evil, it is an easy path for them to find, especially as most suffer at the
    hands of "normal" folks while growing up. Tieflings look mostly human except
    for some physical traits that reveal their strange heritage. Tiefling
    Characters Tieflings are defined by their class levels-they do not possess
    racial HD. They have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2
    Intelligence, -2 Charisma: Tieflings are quick in body and mind, but are
    inherently strange. Darkvision: Tieflings see in the dark up to 60 feet.
    Skilled: Tieflings have a +2 racial bonus on Bluff and Stealth checks.
    Spell-Like Ability: Tieflings can use darkness once per day as a spell-like
    ability. The caster level for this ability equals the tief ling's class
    level. Fiendish Resistance: Tieflings have cold resistance 5, electricity
    resistance 5, and fire resistance 5. Fiendish Sorcery: See above. Languages:
    Tieflings begin play speaking Common and either Abyssal or Infernal.
    Tieflings with high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following:
    Abyssal, Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Goblin, Half ling, Infernal, and
    Orc.
