SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Keen Scent (Ex)
    description: >-
      An abyssal wolf can detect prey within 60 feet by sense of smell, as per
      the scent ability. This range increases to 120 feet if the opponents are
      upwind; and decreases to 30 feet if downwind. By making a successful DC 15
      Wisdom check the abyssal wolf can determine whether a tiefling or
      half-fiend is present among the opponents.
  - name: Know Alignment (Su)
    description: >-
      Abyssal wolves always know the alignment of any creature they look upon.
      This ability can be negated or dispelled, but the abyssal wolf can
      activate it again as a free action on its next turn.
  - name: Paralyzing Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Anyone within 40 feet meeting the gaze of an abyssal wolf must make a
      successful DC 16 Will save or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds. Half-fiends and
      tieflings have a -2 circumstance penalty on this save. Once a successful
      save is made, the target is immune to the effects of that abyssal wolf's
      gaze attack for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Abyssal wolves roam the Abyss seeking sources of meat. They savor the flesh
    and blood of lesser demons and have a particular liking for the taste of
    tieflings and good-aligned outsiders. Should a pack of abyssal wolves run
    across one of the aforementioned creatures, it does not hesitate to attack.
    The blood and flesh of half-fiends is another meal that these monsters
    enjoy, so they rarely turn down an opportunity to hunt on the Material
    Plane. Many demon lords find it blasphemous that their own kind mate with
    mortals, and thus unleash these monsters on the Material Plane to deal with
    such creatures. Most often when encountered on the Material Plane, abyssal
    wolves have either been summoned by an evil spellcaster or unleashed by one
    of the demonic lords of the Abyss.
  - >-
    The abyssal wolf is a man-sized wolf that stands 5 feet tall at the
    shoulder. When enraged, the hair on the nape of its neck stands up and the
    wolf issues forth a low growl, bearing its razor-sharp (and usually
    blood-stained) teeth.
  - >-
    Abyssal wolves hunt in packs. When prey is sighted, the monsters move within
    range where they can use their paralyzing gaze. Foes that are not paralyzed
    are dealt with first; the wolves circle an opponent and take turns charging
    in and attacking. A foe that is tripped is pounced on by the pack. Once the
    pack deals with the immediate threat, they turn their attention to any
    paralyzed creatures and tear them to pieces.
