  - name: Force Field (Ex)
    description: >-
      A surgeon robot is sheathed in a thin layer of shimmering energy that
      grants it 75 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a surgeon robot with an
      active force field is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the
      force field is active, the surgeon robot is immune to critical hits. A
      surgeon robot's force field has fast healing 15, but once these bonus hit
      points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and doesn't reactivate
      for 24 hours.

    description: >-
      Programmed to execute advanced medical procedures, a surgeon robot can
      perform surgeries and other procedures that heal humanoid creatures of all
      manner of maladies. A surgeon robot can heal wounds, set broken bones,
      cure diseases, treat burns, remove poison, and even install cybertech
      items. These procedures take varying amounts of time for the surgeon robot
      to complete and require different Heal check DCs. The DCs for these
      surgical procedures increase by 10 when they're performed on a
      non-humanoid creature. These procedures leave the patient with the
      exhausted condition. If the surgeon robot fails any of its Heal checks,
      the surgery fails and the patient takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage
      and is exhausted for 24 hours. The procedures a surgeon robot can perform
      are as follows: • Cure Blindness/Deafness (DC 35): The patient's sight or
      hearing is restored. Required Time: 30 minutes. • Install Cybertech (DC =
      5 + the cybertech install DC): Cybernetic equipment is installed safely.
      Required Time: 20 minutes per point of implantation of the cybertech being
      installed. • Minor Surgery (DC 25): The patient is healed of 1d8+1 points
      of damage. Required Time: 5 minutes. • Moderate Surgery (DC 30): The
      patient is healed of 2d8+3 points of damage and 1d4+1 points of ability
      damage to a selected ability score. Required Time: 10 minutes. • Major
      Surgery (DC 35): The patient is healed of 3d8+5 points of damage and is
      cured of blindness and deafness. Required Time: 15 minutes. • Critical
      Surgery (DC 40): The patient is healed of 4d8+7 points of damage and
      either all ability damage to all ability scores or all ability drain to
      one ability score. Required Time: 30 minutes. • Treat Toxin (DC = 10 + the
      save DC of disease or poison): One disease or poison currently afflicting
      the patient is removed. Required Time: 10 minutes.

    description: >-
      Heal is always a class skill for surgeon robots, and they gain a +8 racial
      bonus on Heal checks.
  - name: Superior Optics (Ex)
    description: Surgeon robots see invisible creatures or objects as if they were visible.
  - name: Syringe (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a surgeon robot makes a successful attack with its syringe, it can
      inject the target with pharmaceuticals. The robot contains nanites that
      fabricate the pharmaceuticals stored within its body. Up to 10 doses of
      these pharmaceuticals can be administered per day. The surgeon robot can
      choose to affect its target with cardioamp, cureall, hemochem (grade III),
      torpinal, or zortaphen each time it uses this ability. Rules for these
      pharmaceuticals can be found on pages 33-34 of Pathfinder Campaign
      Setting: Technology Guide.
Description:
  - >-
    These large, insectoid-looking robots were designed to perform incredibly
    complicated surgeries with flawless results. Possessing a data bank filled
    with advanced surgical techniques, these robots produce nearly supernatural
    effects, and the recovery time from their procedures is often nothing short
    of miraculous. These robots were
  - >-
    originally stationed on Divinity to care for the humanoid crew of the ship
    during their long voyage, and some were even employed to treat the aliens
    the ship collected during its journey. Surgeon robots stand 7 feet tall and
    weigh a bit more than 600 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Formed from a skeletal array of gleaming metal, surgeon robots can contort
    their forms to accommodate various positions needed to most effectively
    perform surgical procedures on their patients. Though the robot is capable
    of standing upright and extending its body to a height of 10 feet, it
    usually stands on four legs when working for increased stability. In this
    posture, the surgeon robot resembles an oversized preying mantis. Surgeon
    robots are equipped with powerful and precise rotors that allow them to fly
    if necessary. This added movement allows surgeon robots to treat patients in
    precarious locations during emergency situations.
  - >-
    Surgeon robots possess remarkable speed, dexterity, and structural strength,
    and their design makes them highly adaptable. In addition to sensory inputs
    that exceed the senses of most living creatures, its creators also added a
    nanite-powered pharmaceutical lab that is housed deep in the robot's body.
    Each of its limbs-though seemingly delicate-is crafted from remarkably
    durable metal that flexes to prevent breakage if the robot attempts to lift
    more than it can normally carry. Thin claws extend from its two primary
    limbs, allowing it to deftly and precisely maneuver a patient into the
    optimal position for each of the dizzying number of procedures the robot is
    capable of performing. Should a surgeon robot need to defend itself or its
    patient, its claws are also more than ample weapons.
  - >-
    Some surgeon robots have been reprogrammed to accommodate different sorts of
    patients. Due to exposure to alien creatures or training given by those
    expecting to venture into places with non-humanoid creatures, the robots
    contain detailed information on alien physiologies. These surgeon robots can
    perform surgical procedures on non-humanoid creatures with no increase to
    the Heal DC.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    The Technic League has spent a great deal of effort recovering and
    reprogramming these robots for its own purposes, which are not limited to
    simple healing and surgery. Aside from medicine, Technic League agents use
    these robots as torturers during painful interrogations, or take advantage
    of the robots' pharmaceutical production to keep subjects drugged for months
    at a time. Despite such alternate uses, these intelligent constructs have a
    hardwired directive that Technic League agents have failed to deactivate: an
    obsessive
  - >-
    drive to perfect their craft. Surgeon robots continually attempt to study
    humanoid physiology. They require new subject matter to study with some
    regularity, and if denied such opportunities, they take it upon themselves
    to collect specimens and perform experiments on them-sometimes claiming the
    same Technic League agents who tried to cow them.
  - >-
    These robots are most commonly encountered in Silver Mount, among the
    Technic League compound in Starfall, or hidden away inside other ruins of
    Divinity's crash where they once were stationed to provide medical care.
    However, rogue surgeon robots may also be found in dungeons or caves that
    they've transformed into their own macabre operating rooms filled with all
    manner of strange and alien technological devices. On rare occasions, these
    beings form pacts with other intelligent creatures, bartering their services
    as surgeons in return for both materials and test subjects. Lacking any sort
    of conscience or ethical code, surgeon robots make excellent torturers and
    executioners.
