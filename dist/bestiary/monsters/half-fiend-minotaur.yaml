    *Minotaur ability; see page 206 for details. Half-fiends are creatures
    heavily tainted with demonic, infernal, or other evil power. Creating a
    Half-Fiend "Half-fiend" is an inherited or acquired template that can be
    added to a living, corporeal creature with an Int score of 4 or more. A
    half-fiend uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities
    except as noted here. CR: HD 4 or less, as base creature + 1; HD 5 to 10, as
    base creature + 2; HD 11 or more, as base creature + 3. Alignment: Any evil.
    Type: The creature's type changes to outsider (native). Do not recalculate
    HD, BAB, or saves. Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +1.
    Defenses/Qualities: Gains darkvision 60 feet; immunity to poison; acid,
    cold, electricity, and fire resistance 10; DR 5/magic (if HD 11 or less) or
    10/magic (if HD 12 or more); and SR equal to creature's CR + 11 (maximum
    35). Speed: Unless the base creature flies better, the half-fiend flies at
    twice the base creature's land speed (good). Melee: A half-fiend gains two
    claw attacks and a bite attack. Damage depends on its size (see pages
    301-302). Special Attacks: A half-fiend gains the following. Smite Good
    (Su): Once per day, as a swift action, the half-fiend can smite good as the
    smite evil ability of a paladin of the same level as the half-fiendâ€™s Hit
    Dice, except affecting a good target. The smite persists until target is
    dead or the half-fiend rests. Spell-Like Abilities: A half-fiend with an Int
    or Wis score of 8 or higher has a cumulative number of spell-like abilities
    set by its HD. Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable 1/day. CL equals
    the creature's HD (or the CL of the base creature's spell-like abilities,
    whichever is higher). HD A bilities HD Abilities 1-2 Darkness 3/day 11-12
    Blasphemy 3-4 Desecrate 13-14 Unholy aura 3/day, unhallow 5-6 Unholy blight
    15-16 Horrid wilting 7-8 Poison 3/day 17-18 Summon monster IX (fiends only)
    9-10 Contagion 19-20 Destruction Abilities: A half-fiend gains a +4 bonus on
    three ability scores of its choice and a +2 bonus on the other three.
    Skills: A half-fiend with racial HD has skill points per racial HD equal to
    6 + Int mod. Racial class skills are unchanged, and class level skill ranks
    are unaffected.
