      1/day; effect 1d6 Con and 1d6 Str damage; cure 3 consecutive saves. A
      creature damaged by a sepulchral guardian's slam attack must succeed on a

    description: >-
      Creatures viewing a sepulchral guardian must succeed on a DC 16 Will save
      or become shaken as long as the sepulchral guardian is "alive" and within
      100 feet and for 2d4 rounds afterwards. A successful save renders the
      target immune to the guardian's dread for 24 hours. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Sepulchral guardians are specially constructed guardians created from the
    preserved corpses of dead humanoids that have been encased in iron.
  - >-
    They are created for one purpose and one purpose only: to guard the final
    resting place of a now dead creature. Once activated, a sepulchral guardian
    performs its task until it is destroyed. Even the death of its creator does
    not disrupt a sepulchral guardian as many are created to guard the final
    resting place of the one that created them.
  - >-
    A sepulchral guardian appears as a humanoid standing just over 6 feet tall.
    Its entire body, save its face is encased in a suit of iron. Its face, while
    humanoid, shows no signs of life, and its eyes are filled with the emptiness
    of an automaton. Most sepulchral guardians wield longswords, battleaxes, or
    other such weapons. A sepulchral guardian weighs about 900 pounds.
  - Sepulchral guardians cannot speak and do not utter any sound.
  - >-
    Sepulchral guardians attack with deadly accuracy, relying on either a
    longsword or their powerful fists in battle. They are relentless combatants
    and attack until destroyed or until their foes are slain or driven from the
    area they are protecting. A sepulchral guardian never gives pursuit,
    refusing to leave its assigned area.
  - >-
    Construction A sepulchral guardian' body is constructed from 500 pounds of
    iron mixed with rare chemicals totaling 1,000 gp and the preserved corpse of
    a single humanoid (which is encased in the iron).
