SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Shrieking Frenzy (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a charau-ka can enter a state of shrieking frenzy as a free
      action. While in this state, the charau-ka automatically fails Stealth
      checks and cannot speak or cast spells that use verbal components (or use
      items that require command words to activate), but functions as if under
      the effects of a haste spell. The charauka can continue shrieking for up
      to 3 rounds, after which it is staggered for 1 round. Thrown-Weapon
  - name: Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Charau-ka are masters of thrown weapons. All charau-ka gain Throw Anything
      as a bonus feat. In addition, a charau-ka gains a +1 racial bonus on all
      thrown weapons, and their threat range for thrown weapons is doubled, as
      if the charau-ka possessed the Improved Critical feat for all thrown
      weapons. This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the
      threat range of a weapon.
Description:
  - >-
    Although they call themselves the charau-ka, these dangerous jungle dwellers
    are often known to colonists and explorers as ape-men. Legend holds that the
    charau-ka stem from the demon lord Angazhan, who transformed the bodies of
    the first humans that tried to wage war against his cult, causing the dead
    to rise as the first apemen.
  - >-
    Rumors that charau-ka clerics have perfected a hideous ritual to force those
    slain to reincarnate as new charau-ka are popular tales among jungle
    explorers-but proof of such a magic spell has yet to reach civilization.
  - >-
    Today, the charau-ka are one of the most fecund and widespread races of
    creatures in the Mwangi Expanse. Not all of them serve the Gorilla King or
    worship Angazhan; some have become feral monsters little more organized than
    apes, while others may have turned to the worship of other demon lords or
    even the snake-god Ydersius.
  - >-
    Charau-ka generally dwell in small tribes of a few dozen members. They often
    keep dangerous jungle creatures as pets or guardians, trusting to their
    druids or animal handlers to keep the deadly beasts under control. A typical
    charau-ka village extends from the jungle floor up into the canopy above,
    and usually includes several treehouse-style structures connected by vines
    or rope bridges.
