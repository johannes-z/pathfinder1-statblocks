SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sucking Maws (Su)
    description: >-
      A dark young of Shub-Niggurath that successfully pins a creature it is
      grappling automatically inflicts 1d4 points of Strength drain on that
      creature. A DC 24 Fortitude save reduces this effect to 1 point of
      Strength drain. A creature drained to 0 Strength does not die, but must
      make a DC 24 Will save at that point to resist being driven mad by the
      experience, as the foul green waste exuded from the same sucking mouths
      that drink life implant in the emptied shells strange visions and
      horrifying certainties. If you use the GameMastery Guide in your game,
      this madness manifests as schizophrenia, but with a save DC equal to the
      dark young's Strength drain save DC listed above (DC 24 for most dark
      young). One common result of this unfortunate madness is a strange desire
      to return to the site of their original encounter in hopes of being
      consumed entirely by the creature that only drank a part of their body and
      mind-many of those who survive this horrific ordeal go on to found dark
      young cults of their own. If you don't use the GameMastery Guide in your
      game, treat this madness instead as an insanity spell. The madness element
      of a dark young's sucking maws is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC for
      all of the saving throws involved with this special ability is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The Elder God known in whispered circles as Shub- Niggurath is reputed to
    have a thousand young, when in fact her spawn are myriad. Yet some of her
    children are more fecund and successful than others, and the monstrosities
    known as her dark young are perhaps the best known of this legion of
    monstrosities.
  - >-
    In combat, a dark young usually starts by using entangle and command plants
    to seize control of the surrounding terrain-its ability to constantly use
    freedom of movement affords it mobility through such regions, allowing it to
    move through the areas and select its prey with ease.
  - >-
    Intelligent and canny, dark young know that spell-casters are more difficult
    to affect with insanity, and save that spell-like ability for use against
    rogues, fighters, and similar foes. Flight offers no guarantee of safety
    from the dark young, for they can pursue their foes through the air as
    surely as across land.
  - >-
    Ecology A dark young superficially resembles a tree, and while it possesses
    magic that allows it some ability to appear as a tree or to control the
    plants of the trackless forests it favors, upon close inspection a dark
    young is manifestly something far more than a mere tree. Even the smallest
    of these creatures stand taller than a house, while the largest of them
    shake the very earth with their cloven hooves and crush cities and forests
    alike with their passage.
  - >-
    A typical dark young of Shub-Niggurath stands nearly 30 feet tall and weighs
    12,000 pounds, but many are much larger. While most are encountered in
    temperate regions, they can also be found in subarctic or tropical forests.
  - >-
    These dark young appear no different than their temperatedwelling kin, but
    when they use their tree shape ability, they assume the forms of plants
    native to the region.
  - >-
    Habitat & Society Dark young prefer to dwell in large wilderness regions,
    particularly within temperate woodlands or swamps.
  - >-
    While their presence amid cults of Shub-Niggurath have given rise to
    assumptions that these foul lunatics possess strange secrets that allow them
    to conjure the dark young to serve their cabals as guardians, in fact the
    reverse is true. Cultists of Shub-Niggurath often seek out the dark young
    and offer themselves to the creatures in sacrifice, in hopes of either being
    transported to the embrace of their goddess Shub-Niggurath in the process of
    being digested or impressing the dark young with their devotion so they
    might be granted reincarnation as one of them-or simply out of madness. In
    most cases, these offerings end poorly for the cultist, for the dark young
    of Shub- Niggurath are ravenous-the numerous sucking mouths that stud their
    trunks drain blood, drink flesh, and devour life rapidly, causing the
    victim's body to wither and atrophy. Often, a dark young takes pains to
    avoid damaging those it grabs and holds against its hungry flanks, for a
    living, squirming meal is so much more delicious than a lifeless husk. Those
    drained to zero Strength by a dark young are sometimes left hideously alive,
    perhaps draped across high branches in a tree where the paralyzed victim has
    no choice but a slow death from thirst and exposure, or maybe left for
    hungrier jaws in the woods amid the cloven prints and pools of thick green
    waste that drain from these creatures as they feed.
  - >-
    Yet not all cultists who seek the dark young meet such ends, for some of the
    dark young have strange needs and uses for mortal minions. These dark young
    serve as objects of veneration and obsession for their cults, and happily
    accept their sacrifices in Shub-Niggurath's name, even though most dark
    young themselves feel no great debt of loyalty to their fecund progenitor.
    The actual uses the dark young put their cults to vary wildly-these
    aberrations are quite intelligent, and many have their own goals and plans
    that are made much easier to achieve with the addition of a blindly loyal
    cult. Most dark young merely enjoy the idea of being worshiped as a god,
    while others stand apart from their kin and do feel a strong link to
    Shub-Niggurath, seeing these cults as a way to honor their inhuman mother
    with mortal minions. Yet the dark young of Shub-Niggurath are the spawn of a
    body and mind alien to most forms of mortal life, and as such the majority
    of these monsters have plans and goals that may seem nonsensical at best
    (such as a strange desire to drive all avian life from a swamp, or a drive
    to build a series of stone menhirs in a massive spiral shape recognizable
    only from absurdly great heights) or wantonly destructive at worst (such as
    the destruction of all settlements within a mile of a forest's edge). It's
    rare for the cultists themselves to be privy to the dark young's reasoning,
    and most worshipers content themselves with their own interpretations of why
    they serve one of the Thousand Young.
