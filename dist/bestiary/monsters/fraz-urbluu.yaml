  This creature appears as a massive hulking ape-like humanoid standing nearly
  three times as tall as a normal human. Its head sports large, upright, pointed
  ears and a large round mouth lined with sharpened teeth. Its body is gray and
  covered with fine, thin blue hair. A long, serpentine tail, gray and yielding
  to blue near the barbed end, trails behind it. Two large bat-like wings
  protrude from its back.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Summon Demonic Entity (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day, Fraz-Urb'luu can attempt to summon a demon lord or demon
      prince with a 70% chance of success, and deceive the summoned demon into
      believing it was called by his opponents. The summoned lord or prince must
      succeed on a DC 44 Will save. If the save fails, it believes that
      Fraz-Urb'luu's opponents called it and deals with them appropriately
      (which usually involves killing the offending party for daring to call a
      demon prince or lord). The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +15
      racial bonus. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.
Description:
  - >-
    Fraz-Urb'luu is one of the most physically powerful demon princes as well as
    one of the most cunning. His deceptions range far and wide, affecting and
    influencing not only those on the Material Plane but also other demon
    princes and demon lords. His malevolent nature lends itself well to his
    trickery and deception, and he bends others to do his will. Those that
    oppose him are quickly dispatched. Those he favors are often captured and
    taken back to his lair in the Abyss where they are forced into a life of
    servitude. When the day comes that Fraz-Urb'luu grows weary of them, he
    devours them or throws them to his other servants to do with as they wish.
    He makes his home deep within the Abyss on a smoldering and scarred layer
    devoid of most life. His keep is a large iron and stone castle situated near
    the very center of the layer. A constant stream of traffic emanates to and
    from his castle; demons and slaves tending to their daily tasks.
    Fraz-Urb'luu stands 18 feet tall and weighs about 8,000 pounds. Fraz-Urb'luu
    opens combat by pounding his foes with his spells or spelllike abilities. He
    next assaults them physically by pummeling with his powerful fists and
    slashing with his tail. A grabbed foe is entwined in his tail and gnashed
    between the demon prince's fangs. One of Fraz-Urb'luu's favorite tactics,
    after wearing down his opponents, is to summon a demon prince and then
    immediately teleport away as the prince arrives. Servants of Fraz-Urb'luu
    Followers of Fraz-Urb'luu are usually evil humanoids and consist of clerics,
    politicians or aristocrats, sorcerers, and adepts. Devout followers of Fraz-
    Urb'luu are called Deceivers and must sign a pact of evil with Fraz-Urb'luu.
    Deceivers can receive spells from Fraz-Urb'luu and are granted access to two
    of the following domains: Chaos, Evil, Knowledge, and Trickery. Credit
