Description_Visual: >-

  brightly colored caps, stubby arms and thick, trunk-like legs. They do not
  speak, but they hold up their hands in a sign of peace or supplication.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Spore Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per round as a standard action, a fungus man can release a cloud of
      noxious spores. All living creatures within 5 ft. must make a DC 16
      Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. This is a poison effect, and once a creature
      successfully saves it is immune to the spore cloud of that particular
      fungus man for 24 hours.
Description:
  - >-
    Fungus men are an extremely peaceful and easy-going race of intelligent
    plants. They are bipedal, in a squat, humanoid fashion. The fungus men are
    sexless, and reproduce by means of spore clouds. They lack the appendages
    for fine manipulation of objects, but are quite dexterous in their own way.
    The fungus men are fiercely loyal to their fungus man king, and attack
    immediately if it is threatened.
  - >-
    Fungus men do not communicate by verbal means; they have learned to deal
    with outsiders by using hand gestures and supplicating movements. They
    communicate with each other by pheromones and spores release.
  - >-
    Fungus men cohabitate in enclaves throughout the underdark, farming lichen
    and mosses to trade with other races for soil and excrement (their sources
    of food). Some fungus man colonies keep "domesticated" giant lizards
    available to replenish their dung fields and for pack animal uses. Fungus
    man colonies are not hostile towards each other; neither do they work
    together in any societal fashion.
