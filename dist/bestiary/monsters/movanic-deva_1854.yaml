      Animals and plant creatures do not willingly attack a movanic deva, though
      they can be forced to do so through magical means however. If the movanic
      deva attacks a plant or animal, its protection against that creature ends.
Description:
  - >-
    Movanic devas are relatives of the astral and monadic deva and are usually
    found wandering the Positive or Negative Energy Planes or the Material
    Plane. Movanic devas directly aid powerful mortals when evil threatens the
    balance of the planes. In the celestial armies, movanic devas serve as
    soldiers. Movanic devas, like their brethren, enjoy combat.
  - >-
    They use their +1 flaming greatsword and spell-like abilities when fighting
    their foes.
  - A movanic deva is nearly 8 feet tall and weighs about 280 pounds.
