Description:
  - >-
    The ha-naga is a stronger, fiercer version of the more common naga that
    spends its time moving from plane to plane, engaging in diplomacy, courtly
    intrigues and plotting, and even hunting (both for sport and for food).
    These creatures are known for their voracious appetites, eating anything,
    both alive or dead, except for others of their own kind (even in times of
    starvation).
  - >-
    Ha-nagas lair in deep, dark caves or ruins, far away from most civilized
    lands. A typical ha-naga lair is a twisted maze of tunnels and chambers with
    multiple entry and exit points, all camouflaged and trapped with both
    mundane and magical traps.
  - >-
    Ha-nagas are generally solitary creatures but can occasionally be
    encountered with other nagas of evil disposition. These creatures sometimes
    make truces with local evil humanoids (gnolls, inphidians especially, or
    hobgoblins) allowing the humanoids to serve them or in some cases even
    worship them as gods, and exchanging gifts and treasure for knowledge, food,
    and other goods.
  - >-
    A typical ha-naga stretches over 20 feet and weighs over 600 pounds. Larger
    versions are known to exist. They are stronger and smarter than the ha-naga
    presented here. One unique ha-naga of Colossal size, Sss'ashisth, dwells in
    the fabled City of Brass, spending his days in the court of the Sultan. (See
    the City of Brass boxed set from Necromancer Games for details.)
