Description:
  - >-
    These invertebrate parasitic relatives of the worm lurk in stagnant or
    slow-moving water, waiting for a suitable host. Giant leeches appear as
    larger versions of the common leech.
  - >-
    A giant leech attacks any living creature that comes within 30 feet of it.
    There is a 50% chance that any leech encountered carries filth fever.
