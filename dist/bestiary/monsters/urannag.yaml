SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Encage (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, an urannag can attempt to encage a creature that is not
      aware of it and is sharing its space, or a helpless creature it has
      entrapped. The target creature can resist this attempt with a DC 22 Reflex
      save. On a failure, the target treats the urannag's space as difficult
      terrain, but cannot move out of that space or up more than 10 feet. Each
      round a creature remains encaged, it takes 2d6 slashing damage from the
      sharpened gears and blades thrashing and whirring inside the creature. A
      creature can escape being encaged by making a successful CMB check or
      Escape Artist check (DC = the urannag's CMD) as a full-round action, or
      can smash through a cage wall. These walls are AC 22, have hardness 10,
      and 22 hp-once a hole is smashed into a wall, it automatically repairs
      itself the next time the urannag encages a foe. The save DC is
      Strength-based.
  - name: Exposed Mechanisms (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although an urannag is a construct, it can be damaged and harmed by the
      same methods used to disarm and disable traps. A DC 20 Disable Device
      check can be attempted against an urannag as a full-round action that
      provokes an attack of opportunity. On a successful check, the urannag
      takes damage equal to 3d6 + the character's total ranks in Disable Device
      and it must make a DC 16 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered for 1
      round (the damage bypasses the urannag's damage reduction).
  - name: Living Trap (Ex)
    description: >-
      Defensive abilities that apply to traps (such as trap sense) apply against
      an urannag's attacks.
Description:
  - >-
    The strange urannag (ur-AWN-ag, the singular and plural are the same) has
    long vexed scholars who have argued whether or not the thing is a creature
    or merely a complex trap. In truth, it is a little bit of both-yet another
    unsettling example of how reality on the Abyss doesn't quite match mortal
    expectations. Behaviorally, an urannag acts similarly to an ambush predator,
    yet it has no need for sustenance and is driven to trap and flense prey
    simply out of an inborn sense of cruelty and sadism.
  - Construction
  - >-
    Most urannag are created spontaneously by the Abyss, but enterprising
    spellcasters have found methods to duplicate the construction of these
    strange creatures. An urannag's body is made of 2,000 pounds of iron, and
    its frame must be forged over an Abyssal heat source, which infuses the
    creature with its chaotic and evil urges.
