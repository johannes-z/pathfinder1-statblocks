SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mind Flood (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action and by touching an opponent, a memory child floods
      the opponent's mind with every single thought the child has ever collected
      from those that have come into contact with it. This effect overloads the
      opponent's brain dazing it for 1d6+2 rounds and confusing it for 1 hour
      (treat as a confusion spell, caster level equals the memory child's Hit
      Dice). A successful DC 16 Will save negates the stunning effect and
      reduces the confusion effect to 1 minute. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. This ability is always active but can be suppressed or
      restarted by the memory child as a free action.
  - name: Thought Consumption (Su)
    description: >-
      A memory child can drain an opponent's thoughts and memories by touch.
      (The opponent retains its memories; the memory child just copies them). By
      making a successful melee touch attack, a memory child deals 1d4 points of
      Intelligence damage to its opponent. A memory child must consume at least
      4 points of Intelligence each day or it suffers the effects of starvation.
Description:
  - >-
    A memory child is an extraplanar being from an unknown plane of existence
    whose sole purpose is the harvesting and collecting of memories from all of
    those it encounters. Such memories function as food for the memory child
    (though it retains all memories collected; that is, they are not actually
    devoured and do not disappear). Memory children take delight in traveling to
    the Material Plane and so are most often encountered there, especially in
    places where intelligent creatures reside such as cities and towns.
  - >-
    A memory child waits until the perfect moment to use its abilities. It
    rarely if ever engages in melee, preferring to flee rather than engage a foe
    in combat. If possible, it uses its special abilities to make such combat
    unnecessary.
  - >-
    To the observer, a memory child looks exactly like an ordinary child (male
    or female) about 7 or 8 years old with delicate features, pale skin, and
    innocent eyes of blue (all memory children have blue eyes).
  - >-
    Regardless of its actual age, a memory child never seems to grow up or grow
    old.
