Description_Visual: >-
  This tiny, grisly fetish seems to be carved from numerous pieces of bone,
  adorned with a necklace of teeth and caked with a thin layer of dried blood.
  Hair and twine bind the pieces of bone together. The thing's misshapen head
  leers forward, carved with a demonic, ape-like grin.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Feverish Fortitude (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures within 30 feet of a bone idol gain a +2 bonus on saving
      throws against disease and poison. The effect lasts as long as a creature
      remains within the bone idol's aura.
  - name: Inanimate (Ex)
    description: >-
      An idol is effectively a statuette and does little to suggest otherwise.
      Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is
      indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. Unless noted in its
      description, an idol can make use of the majority of its special abilities
      without moving, though the round after it does so observers can make a DC
      25 Perception check to notice minute hints-magical glimmers, minute
      contortions, etc.-suggesting that the idol is actually animate. Overt
      actions, such as an idol moving or attacking, make its nature obvious to
      witnesses, and to others who make a Perception check (as previously noted)
      even 1 round after it moves.
  - name: Mad Rage (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature bitten by a bone idol must make a DC 16 Will save or fly into
      an uncontrollable, violent rage. Those affected by this rage are treated
      as being under the effects of both the spells rage and confusion for 1
      minute. However, whenever the affected creature rolls a confusion result
      that would lead it to flee or attack the bone idol, the idol instead
      chooses a target for it to attack. This is a mind-affecting effect. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Share Abilities (Su)
    description: >-
      An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect
      itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or
      allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them
      specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are
      marked with an asterisk (*). Skills In addition to the challenge of
      detecting a stationary idol, these constructs gain a +4 racial bonus on
      Stealth checks made to hide amid the materials that comprise their bodies.
  - name: Zombie Fetish (Su)
    description: >-
      Any zombie created within 30 feet of a bone idol rises as a fast zombie
      (see page 289 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary for details).
Description:
  - >-
    Carved from human and animal bones and stitched together with hair, bone
    idols serve as grisly fetishes and totems for cannibalistic tribes. Although
    a number of small, nameless tribes carve bone idols in honor of obscure gods
    of disease and beastliness, most bone idols are fashioned to resemble the
    fearsome, simian appearance of Angazhan, the demon lord of apes and jungles.
