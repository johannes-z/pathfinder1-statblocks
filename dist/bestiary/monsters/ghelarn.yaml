  - name: Carapace (Ex)
    description: >-
      A ghelarn typically shelters within a hardened, rocklike shell that houses
      all of its vital organs. By withdrawing its tentacles and sensory stalks
      into its shell, the ghelarn gains total cover until the beginning of its
      next turn. The shell doesn't provide cover against targeted spells, and
      the ghelarn's movement is limited to downward burrowing during this time.
      The benefits of the shell can be lost if sundered (hardness 5, 8 hit
      points, regenerates in 2d6 days), and a ghelarn caught without its
      carapace loses its natural armor bonus.
  - name: Entrap (Ex)
    description: >-
      A ghelarn secretes a quagmire of sticky fluid a few feet below the sand
      where it lives. This fluid extends in a 10-foot radius around the creature
      and acts to trap victims, making it easier for the ghelarn to attack prey
      with its tentacles or feed upon it with its leeching tendrils. This
      otherwise acts as the entrap universal monster rule.
  - name: Hibernate (Ex)
    description: >-
      When food is scarce, a ghelarn can enter a state of hibernation for an
      indefinite period of time. When it enters hibernation, the ghelarn nestles
      itself in the sand and fills in its porous carapace with sticky excretions
      that quickly harden to seal the creature from the elements. When
      hibernating, the ghelarn doesn't have to eat or drink. A ghelarn remains
      in a state of hibernation until it senses another living creature within
      10 feet, at which point it dissolves the seals on its carapace over the
      course of 1d4 minutes.
  - name: Leeching Tendrils (Ex)
    description: >-
      A living creature that spends more than a single round ensnared within a
      ghelarn's entrapping fluid becomes targeted by invasive tendrils from the
      ghelarn's lower body. These feeding stalks deal 1 point of bleed damage
      each round, and continue to do so for as long as a victim remains within
      the area of the ghelarn's entrapping fluid.
Description:
  - >-
    Born on the desert plain of an alien world, the soft-bodied ghelarn is a
    non-aquatic arthropod living within a shell-like exoskeleton manufactured
    from its own hardened secretions. This outer carapace contains many
    perforations, similar to dry coral or air-blasted stone, providing ample
    room from which the ghelarn can extend its outer extremities and explore the
    world. Chief among these appendages are two main tentacles that it uses to
    pull itself through the upper layers of sand within its native home,
    burrowing just below the surface while its hardened carapace remains above
    ground. As a result, ghelarns give the impression of ambulatory stone
    formations when traveling, but they can also abandon their shells entirely
    and delve deeper into the sand to avoid predators.
  - >-
    Patient, quiet creatures, ghelarns prefer to ambush prey, waiting until
    suitable meals wander within reach of their tentacles or into the sticky
    quagmires they create just below the surface around their nesting grounds.
    Helpless victims soon find themselves pulled into the sand as the ghelarn
    extends invasive tendrils from its lower body. These lesser tentacles slowly
    bleed away moisture from anyone trapped in the ooze, leaving behind little
    more than dried husks and bones for scavengers to find, along with whatever
    equipment such victims may have carried.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    During the creatures' spawning season, an entire clutch of ghelarns produces
    a variant musk in their secretions to attract one another. Some travel for
    miles in search of this scent, and the resulting orgy once a group gathers
    allows for a communal intermingling of reproductive oils. This impregnates
    multiple ghelarn at the same time, enabling them to spawn new offspring as
    they separate again. A typical ghelarn can create 1d3 young, which gestate
    for consecutive 3-month periods rather than being born all at once. Pregnant
    ghelarns abandon these young to fend for themselves almost as soon as
    they're born, moving to another region to birth more offspring rather than
    leaving them within the same area to compete for resources.
  - >-
    It takes a newborn ghelarn about 2 weeks before it can muster enough
    secretions to form a hardened shell of its own. During this time, it stays
    deep below the earth, seeking nourishment and moisture trapped in the desert
    soil rather than risking its vulnerable body to predators above ground. Once
    fully matured, it pushes upward, its shell rising from the sand to mark its
    domain. Sentient creatures wisely avoid these areas, though it's often hard
  - >-
    to tell empty shells from a living ghelarn's hunting grounds. Many societies
    find the abandoned and cast-off shells useful for making tools and crafting
    weapons and armor. As a result, ghelarn habitats frequently draw those
    seeking to harvest them as a resource. Unfortunately for the scavengers,
    these shells also attract young ghelarns who haven't yet formed their own
    and seek to use the abandoned ones as temporary homes.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Ghelarns typically live solitary lives. The extreme nature of their native
    habitat causes them to separate and spread out to avoid overhunting an area.
    They sometimes cooperate in pairs or packs known as clutches to defend
    themselves, but more frequently do so in preparation for mating season, so
    they can drag down large prey that they leave behind for their new offspring
    to feed upon. Sometimes a clutch will gather in geologically unstable
    regions, where quakes and tremors draw their interest. Mostly, they migrate
    in seemingly aimless patterns, driven away from the harsh sounds of overhead
    thunderstorms, as the noise causes them acute pain.
  - >-
    The rudimentary sentience of ghelarns places them just above animal-level
    intelligence. Though they have no real language of their own, they
    communicate warnings or call for help by turning their porous shells into
    the wind and adjusting the flow with their tentacles, allowing air to pass
    through the openings, and creating a musical "voice" similar to wind
    instruments. Each ghelarn's voice is distinctly different from any other
    ghelarn. Some societies have also learned to domesticate young
    ghelarns-these cultures train them to understand simple commands and use
    them as guard animals.
  - Noble Ghelarns
  - >-
    Occasionally, evolution gives rise to a more advanced breed of ghelarn.
    These specimens have both the advanced and giant simple templates, and prove
    more intelligent than their lesser kin. The shell of a noble ghelarn
    encompasses a much greater area, appearing more like an outcropping of rock
    or a small hillside. This grants them the freeze special quality to appear
    as such, allowing them to take 20 on their Stealth checks to hide in plain
    sight. Noble ghelarns sometimes remain hidden within these massive shells
    and purposefully suppress their entrapping ooze in order to dupe other
    creatures into seeking shelter next to them. While the tall shell certainly
    provides shade from the sun and a windbreak against desert storms, those
    camping near a noble ghelarn inevitably find themselves assaulted during the
    night by the creature's invasive tendrils. These appendages are more
    leechlike than the painful barbs of lesser ghelarns and require a DC 20
    Perception check for sleeping creatures to notice.
