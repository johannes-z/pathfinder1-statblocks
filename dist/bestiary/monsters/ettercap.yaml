      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 1d2
      Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution based.
  - name: Spider Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as the druid's wild empathy, save that an ettercap
      can only use this ability on spiders. An ettercap gains a +4 racial bonus
      on this check. Spiders are mindless, but this empathic communication
      imparts on them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing ettercaps to
      train giant spiders and use them as guardians.
  - name: Traps (Ex)
    description: >-
      The ettercap is particularly skilled at crafting cunning traps with its
      webs. Deadfalls, nooses, and spear traps are the most common traps
      ettercaps build with their webs. An ettercap doesn't require gold to build
      its traps, merely time. Rules for crafting traps can be found in Chapter
      13 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. Ettercap Deadfall: CR 3; Type
      mechanical; Perception DC 20; Disable Device DC 20; Trigger location;
      Reset repair; Effect +10 melee (4d6), multiple targets (all targets in a
      10-ft. square). Ettercap Noose: CR 1; Type mechanical; Perception DC 20;
      Disable Device DC 20; Trigger location; Reset repair; Effect +15 CMB check
      (grapple). Ettercap Spear Trap: CR 2; Type mechanical; Perception DC 20;
      Disable Device DC 20; Trigger location; Reset repair; Effect +15 melee
      (1d6+6).
Description:
  - >-
    Ettercaps are typically 6 feet tall and weigh about 200 pounds. They are
    solitary creatures and rarely group with others of their kind, even to mate.
    When they do group, they tend to attract a variety of different spiders,
    forming a strange collective of ettercaps and arachnids. Ettercaps are known
    for building cunning traps out of webs and other natural materials, using
    them to trap prey. They build shelters out of webbing, often high up in the
    trees away from other ground-based predators, and use monstrous spiders as
    lookouts and guardians. Ettercaps are not brave creatures, but their traps
    often ensure that the enemy never draws a weapon. When an ettercap does
    engage its enemies, it attacks with its claws and venomous bite. It usually
    refuses to come within melee reach of any foe that is still able to move,
    and flees if an opponent gets free.
