Description_Visual: >-
  What was once a still puddle of green liquid rises up like a wave, lashing out
  with acid-dripping tendrils. In the midst of the pool, one can barely make out
  regions of darker green that form a vaguely human face.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      Acid quasi-elementals are living creatures of acid; any melee hit deals
      acid damage. Creatures hitting an acid quasi-elemental unarmed or with
      natural attacks take acid damage as though hit by the quasi-elemental's
      slam attack.
  - name: Acid Swimmer (Ex)
    description: >-
      Acid quasi-elementals cannot swim in water. The swim speed given in the
      statistics block is their movement only through acid pools or the acidic
      nature of their environment on their home plane.
  - name: Drench (Ex)
    description: >-
      The quasi-elemental's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns,
      and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size or
      smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire as dispel magic (caster
      level equals the quasi-elemental's HD).
  - name: Fumes (Ex)
    description: >-
      The fumes from an acid quasi-elemental's body act as an inhaled poison.
      Creatures within 5 ft. of an acid quasi-elemental must make succeed on a
      Fortitude save or take 1 point of Constitution damage each round. This
      poison does not have a frequency; a creature is safe as soon as it moves
      more than 5 ft. away from the acid quasi-elemental.
  - name: Vulnerability to Water (Ex)
    description: >-
      An acid elemental erupts in a violent chemical reaction when touched by
      water. An acid quasi-elemental takes 1d4 points of fire damage for each
      gallon of water poured into it. The reaction is so violent that all
      creatures within 5 ft. of the acid quasi-elemental when the water hits it
      must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or take the same damage. Pouring water
      onto an acid quasi-elemental requires a successful ranged touch attack.
      Water from other sources, such as spells or effects that create water but
      do not specify an amount in gallons, deal 1d4 points of fire damage per
      caster level to an acid quasi-elemental within its area of effect. Damage
      from water-based attacks, like the slam attack of a water elemental, is
      increased by 50% against an acid quasi-elemental. Note that this reaction
      does not occur when the acid quasi-elemental touches water, only when
      water touches the acid quasi-elemental.
Description:
  - >-
    Nestled among the various elemental there lies a plane composed entirely of
    acid. It is a place of noxious fumes and roiling, bubbling, pools. Plane
    jumpers do well to avoid this place as it is considered by many to be one of
    the deadliest, if not the deadliest, of the elemental-based planes. Acid
    quasi-elementals rarely journey from their native plane, except when
    summoned. They do not like the Material Plane and when called to the place,
    are usually angered and always a bit uncomfortable. They have no trouble
    moving on land, but prefer the sanctity of their native plane to all others.
    At rest, an acid quasi-elemental is a clear puddle of liquid with a slightly
    green hue. It can rise up like a wave in a manner similar to a water
    elemental, or ooze along solid surfaces by sending out tendrils and pulling
    itself along. Wherever it travels, it leaves behind a shallow trough that
    emits wisps of smoke. Acid quasi-elementals are almost always encountered in
    large pools of acid when on the Material Plane and rarely leave these pools
    when combating foes. A favored tactic is to grab a foe and pull it into the
    quasi-elemental's acid pool, subjecting it to massive amounts of acid damage
    (see the Core Rulebook for details). Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
