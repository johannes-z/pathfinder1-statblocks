Source: PFRPG Bestiary 4
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alien Presence (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that fails its saving throw against a solar dragon's alien
      presence is blinded for 5d6 rounds (or permanently if it has 4 Hit Dice or
      fewer).
  - name: Beam of Light (Su)
    description: >-
      A great wyrm solar dragon can transform itself into a beam of pure light
      and travel to any location it can see as a move action. This travel must
      be in a straight line, but otherwise the dragon can travel anywhere that
      light can enter.
  - name: Channel Life (Su)
    description: >-
      A solar dragon can channel positive energy a number of times per day equal
      to 3 + its Charisma modifier, using its age category + 2 as its cleric
      level. This energy can be used only to heal living creatures.
  - name: Channel Radiation (Su)
    description: >-
      An old or older solar dragon can use its channel life ability to instead
      channel radiation that deals an equal amount of damage to living
      creatures. A living creature that succeeds at a Fortitude save takes half
      damage.
  - name: Primal Fire (Su)
    description: >-
      A very young or older solar dragon's breath weapon can affect creatures
      normally immune or resistant to fire damage. A creature immune to fire
      damage still takes half damage from the breath weapon (no damage with a
      successful saving throw). A resistant creature's fire resistance is
      treated as 10 less than normal.
Description:
  - >-
    Arrogant and proud, solar dragons see themselves as the originators of light
    and life in the vastness of space. They treat all living creatures as their
    own creations.
