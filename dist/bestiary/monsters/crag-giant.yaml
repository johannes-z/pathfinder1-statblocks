SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Earth Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A crag giant gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and
      its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne,
      the crag giant takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These
      modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the crag giant
      is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These modifiers are
      not included in the statistics block.)
  - name: Stonecunning (Ex)
    description: This ability functions as the dwarf's stonecunning ability.
Description:
  - >-
    Crag giants are malicious and capricious giants found inhabiting mountains
    and hills. They are highly territorial and attack most any creatures that
    wander into their lands. Bestial creatures are slaughtered and served as
    food while humanoids, especially dwarves, orcs, and humans are enslaved and
    forced into manual labor serving the crag giants and their ilk. When labor
    is in short supply and high demand, crag giant hunting parties venture
    forth, raiding nearby civilized lands and capturing whatever humanoids they
    can. Slave trade is common between crag giants, other giant races, and drow.
  - Crag giants stand 11 feet in height, and typical weigh around 1,100 pounds.

    Skin color is almost always dark brown, but some slate gray crag giants have
    been encountered. Hair on both males and females tends to be long and worn
    in ponytails. Hair color ranges from black to brown to red. Eyes are usually
    brown or green. Crag giants generally live to be 250 years old.
  - >-
    Crag giants are violent creatures and wade headlong into combat, swinging
    their massive clubs or smashing their foes with their great fists. If
    interlopers are detected early and crag giants have the high ground, they
    bombard their foes with rocks, moving in to mop up any survivors.
