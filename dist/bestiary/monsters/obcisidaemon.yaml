Description_Visual: >-
  This massive fiend has thick claws like a lion's, the broad wings of an eagle,
  and the legs of a massive canine. Its face is that of a three-eyed wolf with
  the jaws of a saber-toothed tiger. While two of the thing's eye sockets are
  merely empty holes that trickle blood, the middle eye glows a sickly yellow. A
  cloud of globular soul-stuff cloaks the creature's hulking body, bits dripping
  loosely from its barbwire-covered arms.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cloak of Souls (Su)
    description: >-
      An obcisidaemon is surrounded by a dark cloud of souls it has consumed,
      often resembling a tattered, ethereal cloak. When an obcisidaemon
      successfully captures a soul with its inherit soul ability, the soul
      becomes a part of its cloak of souls, taking up one soul slot. An
      obcisidaemon has a number of soul slots equal to its Charisma modifier
      (usually 7). An obcisidaemon can consume a soul as a swift action to
      achieve a particular effect. When a soul within this cloak is consumed by
      the obcisidaemon, it is immolated as though by the destruction spell.
      Destroying the daemon frees the souls in its cloak, though this does not
      return the deceased creatures to life. Any attempt to resurrect a body
      whose soul is trapped in a cloak of souls requires a DC 28 caster level
      check. Failure results in the spell having no effect, while success tears
      the victim's soul free from the cloak and returns the creature to life as
      normal. If the daemon is in an unholy location, such as that created by
      the unhallow spell, the DC of this caster level check increases by +2. The
      caster level check DC is Charisma-based. An obcisidaemon can achieve one
      of the following effects by consuming a single soul. • Increase the DC of
      the next spell-like ability the obcisidaemon uses that round by +1. • Give
      the obcisidaemon 3d6 temporary hit points for 1 hour. • Increase the
      damage of the obcisidaemon's next melee attack that round by +1d6 hit
      points.
  - name: Inherit Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever an obcisidaemon kills a creature with its halberd, that creature
      must immediately make a DC 31 Fortitude save or be consumed by the
      daemon's cloak of souls. This is a death effect. If the cloak cannot
      consume this soul without exceeding its number of soul slots, the daemon
      can release a soul as a free action in order to make room for the new
      soul, otherwise, the killed creature automatically succeeds at its save
      and its soul is not absorbed. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Scorched Earth (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that dies within 60 feet of an obcisidaemon must immediately
      make a DC 28 Fortitude save to prevent its body from being utterly
      consumed in unholy fire equivalent to the destruction spell. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The obcisidaemon personifies the darkest elements of war. Obcisidaemons
    strip away the veneer of honor and battlefield glory, leaving only the
    brutal and violent pragmatism at its core, and then divest it of any
    humanity to reveal naught but scorched earth and genocide. Ref lecting the
    disgraceful values of ethnic cleansing, depopulation, and all other forms of
    the clinical, systematic obliteration of civilian populations, obcisidaemons
    are among the most powerful members of daemonkind. These paragons of
    inhumanity arrive in the heart of great cities and leave only wastelands of
    rubble and ashes in their wake. Where an obcisidaemon walks, not even the
    ghosts of the dead remain to lament the destruction, for the daemon wipes
  - >-
    out not only innocent individuals, but also their entire histories and
    bloodlines, ensuring that no future exists for its victims in any sense of
    the word.
  - >-
    Obcisidaemons stand 25 feet tall, have a wingspan of 30 feet, and weigh over
    15,000 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    When a mortal commits a true act of genocide in life and goes to Abaddon in
    death, it has a chance of forming into an obcisidaemon if it survives long
    enough as a member of the hunted. Such individuals rarely have trouble
    managing the unforgiving wastes, as they are willing to destroy any and all
    possible allies in order to ensure their own survival, making betrayal an
    impossibility and solitude an inevitability. This vicious soul eventually
    develops into an obcisidaemon-a lone, wandering mass of slaughter that acts
    as a harbinger of undiscriminating and unforgiving death to all who dare
    stand in its path. In life, the soul of an obcisidaemon perhaps only desired
    to kill a particular chosen population; as an obcisidaemon, however, the
    being seeks the obliteration of all mortals.
  - >-
    Peculiar to an obcisidaemon is the cloak of souls that seems to drip from
    its enormous body, a symbol of its destructive abilities that provides
    onlookers an idea as to the sheer scope of its murderous capabilities. When
    an obcisidaemon lays slaughter to entire populations, it does not feast on
    all of the souls at once, instead capturing victims for later use. When the
    fiend needs to unleash a particularly potent rampage upon a resistant
    population, it consumes its reserve souls in order to strengthen its powers
    and ensure its success in total annihilation.

    Devoted to the wanton, systematic slaughter of mortals, most obcisidaemons
    serve Szuriel, the Horseman of War, who shares similar ideals. In her
    service, an obcisidaemon functions as a high-ranking officer at the head of
    an army of purrodaemons, so skilled are the harbingers of genocide at
    managing the pragmatic art of organized massacres. Sometimes, an amassed
    group of obcisidaemons instead trails behind an invading daemonic army, so
    as to ensure that no trace of the butchered mortals remains but ashes and
    salted earth. Obcisidaemons not only ensure that all life perishes, but that
    the land is thereafter uninhabitable by any other creatures as well.
    Occasionally, an obcisidaemon serves Apollyon, occupying a similar role at
    the head of a titanic flight of leukodaemons, sowing disease and clouds of
    poison across miles of terrain in its passing.
  - >-
    Some obcisidaemons serve no particular member of the Four, instead choosing
    to function as independent agents of genocide. These beings wander from
    plane to plane, laying waste to one civilization after another. Some
    obcisidaemons intentionally spread their true names to the Material Plane,
    hoping for a foolish evil summoner to call upon them, knowing that no mere
    mortal could control their awesome power. Most such summoners end up among
    the first souls devoured and consumed into the cloud of tormented spirits
    that cloaks the now-rampaging obcisidaemon.
