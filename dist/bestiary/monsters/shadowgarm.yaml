Description_Visual: >-
  This amorphous creature loosely resembles a cross between a large snake and an
  insect. It has black oily skin, and parts of its very flesh blend seamlessly
  into the shadows. Its constantly moving, writhing form makes it difficult to
  identify from a distance.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Feather Fall (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shadowgarm's body is both light and consists of numerous folds of thin
      flesh. Although it cannot fly, a falling shadowgarm always descends as if
      under the effects of a feather fall spell, and thus never takes falling
      damage.
  - name: Light Fixation (Su)
    description: >-
      Although a shadowgarm is not particularly harmed by bright light, it
      prefers dim lighting. Magical light, on the other hand, causes a
      shadowgarm to grow slow and lethargic. Whenever a shadowgarm is within an
      area of bright light that is magically created, it is staggered.
  - name: Shadow Blend (Su)
    description: >-
      In conditions of dim light, a shadowgarm's outline wavers and blends with
      the surrounding shadows, granting it concealment (20% miss chance) even if
      its opponents are capable of seeing clearly in dim light.
  - name: Shadow Slime (Su)
    description: >-
      A shadowgarm is coated with a thin layer of oily black slime. Whenever it
      strikes a foe, it transfers a swath of this cold black slime onto the
      creature struck. This slime causes a growing numbness and lethargy in the
      bodies of those it coats. Each time a creature takes damage from a
      shadowgarm's claws, the creature struck must make a DC 13 Fortitude save
      or take a cumulative -2 penalty to its Dexterity score. A creature whose
      total Dexterity penalty equals its Dexterity score is paralyzed and
      blinded as long as the penalty remains in effect. All accrued Dexterity
      penalties fade an hour after the last time the victim was affected by
      shadow slime, but any new shadow slime resets the recovery period.
      Exposure to bright light of any sort causes the Dexterity penalty to
      lessen by 2 points per round until all of the shadow slime is effectively
      "burned away" by the light. A shadowgarm is immune to the effects of its
      shadow slime and the shadow slime of other shadowgarms. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Shadowgarms are strange monsters from the Plane of Shadow, where they
    function as lowly predators and pests somewhat akin to the Material Plane's
    coyotes, leopards, and similar hunting mammals. Yet to a creature unfamiliar
    with the workings of the Plane of Shadow, the shadowgarm is a hideous and
    frightening beast. Generally lairing in ruined sections of towns or dead-end
    alleys clogged with refuse during the day, they come out at night to prey
    upon creatures that stray too far from the safety of light. These aberrant
    predators "leak" into the Material Plane anywhere the Plane of Shadow's
    influence is strong. Small groups of shadowgarms are occasionally seen
    lurking in old graveyards where undead (particularly shadows) are known to
    reside, and anywhere that has strong traditions of shadow magic tends to
    have a healthy population of shadowgarms lurking in out-of-the-way areas as
    well. The typical shadowgarm measures about 4-1/2 feet long and weighs
    approximately 90 pounds, their bodies being strangely light, composed of a
    spongy dark matter and seemingly wisps of shadow itself. Some, however, grow
    to be much larger, though shadowgarms of all sizes prove especially adept at
    blending in among the shadows and detritus of their hunting grounds or
    crawling into crevices it seems creatures of their size would not be able to
    squeeze. Ecology Strange beings with a little-understood physiology,
    shadowgarms prove endlessly hungry, taking sustenance from shadow as if it
    were water and drawing nutrition from the flesh of other creatures as their
    only source of food. Shadowgarms can eat and digest any sort of animal
    matter, from flesh to bone, converting them into little more than smoke and
    shadow. A creature left to a shadowgarm to feed upon leaves behind nothing
    but trappings of metal and similarly solid accessories. A shadowgarm's
    physical form seems strangely fluid, proving slightly malleable and
    generalized. No two shadowgarms appear exactly alike, and even individuals
    of the race seem to gradually change, all the faster in areas of deep
    shadows. Regardless of their endless, fluid alterations, they retain three
    primary clawed appendages, which serve them in consuming meals and fighting.
    Their number of feelers or tentacle-like legs, however, is constantly in
    flux, numbering but two or three one moment and then multiplying to dozens
    the next. Shadowgarms do not have a mouth and hardly have heads to speak
    off-possessing only slight knobby protuberances that seem to have little
    role in guiding their motions. When ingesting matter, they slowly dissolve
    their meals, their bodies breaking down any organic substance they choose by
    resting upon their meal for a matter of moments. The entire process might be
    likened to a body-wide ingestion process similar to that of a fly, as matter
    is dissolved and subsumed by the shadowy hunter's bulk. Once every several
    months, the urge to mate descends upon shadowgarms like a mass racial
    insanity. At this time, their natural aversion to their own kind is
    overwhelmed by a need to procreate. Shadowgarms are hemaphroditic, but
    cannot fertilize themselves- when a shadowgarm gathering begins, these
    creatures congregate in groups of up to a dozen, remaining in close
    proximity to each other for days at a time. The cycle that drives shadowgarm
    gatherings is nothing connected to the Material Plane-most scholars have
    been unable to determine what pattern the timing follows, if indeed there is
    a pattern at all. Habitat & Society Although shadowgarms are quite active at
    all times on the Plane of Shadow, the realities of the Material Plane force
    them into the niche of nocturnal predator. Yet despite their hatred of
    light, they seem to need it in some strange way. Observers have noted that
    the creatures prefer to stand in actual shadows, rather than just in
    darkness, and seem to savor the ever-changing nature of the shadows
    themselves. It may be that shadowgarms abhor total darkness as much as
    light, though neither bright light nor utter darkness causes them physical
    harm. Most shadowgarms' hunts take place under the light of the full moon,
    or in the shadowy hours of dusk or dawn. In cities where shadowgarms are
    common, they naturally gravitate to sewers or narrow alleys. This allows
    them the easiest way to quickly strike at unwary victims from above or
    below. They do not build any sort of true nest or lair, preferring to remain
    constantly afoot in search of new prey. As shadowgarms have no fear of
    falling, they often clamber up to corners and niches at the tops of tunnels
    or just under rooftop overhangs, both to avoid any bright light that might
    be shining down from above and to lie in wait to ambush unsuspecting prey
    that walks underneath. This leads to the discovery of shadowgarms in truly
    unexpected and unnerving places, like in bell towers, within attics and
    crawl spaces, and even hidden amid cracks and loose shingles in old roofing.
    More than one child's tale of boogiemen or strange shapes lurking outside
    their windows might actually be attributed to the daring nocturnal
    wanderings of shadowgarms. Shadowgarms are incredibly territorial, and
    usually do not nest together except during their mating gathering.
    Shadowgarms immediately confront one another upon meeting. Pickpockets and
    other street urchins often share wild tales of shadowgarms battling fiercely
    in the alleyways and nighted dens, fighting with raw savagery instead of
    their more customary stealth. Some canny streetfolk use this territorial
    nature to trick competing shadowgarms into fighting each other, giving
    wanderers out after dark enough time to move through territories infested by
    these lurking hunters without being attacked. Of course, this tactic doesn't
    work well in areas where large numbers of shadowgarms are known to skulk, as
    directing one's attention to avoid a single hunter might prevent a traveler
    from noticing other predators lying in wait in the shadows. On rare
    occasions, a shadowgarm might take to the seas, stealing aboard a ship at
    dock and hiding in the hold. Once at sea, such hunters emerge nightly to
    prey upon the ship's crew. Since a shadowgarm melts away into shadow and fog
    when it dies, leaving no evidence of a corpse behind, this might be one
    explanation for mysteriously derelict ships found adrift on the waves with
    nothing living on board.
