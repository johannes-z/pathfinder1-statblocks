    All ifrits are at some level pyromaniacs. Adoring fire in all its forms,
    they tend to be passionate and quick to action, with a predilection for
    striking first in any conf lict-a trait which keeps them alive but doesn't
    make them a lot of friends. Ifrits generally seek out the company of either
    less-powerful minions who can be browbeaten into following orders, or calm,
    cool individuals who can balance the ifrits out.
