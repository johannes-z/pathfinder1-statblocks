  - name: Soulsight (Su)
    description: >-
      An entropic ooze can automatically detect the location of any living
      creature within 120 feet. It also senses the strength of their life force
      automatically, as if it had cast deathwatch.
Description:
  - >-
    A larger, more powerful version of the standard entropic ooze is know as the
    dark matter entropic ooze, a massive creature that rarely leaves its home
    plane. Spellcasters who summon this creature often live (or don't live) to
    regret it.
