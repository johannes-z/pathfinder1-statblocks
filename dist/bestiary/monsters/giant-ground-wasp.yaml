SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Implant (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ground wasps grow their eggs inside of a living host. Implanting eggs in a
      host is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and the
      target must be helpless but alive. Once an egg is implanted, it exudes
      paralytic enzymes that not only keep the victim in a state of perpetual
      paralysis, but also keep it nourished and alive- and fully aware. This
      condition lasts until the egg hatches 1d6 days later, at which point the
      larvae consume most of the host, killing it. Any magical effect that
      removes paralysis or disease (such as remove paralysis, remove disease, or
      heal) destroys the eggs, but mere immunity to paralysis or disease does
      not offer protection.

Description:
  - >-
    In areas of dense vegetation, ground wasps can destroy crops and ruin the
    land with their burrows, but in the rocky and sandy desert, living creatures
    are most at risk from these dangerous vermin. The blistering heat of the
    desert can damage delicate eggs laid in exposed locations, so ground wasps
    have evolved to lay their eggs safely in the bodies of their victims. They
    keep to their shallow burrows during the hottest parts of the day, but
    remain near the opening to ambush creatures that wander near. A fully-grown
    ground wasp is 2 feet long, with a wingspan of 5 feet, and weighs 22 pounds.
