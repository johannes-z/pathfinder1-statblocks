SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Discord (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a carbuncle can sow discord in a creature within 30
      feet using its telepathy ability. It can use this ability once per round
      to affect one creature. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 14 Will
      save or fall into loud bickering and arguing with those around him.
      Meaningful communication is impossible. If the affected creatures have
      different alignments, there is a 50% chance that they attack each other.
      Bickering lasts 5d4 rounds. Fighting begins 1d4 rounds into the bickering
      and lasts 2d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
      Wisdom-based.
  - name: Foresight (Su)
    description: >-
      A carbuncle has a +2 insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves. This ability is
      always active and cannot be negated or dispelled.
Description:
  - >-
    Deep in the tangled underbrush of forests and in the remote regions of
    dismal swamps and bogs lives a strange creature called the carbuncle. The
    carbuncle is a withdrawn creature and seeks to avoid encounters. Should it
    seek interaction, a carbuncle often begins by proudly announcing the value
    of the gem in its forehead just to watch the reaction such information
    arouses.
  - >-
    Despite its overall shy nature, the carbuncle has a mischievous side as
    well, often seeking to join travelers in order to play pranks and gauge the
    reactions of the unfortunate victims of its curiosity. After joining with a
    party, a carbuncle will seek to cause discord by using selective telepathic
    images and prophesies to breed hostility and suspicion between party
    members. It will often telepathically contact nearby monsters and lead them
    to attack the party so that it can watch in fascination and read the
    thoughts of the party as they are attacked, slipping away at an opportune
    moment.
  - >-
    A carbuncle can be coerced to surrender the gem in its forehead. This
    requires a successful DC 20 Bluff check. If successful, the carbuncle
    releases the gem. If the check fails, the carbuncle sees through the
    deception and attempts to flee. When a carbuncle is slain, its forehead gem
    crumbles to dust. If the carbuncle relinquishes its gem, it grows another
    one within one month.
  - Though fascinated by combat, carbuncles are nearly helpless in melee.
  - >-
    They much prefer to set up encounters using their powers and then watch the
    brutal scenes unfold. Carbuncles surrender immediately if attacked. If
    placed under duress, a carbuncle wills itself to die. A favorite tactic of
    the carbuncle is befriending a party and accompanying them on their quest.
  - >-
    Once it has achieved this objective, it uses its discord ability to cause
    suspicion, hostility, and disruption among the party members.
