SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Foul Breath (Ex)
    description: >-
      A greater basilisk's breath is extremely foul. Any creature in a space
      directly in front of a greater basilisk must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude
      save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round they remain in
      the area. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the
      breath of the same greater basilisk for 24 hours. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Gaze (Ex)
    description: >-
      Turn to stone permanently (as stone to flesh), range 30 feet, Fortitude DC
      18 negates. A creature petrified in this manner that is then coated (not
      just splashed) with fresh basilisk blood (taken from a basilisk no more
      that 1 hour dead) is instantly restored to flesh. A single greater
      basilisk contains enough blood to coat 1d4 Medium creatures in this
      manner. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Claw-injury; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3
      Con; cure 1 save.
Description:
  - >-
    A larger and meaner cousin of the normal basilisk, the greater basilisk is a
    12-foot long reptilian monster with dull brown skin and a yellow underbelly.
    Sages believe the greater basilisk hails from the Elemental Plane of Earth.
  - >-
    Greater basilisks rear up on their hind legs and slash opponents with their
    poisonous claws while also using their deadly gaze attack. The breath of a
    greater basilisk is so foul that all creatures within 5 feet can be affected
    by it just by entering or remaining in the area.
