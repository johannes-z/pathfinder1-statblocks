SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Frenzy (Ex)
    description: >-
      Quippers can detect blood in the water goes into a killing frenzy, as do
      all other quippers within a 90-foot radius. Frenzied quippers attack until
      either they or their opponents are dead. A frenzied quipper can make one
      extra attack when making a full attack action. The attack is made using
      the creature's full base attack. Additionally, it gains a +1 bonus on
      attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. A frenzied
      quipper's swim speed increases by 10 feet. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute
      and can only be used once per encounter.
  - name: Keen Scent (Ex)
    description: >-
      A quipper can notice creatures by scent in a 90-foot radius underwater and
      can detect blood in the water at ranges up to 500 feet.
Description:
  - >-
    The quipper is a rare form of cold-water piranha. They are dark green in
    color and are found in freshwater lakes and stream.
  - >-
    Quippers attack by swarming an opponent and biting with their razor-sharp
    teeth. Once blood is drawn, the entire pack goes into a frenzy, attacking
    twice each round.
