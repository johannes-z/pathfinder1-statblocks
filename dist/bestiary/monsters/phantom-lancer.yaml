      A phantom lancer is not actually two creatures, but rather a single spirit
      animating both a suit of humanoid-shaped armor and a ridden creature's
      barding. Therefore, it does not need to make the checks normally
      associated with riding another creature.
Description:
  - >-
    Raised from the corpses of knights and soldiers slain by treachery rather
    than battle or conflicts considered crimes even in the heat of war, phantom
    armors appear as suits of animate armor, walking or floating of their own
    accord. Most phantom armors haunt the halls and blasted battlefields where
    they were slain, seeking revenge against their murderers or, should that
    prove impossible, confronting any living creature that might give them the
    opportunity to do battle once more. Dastardly necromancers have also
    discovered the process for binding violent spirits to suits of armor, giving
    rise to eerie servants that combine endless patience with cold brutality.
    Phantom armors come in many shapes and sizes; some appear to be nothing more
    than animate helms while others resemble armored giants. Ecology Phantom
    armors-being undead and having no need for sleep or sustenance-make perfect
    guards, especially given their single-minded demeanors and their innocuous
    appearances. While a phantom armor's "suit" is hollow, the spirit of a dead
    warrior still inhabits it, forever caught in the cold embrace of steel and
    forced servitude until it is defeated in battle. Of course, since not all
    suits of armor are alike, neither are all phantom armors. Horrific tales
    tell of ghastly knights floating through haunted corridors, their helmet
    visors revealing only blackness within. The animating spirit of a phantom
    armor is typically invisible, the armored shell appearing to be the entirety
    of the creature. Casting spells like see invisibility or detect undead
    reveals the vague shape of a spirit seemingly wearing the armor. Creating
    Phantom Armor Phantom armors of varying types can be created using the spell
    create undead, as detailed below. In addition to requiring a corpse for it
    to be cast upon, the spell requires that body must be wearing a suit of
    heavy armor. The corpse dissolves into the armor at the conclusion of the
    spell's casting. Caster Level Phantom Armor Created 11th or lower Hollow
