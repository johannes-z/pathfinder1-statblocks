SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Feed (Su)
    description: >-
      By spending a full-round action devouring the body of a dead or
      unconscious creature, a ghonhatine gains 1d8+9 temporary hit points and a
      +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls for 1 minute. The bonus to hit points
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Filth Fever (Ex)
    description: >-
      Disease-injury; save Fort DC 25; onset 1d3 days; frequency 1 day; effect
      1d3 Dex damage and 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Powerful Stench (Ex)
    description: >-
      An enraged ghonhatine secretes a tarry, musk-like chemical. Any living,
      non-ghonhatine creature within 10 feet must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude
      save or be nauseated as long as it remains within the affected area and
      for 1d4 rounds afterward. A creature that saves is sickened as long as it
      remains in the area, and can't be affected again by the same ghonhatine's
      stench for 24 hours. This is a poison effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Regurgitate (Ex)
    description: >-
      A ghonhatine can expel the contents of its stomach as a ranged attack with
      a splash weapon that has a range increment of 20 feet. It deals 2d6 acid
      damage to the target and splashes all adjacent creatures. In addition to
      taking damage, a target directly hit by a ghonhatine's regurgitation must
      make two DC 24 Fortitude saves, the first to resist contracting filth
      fever, and the second to avoid being nauseated for 1 minute. A nauseated
      creature can end its nausea early by dousing itself in a gallon of water.
      All creatures adjacent to the target must make DC 24 Fortitude saves to
      avoid being sickened for 1 minute. Once a ghonhatine uses this ability it
      can't use it again until it feeds. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

    Troglodytes forced to undergo fleshwarping by the drow, ghonhatines harken
    to what troglodytes might have been in savage prehistory. They stand over 10
    feet tall (hunched to about 8 feet) and weigh upward of 5,000 pounds.
