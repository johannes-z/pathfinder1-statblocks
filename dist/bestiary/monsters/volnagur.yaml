SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Rage (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature taking bleed damage from Volnagur's razor tongues takes a -4
      penalty on Will saves and is affected as the murderous commandUM spell
      (Will DC 16 negates) each round that bleeding continues, ignoring allies
      that are also taking bleed damage from Volnagur.
  - name: Eye Rays (Su)
    description: >-
      Volnagur fires eye rays at a range of up to 120 feet. Creatures struck by
      his eye rays are nauseated for 1 minute (Fortitude DC 29 negates). In
      addition, if the target fails a second Fortitude save against the same DC,
      it gains one of the following conditions, lasting as long as the nauseated
      condition, as its mind and body begin to unravel (roll 1d6): 1-confused,
      2-fatigued (exhausted if already fatigued), 3-shaken (increase severity of
      fear effect if already present), 4-sickened, 5-staggered, 6-stunned.
      Reroll if an identical condition already exists. This is a sonic effect.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Shatter Silence (Su)
    description: >-
      Volnagur's presence unravels magical silence effects or effects that
      provide energy resistance against sonic attacks. At the beginning of its
      turn, any such effect within 60 feet is targeted as dispel magic (caster
      level 25th).
Description:
  - >-
    Volnagur, the End-Singer, is an alien thing whose very presence brings
    turbulence, disturbance, and cacophony wherever he soars. He flits with
    effortless grace upon a hideous assortment of mismatched wings that
    constantly molt and rot from within, the oldest wings falling off as new
    ones spring up and grow in their place. His skirling cry awakens madness and
    blood fury in those who listen, as does the touch of his impossibly long,
    jagged-razor tongues. Alien harmonics induced by his grotesque gaze cripple
    those upon whom he gazes.
