SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      The soul knight projects a fear aura that functions like the fear spell
      within a 30 ft. radius. Affected creatures must make a DC 17 Will save to
      resist the effect. Use of this ability is a free action. This save is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A soul knight is a suit of armor animated by the lingering soul of an evil
    knight, cursed to undeath as punishment for having committed betrayal,
    murder or other crimes. The evil spirit continues to inhabit its old armor,
    repeating the deeds that brought about the living knight's ruin.
  - >-
    Soul knights seek out those that remind them of their past station (good
    clerics, paladins, etc.) and attack those foes first in combat.
