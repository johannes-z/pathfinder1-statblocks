  Clad in hides and furs, this creature appears to be a small, ugly woman whose
  hair, claws, and teeth crackle with sparks of electricity. Her windswept hair
  billows up from her brow like an enormous thunderhead.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Scent (Ex)
    description: >-
      A storm hag has the scent ability, but only with respect to humanoid
      children and immature animals. Thus, she could sniff out a child's hiding
      place or a den of wolf pups, but not the child's parents or the den
      mother.
  - name: Storm Rider (Su)
    description: >-
      A storm hag is considered two size categories larger than she actually is
      in regard to wind effects.
  - name: Storm Strike (Su)
    description: >-
      Each time a storm hag makes a successful attack with her bite, claws, or
      when she uses a weapon that is predominantly made of metal the attack
      deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage.
  - name: Whipping Winds (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a storm hag can use her gust of wind spell-like
      ability to trip her foes. This ability can only affect one target within
      30 feet, and the storm hag uses her combat maneuver bonus as if tripping a
      creature normally. The gust of wind spell doesn't possess its normal
      effects, but instead sweeps a creature off its feet. Attempting to trip a
      creature with this ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity, but
      casting the spell-like ability provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.
Description:
  - >-
    When the clouds turn gray and the winds pick up into a howl, wise travelers
    pray that the cause is only a natural tempest and the foul weather is not
    connected with a storm hag. Storm hags are hateful creatures, and strangely,
    their hate is one of the few things that brings them pleasure.
  - >-
    A storm hag resembles a shrunken old woman with a thundercloud of hair
    stacked atop her wrinkled head. Her mouth hangs open, revealing thin pointed
    teeth; small arcs of electricity can be seen jumping across her teeth and
    spittle. Black talons sprout from her fingertips, likewise crackling with
    electricity. A storm hag's wrinkled face contains a look of gleeful
    distaste, and her eyes are thick with cataracts, rendering her gaze
    pupil-less. A storm hag's hair is wild and unruly with static electricity
    popping and crackling throughout the mass. Seemingly animated, a storm hag's
    hair can easily stand as tall as she is. Wiry and stooped, a storm hag
    weighs about 70 pounds and stands a little over 4 feet tall, though if she
    stood up straight she could easily reach 5 feet or more. A storm hag usually
    wears rough furs and coarse woolen clothing that is rarely cleaned, giving
    her a distinctly unpleasant odor.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Like most other living things, a storm hag needs to eat, and her favorite
    meal is the tender flesh of young children. Storm hags use their ability to
    smell children and young animals to track down their meals no matter where
    the child has hidden himself. On Golarion, storm hags have developed a
    special fondness for Kellid and Ulfen children.
  - >-
    Storm hags find the childlike gnomes and half lings infuriating. It is
    unknown why this is so-perhaps storm hags cannot distinguish between
    children and members of these small races on sight and are angered that
    their prey is not actually their favorite food. They may very well just have
    some other unknown pet peeve about the smaller folk, but either way, the
    presence of gnomes or half lings drives storm hags into a rage. When given
    the choice, storm hags always target members of these races above all
    others.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Storm hags are most numerous in the northern lands of the Inner Sea region,
    but with their ability to fly, their insatiable hunger, and the desire to
    share their hate with others, storm hags can likely appear anywhere. They
    prefer areas that are prone to inclement weather, and enjoy flying through
    the air during thunderstorms, feeling the static discharge dancing across
    their warty skin. Storm hags most frequently claim territory in the wild
    spaces between settlements where they keep their distance from civilization
    unless hunting. Like a predator, a storm hag constantly surveys her
    territory and takes great pains in keeping a secret den she considers always
    hers. For the most part, a storm hag is content to remain in one place if
    the food is plentiful and her shelter is safe and obscured. A storm hag's
    den is a simple, yet grotesque affair, often located in deep, dark forests
    or atop craggy mountains, and is always hidden from sight. Cluttered with
    bones and skins from previous meals, a den's most dominant feature is the
    storm hag's cauldron.
  - >-
    Storm hags roam their territory hunting, preferring to prey on children if
    possible, but they do consider adult humanoids suitable substitutes when
    children are unavailable. A storm hag only stoops to eating animals when her
    hunger grows too strong, however.
  - >-
    When a storm hag encounters travelers in her territory, she torments the
    unwitting visitors, calling down the winds and whipping up a storm of
    howling gales and crashing lightning to break her enemies' ranks and to send
    them running for shelter. Once her prey has been cornered into a cave or
    thicket where they sought shelter from the weather, the storm hag sows
    discontent by using her whispering wind spell-like ability to harass and
    frighten the sheltered travelers with a hate-filled, disembodied voice. Like
    a cat toying with a crippled field mouse, the storm hag pushes her prey to
    their breaking point-letting them steep in shivering fright-before
    confronting them face to face with tooth, claw, and lightning before finally
    killing and consuming them.
  - Storm Hag Covens
  - >-
    Like other hags, storm hags form covens. They prefer to form these covens
    with other storm hags, but storm hags have been known to team up with green
    hags or other hags on occasion. Storm hags inhabiting stormy coasts or soggy
    salt marshes sometimes ally with sea hags and form covens with them. Though
    they respect the strength of annis hags, few storm hags enter into a coven
    with those brutish and simple creatures. When they do, the storm hags rely
    on the annis hags' intimidating physical might to help in their hunts.
  - >-
    A storm hag is an attractive prospect for any burgeoning coven-to-be, but
    these hags aren't easily wooed into joining with others. A storm hag is
    haughty and views her way of doing something as the best, if only because
    she is the one doing it. Any hag thinking of forming a coven with a storm
    hag would do well to ride a fine line between flattery and outright
    dominance by performing simultaneous acts of humble depravity and honorific
    evil. The other two hags in a coven with a storm hag gain her child-scent
    ability as long as they are within 100 feet of the storm hag. In addition, a
    coven with a storm hag as a member has access to the following spell-like
    abilities beyond what a normal coven provides: call lightning storm (DC 18),
    plague stormUM (DC 19), quench (DC 16), whirlwind (DC 21), wind wall. Like
    other covens, all three hags must be within 10 feet of one another and must
    work together and take a full-round action take part in this cooperative
    magic. For more information about hag covens, see page 167 in the Pathfinder
    RPG Bestiary.
