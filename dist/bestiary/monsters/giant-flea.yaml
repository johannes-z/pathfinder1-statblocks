Description:

    Much like their smaller cousins, giant fleas are hemophagous insects that
    live in any kind of environment where they can feed upon blood. These
    creatures possess surprising agility and strength. Able to leap great
    distances, they flit about mindlessly, looking for easy prey. A giant flea
    can go for several months without feeding, but then gorges after such a
    fast. A witch can take a giant flea as a familiar. Like all vermin, a giant
    flea gains 1 point of Intelligence when it becomes a familiar. A giant flea
    familiar grants its master a +3 bonus on Fortitude saves against disease.
