    description: >-

      ranged touch attack with no range increment. Any opponent hit by this
      attack is exposed to the seru's poison.
Description:
  - >-
    A seru is an underground variety of telepathic venomous snake with the wings
    of a bat. These creatures have long held a special relationship with
    serpentfolk, and some legends suggest the snake-god created these winged
    vipers to assist the serpentfolk in their war against humanity. Intelligent
    enough to form their own culture, many serus live entirely separate lives
    from serpentfolk enclaves. Even so, many serpentfolk wizards still seek out
    serus to bind them as familiars. A spellcaster must have the Improved
    Familiar feat, be of an evil alignment, and be an arcane caster of level of
    7th or higher to gain a seru familiar.
  - >-
    Serus are natural predators that prefer to track prey by scent. When ready
    to strike, they spit venom into the eyes of a victim and use ambush tactics
    to wear down their targets. When presented with overwhelming odds or those
    capable of resisting their venom, serus tend to flee and hide among their
    cavern rocks.
  - >-
    Serpentfolk often use serus to watch their territorial borders. These
    creatures serve both as a deterrent and as telepathic spies that can quickly
    alert their masters to the presence of outsiders. They sometimes enter into
    friendships with degenerate serpentfolk, participating in raiding parties as
    equal companions and trackers, or else command them by acting as mouthpieces
    for purecastes.
  - >-
    An adult seru weighs approximately 20 pounds, with a body nearly 3 feet long
    and a wingspan of 5 feet. A mated female lays two to five eggs every year,
    but many fall victim to underground predators before they ever hatch. Serus
    have an average life span of 25 years.
