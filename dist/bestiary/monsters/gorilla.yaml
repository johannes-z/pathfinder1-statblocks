Description:
  - >-
    An adult male ape is 8 feet tall and can weigh as much as 400 pounds. While
    generally shy and peaceful creatures when left to their own business,
    gorillas are territorial and become highly aggressive when provoked. This
    stat block can generally be used for any of the larger types of primates,
    such as gorillas-for smaller apes like orangutans and chimpanzees, apply the
    young simple template. Even smaller primates should use the stats for
    monkeys found on page 132. Gorillas typically make a large show of force
    before actually attacking, thumping their chests with their palms, stamping
    their feet, and roaring loudly. Any opponents who refuse to flee after this
    display are attacked. Troops of apes fight together in a frenzy, tearing
    opponents to pieces with their hands and teeth.
