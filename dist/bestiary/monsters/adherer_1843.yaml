Description_Visual: >-
  This creature appears to be a withered humanoid wrapped in decaying and
  rotting bandages. Upon close inspection, what appeared to be bandages are
  actually loose folds of the creature's skin. A sour-smelling odor fills the
  air around the creature.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adhesive (Ex)
    description: >-
      An adherer exudes a sour smelling glue-like substance that acts as a
      powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or items touching it, except
      for items made of stone. The adherer automatically grapples any creature
      it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot break free
      while the adherer is alive without removing the adhesive first. A weapon
      that strikes an adherer is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC
      14 Reflex save. A successful DC 14 Strength check is needed to pry it off.
      The save and check DC are both Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    An application of boiling water thrown on the adherer deals 1d4 points of
    damage to it (and to any creature stuck to it). It also reduces both the
    Reflex save DC and the Strength check DC to 10 for 1 round. An application
    of fire deals damage to both the adherer and any creature stuck to it and
    weakens the adhesive (as above) for 1d3 rounds.
  - >-
    An application of the universal solvent automatically dissolves the
    adhesive. An adherer can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance
    breaks down 1 hour after the creature dies.
  - >-
    Adherers are strange creatures found in forested areas or underground
    caverns. They resemble mummies at a distance (DC 20 Knowledge [religion] or
    Perception check from a distance of 10 feet or more to discern that the
    creature is not in fact a mummy), but are not in fact related to the
    aforementioned undead. Adherer's are malign creatures and attack just about
    any living creature they encounter.
  - An adherer is 6 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds.
  - >-
    Adherers attack by ambushing their prey. When lying in wait, an adherer
    covers its body with leaves, sticks, or debris to better blend with its
    surroundings. When prey wanders too close, the adherer springs to the
    attack. They are cowardly creatures, and if spotted before they attack, flee
    from their potential prey.
  - >-
    The adherer attacks by pummeling its foes with its fists. Those successfully
    attacked are stuck to the adherer.
