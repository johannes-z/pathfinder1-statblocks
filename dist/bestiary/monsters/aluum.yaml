SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      An aluum is immune to any spell or spelllike ability that allows spell
      resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently
      against the creature. A magical attack that uses negative energy (such as
      channel negative energy, inflict light wounds, or enervation) deals no
      damage, but speeds up the aluum's attacks and movement as if it were under
      the effects of a haste spell for 1d6 rounds. A magical attack that uses
      positive energy slows the aluum as if by a slow spell for 1d6 rounds and
      dispels any haste effects currently affecting it. Magic jar confuses the
      creature for 1d6 rounds.
  - name: Paralysis (Su)
    description: >-
      The touch of an aluum paralyzes living creatures that fail a DC 17
      Fortitude save for 1d4 minutes. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Soul Shriek (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action every 1d4 rounds, the aluum's enslaved souls may emit a
      keening wail in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 10d6 points of
      sonic damage and are stunned for 1 round. A DC 15 Will save halves the
      damage and negates the stun effect. This is a sonic mindaffecting effect.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Aluums are magical constructs created from metal and stone native to
    Katapesh. They are the fighting juggernauts that maintain order within the
    city of Katapesh when the city's normal means of doing so fail. Aluums are
    powered by the souls of Katapeshi slaves and prisoners bound into glowing
    gems in their chests.
  - >-
    An aluum stands approximately 14 feet tall and weighs over 2 tons. They are
    controlled by magical pendants called charms of aluum control (see page
    298).
  - >-
    Construction Although the secret to the creation of aluums is closely
    guarded by the Pactmasters, near approximations have appeared elsewhere,
    indicating that some have either reverse-engineered the process or have
    stolen those secrets from Katapesh. During the creation process, the souls
    of a dozen slaves are siphoned from their bodies as they die.
  - >-
    Fragments of these souls are placed within the inert body of the aluum,
    giving it its animating force.
