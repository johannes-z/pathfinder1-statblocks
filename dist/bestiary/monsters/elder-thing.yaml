  - name: Hibernation (Ex)
    description: >-
      An elder thing can enter a state of hibernation at will; doing so takes 1
      minute. While in this state, it can take no actions and is effectively
      helpless, as if it were in a deep sleep. An elder thing can remain in
      hibernation for as long as it wishes- while in this state, it does not
      need to eat or drink, nor does it age. Time effectively stands still for a
      hibernating elder thing. If it is jostled or damaged while hibernating, an
      elder thing can attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it succeeds, it awakens in
      2d4 rounds. Otherwise, it takes 1d4 days to awaken from hibernation. An
      elder thing can set the length of its hibernation when it first enters
      this state, so that it can awaken after a set amount of time has passed.
      When awakening at a set time in this manner, an elder thing needs only 1d3
      rounds to rouse itself, with no Will saving throw necessary.
  - name: Limited Starflight (Ex)
    description: >-
      An elder thing can survive in the void of outer space, and its wings allow
      it to use its fly speed in that environment despite the lack of air.
      Unlike creatures with full starflight, an elder thing's ability to fly in
      outer space does not allow it to reach unusually high speeds-an elder
      thing that wishes to travel from one planet to another typically
      calculates the distance and then hibernates for the majority of the
      journey, relying on its momentum and inertia to carry it to its
      destination while it slumbers along the way.
Description:
  - >-
    Known by various names on various worlds, but most often as "elder things"
    or "old ones," these alien creatures are interested in creating lasting
    works of art, architecture, and even life (such as the dreaded shoggoths).
    They possess a boundless capacity for war and egotism. A typical elder thing
    is 6 feet tall from head to foot, with a 7-foot wingspan. Surprisingly heavy
    for its size, an elder thing generally weighs about 450 pounds.
