  - name: Painful Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      The bite of a scarlet spider is extremely painful. A creature bitten takes
      a -1 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and
      ability and skill checks until cured. A neutralize poison or remove
      disease spell, or a DC 13 Heal check removes the penalty. The check DC is
      Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Scarlet spiders dwell in temperate forests and make their homes in the
    hollows of trees, under fall trees, and in dense foliage.
  - >-
    Scarlet spiders are deadly, aggressive black spiders about 3 inches long.
    Their legs are long, thin, and covered in a thin layer of dark hair.
  - >-
    Their bodies are solid black with horizontal bands of scarlet ringing them.
    Scarlet spiders are not web-spinning spiders; therefore, they do not possess
    the standard web ability of other spiders.
