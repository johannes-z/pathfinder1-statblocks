SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bay (Su)
    description: >-
      When the Yethazmari howls or barks, each creature within a 300-foot-radius
      spread must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be panicked for 2d4 rounds.
      This is a sonic mindaffecting fear effect. Evil outsiders are immune to
      this ability. Whether or not it succeeds at its save, a creature in the
      area is immune to the Yethazmari's bay for 24 hours. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      The Yethazmari's breath weapon is a jet of smoke. Any nonchaotic creature
      that takes damage from this breath weapon must succeed at a DC 25 Will
      save or be confused for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Soul Scream (Su)
    description: >-
      Anytime the Yethazmari takes piercing or slashing damage, its wounds
      create a terrifying cacophony equivalent to its bay ability. Creatures
      within 10 feet of it take a -4 penalty on their saves against this effect.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Contact or bite-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds;
      effect 1d6 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Description:
  - >-
    Having witnessed the most profane atrocities committed by the Mother of
    Monsters, the eyes of Lamashtu's herald-the Yethazmari-burned to smoldering
    coals. Now this ancient monstrosity, often said to be Lamashtu's favored
    offspring, sees only worlds undone and endless ruinous visions of reality
    rent by Lamashtu's claws. The Yethazmari stands 14 feet tall and weighs over
    1,600 pounds.
