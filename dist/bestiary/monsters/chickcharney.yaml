SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blessed Trill (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a chickcharney can emit a melodious
      trill that grants all creatures within a 20-foot radius a +1 morale bonus
      on saving throws for the rest of the day. This is a sonic, mind-affecting
      effect.
  - name: Ill Luck (Su)
    description: >-
      When a chickcharney hits a creature with one of its natural attacks, the
      target is exposed to the chickcharney's curse. Curse of Ill Luck: save
      Will DC 14; effect the creature takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving
      throws, ability checks, and skill checks. A creature can be affected by a
      curse of ill luck multiple times (up to a maximum cumulative penalty of
      -4). Chickcharneys are immune to this curse. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Maddening Screech (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a standard action, a chickcharney can emit a
      piercing cry that affects all other creatures within a 30-foot radius. An
      affected creature must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or become
      confused for 1d3 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Chelish explorers first came upon this strange magical bird during their
    early voyages to the Shackles. While the unusual creature was initially
    laughed at for its unsightly appearance and awkward gait, the tempestuous
    bird has nonetheless proven to be a force to be reckoned with in its own
    way. A chickcharney can grant good luck to those it deems worthy of its
    gifts, but its favor can just as easily turn to scorn, and a mere scratch
    from a chickcharney's accursed beak or claws has spelled the end for
    countless unwary seafarers.
  - >-
    Naturally curious and trusting, chickcharneys freely approach most
    non-threatening humanoids, even accompanying them for short times and often
    leaving their nesting spots unprotected if they have no eggs or mate.
    However, they are fickle things, and if they recognize hostility or
    rudeness, they inf lict all manner of chaos upon those who provoke them.
    Chickcharneys fiercely protect their eggs and young, their eggs being highly
    coveted by predators as well as humanoids. The shells are thought to possess
    alchemical properties that can be employed in numerous formulae, and many
    alchemists are willing to pay exorbitant sums for intact specimens.

    While some pirates of the Shackles continue to insist that encountering a
    chickcharney is a good omen, a much larger contingent gives the ornery and
    erratic bird a wide berth. A chickcharney is 3 feet tall and weighs 50
    pounds.
