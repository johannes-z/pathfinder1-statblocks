Description_Visual: >-
  This creature appears as a floating blob of mottled black and gray flesh. 
  From its central form sprouts six long tentacles and three snake-like heads,
  each head perched atop a thin, serpentine neck. Each head has a gaping maw
  lined with pointed fangs. Many smaller tentacles jut from its central form
  only to disappear back into its trunk just as quickly as they appeared.

Description:
  - >-
    Gohls are nightmarish creatures found lurking in desolate ruins or
    subterranean caverns. No one is quite sure of their true origin and some
    sages believe they may have traveled to the Material Plane from another
    dimension or time. They are solitary creatures and favor humanoid prey above
    all others, though they are not adverse to attacking and devouring any
    living creature encountered.
  - >-
    A gohl is a 10-foot wide, 10-foot high, blob of mottled black and gray
    flesh, slimy and rubbery to the touch. Each of its three heads is gold with
    red eyes and has a wide mouth lined with double rows of needle-sharp teeth.
    Each neck is scaled gold and turns to dark green as it nears the gohl's
    body. The underside of each neck is slightly lighter in color.
  - >-
    Gohls communicate with others of their kind by changing the color of their
    trunk. In combat, a gohl can release a loud, metallic-sounding roar from one
    of its heads and often does so, in an effort to scare its adversaries.
  - >-
    Gohl's make no effort to disguise themselves or hide from opponents. As soon
    as intruders are detected in their area, they move to intercept them.
  - >-
    The gohl begins combat by grabbing a foe with a tentacle. A grabbed foe is
    subjected to as many bite attacks each round as the gohl can bring against
    it. Multiple opponents are often grabbed and bitten as well. Foes that are
    killed by a gohl are carried to its lair and digested.
