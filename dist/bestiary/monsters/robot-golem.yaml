SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A robot golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell
      resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently
      against it, as noted below. • A magical attack that deals electricity
      damage deals half damage to the golem. Additionally, for 1d4+1 rounds the
      golem gains the benefits of haste and goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem
      goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing an
      object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach; it then moves
      on to spread more destruction. The golem comes back under the control of
      its creator when the duration ends. • A transmute metal to wood spell
      reduces the robot golem's damage reduction by 5 and its natural armor
      bonus by 9 for 1d4 rounds. • A robot golem is affected normally by rust
      attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.
  - name: Rend Construct (Ex)
    description: >-
      This functions as the rend special ability, except the robot golem can
      rend only other constructs.
  - name: Shockwave (Ex)
    description: >-
      A robot golem can release a pulse of electrical energy held within its
      nonfunctioning batteries as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds. This
      pulse is a 30-foot-radius spread that deals 8d6 points of electricity
      damage to all creatures in its area of effect (Reflex DC 19 half). The
      save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    When robots are damaged beyond the abilities of Numerian technologists to
    repair, salvages sometimes animate their frames via magic rather than
    science.
  - >-
    What results is more of a walking mechanical corpse that lacks the
    intelligence and vulnerabilities of a true robot.
  - >-
    The arcanists of the Technic League often employ these magically animated
    constructs to combat rogue robots or those under the control of their
    enemies.
  - >-
    Construction A robot golem's body used to be a Large robot, but is now
    nonfunctional. Any major damage on the intended body must be repaired prior
    to animation.
