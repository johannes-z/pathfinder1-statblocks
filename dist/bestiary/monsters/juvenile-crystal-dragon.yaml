Description:
  - >-
    Crystal dragons are generally good-natured, though their incredible vanity
    sometimes causes them to seem aloof and cocky. Any perceived insult against
    its appearance is all but assured to send a crystal dragon into a rage-which
    is a problem, as most crystal dragons are prone to seeing insults even where
    none are intended. Crystal dragons prefer underground lairs, and often go
    for decades or even centuries without emerging from their extensive cavern
    lairs onto the surface world above.
  - >-
    Crystal dragons tend to be exacting and even obsessive-compulsive, their
    personalities mirroring the precise and ordered nature of the facets of
    their scales. A crystal dragon's lair is a well-ordered place-these dragons
    find the very idea of the classic sprawl of a dragon's hoard to be shameful.
