SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mutable Polymorph (Su)
    description: >-
      When using spells with the polymorph descriptor, raelises have an uncanny
      amount of control over their target shape. While they still cannot use the
      spells to transform into specific individuals, they can control the skin
      tone, the hair color, the general body shape, and even the gender of the
      creature they transform into, granting them a +20 bonus on Disguise checks
      instead of the usual +10. This is a free action made as part of the
      spellcasting.
  - name: Rune Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Raelises are masters of all magic based on runes or symbols. They
      automatically add explosive runes, glyph of warding, greater glyph of
      warding, sepia snake sigil, and all symbol spells to their list of spells
      known and increase the DC for these spells by 1. Additionally, raelises
      are immune to magical traps and effects that utilize runes or symbols,
      such as sepia snake sigil and explosive runes. Spells A raelis casts
      spells as a 12th-level sorcerer. It has no sorcerer bloodline and does not
      gain any other sorcerer class abilities.
  - name: Stun (Ex)
    description: >-
      A raelis's iron-hard fist delivers a powerful, stunning blow. A creature
      struck by this attack must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be dazed
      for 1 round. If the attack is a critical hit and the target fails its
      save, the creature is instead stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is
      Strength-based.
  - name: Word Caller (Su)
    description: >-
      Raelises automatically sense the presence and basic topic of any books,
      scrolls, or other writings within 50 feet. By spending a standard action,
      they gain a deeper understanding of the text, treating up to 100 pages of
      nonmagical writing as if they had read it, or treating one magical spell
      or scroll as if they had read it and successfully made a successful
      Spellcraft check to understand it.
Description:
  - >-
    Formed from the souls of authors, artists, and storytellers, raelises travel
    to the farthest corners of Golarion and beyond searching for epic stories,
    poems, and simple tall tales. As they travel and quest for ever more obscure
    tales, they strive to make the world a brighter place-setting wrongs right
    or acting as agents for divine beings.
  - >-
    Though raelises appear to be frail, they possess a wiry strength and
    long-fingered hands ideally suited for the brawling and wrestling they enjoy
    so much. Deep brown or gray eyes dominate their expressive faces, and smiles
    and laughter come easy to their lips. Newly formed raelises have fair skin,
    but it slowly darkens over the centuries as they spend long hours exposed to
    the sun and elements. A raelis stands 9 feet tall and weighs close to 1,000
    pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    The lust for new tales and stories drives raelises to the mortal planes more
    often than most of their azata brethren.
  - >-
    Unable to just stand idly by, raelises aid mortals more frequently than do
    other azatas, though they almost always do so disguised as humans or
    sometimes even common or familiar animals. Raelises prefer to avoid physical
    confrontation when dealing with mortals, but don't hesitate to inf luence
    events in other ways. A raelis might travel from town to town spreading
    tales and news to encourage rebellion in a poorly run kingdom, or insinuate
    itself into an invader's army to sow dissension. Often a raelis's inf luence
    isn't felt until it is long gone, as raelises use their powers to bend minds
    in subtle ways to plant the seeds of change.
  - >-
    Essentially gender neuter in their natural form, raelises have an
    androgynous beauty to their lean, sculpted bodies. When altering their
    physical form via alter self or other magical abilities, they can choose to
    take on male or female forms. Younger raelises often have a preferred
    gender, but as they get older, raelises choose their gender based on mood or
    as the task in front of them demands. They occasionally tryst with mortals,
    though their lack of stable gender identity sometimes leads to confusion.
  - >-
    Ironically, bards and storytellers are the mortals least likely to receive
    the aid of a raelis azata. Raelises almost universally believe the best
    mortal works are born of strife and crisis. Shielding a known storyteller
    from the trials of life could very well prevent the greatest epics from
    being written. Exactly how far they are willing to let things go is a matter
    of preference and a frequent topic of debate among their kind. Raelises like
    to compare the trials and suffering of storytellers to the fire and anvil
    that forges a great sword. Raelises do not enjoy this suffering, however,
    and those who deliberately abuse or murder a storyteller while a raelis is
    near discover swift justice after the fact.
  - >-
    Traveling is raelises' second love; they pride themselves on their knowledge
    of obscure back roads and trails. While they all have favored trails,
    raelises consider it a bad omen to make the exact same journey twice and
    they go long distances out of their way to avoid doing so. After eons
    exploring in this manner, the average raelis becomes a living atlas.
  - >-
    Though competent flyers, raelises prefer to walk or even run when they
    travel. Even on the coldest and hottest of days they travel with their feet
    bare. They love the feel of grass or even mud between their long toes, and
    pass time reciting stories they have collected, getting a feel for the flow
    of the verse and the rhythm of the words. Raelises can run for days at a
    time without stopping to rest or even sleep, crossing great distances or
    just scouting all available roads and trails in an area.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Their ability to travel discretely and their familiarity with the cities and
    geography of Golarion make raelises excellent spies and agents for deities
    with similar interests. While they avoid long-lasting alliances, raelises
    have much in common with the Empyreal Lord Sinashakti and often find
    themselves exchanging favors with him. Less frequently, they strike bargains
    with Cayden Cailean or even Desna in exchange for small favors or
    information.
  - >-
    Though many raelises are poets and storytellers, they value the stories
    mortals create. Few raelises worry overmuch about the accuracy of any given
    story-they are more interested in the art of the telling rather than the
    veracity of the tale. Some raelises even prefer the most outlandish tall
    tales and outright fabrications, as long as the exaggeration furthers the
    story.
