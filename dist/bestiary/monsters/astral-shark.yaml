SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Astral Scent (Ex)
    description: >-
      An astral shark is highly attuned to the energy of a traveler in the
      Astral Plane and can detect such creatures in a 180-ft. radius.
  - name: Sever Silver Cord (Ex)
    description: >-
      An astral shark can attack an opponent's silver cord with a normal attack
      that provokes an attack of opportunity. If the astral shark rolls a
      natural 20 (and subsequently confirms the critical hit), the traveler's
      silver cord is severed and its material body and astral form are both
      instantly destroyed.
Description:
  - >-
    An astral shark is a sleek, fish-like creature that spends its entire life
    in the Astral Plane and cannot materialize on any other plane. Among the
    lower life forms of the Astral Plane, the astral shark is near the top of
    the food chain. When extraplanar visitors come to the Astral Plane, however,
    the astral shark attacks them in preference to other prey. It is unknown if
    the astral shark is drawn to the visitors' strange energies, or if it
    somehow gains special nutrition from them or the silver cord that connects
    an astral traveler to its material body.
  - An astral shark is 12 feet long, but can grow to lengths of nearly 30 feet.
  - >-
    An astral shark's tactics resemble those of its Material Plane counterpart:
    circling its prey, then darting in and biting with its powerful jaws. An
    astral shark weakens an opponent and then attacks the opponent's silver
    cord, all the while biting and tearing at its opponent with its teeth.
