SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animal Telepathy (Su)
    description: >-
      A giant owl can telepathically communicate with other animals as if under
      the effects of speak with animals.
  - name: Insightful Senses (Su)
    description: >-
      A giant owl's senses are particularly well honed to sensing danger or
      locating prey. It adds its Wisdom modifier as an insight bonus (+3 for
      most giant owls) on its initiative checks.
  - name: Piercing Stare (Su)
    description: >-
      Up to three times per day as a swift action, a giant owl can gain the
      effects of true seeing (as the spell) for 1 round.
Description:
  - >-
    The noble giant owl roosts in the tallest trees or in high caves near its
    forest home. No mere animals, giant owls pride themselves as intellectuals
    and keen judges of character. Little passes a giant owl's notice in its home
    forest. What it doesn't observe directly, it learns from its wide network of
    animal informants. Giant owls view themselves more as watchers than
    participants, rarely interfering in the affairs of others barring a threat
    to their homes. Giant owls stand 18 feet tall and have 30-foot wingspans,
    yet they rarely weigh over 600 pounds.
