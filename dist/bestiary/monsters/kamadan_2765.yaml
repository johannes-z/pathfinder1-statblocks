Description:
  - >-
    The kamadan is a feline-like predator. It is a fierce predator and highly
    territorial, hunting just about anything that spends too much time in its
    territory. The kamadan has a hunting range of about 5 or more square miles.
    It makes its lair under rocky outcroppings or within caves. The kamadan has
    coarse, yellowish brown fur and a leopard-like body and head. It is about 9
    feet long and weighs about 600 pounds. The kamadan opens combat using its
    breath weapon. It attacks those that resisted using its claws and bite. Each
    snake also bites an opponent. Poisonous Kamadan A variant kamadan, one with
    poisonous snakes, is rumored to exist in the world. Encounters with such
    creatures are rare, for which most adventurers are thankful. The poisonous
    kamadan is CR 6 and uses the same statistics as the normal kamadan, but each
    snake head delivers a poisonous bite. Poison (Ex) Snakes-injury; save Fort
    DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Constitution damage; cure
    2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. Credit The Kamadan
