Description:
  - >-
    An enormous monstrosity that makes its home in the darkest depths of the
    ocean's trenches, the deep sea serpent is as elusive as it is terrifying,
    the nightmare of sailors making their ways over the vast and seemingly
    bottomless waters. A deep sea serpent is rarely seen unless it wishes to be
    seen, and the beast usually has its own mysterious reasons for occasionally
    coming to the surface. At other times, those reasons are gruesomely
    obvious-the deep sea serpent rises to the surface to crush ships and devour
    sailors who tumble from the freshly shattered hulls.
  - >-
    It is thought that in incredibly remote parts of the underwater world, even
    more powerful deep sea serpents exist, beasts with supernatural luminous
    lures that can be used to blind foes, or with the ability to create
    overwhelming blasts of electricity that stun or even outright slay prey with
    a single stroke. Yet perhaps the most unnerving are the rumors of deep sea
    serpents that possess a remarkable intelligence. Such creatures, if they
    even exist, are rarely if ever seen near the surface-both their naturally
    elusive natures and the remote reality of their habitats mean that ensuring
    the veracity of these claims requires truly extraordinary efforts.
  - A typical deep sea serpent measures 50 feet long and weighs 35,000 pounds.
