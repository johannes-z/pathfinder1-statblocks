SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Su)
    description: A blood golem heals 5 hit points each round it drains blood.
  - name: Clotted Skin (Ex)
    description: >-
      A blood golem can congeal its surface into a hard skin as a full-round
      action, allowing it to assume a vaguely humanoid form. With its skin, it
      gains DR 5/bludgeoning, natural armor +6, and speed 30, but loses its
      amorphous and compression abilities. It can liquefy this skin as a
      full-round action, losing its DR and natural armor, changing its speed to
      10 feet, and regaining the amorphous and compression abilities. The golem
      normally maintains its congealed skin, liquefying itself only when it has
      to pass through obstacles that would hinder its solid form.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A blood golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature. • Cure spells affect it as if it were a
      living creature, but only cure the minimum amount of damage. • Spells and
      effects that specifically affect blood (such as boiling bloodAPG) affect
      it normally.
  - name: Vulnerable to Bleed (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bleed effects, blood drain, and attacks that target a creature's blood
      affect a blood golem normally. The golem can spend a full-round action to
      harden its clotted outer shell to end a bleed effect.
Description:
  - >-
    A blood golem is an animate mass of living blood. It can creep about in
    liquid form like an ooze, or create a thick skin made up of coagulated blood
    that allows it to walk upright like a person.
