Description_Visual: >-
  This finely sculpted statue is formed of hardened clay. Its muscular body is
  topped with the head of a feline predator.
Group: Golem
Source: AP 82
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cursed Wound (Ex)
    description: >-
      The damage a panthereon deals doesn't heal naturally and resists magical
      healing. A character attempting to use magical healing on a creature
      damaged by a panthereon must succeed at a DC 26 caster level check, or the
      healing has no effect on the injured creature.
  - name: Eye Beam (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round as a standard action, a panthereon can unleash a beam of
      blinding light at a target within 60 feet as a ranged touch attack. The
      beam deals 2d8 points of fire damage. Any creature struck by this beam
      must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 hour.
  - name: Haste (Su)
    description: >-
      After it has engaged in at least 1 round of combat, a panthereon can gain
      the benefits of haste once per day as a free action. The effect lasts 6
      rounds and is otherwise the same as the spell.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A panthereon is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. • A disintegrate spell
      slows the golem (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d12 points
      of damage (no save). • A soften earth and stone spell cast directly at a
      panthereon reduces its damage reduction to DR 2/ adamantine and
      bludgeoning for 1d4 rounds. • Any magical attack against a panthereon that
      deals electricity damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of
      damage it would normally deal. If the amount of healing would cause the
      golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as
      temporary hit points. A panthereon gets no saving throw against magical
      attacks that deal electricity damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Carefully constructed to serve as tomb guardians and protectors of their
    creators and their treasure, panthereons are a variant of clay golems. The
    majority of these golems were created during the First Age in Osirion,
    though evidence of their existence has turned up beyond the nation's
    borders. A panthereon stands over 8 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. While
    its sculpted form may vary, it is typically muscular and wears no clothing
    save for a simple Osirian skirt.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Osirion's golem makers dispute the notion that the panthereon's design was
    simply the work of some arcane crafter. Instead, many of them believe the
    inspiration for its creation was bestowed by the ancient gods themselves.
    The design for golems has changed little from their initial creation in the
    First Age, and most variations only came along during the end of the Second
    Age.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    As mindless constructs, panthereons have no society or culture of their own.
    Scholars closely associate panthereons with the societal norms of Osirion
    during the period when the creatures were widely used as tomb guardians.
    Many panthereons have abilities tied to their creators, but most of these
    creators have long since perished, leaving the golems to act on their last
    given orders.
  - Construction
  - >-
    A panthereon's body is carved from 1,000 pounds of clay mixed with the
    powdered bones of a purebred Osiriani cat that was either awakened or served
    as a bonded familiar. During the sculpting process the creator may only
    moisten the clay with water sourced from an Osirian desert oasis and must
    add 1,500 gp worth of rare oils and powders.
  - PANTHEREON
  - CL 11th; Price 48,500 gp
  - Construction
  - >-
    Requirements Craft Construct, animate objects, bless, commune, prayer,
    resurrection, searing light, true seeing, creator must be caster level 11th;
    Skill Craft (pottery) or Craft (sculpture) DC 16; Cost 28,500 gp
  - VARIANT PANTHEREONS
  - >-
    While most panthereons possess the statistics presented above, a few of
    Osirion's finest golem makers have developed specialized panthereons, each
    with slightly different enhancements to their abilities. Each one of these
    variants lists the new abilities, as well as any additional construction
    requirements and the additional cost in special materials required to create
    the variant.
  - Esteemed (CR+0)
  - >-
    The ultimate palace guard, an esteemed panthereon can take the form of a
    black house cat (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 131) at will as a standard action.
    This allows the panthereon to guard a location without being seen as an
    obvious sentry. Esteemed panthereons can be commanded to change between
    house cat and guardian forms by their creator, or they can be made to do so
    under set conditions. Though not widely held, the superstitious belief that
    any house cat could be a disguised esteemed panthereon has led some to keep
    cats as a deterrent to thieves and vandals.

    Additional Construction Requirements: beast shape II; Additional Cost:
    21,000 gp.
  - Slaver (CR+0)
  - >-
    The slaver panthereon was initially designed to supervise recalcitrant
    slaves, but it has since proved equally useful when hunting anyone the
    golem's creator wants to have captured alive. Because slaves and prisoners
    are often a very valuable commodity, the slaver panthereon has the ability
    to, as a swift action, convert all of its attacks to nonlethal damage. When
    it does so, its slam attacks also gain the grab special ability. As another
    swift action, it can change its attacks back to dealing normal lethal damage
    (losing the grab ability in the process). Since they are nonintelligent,
    slaver panthereons default to dealing nonlethal damage unless their master
    orders otherwise.
  - >-
    Additional Construction Requirements: Merciful Spell; Additional Cost:
    21,500 gp.
  - Spell Bearer (CR+1)
  - >-
    This panthereon serves its master by augmenting and reinforcing the master's
    spellcasting. Some sages believe the spell bearer panthereon was a precursor
    to the present-day shield guardian golem. A spell bearer panthereon can
    store a single spell of 1st through 6th level, but the golem can't be
    commanded to cast the spell as a shield guardian golem would. Instead,
    should that spell be cast on the golem or its creator (as long as the
    creator is within 60 feet), the spell is immediately countered, as by
    counterspell, requiring no action of the panthereon or its creator. Once
    used, the spell in the panthereon is gone, and a new spell (or the same
    spell) may be placed into it.
  - >-
    In addition, if a spell bearer panthereon's creator casts a spell within 60
    feet of the panthereon, the golem may mirror its creator, and also cast the
    same spell the following round. A spell bearer panthereon can use this
    ability once per day for any spell 3rd-level or lower.
  - >-
    Additional Construction Requirements: Improved Counterspell, mnemonic
    enhancer; Additional Cost: 30,000 gp.
  - TrueHunter (CR+1)
  - >-
    During creation, this panthereon is given the name of an individual it is
    tasked with slaying. The target's identity must be clear and unambiguous.
    Once the ritual is complete and the panthereon is activated, the golem
    receives a +4 bonus on attacks against its named target and deals it an
    extra 2d6 points of damage. This additional damage is not multiplied on a
    critical hit. A true hunter can always detect the presence and location of
    its target so long as the target is within 1 mile.
  - >-
    If the true hunter's target is killed, it becomes a regular panthereon. If
    the target is resurrected or reincarnated, the true hunter instinctively
    becomes aware of this, and regains all of its old abilities. It can't
    pinpoint their direction or presence unless the target is within 1 mile.
