      Any living creature that comes within 30 feet of a jolly jelly must
      succeed on a DC 14 Will save or take 1d2 points of Charisma damage. A new
      save must be made each round the creature remains in the area. A creature
      that takes 6 or more points of Charisma damage from this attack is
      automatically affected as if by a rage spell (CL 6th) with the exception
      that it cannot tell friend from foe. The affected creature remains enraged
      until it moves more than 30 feet away from the jolly jelly. There is no
      save against the rage effect. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.

      Once per day, as a swift action, a jolly jelly can emit a cloud of
      pheromones containing the distilled essence of the positive emotions the
      jelly has consumed. This cloud covers a 20-foot-radius burst around the
      jelly. Living creatures in the cloud must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude
      save or be affected as by a hideous laughter spell (CL 6th) for 2d4
      rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Jolly jellies are psychic vampires which feed on positive emotion. The mere
    presence of a jolly jelly causes living creatures in its vicinity to become
    dour and petulant. Often the victims of a jolly jelly descend into violence
    against one another as all traces of happiness and mirth are drained away by
    the creature. A jolly jelly needs no nourishment other than the emotions it
    drains from its victims. A jolly jelly can go several months between meals
    before the effects of starvation are noticed.
  - >-
    Jolly jellies are mostly active during sunrise and sunset, even underground.
    During daylight hours they are sedentary in their lair which if aboveground
    is usually under fallen trees or hollowed logs. Underground, jolly jellies
    dwell in damp caves and caverns.
  - >-
    Jolly jellies vary in size, but a typical specimen is 5 feet across and
    weighs 100 pounds. A jolly jelly that has recently eaten (usually within the
    last 4 hours) is flushed with a deeper pink hue than one that hasn't.
  - >-
    Unlike most oozes, a jolly jelly has no acid with which it can attack. Its
    only means of physical defense are slams from its multi-colored pseudopods.
    As a last-ditch defense, a jolly jelly can emit a cloud of pheromones
    containing the mirth it has absorbed from its victims. It is this
    laughter-inducing cloud that gave the jolly jelly its name.
