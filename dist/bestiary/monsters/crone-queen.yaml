Description_Visual: >-
  A cold, hateful light burns in the eye sockets of this corpselike creature,
  whose withered skin is stretched over its icy bones. It wears the tattered
  raiments of ancient royalty, and a crown of jagged icicles juts from its head.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blizzard Sight (Su)
    description: >-
      A crone queen can see normally in natural or magical rain, sleet, hail,
      fog, snowstorms, blizzards, and similar weather conditions.
  - name: Cold (Ex)
    description: >-
      A crone queen's body generates intense cold, dealing 1d6 points of cold
      damage with its touch. Creatures attacking a crone queen with unarmed
      strikes or natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one of
      their attacks hits.
  - name: Frozen Heart (Su)
    description: >-
      A crone queen's frozen heart contains a tiny portion of Baba Yaga's life,
      and binds the crone queen to Baba Yaga's will. As a free action, Baba Yaga
      can command a crone queen as dominate monster (CL 20th). If a crone
      queen's frozen heart is somehow removed before the creature is destroyed,
      the crone queen loses its fast healing, spell resistance, and unearthly
      cold ability.
  - name: Hexes (Su)
    description: >-
      A crone queen can use the following hexes as a 20th-level witch: blight,
      frostfootISM, hoarfrostUM, ice tombUM, and misfortune. The save DC is 24
      to negate or resist and is Intelligence-based.
  - name: Ice Staff (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a crone queen can create a magic staff out of
      supernaturally hard ice that functions as a +3 frost quarterstaff and
      allows the crone queen to use her energy drain attack with the staff. The
      ice staff melts away instantly if it leaves the crone queen's hands.
  - name: Unearthly Cold (Su)
    description: >-
      A crone queen's spell-like abilities and supernatural abilities that deal
      cold damage are horrendously cold. Half the cold damage caused by these
      effects comes from an otherworldly power and is not subject to being
      reduced by resistance or immunity to cold-based attacks.
Description:
  - >-
    When one of Baba Yaga's chosen daughters has served her 100-year tenure as
    queen of Irrisen, the Queen of Witches comes to replace her with another
    daughter. Ostensibly, the deposed daughter joins her mother in the Dancing
    Hut and goes on to bigger and better things far beyond the bounds of Irrisen
    and Golarion, but the true fate of the queens of Irrisen remains a mystery
    to most. In fact, these former queens never leave the confines of the
    Dancing Hut-drained of their vitality and power by Baba Yaga and imprisoned
    deep inside the hut's innermost chambers, these daughters become crone
    queens, undead mockeries of the powerful witches they once were.
  - >-
    The crone queens are unique creatures, each one a former queen of Irrisen.
    They are bound to the Hall of Thrones inside the Dancing Hut, where Baba
    Yaga has erected a throne for each deposed queen. Currently there are only
    12 crone queens, though the Hall of Thrones holds 14 royal seats. One throne
    sits ready for the current queen, Elvanna, when her reign is over, and the
    other is left empty-the throne of Tashanna, Baba Yaga's ninth daughter and
    the only queen to escape the fate shared by her sisters.
  - >-
    As a crone queen ages, the long years take their toll on the necromantic
    energies animating the unliving husk of her body, and movement and activity
    become more difficult. Although their powers have not diminished with age,
    the oldest crone queens rarely leave their frozen thrones; less interested
    in vengeance, they instead spend the long centuries reliving the memories of
    their former lives. It takes a significant effort to rouse them from their
    dreamlike reveries, but once awakened, the eldest crone queens are dangerous
    foes indeed.
  - The Deposed Queens
  - >-
    Twelve of Baba Yaga's daughters sit enthroned inside the Dancing Hut,
    fueling their mother's extended lifespan. Besides the abilities presented in
    the stat block above, each crone queen possesses additional unique
    abilities. Over the centuries, the first eight queens of Irrisen- Jadwiga,
    Morgannan, Urvalane, Pjallarane, Aelena, Harcatha, Sascha, and Karina-have
    gradually withdrawn into themselves, and now rarely move or interact with
    the world at all, but in general, the older the crone queen, the more
    powerful her unique abilities are. If any of these crone queens are awoken
    from their torpor, they should receive additional abilities in line with
    their age.
  - >-
    The four most recent queens remain active, full of hatred and a thirst for
    vengeance. Their unique abilities are detailed below.
  - >-
    Betyrina: The twelfth queen of Irrisen, Betyrina, was known for her vanity
    and conceit. It is said that, during her reign, no room in Whitethrone's
    Royal Palace was without a mirror, so the queen could enjoy a constant view
    of her own ref lection. Next to Yelizaveta, Betyrina is perhaps the
    best-preserved crone queen, and though she is still clearly an undead
    creature, she takes great pains to keep her hair carefully coiffed and her
    200-year-old gown as clean and tidy as possible. Betyrina can cast
    strangling hair (Ultimate Magic 240) as a spell-like ability three times per
    day, and smug narcissism (Ultimate Magic 238) as a spell-like ability once
    per day.
  - >-
    Kseniya: A skilled conjurer herself, Irrisen's eleventh queen, Kseniya,
    founded an academy for conjurers and summoners known as the Bloodstone
    Conservatory. Kseniya was also famous for trying to take her own life when
    Baba Yaga came for her at the end of her reign. She was unsuccessful, and
    the scars of her attempted suicide are still visible on her shrunken wrists.
    Kseniya can cast control summoned creature (Ultimate Magic 212) and terrible
    remorse (Ultimate Magic 243) as spell-like abilities three times per day.
  - >-
    Velikas: The reign of Velikas, tenth queen of Irrisen, was marked by a
    lethal epidemic of chillbane fever that swept across the land and devastated
    the population of the city of Algidheart.
  - >-
    Velikas is still a carrier of this original potent strain of chillbane fever
    and can cast epidemic (Ultimate Magic 218) as a spell-like ability once per
    day, infecting the target with virulent chillbane fever.
  - >-
    Virulent chillbane fever-inhaled or injury; save Fortitude DC 23; onset 1
    day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Con damage and target is shaken and
    fatigued, target must make a second Fortitude save or 1 point of the damage
    is drain instead and target is exhausted instead of fatigued; cure 2
    consecutive saves.
  - >-
    Yelizaveta: Irrisen's thirteenth queen, Yelizaveta is the most recently
    deposed and best preserved of the crone queens, having died only 100 years
    ago, and her hatred and spite toward her mother is still fresh. Yelizaveta
    can cast vengeful outrage (Ultimate Magic 246) as a spell-like ability once
    per day.
