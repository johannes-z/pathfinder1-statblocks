SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gaseous (Ex)
    description: >-
      A demonic mist can pass through small holes, even cracks, without reducing
      its speed. It cannot enter water or other liquid. It has no Strength
      score, and cannot manipulate objects.
  - name: Psychic Crush (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, as a standard action, a demonic mist can attempt to
      crush the mind of a single creature within 40 feet. The target must make a
      DC 15 Will save or take 3d6 points of damage and become sickened for 1d4+1
      rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Vulnerability to Wind (Ex)
    description: >-
      A demonic mist is treated as a Tiny creature for the purposes of
      determining the effects high wind has upon it.
Description:
  - >-
    Some scholars and sages believe a demonic mist is the incomplete
    manifestation of a demon on the Material Plane. Others conjecture it is a
    representation of chaos unleashed by the denizens of the Abyss. Whatever the
    true nature of its origin, a demonic mist is a creature wholly chaotic and
    evil. When encountered on the Material Plane it is most often in areas of
    consecrated ground such as graveyards, temples, and holy sites. In their
    native environment, demonic mists are found haunting the most putrid and
    disgusting of the Abyssal planes. Those planes covered with oozes, mires,
    fens, and swamps are favored by these creatures. Demonic mists have
    voracious appetites and always seem to be on the hunt. They are carnivorous
    creatures devouring just about anything they came across. Once a demonic
    mist slays its prey, it moves over the body and rapidly digests it, draining
    blood and body fluids, and leaving nothing more than a dried husk.
  - >-
    A demonic mist's semi-solid body is composed of a strange, sickly green and
    ever-shifting mist. It can change its color to a semi-translucent whitish
    smoke, thereby blending in and hiding in areas of normal fog and mist. When
    hiding in this way, a demonic mist seeks to quickly close ground with its
    target and attack from ambush, unleashing its psychic crush and enervating
    attacks at the closest and strongest opponents.
  - >-
    Demonic mists are often found in the employ of clerics dedicated to the
    demonic lords (particularly Tsathogga and Jubilex), serving as temple guards
    or assassins.
