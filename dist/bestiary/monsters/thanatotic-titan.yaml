Description:
  - >-
    Some believe that the titans were the first children of the gods-if this
    myth is true, then the fact that they waged war upon the gods becomes even
    more tragic. After they were betrayed to the gods by their own kin, the
    Thanatotic titans were banished into the Abyss. Today, they seethe with
    jealousy that their Elysian kin are allowed to wander the planes at will,
    while they can leave their Abyssal realm only by stealth. Now, these
    powerful outsiders spend much of their time brooding, fighting among
    themselves, and waging war for control of Abyssal realms against the legions
    of various demon lords.
  - >-
    Thanatotic titans see themselves as the true icons worthy of worship. Some
    work to found personal cults among mortals, while others simply wage
    unending crusades against the minions of the gods.
