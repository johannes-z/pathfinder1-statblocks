SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Air Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against a
      djinni. The djinn (singular djinni) are genies from the Plane of Air. They
      are said to be made of the stuff of clouds, with the strength of the
      mightiest storms. A djinni is about 10 feet tall and weighs about 1,000
      pounds.
Description:
  - >-
    Djinn disdain physical combat, preferring to use their magical powers and
    aerial abilities against foes. A djinni overmatched in combat usually takes
    flight and becomes a whirlwind to harass those who follow. When faced with
    Gelatinous C Gelatinous Cube-Genie, Djinni no other option than melee
    combat, most djinn prefer to wield masterwork scimitars two-handed. Among
    other genies, djinn get along well with jann and marids. They are frequently
    at odds with the shaitans, and are sworn enemies of the efreet, despising
    these fiery genies more than any other genie race. So legendary is the conf
    lict between the efreet and the djinn that many spellcasters attempt (to
    varying degrees of success) to secure a djinni's servitude by promising to
    aid the cause against their hated enemies. A small percentage of djinn are
    noble. Noble djinn, often called viziers, have 10 Hit Dice, Strength 23, and
    Charisma 17, and can grant three wishes to any being (nongenies only) who
    captures them. Djinn nobles are CR 8.
