Description_Visual: >-
  This creature appears as a huge, crablike mechanical monstrosity. It has a
  saucer-shaped main hull with four spindly legs that sprout from its underbelly
  and allow it to move with surprising speed and agility. Two iron-shod fists
  are mounted on the front of its hull.

  - >-
    Quite often, the brain gear attempts to deploy its titans behind a line of
    clockwork warriors, allowing the titans to rain blows upon enemies without
    fear of any counterattack.
