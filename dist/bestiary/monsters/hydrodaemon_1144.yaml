  - name: Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hydrodaemon can launch itself into the air and glide along for 1 minute,

  - name: Sleep Spittle (Su)
    description: >-
      A hydrodaemon can spit at a single target within 20 feet, making a ranged
      touch attack as a standard action. A target hit by this spittle must
      succeed on a DC 19 Will save or fall asleep for 6 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    While at first glance these creatures seem like enormous and foul boggards,
    their dangerous gait, dead eyes, and wicked claws give away their fiendish
    nature. In their home environment, hydrodaemons swim the sickening rivers
    and seas of Abaddon and the River Styx, ducking beneath the rivers of pus
    and bile only to leap out at enemies and rend their flesh with tooth and
    claw. It is said these are among the few creatures able to survive in the
    deadly waters of the River Styx. When called to the Material Plane,
    hydrodaemons serve powerful spellcasters, protecting domains dotted with
    pools, streams, and even sewer complexes. Associated with death by drowning,
    these fiends use a favored tactic to draw the most anguish from their
    victims. Hydrodaemons first attack with their inky black sleep spittle,
    hoping to render victims unconscious. With their opponents unable to fight
    back, hydrodaemons drag their enemies into the foul waters they call home
    and delight as the liquid fills their victims' gasping lungs. If unable to
    drown a victim, they finish the job with jaws and claws.
  - >-
    Hydrodaemons possess an awkward gait, springing back on their heels and
    leaping about like humanoid frogs. Even so, they move in an unpredictable
    manner, twisting their bodies with each hopping movement. Hydrodaemons can
    also unfurl flaps of skin that allow them to glide through the air.
    Hydrodaemons stand 10 feet tall and weigh upward of 3,000 pounds.
