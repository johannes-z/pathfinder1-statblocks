SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      If a quickwood is targeted by a spell (excluding area spells) and it makes
      its save against the spell's effects, it takes no damage and absorbs some
      of the spell's energy and releases it as a fear effect (as a free action)
      in a 10-foot radius per level of the spell. Affected creatures must
      succeed on a DC 20 Will save or be affected as by a fear spell (caster
      level 11th). The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.
  - name: Grasping Roots (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a quickwood hits with a root attack, it can attempt to start a grapple
      as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins
      the grapple check, it establishes a hold and drags the foe 30 feet closer
      each subsequent round (provoking no attack of opportunity). A quickwood
      can draw in a creature within 15 feet of itself and bite with a +4 attack
      bonus in the same round. A root has hardness 2 and 10 hit points and can
      be attacked by making a successful sunder attempt. However, attacking a
      quickwood's root does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the root is
      currently grappling a target, the quickwood takes a -4 penalty on its CMD
      to resist the sunder attempt. Severing a root deals no damage to a
      quickwood.
  - name: Immunity to Fire (Ex)
    description: >-
      A quickwood can perspire as a free action; this grants it immunity to fire
      for one hour. Afterwards, it must wait one minute before using this
      ability again.
  - name: Remote Sensing (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a quickwood can use a normal oak tree within 360
      feet as a magical sensor to view its surroundings. This ability is similar
      to a clairaudience/clairvoyance spell and allows a quickwood to see
      (including with darkvision) and hear through a sensor. A quickwood does
      not need line of sight to establish a sensor. A quickwood can establish a
      new magical sensor in another tree within range as a free action, though
      it can never have more sensors at one time than its Hit Dice. A quickwood
      with multiple sensors can switch between them as a free action. An oak
      tree utilized as a magical sensor takes on a human-like visage (similar to
      a quickwood). A successful DC 20 Perception check allows a character to
      notice the tree's visage.
Description:
  - >-
    Quickwoods appear as nothing more than common oak trees and are
    indistinguishable from them at distances greater than 30 feet. Closer
    inspection (at a distance of 10 feet or less) reveals a human-like visage
    embedded in the trunk. They are carnivores and prefer the taste of human or
    elven flesh above all others.
  - >-
    A quickwood's body is brown and textured like bark, and many strong, rigid
    branches protrude from its trunk. Each branch has many smaller branches that
    sport leaves of a deep, rich green color. Quickwoods usually root themselves
    to a particular location and rarely move. When they do move, they pull
    themselves slowly along with their roots.
  - A typical quickwood stands 16 feet tall.
  - >-
    Quickwoods use their remote sensing ability to keep tabs on their
    surroundings. If trespassers are detected, the creature simply waits until
    one or more come within range of its roots before lashing out and striking.
  - A grabbed opponent is pulled in close to the creature's maw and bitten.
  - >-
    A typical quickwood (11 HD) has 9 roots it uses to grab foes. For every 2 HD
    above 11, a quickwood has one additional root it can use in combat (thus, a
    13 HD quickwood has 10 roots and a 15 HD quickwood has 11 roots).
