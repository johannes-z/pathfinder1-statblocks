Description_Visual: >-
  This gigantic beast stands at least 40 feet tall. It is a squat, bloated mass
  of grayish, leathery flesh, somewhat oval in shape with six long, serpentine
  tentacles protruding from its form. A massive gaping maw dominates its top
  surface extending around its entire top half. Hundreds of smaller tentacles
  adorn the lower part of its body, apparently aiding in locomotion.

Description:
  - >-
    Abyssal harvesters are horrid monsters found primarily on the Abyssal planes
    and rarely anywhere else (for an extended amount of time at least). They
    were created by foul and demonic magic to aid in harvesting bodies and
    living creatures from other planes for use by the various demon lords and
    princes (uses include slaves, food, concubines, and so on).
  - >-
    An abyssal harvester spends most of its time scouring the planes for
    potential prey. It does so by injecting a single tentacle into the plane and
    using it to survey its surroundings. If nothing of interest is located, the
    harvester withdraws its tentacle and moves on. Much of its time is spent
    scouring the planes as directed by a demon prince, lord, or other powerful
    demon (though abyssal harvesters loathe answering to non-princes and rarely
    do so unless said demon poses a direct threat to the harvester's existence).
    When not under the direct orders of a prince or demon, any creature a
    harvester harvests becomes a meal for itself.
  - >-
    A typical abyssal harvester is 40 feet tall, 20 feet wide at its base, and
    weighs around 40 tons. Its flesh is gray and usually carries a stench of
    ozone.
  - >-
    Abyssal harvesters are deadly opponents in battle and have no reservations
    about engaging an enemy in combat. The creature is smart enough to know when
    it is beaten however and will withdraw (using its plane shift ability) if
    combat is going against it.
  - >-
    Most of the time however, an abyssal harvester simply injects its tentacles
    into a plane, grapples its foes, and when they are sufficiently weakened,
    draws them through a temporary gate onto its plane where it devours them.
  - >-
    Foes can attack an abyssal harvester's tentacles. A tentacle has AC 21 (+11
    natural), touch 10, flat-footed 21, and can withstand 30 points of damage.
    Damaging or severing a tentacle does not harm the abyssal harvester (damage
    dealt to a tentacle is not subtracted from its hit points).
  - >-
    An abyssal harvester's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields,
    are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of
    overcoming damage reduction.
