Description:
  - >-
    Dwarf caimans are a small species of crocodilian predators that live
    primarily amid the fast-running streams of tropical rainforests and nearby
    coastal waters. While hunting birds, lizards, fish, and other small prey,
    these patient predators sometimes lie in awkward positions for hours before
    they strike, their mottled scales making them appear to be nothing more than
    floating wood.
