SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ember Storm (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day a smoke mephit can create a downpour of white-hot embers that
      affects a 20- foot radius. Living creatures caught in the storm take 2d6
      points of fire damage (Reflex DC 14 half, caster level 6th). This ability
      is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Fast Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A smoke mephit heals only if it is exposed to smoke or soot (whether
      magically created or mundane in nature).
  - name: Sooty Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Living creatures that fail their saves against the smoke mephit's breath
      weapon are tormented by burning eyes. This effect imposes a -4 penalty to
      AC and a -2 penalty on attack rolls for 3 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Smoke mephits are generally only encountered on the Plane of Molten Skies,
    though it is believed they originate from a plane or para-plane comprised
    entirely of smoke. They are generally lazy, but quick to anger.
  - >-
    When encountered on the material planes it is usually because they have been
    summoned or called by a spellcaster to perform some task or chore.
  - >-
    On such planes, smoke mephits generally prefer warmer climates and are never
    found in cold areas (unless specifically called by a spellcaster).
  - >-
    Smoke mephits enjoy combat and rush headlong into it, slashing with their
    claws. If a smoke mephit can draw its opponents to within 20 feet of its
    position, it uses its spell-like abilities to create an ember storm.
  - >-
    A smoke mephit's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A smoke mephit stands about 4 feet
    tall and weighs about 2 pounds.
