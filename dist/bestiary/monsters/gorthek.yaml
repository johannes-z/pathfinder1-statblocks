Description:
  - >-
    The gorthek is, without a doubt, one of the crankiest beasts found roaming
    in the wilderness. Appearing as a strange combination of primeval bison and
    ornery rhinoceros, but with a leonine head crowned with ramlike horns, a
    gorthek is both immensely powerful and preternaturally hard to injure. Its
    thick, battering-ram head and powerful body make it a fearsome opponent,
    particularly when it's riled up and in full charge.
  - >-
    Gortheks tend to travel in small herds, grazing across remote temperate
    grasslands or sparsely wooded hills. When a gorthek perceives a threat-which
    to the gorthek includes just about everything, often even other gortheks-it
    launches itself into a full charge, intent on sending the enemy flying.
  - >-
    Orc tribes have made a practice of raising the beasts from infancy to serve
    as living siege engines during warfare. Future gorthek riders bond with the
    creatures from a very young age, and if possible use gorthek masks to make
    that bond stronger. When riding into battle, one orc sits astride the
    gorthek in a specially crafted saddle secured behind its massive horns and
    guides the beast using spiked reins.
  - >-
    An adult male gorthek stands about 7 feet high at the shoulder and weighs
    around 9,000 pounds.

    An orc who takes the Beast Rider feat (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide
    56) can choose a gorthek as an animal companion or mount.
