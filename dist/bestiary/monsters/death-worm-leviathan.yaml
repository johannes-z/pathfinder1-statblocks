Description:
  - >-
    Sometimes a pregnant death worm lays an especially promising egg among her
    brood, about twice as large as the others and with a nigh-impenetrable,
    brown-speckled shell. This egg requires even more warmth than the others in
    its clutch, and upon emerging the worm would rather devour its brethren than
    the meal left by its parent. Such rare specimens grow up to become death
    worm leviathans, and those few who have heard of the fell beasts know to
    fear them as well as to hold them in awe. Death worm leviathans possess
    powers nearly identical to those of their smaller kin, albeit at a much
    deadlier scale. In addition, their massive girth makes it even easier for
    them to consume prey both large and small, and a single leviathan might
    consume an entire desert village before its terrible hunger is sated.
