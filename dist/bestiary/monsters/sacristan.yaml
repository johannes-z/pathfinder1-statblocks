Description:
  - >-
    Every kyton considers itself some manner of artiste, working and reworking
    its avant-garde visions in various mediums-f lesh, minds, darkness, and
    others both natural and fragile. But for every masterpiece, there are
    countless failures. Sacristans number among the most useful failures of the
    kyton race. Born from scraps of imperfect flesh, bent chain, and scarred
    minds, sacristans are bound together by kyton sculptor-surgeons. They lack
    the burden of free will, and their minds are etched with the ability to
    serve, making them utterly obedient to other kytons. While much more than
    automatons, sacristans are a potent slave caste, one manufactured to take
    ecstatic pleasure from serving their brethren. Their other blessing is a
    miniature, permanent portal to the Shadow Plane sealed within their mouths.
    Kept restrained, this portal endlessly howls the music of the kytons' realms
    of shadowed torture and veiled delights. When threatened, sacristans burst
    open their mouths and allow the song of their collective race to seduce
    their foes in a way these brutes never could. Sacristans vary in their
    appearance, but always look like tortured and maimed humanoids, often with
    redundant or absent features. They typically stand between 6 and 8 feet tall
    and weigh from 80 to 160 pounds.
