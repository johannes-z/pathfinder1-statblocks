Description:
  - >-
    South of Jalmeray, deep in the Yogisa Trench in the middle of the Obari
    Ocean, the terrifying gutaki known as Ugash-Iram lords over the underwater
    city of Achom. Ugash-Iram and its lesser kin practice foul rites and perform
    horrible rituals to honor their patron deity, Dagon, amid the city's strange
    and twisted spires, which rise out of a dark fissure in the seabed like
    claws climbing toward the surface. Crackling eruptions of magical energy
    brief ly illuminate the city in flashes of light, but it is otherwise as
    dark and lightless as the souls of its foul inhabitants.
  - >-
    Because of its isolation in the deepest waters of the Obari Ocean, few
    surface-dwellers know of Ugash- Iram's existence, though those fisherfolk
    and sailors who've heard tales of the mighty being know to fear it. Locathah
    sages place the indomitable gutaki's age at over 3,000 years old, and
    dwellers in the underwater regions surrounding Achom have long loathed and
    feared Ugash-Iram, whose legions of devotees have spelled the ruin of
    countless aquatic cities. Ugash-Iram itself is responsible for destroying a
    dozen massive underwater cities in the past millennium, and the scattered
    ruins that lie around the Yogisa Trench serve as testament to its power.
  - >-
    Those aquatic creatures Ugash-Iram doesn't outright annihilate are captured
    and integrated into Achom either as members of the slave caste or as
    converted devotees to Dagon. Entire tribes of sahuagin, adaros, and
    iku-tursos have united under the banner of Ugash-Iram and its gutaki kin in
    Achom, and the underwater metropolis bulges at the borders with the
    thousands of evil inhabitants who make their home there. These inhabitants
    raid for Ugash-Iram and populate its city, protecting Achom and performing
    all kinds of menial tasks for their overlord. With these minions,
    Ugash-Iram's deadly reach extends all the way to the surface of the Obari
    Ocean and even the nearby shores of Geb, Jalmeray, and Qadira.
  - >-
    Isolated in its flooded metropolis beneath the sea, Ugash-Iram has plenty of
    resources, a generous life span, and thousands of minions at its disposal,
    making it a formidable foe for any who would seek to stop the despotic
    gutaki before its inf luence spreads even further.
  - Infamous Deeds
  - >-
    The legends of Ugash-Iram remain shrouded in mystery, since few aquatic
    humanoids have seen the monster, and fewer still have lived to tell the
    tale. Some claim that the gutaki gained its power by devouring other gutaki,
    gaining greater power and its array of 12 tentacles.
  - >-
    One especially strange tale claims Ugash-Iram once captured a great kraken
    and imprisoned it deep in the gaping Yogisa Trench. Ugash-Iram is said to
    keep the behemoth perpetually on the brink of death-the gutaki and its
    minions carefully torture the kraken and subject it to grotesque experiments
    and disfiguring transformations. Just as gutaki were supposedly born when
    Dagon defeated the great kraken Kaktora, Ugash-Iram hopes that by subjecting
    its captured kraken to cruel experiments, it can create its own race of
    12-tentacled followers.
  - >-
    While ships crossing the middle of the Obari Ocean face all manner of risks,
    perhaps the worst is capture by Ugash-Iram's minions. Records tell of a
    combined effort by Ugash-Iram's adaro and sahuagin soldiers to capture a
    diplomatic fleet from Vudra some years ago. A dozen lucky sailors perished
    during the raid; the aquatic horrors captured everyone else, smearing them
    with a magical jelly that allowed them to breathe underwater and dragging
    them to Achom for torture, experimentation, and eventual sacrifice to their
    lord Dagon.
  - Adventure Hooks
  - >-
    Tracking Ugash-Iram down is not a task for the faint of heart, and those who
    do manage to find the vile underwater metropolis of Achom would do well to
    stay away. Despite the danger, adventurers might find any number of reasons
    to explore the foul settlement and face its cruel inhabitants.
  - >-
    • A tribe of adaro aligned with Ugash-Iram of Achom threatens Vudrani
    vessels bound for Jalmeray. At risk of losing their precious cargo,
    merchants send word to ports along the Obari Ocean's shores, searching for a
    group to deal with the adaro threat and determine their true motives.
  - >-
    • Tired of living in fear of Ugash-Iram, locathah, merfolk, cecaelias, and
    other non-evil aquatic creatures recently formed a congress to address the
    gutaki's tyranny. Legends tell of a magical device of unknown origin lost
    within the Obari Ocean south of Stonespire Island. Thought to be capable of
    blocking out mental domination-among other powers-this device would prove a
    great weapon in the fight against Ugash-Iram and the other denizens of
    Achom. The aquatic council has put out a great bounty for retrieval of the
    item.
