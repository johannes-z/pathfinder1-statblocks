SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Smashing Breach (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a great white whale can make a special charge
      attack against creatures on the surface of the water. At the end of its
      charge, the whale breaches, then slams down onto the target with
      incredible force. Any Huge or smaller creatures in the whale's space must
      make a DC 27 Reflex save or take 4d8+30 points of bludgeoning damage and
      be forced into the nearest square that is adjacent to the whale. This
      breach automatically attempts to capsize any boats caught wholly or
      partially in this area. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Legendary in size and temper, great white whales are far more aggressive
    than their smaller kin.
