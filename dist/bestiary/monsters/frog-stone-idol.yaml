SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Crush (Ex)
    description: >-
      A frog stone idol can land on foes as a standard action, using its whole
      body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents one
      or more size categories smaller than the frog stone idol. A crush attack
      affects as many creatures as fit in the stone idol's space. Creatures in
      the affected area must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save or be pinned,
      automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the
      stone idol moves off them. If the stone idol chooses to maintain the pin,
      it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take
      damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. The save DC is
      Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
  - name: Powerful Leaper (Ex)
    description: >-
      A frog stone idol uses its Strength to modify Acrobatics checks made to
      jump, and it has a +8 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone idol is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. A transmute rock to mud
      spell slows a stone idol (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no
      saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost hit
      points. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the stone idol's
      structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1
      full round. A disintegrate spell deals +50% damage to a stone idol. A
      chaos hammer, holy smite, order's wrath, or unholy blight spell deals 1d4
      points of damage per two caster levels to a stone idol if the creator's
      alignment matches one of the aforementioned spells.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      Unless a stone idol's main body is shattered into small fragments and
      scattered to the winds, the creature reforms itself at full strength in
      1d4+2 days.
  - name: Site Bound (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stone idol cannot travel more than 200 feet from a central point
      designated by its creator. Once this point is selected, it can never be
      changed. A stone idol taken outside the area ceases functioning until it
      is brought back into the area.
Description:
  - >-
    A stone idol frog is about 10 feet long and weighs 10,000 pounds. It leaps
    at its foes attempting to crush as many as it can before resorting to its
    powerful bite attack.
  - Variant Frog Stone Idol

    variant is detailed below.

  - >-
    Vile Croak (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a Tsathogga idol
    can unleash a croak that affects all that hear it within 60 feet. Affected
    creatures take 5d6 points of negative energy damage. A DC 16 Will save
    reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a
    +2 racial bonus.
