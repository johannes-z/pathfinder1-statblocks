SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison Use (Ex)
    description: >-
      Buckawns never risk accidentally poisoning themselves when applying poison
      to a blade. They favor moonseed berries as poison and usually have a
      plentiful supply readily available. These small berries are bluish-purple
      and resemble wild grapes. They are highly poisonous and are often mixed
      with food or crushed and smeared on a weapon or object. Moonseed Berries:
      poison-contact or ingested; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 4
      rounds; effect 1d2 Con; cure 1 save; Price 1,500 gp.
Description:
  - >-
    Buckawns are somehow related to brownies, but they are nowhere near as
    kind-hearted and playful. Buckawns are extremely reclusive and rarely have
    dealings with outside races. Trade of any kind between a buckawn tribe and
    another race is virtually unheard of.
  - >-
    Characters who journey into a buckawn's realm are usually left alone,
    providing they themselves leave the buckawn's realm alone. Trespassers,
    evil-doers, and those that disturb the natural beauty of a buckawn domain
    are dealt with quickly-and permanently if necessary.
  - A buckawn stands about 2 feet tall and weighs about 30 pounds.
  - >-
    Buckawns favor daggers and darts in combat. They readily use poisoned blades
    when confronted with a tough opponent, when outnumbered, or when battling
    opponents for whom they have great disdain.
