  This tall, slender plant has a large flowering bulb topping its brownish-green
  roots. Two large green leaves flank its flowering top, giving the appearance
  of a cobra's hood. Its leaves are thin and have transparent blotches on them.

Description:
  - >-
    Cobra flowers draw nutrients from sunlight, the soil, and water, but enjoy a
    diet of insects, rodents, animals, and even humanoids when available. The
    creatures can be found nesting in forests and often take up residence near
    small population areas where they can feed on humanoids who wander into
    their area. Many a child's or adult's disappearance can be attributed to a
    cobra flower.
  - >-
    When a cobra flower detects a living creature, it remains motionless until
    its prey is within 5 feet. It then spreads its leafy hood, opens its flowery
    bulb, and bites its prey, secreting acidic enzymes to break down and digest
    the victim.
