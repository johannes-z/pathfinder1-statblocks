Description:
  - >-
    The stench kow is the cattle of the lower planes. Found mainly in the Hells,
    stench kows are a race of bison-like creatures, not unlike the normal cattle
    found on the Material Plane. They are used as food by the denizens of the
    lower planes and are often found in large herds wandering the wastelands of
    the nether regions. Stench kows attack only if threatened, if the herd is
    threatened, or if the young calves are in danger. A stench kow attacks by
    charging and trampling, or butting its opponents with its horns.
  - >-
    A typical stench kow is 8 feet long and weighs about 3,000 pounds. Its fur
    is orange or brown in color and mottled green throughout.
