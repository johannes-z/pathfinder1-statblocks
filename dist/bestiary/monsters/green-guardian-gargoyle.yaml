    description: >-
      The eyes of a green guardian gargoyle are made of two pieces of jet (500
      gp each) that detect as both magic (faint conjuration) and evil. After
      being destroyed, a green guardian automatically reanimates in 1d8+2 days
      unless the eye gems are crushed and disenchanted with both dispel magic
      (DC 15) and remove curse.
