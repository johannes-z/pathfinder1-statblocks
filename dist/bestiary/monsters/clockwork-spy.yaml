SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Record Audio (Su)
    description: >-
      A clockwork spy can record nearby sounds as a swift action, archiving all
      sound within a 20-foot spread onto a small gemstone worth 50 gp embedded
      in its body. The clockwork spy can record up to 1 hour of sound per Hit
      Die it possesses. Starting and stopping playback of recorded sound is a
      swift action. Removing a gemstone or installing a gemstone into a
      clockwork spy requires a DC 25 Disable Device check as a full-round
      action-failure does not damage the gemstone but does erase any recorded
      sounds on the gemstone. Since clockwork spies are not intelligent, they
      must be given simple commands as to when they are to start recording
      sounds. A clockwork spy can differentiate between creature types and
      subtypes, but not between specific individuals-a spy can be ordered to
      start recording sound as soon as a humanoid (human) or an aberration comes
      in range, but it cannot be ordered to start recording when a specific
      person comes within range. Once a clockwork spy begins recording sound, it
      cannot cease recording early. Likewise, it cannot record sound onto a
      gemstone that already contains a recording. Self-Destruct (Su) Unless
      specifically programmed otherwise by its creator, a clockwork spy explodes
      1 round after it is destroyed. During this round, the thing shrieks and
      thrashes about as if undergoing convulsions. On what would normally have
      been the clockwork spy's next action, it explodes, dealing 1d6 points of
      fire damage in a 5-foot radius (Reflex DC 10 half ). A DC 20 Disable
      Device check made as a standard action can halt the spy's self-destruct
      sequence, but does not prevent it from dying. A clockwork spy that
      self-destructs automatically destroys its gemstone, along with any
      information contained inside it. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    These spindly and discreet mechanical arachnids are ideal for surveillance
    and reconnaissance missions, and can be vital tools in political intrigues
    or illicit consortium tactics. Their retractable, insectile wings make the
    swift creatures even craftier foes than most would anticipate. As they are
    less combat-oriented than many other clockworks, if a clockwork spy is
    caught in the act of recording its target, escape is usually the most
    practical course of action for it.
  - >-
    Clockwork spies are about 2 feet wide from leg to leg, and weigh less than
    40 pounds.
  - Construction
  - >-
    These delicate constructs are full of small parts and difficult to
    construct. The creator must start with crafted clockwork pieces worth 250
    gp.
