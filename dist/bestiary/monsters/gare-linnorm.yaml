Description_Visual: >-
  An enormous draconic head rises up atop a massive serpentine neck wider than a
  galleon's mainmast. Seemingly endless coils break the water's surface around
  it, only hinting at the monster's terrifying size, as it opens its
  steam-shrouded maw with a hiss.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a gare linnorm can breathe a
      60-foot cone of scalding steam, dealing 17d8 points of fire damage to all
      creatures struck (Reflex DC 25 halves). This steam then hangs in the air
      for 1 round after the linnorm creates it. Creatures in the area of effect
      or that enter the area take an additional 6d6 points of fire damage the
      second round (Reflex DC 25 negates). In addition, the cloud of steam acts
      as the spell solid fog, with a caster level equal to the linnorm's HD. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Death Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      When a creature slays a gare linnorm, the slayer is affected by the curse
      of the drowning gasp. Curse of the Drowning Gasp: save Will DC 22; effect
      anytime the creature imbibes a liquid of any kind, its lungs fill with
      water and it begins to drown. Treat this as the spell suffocation* (DC 19
      Fort save to resist), with a caster level equal to the linnorm's Hit Dice.
      The save DC for the curse is Charisma-based. * See page 248 of the
      Advanced Player's Guide.
  - name: Freedom of Movement (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gare linnorm is under the constant effect of freedom of movement, as the
      spell of the same name. This effect cannot be dispelled.
  - name: Poison (Su)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 3d6
      fire damage and 1d6 Dex drain; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: True Seeing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gare linnorm has true seeing, as the spell of the same name. This effect
      cannot be dispelled.
Description:
  - >-
    So named for a northern word for "river," a gare linnorm's body resembles
    that of a gigantic serpent, save for two muscular forelimbs. The creature's
    head is long and angular, with crests that it uses to break through ice in
    its never-ending search for food. A gare linnorm's hide is a dull gray color
    akin to tarnished silver, with a slightly paler underbelly. Unlike many
    linnorms, a gare linnorm has a smooth hide, allowing it to slip easily
    through water and ice holes.
  - >-
    A gare linnorm can grow as long as 60 feet, typically weighs 11,000 pounds,
    and can live for over 1,000 years.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Little can compare to the power and efficiency of a gare linnorm in the
    regions where these beasts dwell. Like all linnorms, gare linnorms are
    relatively unintelligent compared with their chromatic and metallic cousins,
    but what these beasts lack in intelligence and spellcasting ability they
    make up for in brute strength, savage fury, and dangerous cunning. Despite
    dwelling in water, gare linnorms have an innate ability to raise their body
    temperature so dramatically that the creatures are immune to even the
    hottest flames. Gare linnorms use this ability to keep warm when hunting
    through rivers and waterways buried beneath feet of ice, which the creature
    can come bursting through with surprising speed and force when it detects
    prey above. A gare linnorm's breath weapon is similarly linked to this
    internal fire. Small gill-like vents along the creature's serpentine body
    pass water through the dragon, which is heated to extreme temperatures en
    route to the linnorm's mouth. The gare linnorm then expels the water through
    a series of muscular chambers that turn the water into a gout of steam hot
    enough to scald flesh and warp armor. The difference in temperature between
    the inside of the linnorm's mouth and the cold air of its homelands causes
    the steam to condense into a massive cloud of vapor that persists afterward
    and, because of the linnorm's magical nature, achieves an almost solid
    state, hampering movement throughout its area.
  - >-
    In addition to its deadly breath weapon, a gare linnorm's fangs are infused
    with potent venom. A creature bitten by the dragon is bathed in an eerie
    blue-white aura that burns like the hottest alchemist's fire. Meanwhile the
    poison attacks the nervous system with debilitating pain, gradually slowing
    the target's ref lexes and motor functions until total paralysis sets in.
  - >-
    Gare linnorms prefer to hunt large prey, as fish and other small underwater
    creatures don't provide enough food to sate their enormous appetites. As a
    result, gare linnorms hunt not just larger, land-bound creatures like elk or
    moose, but even large predatory animals like brown bears and dire wolves
    when such creatures come to the water's edge to drink or cross. When
    hunting, a gare linnorm attempt to attack with surprise as it breaks through
    ice or emerges from the water. It bites first to poison its prey, then
    strikes with its tail, using its massive coils to crush its prey or drag it
    into the water, where any creature affected by the linnorm's poison soon
    drowns as the venom takes hold. Hunters and sages who have witnessed gare
    linnorms feeding recount stories of these monsters taking on entire herds of
    mammoths or woolly rhinos, often crushing one animal in its coils and goring
    another while others burn within the dragon's steaming breath. After
    feeding, gare linnorms retreat to their riverbed dens to sleep, often for
    days at a time.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Gare linnorms are always solitary. Their immense appetites and brutal
    tempers make most habitats strain to support even one, and a gare linnorm's
    territory can encompass a labyrinth of rivers and inlets exceeding 1,000
    square miles. Males and females do not even join for reproduction. Instead,
    after a short period of voracious hunting and gorging, a female gare linnorm
    travels to the fringes of her territory to find a deeply frozen lake or
    section of river. The female then uses her breath weapon to melt a portion
    of the ice before laying a single egg and letting it float to the underside
    of the ice, still far beneath the surface. Next, the female stands guard
    until the water refreezes, encasing and protecting her egg, before returning
    to the heart of her territory. Any passing male can sense the egg, even
    within its icy shell, and uses his breath to free and fertilize it, after
    which he carries the fertilized egg beyond his own territory and deposits it
    deep in the mud and silt of a riverbed. The egg gestates for 6 months before
    hatching. A hatchling gare linnorm is the size of an adult crocodile and
    survives on fish and birds for the first few months. Growth is rapid, with
    the linnorm reaching half its adult length within 2 years, when it begins to
    hunt larger land creatures, its breath weapon and venom now at full potency.
    Reproductive maturity is achieved after the first century, with females
    producing an egg just once every century.
  - >-
    Despite their fearsome reputations, gare linnorms are sometimes hunted by
    the brave or the foolhardy. In the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, would-be
    kings who kill a gare linnorm are afforded extra prestige, as such combat
    often requires fighting the beast both on land and on or beneath the surface
    of the water. Frost giants are also known to hunt gare linnorms, but
    invariably target hatchlings or the very young, raising the captive dragons
    as powerful sentries and loyal companions that are often more dangerous than
    the giant's entire clan.
