SQ: control Styx, immortality
Environment: Abyss, Gehenna, Hades, Nine Hells, or Tarterus
Organization: solitary
Treasure: standard coins; 50% goods; 50% items
Description_Visual: >-
  This creature appears as a skeletal humanoid shrouded in a dark hooded robe.
  Small pinpoints of crimson light burn in its eye sockets and seem to function
  as its eyes.
Group: Daemon
Source: Tome of Horrors Complete
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Paralysis (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by Charon's staff takes normal damage and must succeed on a
      DC 30 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 2d6 minutes. The paralysis
      ability only functions in Charon's hands.
  - name: Control Styx (Su)
    description: >-
      Charon can control the waters of the River Styx as if using the control
      water spell (CL 23rd). Additionally, he can form a Huge 16 HD water
      elemental (known as a Styx elemental) as a standard action using this
      ability. A Styx elemental uses the standard 16 HD water elemental
      statistics with the following additional special attack:An opponent hit by
      a Styx elemental's slam attack must succeed on a DC 23 Will save or forget
      everything about its past life (treat this as a feeblemind spell). The
      save DC is Constitution-based. Even if the save is successful, the
      opponent acts as if affected by a confusion spell (CL 20th) for one day.
      The confusion effects can be removed using break enchantment, dispel
      magic, or greater magic. Charon can have only one Styx elemental in
      existence at one time. A Styx elemental is CR 8.
  - name: Immortality (Ex)
    description: >-
      Charon is native to five Lower Planes (Abyss, Gehenna, Hades, Nine Hells,
      and Tarterus), thus when his form is destroyed on one plane, he ceases to
      exist there, but still exists on the other four. When destroyed on one of
      the aforementioned planes, it takes but a single day for him to reform and
      return to that plane. To be permanently destroyed, Charon must be slain on
      all five Lower Planes within a single day.
Description:
  - >-
    Charon spends his time ferrying dead souls to their final resting place in
    the Lower Planes. He uses a large, flat skiff to ferry his passengers across
    the dangerous waters of the River Styx. On occasion, he ferries living souls
    to a desired location within the Lower Planes, though he charges a hefty
    price for such passage. In order to request passage from Charon, would-be
    travelers must first summon him to the banks of the River Styx. This can be
    accomplished by casting blasphemy, holy word, or symbol (any). After casting
    one of the above mentioned spells, 2d4 rounds later, Charon appears on his
    black skiff. Travel across the River Styx by Charon costs 100 gp per
    character level per creature seeking passage. The total cost can be in magic
    items, coins, gems, or any combination of the aforementioned items. If his
    price is refused, Charon turns his skiff and moves away. If attacked, Charon
    attacks but seeks to escape as soon as possible. Charon attacks using his
    spell-like abilities, gaze weapon, and staff. He attempts to throw any
    creature who has stepped foot on his skiff without first paying his price
    into the River Styx. If combat goes against him or he seems to be
    overmatched, he summons other daemons to deal with the interlopers while he
    teleports himself and his skiff away. Credit Charon originally appeared in
