  - name: Cytillesh Flash (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a cytillipede can cause the cytillesh patches that grow
      along its body to release a bright flash of blue light that provides
      bright light in a 20- foot radius and dim light in a 40-foot radius. All
      creatures within the area of effect must succeed at a DC 22 Will save.
      Those within the area of bright light are stunned for 1d4 rounds.
      Creatures within the area of dim light are confused for 1d2 rounds. The
      save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

      Dex and dazed; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes
      a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Derros have long used other creatures in their experiments with alchemical
    and magical augmentations. For the most part, these experiments are not
    altogether failures, though they don't usually have the results the derros
    had in mind. However, on rare occasions they actually get it right.
  - >-
    The cytillipede is one of those rare occasions. For years, they adapted the
    diet of a species of giant centipede to eat nothing but cytillesh fungus.
    After years of exposure to the fungus and certain magical augmentations, the
    result was an entirely new breed of giant centipedes that the derros named
    cytillipedes.
  - >-
    A cytillipede has a gray segmented body of hard chitin. Patches of cytillesh
    fungus grow along its back, which gives the creature an eerie blue glow.
    Because of its constant glowing, a cytillipede out in the open is fairly
    easy to spot. Most of the time, a cytillipede is encountered in the company
    of derro patrols that use their creations as mounts or to guard their lairs.
  - >-
    In combat, a cytillipede simply rushes at its opponent and makes bite
    attacks, relying on its cytillesh venom to stun its enemies so it can bite
    them repeatedly while they deal with the disorientation of sudden short-term
    memory loss. A cytillipede normally only uses its cytillesh flash ability
    when it has been seriously wounded or threatened by multiple opponents. A
    trained cytillipede may also be commanded to use this ability by its rider.
    Because of their long exposure to cytillesh, derros are unaffected by the
    cytillesh-based attacks of cytillipedes.
  - >-
    Cytillipedes are usually encountered as part of a derro patrol around a
    derro lair. A typical cytillipede is a little over 10 feet long and 3-1/2
    feet high, and weighs about 600 pounds.
