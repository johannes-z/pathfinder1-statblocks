SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immortality (Su)
    description: >-
      The Mouse Lord is effectively immortal and nearly impossible to slay. When
      slain, the Mouse Lord's soul reforms on the Astral Plane. Within one week,
      it inhabits another mouse or rat on the Material Plane and the Mouse Lord
      reforms. No form of magic (such as magic that would contain or trap her
      soul) prevents this. To permanently kill the Mouse Lord, one must destroy
      every mouse and rat in existence (so her soul has no creature to inhabit).
Description:
  - >-
    Like the Cat Lord, there is only one Mouse Lord. And she is the Lord (or
    Lady) of all rodents. Her natural form is that of a large black-furred dire
    rat with copper eyes. She can assume a human form and this form is almost
    always of a female with darkened skin, raven-black hair, and copper eyes.
    She dresses in robes of flowing silver or gray.
  - >-
    The Mouse Lord spends her days roaming the Material Plane, Astral Plane, and
    Ethereal Plane.
  - >-
    The Mouse Lord enters combat using her bite. Most often she enters battle
    with greater magic fang already affecting her. When enough foes are within
    range, she unleashes her confusion ability and usually displaces on her next
    turn. If combat goes against her, she summons other rodents to aid her or to
    cover her escape.
