      This functions as the stench ability, but causes affected creatures to be
      nauseated rather than sickened.
  - name: Immune to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A carrion golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. • Gentle repose causes a
      carrion golem to become stiff and helpless for 1d4 rounds if it fails a
      Will save against the spell. • Animate dead causes the various parts of
      the golem's body to shudder and tear, dealing 1d6 points of damage per
      caster level to the golem (no save). • Any magical attack that deals cold
      or fire damage slows a carrion golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds
      (no save). • Any magical attack that deals electricity damage hastes a
      carrion golem (as the haste spell) for 2d6 rounds.
  - name: Plague Carrier (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a carrion golem is created, its creator infects it with a specific
      disease. The carrion golem can then infect those it strikes with its slams
      with this disease-most carrion golems inflict filth fever. The save DC is
      Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. Filth Fever:
      Slam-injury; save Fortitude DC 14; onset 1d3 days; frequency 1/day; effect
      1d3 Dex damage and 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Description:
  - >-
    Carrion golems are made from the partially decayed parts of numerous dead
    creatures-no two carrion golems are exactly alike in appearance. Most are
    created from the corpses of humanoid creatures that are then augmented here
    and there with parts taken from animals, resulting in a monster that stands
    6 feet tall and weighs 120 pounds.
  - Construction
  - >-
    A carrion golem's body can be constructed using at least two Medium corpses
    and four smaller corpses. Special reagents worth 500 gp are also required.
