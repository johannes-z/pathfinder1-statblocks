Description_Visual: >-
  Quivering with heat and barely restrained might, this monstrous, pig-faced
  titan looms taller than a city wall. Girded in fiendishly etched armor too
  small for its incredible corpulence, rolls of densely muscled hide spill forth
  in a flamered avalanche. Gnashing its many-tusked teeth and clutching a wicked
  military fork, the terrible giant rumbles as if preparing to roar or scream.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Corrupt Fire (Su)
    description: >-
      Any fire effect-naturally or magically created-within 50 feet of a chortov
      is tainted into hellfire by its fury and evil. Aside from being sinisterly
      colored, hellfire functions like normal fire, except that half the damage
      dealt by hellfire is fire damage and the other half results from evil
      energy and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to
      fire-based attacks. In addition, all of a chortov's spell-like abilities
      with the fire subtype produce hellfire instead of normal fire.
  - name: Hellfire Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, a chortov explodes in a blast of
      hellfire. All creatures within 25 feet take 6d6 points of damage from
      hellfire (see above; DC 22 Reflex save for half ). The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Upon exploding, the chortov's waning yet still raging
      soul lingers on as a creature of pure living hellfire. This creature has
      the same statistics as a Huge fire elemental, except that damage caused by
      its burn ability results from hellfire and it is not vulnerable to cold.
      Every round that this hellfire elemental exists, it loses 10 hit points
      until it dissipates completely.
  - name: Infernal Bondage (Su)
    description: >-
      Chortovs wage Hell's wars not by choice, but due to powerful magical
      bondage. The armor that binds all chortovs bears an infernal curse that
      compels these murderous fiends to serve the will of their infernal
      masters. This compulsion can be temporarily dismissed by a break
      enchantment, dispel law, or dispel magic spell that overcomes a DC 25
      dispel check. This frees the chortov of its bondage for 1d6 minutes,
      during which the baffled creature acts as though under the effects of the
      spell confusion. Destroying the armor via sundering attacks also frees the
      devil for 1d6 minutes, after which the armor magically reforms. A
      chortov's armor has hardness 13 and 45 hit points.
  - name: Wrath (Su)
    description: >-
      The anger and hatred of chortovs is infectious. Any creature damaged by a
      weapon wielded by a chortov or a chortov's slam attack must make a DC 17
      or be thrown into a haze of murderous rage, being treated as though under
      the effects of the spells confusion and rage. This mania lasts for 1
      minute, but victims may retry their save to resist every round. This is a
      mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Towering, rage-wracked brutes enslaved to the will of Hell, chortovs fume
    upon the borders and ramparts of Hell's hinterlands, murderous deterrents to
    any who would besiege the shores of the infernal realm or seek to escape.
    Born from the remains of souls not destined for Hell but damned nonetheless,
    chortovs carry with them the rage of those who have suffered the
    multiverse's cruelest injustice, and by the inescapable yoke of diabolical
    magic find themselves set upon the enemies of their merciless captors.
    Trapped within grotesque bodies of writhing, porcine flesh and smoldering
    hellfire, these horrors hate all things- other creatures, their fate, and
    the lords who have ensnared them and forced them to serve even past
    damnation. Standing over 20 feet tall, chortovs are mountains of flesh,
    muscle, and flame. Each weighing upward of 5 tons, these devils bear plates
    and bands of diabolical armor that serve as physical manifestations of the
    infernal sorceries that bind them as eternal slaves to Hell. Each chortov's
    armor is unique, often bearing images of the vaguely remembered torments
    their constituent souls once suffered. Their bodies, too, bear incongruities
    uncommon in other diabolical races, harkening toward the lawless natures of
    the soul-stuff from which these terrors are sculpted. Ecology Not all souls
    damned to the depths of the Pit deserve their places therein. Trapped planar
    travelers, goodly souls slain as diabolical sacrifices, or captives who
    would otherwise face torments elsewhere upon the planes-all might become
    prisoners of any one of Hell's inescapable layers, eternally condemned to an
    unfair damnation. Yet Hell cares nothing for the souls that toil and suffer
    within its depths, all being fodder for the infinite exertions of the
    infernal machine. As frightened souls suffer over centuries of horror,
    losing what once existed of their individuality, those rightfully damned to
    the Pit join with the fundament of that realm, supplying the infernal realm
    with the terrible sustenance it requires to- over the span of eons-excrete
    forth mindless lemures. Yet souls not meant for Hell fail to sustain the
    plane, collecting in mindless spirit cancers of primal pain and blind rage.
    From these cysts of wrathful, unrighteous damnation, the powers of Hell
    forge chains in the shape of terrible armor, creating within gigantic,
    barely restrained beings of hatred and living hellfire, and turn them toward
    the enemies of the infernal realm. These towering blasphemies are the
    chortovs. Despite being unwilling servants of devilkind, chortovs are
    irretrievable prisoners of Hell. As the processes by which the infernal
    realm torments, destroys, and refines souls into the stuff of fiends last
    for innumerable centuries, and as untold numbers of the damned comprise a
    single devil, no remnant of individual lives, ambition, or memory remains
    within these gigantic terrors. Yet despite a lack of specifics, all chortovs
    are consumed by an overwhelming understanding that they are slaves to a
    hated master and the impotent knowledge that, for all their might and wrath,
    the one thing they can never strike against is their captors. Thus, while
    other devils stand united as zealots inspired by the will of the archdevils
    and Asmodeus himself, chortovs serve only because they must, suffering
    eternally through a second damnation. Habitat & Society Upon their grotesque
    creations, most chortovs find themselves stationed on the frontiers of Hell,
    where they possess innate control over the hellfire that flickers along the
    infernal realm's brazen ramparts. Their mastery over these infernal flames
    often sees them recruited away from Avernus, drawn to some of the most
    dismal forges in the Pit, such as the fortress-cities of Dis and the Burning
    Legions of Phelgethon, where their titanic strength and rage is harnessed to
    power the foundries. Chortovs rarely work in groups, each arrogant but
    typically dull-witted brute harboring a vicious hatred for the
    grotesqueries, ineptitudes, and injustice tormenting others of their kind.
    Should they be forced into close proximity by the orders of their lords,
    such devils tolerate one another, but are quick to quarrel with their
    monstrous cousins. While such conflicts never come to blows-the chortovs
    restricted by their armor from defying the will of Hell-the distraction
    typically overshadows any benefit gained by their tandem efforts. As such,
    chortovs typically work alongside diabolical keepers, devils with the
    desires of Hell and its lords intrinsic to their beings. These minders
    typically come from the ranks of lesser devils, specifically ordered to
    direct the ferocious destructive might of these gigantic fiends. Barbazus,
    erinyes, and-most commonly- imps typically serve as minders of their
    towering brethren, as even greater devils fear the might of those rare
    chortovs that manage to escape Hell's control.
