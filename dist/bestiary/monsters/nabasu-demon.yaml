Description_Visual: >-
  This creature is tall and thin with large, leathery, scaled, bat-like wings.
  Its skin is stretched tightly over its bones to the point that its underlying
  muscles can be seen clearly. Its skin is pale gray. Its hands end in long
  fingers tipped with razor-sharp talons. Its mouth is filled with tusk-like
  teeth, dominated by two overgrown tusks that jut upward from its bottom jaw.
  Its eyes glow with an eerie yellow light.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day per growth point (minimum 1/day for a demonling, 10/day for a
      mature nabasu), a nabasu can use its death gaze for a full round. Living
      creatures within 20 feet must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain a
      negative level. A humanoid slain in this manner transforms into a ghoul in
      1d4 rounds under the control of the nabasu that created it. The save DC is
      Charisma-based. If the nabasu dies, any ghouls under its control become
      free-willed.
  - name: Plane Shift (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day a nabasu demonling can shift to the Material Plane,
      and a mature nabasu can shift between the Abyss and the Material Plane or
      back. This transports the nabasu and up to six other creatures provided
      they all link hands with the nabasu. It is otherwise similar to the spell
      of the same name (CL 10th for the demonling and CL 13th for the mature
      nabasu).
  - name: Feed (Su)
    description: >-
      When a nabasu creates a ghoul with its gaze attack, it gains a growth
      point. It gains a bonus equal to its growth point total on attack rolls,
      CMB rolls, saving throws, caster level checks, and skill checks. Its
      maximum hit points increase by 10 for each growth point it gains and its
      caster level increases by 1. For every 2 growth points, its natural armor
      bonus, SR, and CR increases by +1. Each time it gains a growth point, the
      nabasu demonling makes a DC 30 caster level check-success indicates it
      becomes a mature nabasu. At 10 growth points, a demonling automatically
      becomes a mature nabasu.
  - name: Paralysis Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, once per day, a mature nabasu can release a paralysis
      arua in a 10-ft. radius. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 24
      Fort save or be paralyzed for 1d6+4 rounds. Demons are immune to this
      aura. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Nabasu (both plural and singular form) are one of the most malign of
    demonkind. They derive great pleasure from torturing and killing (albeit
    slowly) other creatures. Unlike other demons, a nabasu spends a portion of
    its life on the Material Plane. Those that reach the demonling stage in
    their growing process travel to the Material Plane where they feed on
    humanoids in order to continue their maturity. Once a nabasu reaches
    maturity, it returns to the Abyss to spend the rest of its immortal
    existence there. A nabasu (demonling or mature) stands 7 feet tall and
    weighs about 700 pounds. Nabasu prefer to attack with their claws and bite
    so they can watch their opponents die a slow and very painful death. A
    nabasu fights until either it or its opponent is dead, and it never shows
    mercy to an opponent in battle. Credit The Nabasu originally appeared in the
    First Edition Monster Manual II (Â© TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is
