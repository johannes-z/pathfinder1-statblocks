SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Avoidance (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a mindslaver mold is infesting a living or undead creature and would
      be hit by an attack, it can make a Reflex save as an immediate action. If
      the mold succeeds, the attack doesn't harm it and instead harms the
      infested creature-the mold effectively slithers out of the way of the
      incoming attack so that the blow strikes the creature it controls. The
      mindslaver mold must choose to attempt avoidance after the attack roll is
      resolved but before damage is rolled.
  - name: Infestation (Su)
    description: >-
      A mindslaver mold can climb onto and attach itself to a willing or
      helpless host as a standard action. As long as the mold infests its host,
      the mold shares the same 5-foot square with its host's space; this does
      not negatively impact the host or the mold. As long as a mindslaver mold
      infests a host, the host takes a -4 penalty on Will saves against the
      mindslaver mold's dominate person spell-like ability, and the duration of
      that spell-like ability on the host becomes permanent as long as the mold
      remains attached. Each day, an attached mindslaver mold deals 1d4 points
      of damage to its host as it feeds on the host's blood and other bodily
      fluids. A mindslaver mold can be torn free of a host with a successful DC
      15 Strength check as a standard action-doing so deals 2d6 points of damage
      to the host as the mold's tendrils tear free. A dead mindslaver mold deals
      no damage in this way.
  - name: Mold Mindlink (Su)
    description: >-
      A mindslaver mold can communicate telepathically with any other mindslaver
      mold within 10 miles, and knows the condition of all other mindslaver
      molds in this area as if it had a status spell in effect on all other
      molds.
  - name: Spore Pod (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mindslaver mold's sole physical attack is to launch a spore pod the size
      of a sling bullet. This is a ranged touch attack that has a range
      increment of 20 feet.
  - name: Spores (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a mindslaver mold hits a creature with its spore pod, or whenever
      a creature touches a mindslaver mold (including when a creature hits the
      mold with a touch attack, unarmed strike, or natural attack), the creature
      must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage
      as the mold's spores swiftly drain away the victim's willpower and sense
      of self. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Mindslaver mold is an infestation from the primal world of fey that is
    particularly common in remote forests, islands, and mountain valleys where
    it is sometimes worshiped as a strange god by isolated, primitive tribes.
    The mold is joined together by a single consciousness, though individual
    patches retain their own goals. It seeks humanoid hosts, parasitizing them
    and forcing them to serve as its bodyguards and protectors.
