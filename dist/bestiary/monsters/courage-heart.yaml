IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bloody Rose (Su)
    description: >-
      At will as a free action, the herald can create a thorny red rose. She may
      use this rose as a +1 anarchic dart as if she had the Quick Draw feat. The
      rose loses all its powers 1 round after it leaves the herald's hand.
      Darkwood Breastplate The herald's +4 darkwood breastplate has all the
      normal properties of darkwood but is as hard and strong as steel (similar
      to wood created with an ironwood spell).
  - name: Favored Enemy (Ex)
    description: The herald has the favored enemy ability of a 17th-level ranger.
  - name: Imbue with Power (Su)
    description: >-
      The herald can imbue an ally with a portion of her power. This ability
      functions like imbue with spell ability, except she may transfer uses of
      the following spell-like abilities as if they were cleric spells: cure
      moderate wounds, magic weapon, peasant armaments, protection from arrows,
      shield other, and status. Using this ability reduces the number of times
      per day she can use that spell-like ability until she dismisses the
      transfer or the recipient expends it (for example, if she imbues a target
      with cure moderate wounds, thereafter she can only use that spell-like
      ability twice per day). Martyr's
  - name: Blood (Su)
    description: >-
      By marking an ally with her blood, the herald can transfer part of her
      fast healing ability to that ally. The herald's fast healing decreases by
      1 (minimum 0), and the ally gains fast healing 1 for 1 hour. This ability
      has no effect if the target already has fast healing.
  - name: Rebellious Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      The herald's aura grants allies within 60 feet the effects of good hope
      and a paladin's aura of courage. The effects of this ability are included
      in the herald's stat block.
  - name: Tactician (Ex)
    description: >-
      The herald has the tactician ability of a 17th-level cavalier (4/day, one
      teamwork feat, all allies within 30 feet, 11 rounds). She may use this
      ability with any of her teamwork feats (Lookout, Outflank, Swap Places).
Description:
  - >-
    Courage Heart is a weapon against tyranny and a mighty spark that kindles
    the fires of hope in mortal hearts. Once a mortal ranger in the service of
    Milani, she was an early champion of Galt's Red Revolution when its purpose
    was to depose evil Chelish nobles, but when that movement become more about
    chaos and vengeance, she fought against it instead. Eventually branded a
    Chelish sympathizer by the Revolutionary Council, she allowed herself to be
    captured in order to allow her allies to escape. She was executed with a
    final blade, which trapped her soul within it.
  - >-
    Milani, having spent a century communicating directly with her followers,
    saw the merits of having a divine champion like other deities, and plucked
    the woman's soul from the artifact and made her a herald. Now the martyred
    hero keeps her original name secret so her living relatives in Galt do not
    become targets by association, and calls herself Courage Heart. Her mission
    is twofold: to attack the powerful enemies of the church (especially
    immortal undead who would subjugate the common folk and conjured outsiders
    used to strike fear into mortal hearts), and to inspire hope among mortals
    so they can find the strength to turn against tyrants.
  - >-
    As Courage Heart opposes slavery and unjust imprisonment, she has made it
    her personal crusade to steal all the final blades and free the souls within
    them. Milani must look at the bigger picture, so the herald has to make
    progress toward this goal when she can. Courage Heart has been trying to get
    Pharasma's herald, the Steward of the Skein, to join her cause, as
    preventing souls from reaching the Boneyard is of interest to the Lady of
    Graves, but that herald's strange nature and the recent creation of the
    final blades (relative to the history of civilization) means she has made
    little headway in establishing that alliance to date.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    As she has only been immortal for a few decades, Courage Heart still acts
    and feels like a mortal woman. She loves her homeland, cares deeply for her
    mortal relatives (most of whom have some elven blood and were alive when she
    was murdered), and enjoys worldly delights such as music and stories. Though
    she has an instinctive knowledge of the people and places near her, she has
    perfect recall of such things in Galt and feels great sorrow when she
    discovers that a building or person she knew in life has been destroyed or
    has died. She collects remnants of Galt's history, such as travel journals
    about its settlements, songs about its people, and sketches of its locations
    and inhabitants.
  - >-
    Having died for her beliefs holding no expectation of ever returning,
    Courage Heart considers it an honor to die again and again in her goddess'
    service, especially if doing so advances the cause or saves mortal lives.
    The only thing she fears is torture, but she knows her immortal flesh is
    resistant to punishment and she has magic at her disposal to help her escape
    almost any confinement.
  - >-
    Though she does not need to eat or drink, she still feels the urge to do so,
    and favors traditional Galtan food. A priest who calls her and has a Galtan
    meal ready for her is much more likely to get help than one who offers no
    such courtesy and expects immediate compliance.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Though the herald tries hard to not play favorites, she loves Galt and her
    extended family, and often checks up on her friends and relatives by lurking
    in mouse or owl form. Milani's small following and the herald's recent
    elevation to immortal status means they both are inclined to push the
    boundaries of what the divine laws allow for direct intervention on
    Golarion. To bypass these restrictions and watch over her
    revolution-corrupted homeland, Courage Heart often asks Milani to incarnate
    her as a mortal ranger (usually of 4th to 7th level) so she can lend a hand
    where she is needed.
  - >-
    In these incarnations she may be male or female and of nearly any human
    ethnicity or features, but she generally prefers light armor and wields a
    morningstar. In this mortal shell, she is more careful with her life-not out
    of any sense of self-preservation, but because she doesn't want her death to
    upset anyone she befriends. She prefers to show up in a settlement, deal
    with a problem, then leave before there are too many questions.
  - >-
    Among the other celestial servitors of Milani, Courage Heart is beloved as a
    comrade and leader. She often gathers teams of like-minded celestials to
    ambush and slay devils, undead, and minions of Zon- Kuthon, then retires
    with these comrades to Milani's realm in Elysium to tell stories of each
    other's bravery and virtue.
