  What appears to be a miniaturized orrery zips through the air, with thin,
  sharp blades flashing periodically from within.
Group: Archon
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 3
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blades (Ex)
    description: >-
      A harbinger can extend blades from its body to strike with as primary
      natural attacks. These blades possess a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and
      damage rolls, and are treated as both magic and good-aligned for the
      purposes of penetrating damage reduction.
  - name: Disassemble (Su)
    description: >-
      As a move-equivalent action, a harbinger can break apart into its
      components. This is treated as gaseous form, except the archon retains its
      full flight speed and DR, and cannot fit through gaps smaller than 1 inch
      in diameter. Reforming into an orrery is a standard action.
  - name: Minor Archon (Ex)
    description: >-
      Harbinger archons lack the aura of menace and teleport abilities of more
      powerful archons.
  - name: Wrath (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per minute, a harbinger archon can emit a blast of energy that deals
      2d6 points of force damage to adjacent creatures. A DC 12 Reflex save
      halves this damage. The harbinger can choose to omit any target from this
      blast that it desires, damaging only those foes it chooses. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Though counted among the least of the archons, harbingers nonetheless remain
    steadfast in their dedication to combating evil. These tiny beings serve as
    heralds and assistants for the forces of Heaven. While on the Material
    Plane, they advise mortals on how best to serve the causes of order and
    light. Some even venture to the other Outer Planes as minor ambassadors.
    Harbingers can also be bound into service as familiars, a role they accept
    eagerly, taking full responsibility for guiding their masters' souls toward
    salvation. A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar feat, a lawful good
    alignment, and be an arcane caster level of 7th or higher to gain a
    harbinger familiar.
  - >-
    A harbinger resembles a whirling mechanical model of a planetary system. Its
    sun, moons, and planets are crafted of tiny glowing jewels whose color
    shifts with the harbinger's mood. Electric arcs and sparks of magical
    essence dance between its whirling pieces. The harbinger can dismantle
    itself into its component parts to squeeze through tiny gaps, its rings
    dissolving into glowing vapor while its star and planets remain. Harbingers
    shed light as brightly as a torch under normal conditions, but can dim to a
    faint glow if desired, and frequently spin off bits of their essence into
    dancing lights.
  - >-
    A harbinger archon's voice resembles the ringing of a dozen tiny bells, and
    regardless of the language the archon speaks, it retains that tinkling
    musical quality.
  - >-
    Most harbinger archons form from souls that led simple lives of wisdom and
    piety before their deaths. They remember nothing of their mortal existences,
    but retain a decidedly practical, if parochial, view of worldly matters.
    Only rarely does a harbinger want for a parable or proverb apropos to the
    task at hand.
