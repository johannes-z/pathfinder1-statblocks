    Some societies deliberately create these specialized wights to serve as
    guardians for barrows or other burial sites. A cairn wight is an advanced
    wight that fights with a weapon, typically a sword, that channels its energy
    drain attack and affects creatures damaged by the weapon as if they had been
    struck by the wight's slam attack.
