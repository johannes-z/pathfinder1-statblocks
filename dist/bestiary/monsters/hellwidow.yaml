      The hellwidow can set any of its webs on fire as a free action at the

      webs when they catch fire take 2d6 points of fire damage each round until
      they escape. After escaping, creatures continue taking this damage each
      round unless they succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save. A new save can be made
      each round to extinguish the fire.

Description:
  - >-
    Hellwidows are giant spiders that make their home within the Nine Hells.
    They are believed to be the result of diabolical experiments that crossed
    giant black widows with devils. These creatures, while possibly related to
    black widows, are much more cunning and intelligent. Hellwidows dwell on the
    warmer planes of Hell's layers, generally avoiding the colder lower planes.
    Giant web-filled caverns serve as their lairs. When encountered on the
    Material Plane, it is most often in thick forests or caverns in warmer
    climates. Evil spellcasters occasionally summon a hellwidow to the Material
    Plane and strike a bargain with the creature offering food, treasure, or the
    like in return for some service (usually guarding a location or killing a
    particular enemy).

    Hellwidows are roughly 9 feet long and weighs nearly 1,000 pounds, with
    males being slightly smaller than females. Hellwidows mate several times per
    year with the female laying up to 100 eggs in a single dull gray egg sac.
    The eggs hatch within 30 days, with only about 25% of the young surviving.
    Young are blood red in color with dull yellow stripes on their abdomens.
    Young mature rapidly, reaching adulthood within six months.
  - >-
    Hellwidows are carnivores and prey on various types of other creatures,
    including lesser devils, fiendish insects, and even other hellwidows. Prey
    is quickly cocooned in the hellwidow's webbing, set on fire, and then bitten
    repeatedly until it succumbs to the widow's poison. Once the prey is dead,
    the hellwidow carries it back to its lair to be devoured. Hellwidows prefer
    to hunt by ambush; usually hiding in dark corners within their webs. When
    they detect movement, such as a creature becoming entangled in their webs,
    they quickly move to strike.
