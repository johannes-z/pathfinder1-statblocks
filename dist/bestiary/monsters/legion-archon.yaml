Description_Visual: >-
  This celestial knight bears a flaming blade as it flies through the air on
  metallic wings that seem to grow from its armor.
Group: Archon
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 3
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Flames of Faith (Ex)
    description: >-
      A legion archon can manifest a +1 flaming burst greatsword or +1 flaming
      javelin as a move-equivalent action. The legion archon's sword vanishes if
      it leaves its hand, and its javelin vanishes after striking or missing its
      target.
  - name: Second Skin (Ex)
    description: >-
      A legion archon is proficient in all forms of armor. It takes no reduction
      to its speed or any armor check penalties from wearing any sort of armor.
      Most legion archons wear full plate armor.
Description:
  - >-
    Where shield archons are the bulwarks of the armies of Heaven, legion
    archons are the swords, sent in file after file to match evil's boundless
    hordes.
  - >-
    Legion archons stand 6-1/2 feet in height and weigh 200 pounds. Beneath
    their helmets and armor, they have pale or nearly jet-black hairless skin.
    Their eyes burn bright with the flames of their faith, flaring brightest
    when they conjure forth their weapons. Regardless of the armor they choose
    to wear, their metallic wings merge with and extend beyond the armor,
    allowing them flight even when wearing the heaviest of protection.
  - >-
    Despite their warlike mien, legion archons prefer errands of peace and
    mercy. Their masters dispatch unarmed legion archons as celestial envoys,
    though still clad in their heavenly armor. In this fashion, they spread the
    word and love of Heaven to widely scattered realms.
