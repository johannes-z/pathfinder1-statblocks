Description_Visual: >-
  Dangling chains cover the riveted iron body of this massive rhinoceros like
  thick, woolly fur. Its hollow eyes glow-windows into a mighty furnace-and
  smoke that smells suspiciously like burning flesh billows from its smokestack
  horns.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Grasping Chains (Ex)
    description: >-
      An iron rhinoceros is covered in animated chains that grasp at its
      enemies. It doesn't gain the grappled condition when using its chains to
      grapple enemies, and can maintain a grapple using its chains as a free
      action, though doing so prevents it from attacking with that chain. An
      iron rhinoceros may have up to two creatures grappled in its chains at a
      time. Additionally, the chains seek to ensnare creatures the rhino
      tramples. The chains entangle any creature that fails its saving throw
      against the rhinoceros's trample attack, or that chooses to forgo its save
      in order to make an attack of opportunity against the rhinoceros. An
      entangled creature can escape from the chains as a standard action by
      succeeding on a DC 26 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check. Each
      chain has AC 12, hardness 10, and 15 hit points. Creatures entangled in
      the chains can't move farther than 20 feet away from the rhinoceros. If
      the rhinoceros moves farther than 20 feet from an entangled target, the
      tethering chain breaks, but the target remains entangled.
  - name: Powerful Drag (Ex)
    description: >-
      An iron rhinoceros can use the dragAPG combat maneuver to savagely scrape
      its foes across the ground. As a full-round action, an iron rhinoceros can
      attempt a single drag combat maneuver against every creature currently
      tethered to its grasping chains. This deals 1d6 points of damage for every
      5 feet dragged, and the chains tethered to any creature more than 20 feet
      away break. The dragging damage may increase depending on the terrain, at
      the GM's discretion. Creatures dragged any distance are knocked prone.
  - name: Scooping Charge (Ex)
    description: >-
      An iron rhinoceros can unhinge its snout in order to scoop enemies into
      the furnace-like cavity within its belly. When making a powerful charge,
      the iron rhinoceros can forgo dealing damage in order to gain the grab and
      fast swallow abilities with its gore attack. The rhinoceros must make this
      choice at the beginning of its charge.
  - name: Swallow Whole (Ex)
    description: >-
      An iron rhinoceros's belly functions as a furnace, dealing 2d6 points of
      fire damage to swallowed creatures. Hatches on the rhinoceros's sides
      allow it to swallow creatures grappled in its chains. In order to take
      swallowed creatures prisoner without dealing fire damage, the rhinoceros
      can suppress (or activate) the flames within its furnace as a swift
      action. When the rhinoceros is suppressing the flames, the furnace instead
      fills with smoke, forcing swallowed creatures to succeed at a DC 17
      Fortitude save each round or be sickened for as long as they remain in the
      rhinoceros's belly. This save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures
      attempting to cut their way out of the iron rhinoceros's belly must
      overcome the durability of the thick furnace walls (hardness 10).
Description:
  - >-
    The brutality of fire giants is matched only by their ingenuity at crafting
    devices of war. Of all their creations, however, few match the ruthless
    efficiency or raw power of the iron rhinoceros. Built to sate the fire
    giants' endless desire for slaves, iron rhinoceroses serve as both tireless
    mounts for giant warlords campaigning against lesser races and as temporary
    prisons for troublesome captives.
  - >-
    An iron rhinoceros measures 18 feet long from snout to tail and stands 12
    feet tall at the shoulder.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    It is a quirk of fate that fire giants, the most rigid and militaristic of
    the giant races, created a construct as willful and obstinate as the iron
    rhinoceros. Early prototypes for the creature borrowed techniques from golem
    manufacturing and relied on bound elementals to provide the construct's
    animating force. The results were initially promising, as these
    unintelligent creatures obeyed without hesitation and executed their orders
    with mechanical precision. However, they also inherited their golem
    forebears' tendency to go berserk in battle. Few generals were willing to
    ride a mount that might turn on its rider, and so these first creations were
    deemed unreliable and most were broken down for scrap.
  - >-
    For the second generation of iron rhinoceroses, fire giant blacksmiths bound
    the spirits of animals rather than elementals into the construct's frame.
    The results were surprisingly lifelike. When not in use as mounts or engines
    of war, these new iron rhinoceroses rest and graze as normal rhinoceroses
    do, even without the need for food or sleep. They "eat" combustible
    materials, such as wood and coal, to fuel their internal furnaces, and seek
    warm places to
  - >-
    lie down. They also share their living cousins' aggressive tendencies, and
    attack unfamiliar creatures on sight.
  - >-
    An iron rhinoceros is only truly loyal to its maker, or to an individual
    whom its maker designates at the time of its creation. At best, it tolerates
    the presence of other creatures, and more often displays barely constrained
    hostility toward its master's servants. An iron rhinoceros prefers not to
    allow riders other than its master, and such riders take a -4 penalty on
    Ride checks to control it in battle.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Iron rhinoceroses are rarely found outside of fire giant camps. Although any
    sufficiently experienced and equipped spellcaster can create one, something
    in the mechanical beasts' construction predisposes them to favor giants over
    other creatures. While they might remain loyal to their creator, iron
    rhinoceroses display aggression toward any other non-giant creature they
    meet. These tendencies, combined with the creatures' immense size and
    strength, make them dangerous to keep in even lightly civilized areas.
  - >-
    Among some fire giant communities, iron rhinoceroses are a mark of status
    and power. Many fire giants assume that a general who possesses and commands
    one has been successful enough at war to afford the exorbitant cost of the
    beast's creation. Because iron rhinoceroses cannot (or will not) bond with a
    new master after their creation, elders rarely pass them down along family
    lines or to successors. Up-and-coming fire giant generals are expected to
    produce their own iron rhinoceroses to prove their worth as military
    commanders. In truth, few iron rhinoceroses survive their masters, as both
    tend to fall in battle against more powerful enemies. On the rare occasion
    when an iron rhinoceros does outlast its owner, the construct is placed
    within its master's tomb to serve as a guardian for his body and grave
    goods. Desperate or foolish young commanders sometimes attempt to steal iron
    rhinoceroses from the tombs of their ancestors, hoping to gain the prestige
    that comes with ownership without first proving themselves in war. These
    young generals more often than not end up impaled, making their attempted
    theft readily apparent to whatever unfortunate giants must clean up the
    mess.
