Description:
  - >-
    A margoyle is a slightly larger version of the standard gargoyle. It is
    meaner, eviler, and deadlier than the normal gargoyle. Margoyles are most
    often encountered in subterranean regions and often have a pack of gargoyles
    with them. In such cases, the margoyle is looked upon as the master or
    leader of the group.
