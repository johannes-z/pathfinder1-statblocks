IsTemplate: 0
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Agile (Ex)
    description: >-
      Vortex dragons have good maneuverability when flying regardless of their
      age or size.
  - name: Alien Presence (Su)
    description: >-
      A vortex dragon's alien presence bends space. A creature that fails its
      saving throw treats all other creatures as if they were under the effects
      of blur (or displacement if the target has 4 or fewer Hit Dice) for 5d6
      rounds.
  - name: Collapsing Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Instead of a cone of fire, an ancient or older vortex dragon can suck a
      single target into its maw. If the target fails its Reflex save (DC equal
      to breath weapon), it is swallowed whole and takes 6d6 points of
      bludgeoning damage per round. A creature can cut itself out by dealing 30
      points of damage with a light or one-handed piercing or slashing weapon. A
      vortex dragon's interior has an AC of 26.
  - name: Fragmented Strike (Su)
    description: >-
      An adult or older vortex dragon can strike with its bite through a rift in
      space. This allows it to make its bite attack against a target anywhere
      within the radius of its alien presence as long as the dragon can see the
      creature. This doesn't apply to attacks of opportunity.
  - name: Galactic Emissary (Su)
    description: >-
      A young or older vortex dragon halves the time of any starflight journey.
      In addition, it's immune to any effect that bars extradimensional travel.
Description:
  - >-
    Vortex dragons are the undisputed masters of travel across the galaxies,
    serving as messengers and observers for the greatest outer dragons and
    godlike entities in the great beyond.
