Description:
  - >-
    The elasmotherium stands as tall and as long as an elephant, averaging
    almost 15 feet long and weighing around four tons. Its fur is thick, and its
    underlying body is tough and very resilient. Its single horn is thick, ivory
    colored, and almost six feet long. Its fur tends to be a bit darker than the
    common woolly rhino's. Like its brethren, its eyesight is poor, thus it too
    relies on its keen sense of hearing and smell. The elasmotherium is a
    herding creature and encounters with herds are common. When danger presents
    itself, the females encircle the young, while the males charge the predator,
    goring with its horn. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
