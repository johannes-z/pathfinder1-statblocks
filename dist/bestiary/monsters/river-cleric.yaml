Description:
  - >-
    River clerics are dedicated to the pharaoh and the goddess Wadjet, the
    latter of whom they believe dwells within the papyrus marshes of the River
    Sphinx. These holy men and women consider it their sacred duty to offer
    services to river-goers in Osirion, whether by acting as guides for
    unexperienced travelers or by ferrying individuals across rivers. While
    accompanying travelers on their river journeys, river clerics make sure to
    educate the uninitiated on Wadjet and their ancient goddess's divine
    doctrine.
  - >-
    While attending to an Osirian river in accordance with Wadjet's tenets,
    river clerics expect to be paid for their services just as any other guide
    or ferryman. Unlike others who perform similar functions, however, clerics
    of Wadjet use nearly all of their income to fund their deity's church. A
    river cleric never turns down a job unless she feels it clearly violates her
    deity's code of conduct (such as obstructing or defiling the river or acting
    against the interests of the pharaoh and his loyal subjects). Even when not
    ferrying clients, a river cleric can be found traveling along the river,
    offering her goddess's insight and blessings to the loyal subjects of the
    reigning pharaoh.
