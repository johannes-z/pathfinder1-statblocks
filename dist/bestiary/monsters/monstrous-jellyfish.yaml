SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Jet (Ex)
    description: >-
      A monstrous jellyfish can jet backward once per round as a full-round
      action at a speed equal to four times its swim speed. It must move in a
      straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.

      Dexterity damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is

  - name: Transparent (Ex)
    description: >-
      A monstrous jellyfish is nearly invisible floating in the water. An
      observer must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to notice the jellyfish.
  - name: Watersense (Ex)
    description: >-
      Monstrous jellyfish can automatically sense the location of anything
      within 60 feet that is in contact with water.
Description:
  - >-
    The jellyfish's body is a translucent pink, blue, or purple hollow form
    resembling an inverted umbrella of sorts. A giant jellyfish's body averages
    8 feet or more in diameter, while its tentacles (trailing beneath it
    underwater) can reach lengths of around 50 feet or greater. Special muscles
    on the underside of the jellyfish's body push water out of it, allowing the
    creature to swim through propulsion. Jellyfish eat anything that contacts
    their tentacles - usually crustaceans, fish, algae, and plankton. A
    monstrous jellyfish spends its time floating in the oceans and seas. When
    something contacts its tentacles, it quickly rolls its tentacles around the
    creature or object, attempting to paralyze and devour it.
