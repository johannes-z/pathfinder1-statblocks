IsTemplate: 1
Description:
  - >-
    The following template can be used to create unique vampire spawn with class
    levels.
  - CREATING A VAMPIRE SPAWN
  - >-
    "Vampire spawn" is an acquired template that can be added to any living
    creature with 4 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base
    creature). A vampire spawn uses the base creature's stats and abilities
    except as noted here.
  - 'CR: Same as the base creature + 1.'
  - 'Alignment: Any evil.'
  - >-
    Type: The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate class Hit
    Dice, BAB, or saves.
  - 'Senses: A vampire spawn gains darkvision to 60 feet.'
  - >-
    Armor Class: Natural armor increases to +4, unless the base creature's
    natural armor is already +4 or higher.
  - >-
    Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected.
    As undead, vampire spawn use their Cha modifier to determine bonus hit
    points (instead of Con).
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: A vampire spawn gains channel resistance +2, DR
    5/silver, resistance 10 against cold and electricity, and fast healing 2.
  - >-
    Weaknesses: A vampire spawn has the same weaknesses of the vampire that
    created it.
  - >-
    Resurrection Vulnerability (Su): A raise dead or similar spell cast on a
    vampire spawn destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does
    not require a material component.
  - >-
    Melee: A vampire spawn gains a slam attack if the base creature didn't have
    one. Damage for the slam depends on the vampire spawn's size (see Bestiary
    301).
  - >-
    Special Attacks: A vampire spawn gains a vampire's blood drain and dominate
    special attacks. The vampire who created the spawn can inf luence a spawn's
    dominated creature as if she had dominated it herself.
  - >-
    Energy Drain (Su): A creature hit by a vampire spawn's slam (or other
    natural weapon) gains 1 negative level. This ability only triggers only once
    per round.
  - >-
    Special Qualities: A vampire spawn gains the gaseous form, shadowless, and
    spider climb abilities of a vampire.
  - 'Ability Scores: Cha +2.'
  - 'Skills: Spawn gain a +8 racial bonus on Acrobatics and Stealth checks.'
  - 'Feats: Spawn gain Skill Focus (Perception) as a bonus feat.'
