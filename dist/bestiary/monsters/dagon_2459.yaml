SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Water Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Dagon gains a +2 competence bonus on attack and damage rolls and a +2
      competence bonus to AC i f both he and his opponent are touching water.
      Embrace of the Uncaring Sea: Dagon's unique weapon is a +5 unholy mighty
      cleaving trident. On a successful critical hit, the target must make a DC
      39 Fortitude save or begin to drown (see Chapter 13 of the Pathfinder
      Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook). This affects even creatures that can
      ordinarily breathe underwater or are under the effects of a water
      breathing spell. The target is allowed a new saving throw each round. The
      drowning continues until either the target is dead, a successful save is
      made, or the effect is successfully dispelled (CL 30th). Even if the
      effect is successfully removed, another critical hit starts it once again.
      The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +10 racial bonus when
      used by Dagon.
Description:
  - >-
    Dagon is the demon prince of sea creatures. He is worshipped as a deity by
    legions of sahuagin, locathah, skum, lizardfolk, tritons (those that have
    accepted the ways of evil), and some merfolk. His Abyssal lair is not unlike
    the Elemental Plane of Water in that it is composed entirely of water.
  - >-
    Pockets of air, though, are rumored to be trapped in invisible "bubbles"
    throughout his lair (so as to allow the non-water breathing demons to exist
    comfortably). Dagon makes his home in a great underwater iron citadel called
    Thos located in the deepest recesses of his home plane.
  - Dagon appears as a 10-foot tall merman and weighs about 2,000 pounds.
  - >-
    He can move on land using his fists to drag or pull his body, but prefers to
    remain in water whenever possible.
  - >-
    Dagon prefers to use his trident in battle but can attack with his powerful
    fists if he so chooses. One of his favorite tactics is to grab an
    air-breathing opponent and dive as deep as he can in the waters where he
    holds the victim until it drowns.
  - >-
    Servants of Dagon Followers of Dagon are mermen, locathah, sahuagin,
    lizardfolk, skum, and evil humanoids that revere the seas and oceans.
  - >-
    Devout followers of Dagon are called Scaled Ones and must sign a pact of
    evil with Dagon. Scaled Ones can receive spells from Dagon and are granted
    access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and Water.
