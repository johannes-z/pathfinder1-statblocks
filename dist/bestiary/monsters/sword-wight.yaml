      A sword wight's energy drain ability functions through melee weapon
      attacks it makes, in addition to its slam attacks.
Description:
  - >-
    Much like the standard wight, these undead abominations are warped and
    twisted caricatures of their former selves. The sword wight bears a massive
    greatsword, and the cold touch of the grave courses through the creature,
    through the weapon, into the hapless target.
