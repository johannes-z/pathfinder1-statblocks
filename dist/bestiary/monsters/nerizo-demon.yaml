Description:
  - >-
    The bestial nerizo can be found on almost all layers of the Abyss. More
    animalistic than not, the nerizo are sometimes used as "hunting dogs" by the
    greater demons and lords. The nerizo themselves realize that they may not be
    the smartest or strongest of the demons, but they resent being relegated to
    common hunting dogs for the greater demons.
  - A nerizo stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 160 pounds.
  - >-
    The nerizo prefers to attack from surprise, leaping to attack its foes when
    they are within range. A nerizo attacks using its tail sting and claws.
    Slain creatures are dragged away and devoured at a later time. If in the
    employ of a greater demon, the nerizo follows the commands of its "master."
    Nerizo are known to stalk their prey for up to a week before attacking.
