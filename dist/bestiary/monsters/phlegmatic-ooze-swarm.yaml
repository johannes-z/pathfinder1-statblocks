SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Maddening Slime (Ex)
    description: >-
      Phlegmatic oozes are composed of volatile, mind-altering secretions. Any
      living creature that begins its turn affected by the phlegmatic ooze's
      viscous ability must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be confused for 1
      round. This is a mind-affecting effect. Creatures immune to poison are
      immune to this effect.
  - name: Viscous (Ex)
    description: >-
      As described in the sanguine ooze swarm's special abilities, except the
      Reflex save DC is 14 and the patches are destroyed if the victim takes any
      amount of fire damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Formed from accumulations of runoff from arcane laboratories and regions of
    magical calamity, alchemical oozes are fist-sized blobs of volatile
    chemicals. Although composed of unpredictable compounds and toxins, these
    mobile oozes pose little threat individually, but in polluted quagmires and
    tainted sewers can collect in numbers great enough to threaten creatures
    many times their size. Swarms of the slimes linger in such contaminated
    areas and seek new accretions of vital solutions, like those found within
    the bodies of higher life forms, to fuel their erratic life cycles. Found in
    numerous varieties with a host of differing abilities, these weird, clinging
    oozes have been differentiated by likening them to the humors said to
    compose the bodies of living beings. Appearing at first to be a collection
    of tiny blobs of viscous, translucent fluid, alchemical oozes become far
    more terrifying once their hungry nature becomes apparent. Each swarm is
    composed of several hundred palm-sized balls of ooze that all scuttle along
    as a single unit.
