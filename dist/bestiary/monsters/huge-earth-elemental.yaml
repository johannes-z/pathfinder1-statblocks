  This hulking, roughly humanoid creature of dirt and stone explodes up from the
  earth, faceless save for two glowing gemstone eyes.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Earth Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A burrowing earth elemental can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any
      other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water.
      If protected against fire damage, it can even glide through lava. Its
      burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple
      or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area
      containing a burrowing earth elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet,
      stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude
      save.
  - name: Earth Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      An earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it
      and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or
      waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls.
      These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the
      elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These
      modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)
Description:
  - >-
    Earth elementals are plodding, stubborn creatures made of living stone or
    earth. When utterly still, they resemble a heap of stone or a small hill.
    When an earth elemental lumbers into action, its actual appearance can vary,
    although its statistics remain identical to other elementals of its size.
    Most earth elementals look like terrestrial animals made out of rock, earth,
    or even crystal, with glowing gemstones for eyes. Larger earth elementals
    often have a stony humanoid appearance. Bits of vegetation frequently grow
    in the soil that makes up parts of an earth elemental's body. Elemental
