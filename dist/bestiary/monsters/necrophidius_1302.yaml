SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dance of Death (Ex)
    description: >-
      A necrophidius can entrance opponents by swaying back and forth as a
      full-round action. All creatures within 30 feet who can see the
      necrophidius when it uses its dance of death must succeed on a DC 15 Will
      save or be dazed for 2d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save
      DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.
  - name: Paralysis (Su)
    description: >-
      Any living creature that is bitten by a necrophidius must succeed on a DC
      13 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Despite its sinister appearance, the snake-like necrophidius is not an
    undead creature. Rather, it is a magical construct built from the skeleton
    of a giant snake and then mounted with the skull of a humanoid creature.
    Fangs are cemented into the jaws of the skull, after which the entire
    creation can be brought to life by a series of obscure and expensive
    rituals-these rituals are traditionally well guarded by those who discover
    them.
  - >-
    As a mindless construct that requires neither food nor sleep, a necrophidius
    makes an excellent guardian, and its innate stealth allows it to slip up on
    the unwary undetected. In certain areas, the necrophidius is commonly
    employed as an assassin, able to disable its quarries with its dance of
    death or paralyzing bite before disposing of them in a gruesome manner-as
    long as the assassination doesn't require any particular intelligence to
    carry out. Particularly macabre creators might even construct the creature
    from the skull of a friend or loved one of the intended victim in order to
    magnify the horror of the assassination, leaving much of the flesh on the
    skull so the victim can recognize its source. This flesh rots
    eventually-only freshly crafted necrophidiuses have this grisly feature
    (although regular applications of gentle repose spells can keep such a
    morbid decoration fresh for a much longer period of time).
  - >-
    Although a necrophidius is mindless, it can follow the simple commands of
    its creator. These can include commands to lie dormant until some specific
    condition is met or to follow and kill an indicated target to the exclusion
    of all other activities.
  - A typical necrophidius is 10 feet long and weighs 200 pounds.
