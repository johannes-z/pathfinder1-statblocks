Description_Visual: >-
  This small strange creature looks like a saucer-shaped jellyfish with many
  small spike-like tentacles dangling from its underbelly. Its body is
  milky-white in color. Two short eyestalks protrude from the top of its body.
  Its eyestalks are gray as are its tentacles. Its eyes are jet black.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid Injection (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a flumph strikes an opponent with its spikes, it injects a burning,
      irritating acid that deals 1d4 points of damage immediately and another
      1d4 points on the round after the attack. The target can end the acid's
      effects by submerging the wound in water for a round or by being treated
      with a DC 15 Heal check. A creature grappling or swallowing the flumph
      takes this acid damage automatically every round it maintains this
      contact.
  - name: Stench Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      A flumph can spray a 20-foot line of foul-smelling liquid once every 1d4
      rounds. This spray functions like the stench universal monster ability,
      except it only affects creatures struck by the spray, which must make a DC
      11 Fortitude save or be sickened for 5 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Alternatively, the flumph can concentrate the spray on
      a single target within 5 feet - if the target fails its saving throw, it
      is nauseated for 5 rounds; otherwise, it is sickened for 1 minute. The
      odor from this spray lingers in the area and on all creatures struck for
      1d4 hours, and can be detected at a range of 100 feet (creatures with the
      scent ability can smell it at double this range).
Description:
  - >-
    Flumphs are small, very strange creatures that spend their days floating
    along looking for food and water. They are non-offensive and only attack
    when actively hunting for food. Flumphs prefer the darkness of the
    underground and are rarely, if ever, encountered above ground. The average
    flumph is about 2 feet in diameter.
  - >-
    The flumph spends most of its time hunting small animals and vermin, which
    it kills and devours by dropping on them and piercing them with its acidic
    spikes. If threatened by a creature larger than itself, it fires its
    nauseating spray in an attempt to repel its attackers. If this attack fails,
    the flumph rises above its foes and drops at them, attacking with its
    spikes.
