Description_Visual: >-
  This monstrous clam's conjoined shells open wide enough to swallow a horse.
  Inside, two tubular siphons flank the thing's innards, which resemble a
  fleshy, vaguely humanoid woman, save that instead of a face, it has a singular
  massive maw filled with rows of ravenous teeth.

    description: A gigas clam's bite attack threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Siphon dart-injury; save Fort DC 24; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds;
      effect 1d6 Str damage and paralysis; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Siphon Dart (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gigas clam constantly rolls collected sediment and calcifications into
      needle-like darts it can eject through its siphons. A gigas clam can fire
      one of these darts as a standard action at a maximum range of 100 feet
      with no range increment, dealing an amount of damage equal to 2d6 plus its
      Strength modifier, and possibly poisoning the target.
  - name: Siphon Jet (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a gigas clam can use its powerful siphon to move a
      creature or object at least one size smaller up to 20 feet directly away
      from itself or directly toward itself in a straight line. A creature
      trapped in this stream of water can avoid the push or pull with a DC 22
      Reflex save. A gigas clam can also use this jet to propel itself up to
      five times its swim speed in a straight line, and can use its trample
      attack in conjunction with this increased movement. If at any point during
      this movement the gigas clam comes in contact with a solid object (such as
      a ship's hull), it deals 4d8 points of damage as it rams the object with
      its durable shell. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Commonly found only in shallow beds of sediment on the ocean floor, the
    gigas clam is an unusual foe-one that often catches divers and sailors
    unaware when they mistake it for merely an oversized mollusk. Shining,
    misshapen barnacles cover a gigas clam's tough and distinctive shell,
    glittering nodes that attract curious fish toward the beast's side. Even
    larger predator fish such as marlins, tuna, and sharks can find themselves
    in the tightly clasped jaws of a gigas clam.
  - >-
    Gigas clams are primarily sedentary monsters, content to lie in wait as prey
    inevitably wanders toward their seemingly harmless forms. Vast fields of the
    titanic bivalves can be found scattered along the ocean floor of the Inner
    Sea, feeding on fish and any debris that falls to the bottom, including
    shipwreck victims and castaways thrown overboard by pirates. If no food
    presents itself for some time, a bed of gigas clams either relocates or
    crawls toward land in search of a more dependable source of food.
  - >-
    Gigas clams depart from their mostly passive hunting style once per year,
    when the bulging summer moon is at its fullest. Entire beds of the creatures
    propel themselves upward and burst through the surface of the water,
    attacking passing ships as well as coastal communities. During these times,
    gigas clams seek out their most favored prey: air-breathing humanoids. Using
    their powerful siphons to slam into passing merchant vessels and war
    galleons, the massive clams are indiscriminate in their search for humanoid
    flesh. Though they are normally hasty and seldom use tactics to obtain their
    prey, occasionally a lone gigas clam uses its feminine figure to trick
    unsuspecting ships into gigas clam-infested waters. The clam and its kin
    ruthlessly ram the vessel until its contents spill into the open water.
  - >-
    Once trapped inside a gigas clam's quivering and contracting musculature,
    victims are almost certainly doomed, as the clam's acidic innards swiftly
    melt and destroy anything within. When engaged in melee, a gigas clam can
    strike with both its fleshy siphons as well as its terrible foot, which
    terminates in a toothy maw that can deliver devastating wounds.
  - >-
    Since gigas clams openly attack land-dwellers only during 1 month out of the
    year, coastal communities and fisherfolk dwelling near gigas clam beds know
    to prepare their ships and docks for the deadly onslaughts of these
    creatures. But even the most formidable defenses are not enough to hold back
    great numbers of the clams, and most find it easier to simply avoid settling
    near gigas clam fields. Particularly bold monster hunters and sages travel
    throughout the Inner Sea during the summer in hopes of spotting the slimy
    beasts, using elaborate charts and maps listing past reports of the
    creatures to pick which areas to observe. A few whisper tales of immense
    magical pearls buried within the clams, which they postulate are responsible
    for the clams' increased size and intelligence. Others propose that the
    monsters absorb a portion of their victims' intelligence and memories while
    digesting them.
  - Infamous Deeds
  - >-
    Primarily encountered in the shallow depths of the Inner Sea and off the
    coast of western Garund, gigas clams leave a trail of destruction during
    their annual rampages, and have committed numerous deeds that prove them
    worthy of their notoriety.
  - >-
    Humanoids living beneath the waves fear gigas clams as well-a field of the
    creatures destroyed the merfolk town of Selsurisa west of Absalom 10 years
    ago. The settlement had fought off the ravenous clams in years past, but the
    attack that devastated it was odd in that it took place during the region's
    cold season. The merfolk were thus unprepared when the beasts amassed and
    overran the town in a matter of hours. As the clams destroyed the town's
    sculpted caves and elegant spires, the merfolk sent waves of soldiers and
    giant crab companions to fight back, but their hasty defenses were no match
    for the sheer ferocity of the gigas clams. The merfolk have since relocated
    to other settlements around the Isle of Kortos, but have not forgotten the
    day of the attack, which many claim was inspired by fiendish sorcery not
    normally available to the gigas clams. Many of the merfolk still yearn to
    reclaim their overrun settlement, whose ruined towers and rubble-choked
    caves now serve as the breeding grounds for the brutal beings.
  - >-
    In the early days of Bloodcove's founding, gigas clams found their way deep
    into the Fever Sea and settled in the Vanji River delta, where they feed on
    the plentiful fish and other sea creatures that travel downstream with the
    river's current. The mammoth clams posed a great threat to the fledgling
    Bloodcove's fragile trade and commerce, since few ships dared sail near the
    shallow delta in fear of surprise attacks by the unpredictable creatures.
    The pirates of the then-small port banded together and eventually defeated
    the beasts, but were unable to kill all of them. Some residents still worry
    that the clams might organize a retributive assault.
  - Adventure Hooks
  - >-
    Gigas clams tend to remain passive during the cooler months, but those who
    venture too close to their homes during the wrong season might run afoul of
    the giant mollusks.
  - >-
    • A trio of scavenger ships recently returned from looting Azlanti ruins
    only to meet their fate at the hands of a gigas clam, which smashed the
    ships to pieces and littered their treasures all over the sea floor below.
    Only the captain and two sailors survived the ordeal; the captain wants to
    return and claim what's his, while his two crew members want to have nothing
    to do with the sea for a long while.
  - >-
    • In response to sightings of a gigas clam breaching the water this past
    summer near Corentyn, the Chelish Navy issued notice of a substantial bounty
    on the strange beasts. Several folk plan to set sail to hunt the creature.
    One ship in particular is crewed entirely by tengus, who keep a mysterious
    contraption covered with oiled canvas on their ship's deck and guard it day
    and night.
