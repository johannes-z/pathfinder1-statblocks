Description_Visual: >-
  This is a flowerlike creature with a dark green to gray trunk and a brightly
  colored interior. It has a smooth front bordered by dozens of fleshy tendrils,
  and a rougher outer trunk. At the center of the creature's front is a circular
  opening that leads into its interior.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      When provoked, the great sea anemone can eject the contents of its
      stomach, including any creatures being digested. This forms a cloud of
      acidic mucous in a 20-foot radius that deals 3d8 points of acid damage (DC
      23 Reflex, half) for 1d3 rounds before dissipating. It can only do this
      once per minute. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Defensive Curl (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a move action, the great sea anemone can retract its vulnerable front
      and tendrils into its trunk. While in this curl it cannot attack with its
      tendrils, though it can eject its acid cloud and gains a +15 natural armor
      bonus to AC from the thick, rubbery hide of its trunk.
  - name: Paralytic Venom (Ex)
    description: >-
      Tendril-contact; save DC 23; frequency 1/round for 1 round; effect
      paralyzed 1d6 minutes. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    These gigantic but primitive life forms feed on sea life swept near them,
    and may pose a threat to anyone unlucky enough to move within their threat
    range. In rocky areas, a great sea anemone has a green interior.
  - >-
    These horrors lurk in areas near the surface of the water, where tidal
    currents sweep water laden with fish across their surfaces. Great sea
    anemones in the open are easily spotted and avoided, but they sometimes lurk
    at the end of rocky channels or around bends, whereupon they pose a hazard
    to unwary undersea travelers.
  - >-
    In addition to being found in reefs and shoals, many undersea races harvest
    these creatures when young and plant them in or near their lairs to serve as
    sentinels against unwanted intrusion. Care must be taken in this process,
    for the anemone is very difficult to train, and may well snack on the very
    creatures who cultivated it.
  - The great sea anemone is immobile.
  - >-
    Great sea anemones snag anything large enough that comes within their reach
    with their tendrils. Once their intended victim stops struggling, it is
    drawn into the anemone's interior, where it is digested. If injured it
    withdraws its body into its rubbery trunk, and if badly injured it expels
    the contents of its stomach in a cloud of acid.
