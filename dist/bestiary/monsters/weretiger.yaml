Description:
  - >-
    Weretigers in humanoid form have large eyes, long noses, and sharp
    cheekbones. Most have brown or red hair, though a few have white, black, or
    even blue-gray. Their movements appear careful yet casual, and a person
    observing one could easily assume he's watching a skilled pickpocket,
    graceful dancer, or sultry courtesan.
  - >-
    Weretigers tend to be solitary creatures, only spending time with others of
    their kind when they feel the urge to breed. Evil weretigers enjoy the
    thrill of hunting intelligent prey.
