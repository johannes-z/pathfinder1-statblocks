    description: >-
      Once per day as a swift action, a great cyclops can gain a burst of savage
      inspiration. When it does, it doubles the threat range of all attacks
      using weapons, natural attacks, and rock attacks it makes until the start
      of its next turn. Furthermore, once per day when the great cyclops reaches
      0 or fewer hit points and is conscious because of its Diehard feat, this
      ability recharges, allowing the great cyclops to use the ability a second
      time that day.
Description:
  - >-
    In the jungles of the south, great cyclopes roam. Some brutes are especially
    dangerous, raining down furious blows with their huge greatclubs, and
    stunning and smashing foes in a blood-red rage. The roaring cries of savage
    great cyclopes can be heard echoing through the jungles as a warning for all
    other creatures to flee before its wrath.
