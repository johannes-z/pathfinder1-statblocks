Description_Visual: >-
  This insect-like horror has six large, spear-like legs and a poison bite. It
  crawls about on hundreds of legs, using its six spears to impale victims which
  it then bites. It resembles a centipede. Its body is covered with tiny
  hair-like barbs that allow this creature to grapple a man sized or smaller
  opponent.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Superior Climbing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A carrion claw need not make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or
      horizontal surface (even upside down). It retains its Dexterity bonus to
      Armor Class while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their
      attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.
  - name: Vulnerable to Magical Light (Ex)
    description: >-
      A carrion claw that is the target of a spell with the light descriptor
      must succeed on a Will save or be dazed for 1 round. The Will save DC is
      equal to 10 + the spell level + the caster's key ability.
Description:
  - >-
    Carrion claws have a preferential taste for elf flesh, and seek to attack
    and eat elves before other opponents. It does not like halfling flesh, and
    kills but does not devour halflings.
  - >-
    The creature can climb any surface, even hanging upside down from the
    ceiling if desired. The carrion claw is terrified of and hates magical
    light.
  - >-
    Carrion claws hunt in packs, with one claw feigning injury on a floor, while
    the rest of its pack circle prey along the walls and ceiling to drop and
    attack with surprise.
  - >-
    Carrion claws are used by drow to hunt down elves frequenting their
    underground lairs. Forward posts of the dark elves usually have up to a
    dozen carrion claws used for shock troops against elven incursions.
