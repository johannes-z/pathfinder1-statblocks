SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Paired Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because of its intense training wielding a scimitar in each hand, a
      maftet's off-hand scimitar is treated as a light weapon.
  - name: Raptor Dive (Ex)
    description: >-
      When airborne, a maftet can swoop down and strike at lightning speed. This
      is equivalent to an aerial charge, but it must move downward at least 10
      feet and may dive at twice its normal flying speed. Doing so grants the
      maftet a +2 bonus on its attack rolls and allows it to make a full attack
      at the end of the raptor dive.
  - name: Runic Tattoos (Su)
    description: >-
      The tattoos scribed on a maftet's body power its spell-like abilities and
      glow when those abilities are used. A maftet can activate up to two of its
      spell-like abilities as a standard action. It may make a Fortitude save to
      resist the effects of an erase spell cast on its tattoos, but if it fails,
      it loses access to its spell-like abilities for 24 hours.
Description:
  - >-
    Dwelling in crumbling ruins and lost cities, maftets are a race of winged
    feline humanoids. Accomplished hunters and stalkers, maftets are highly
    skilled in fighting with dual scimitars.
  - >-
    A typical maftet is 7 feet tall and weighs 270 pounds. The fur on their
    leonine bodies ranges in coloration from a light buff to goldenrod or rust
    red. In some climates, maftets have the spotted lower bodies of leopards,
    and in rare circumstances they may possess white fur and pale skin or black
    fur and grayish-purple skin. Such individuals frequently rise to positions
    of power among their kind.
  - >-
    At home in dry deserts and mountains, maftets prefer to lair in abandoned
    ruins, mysteriously drawn to such desolate places. They also make do with
    dens in cliff-side caves or mountaintop eyries, but only if no suitable
    abandoned edifices can be found.
  - >-
    When a young maftet comes of age, it receives its runic tattoos from a
    shaman, usually the eldest female in the pride. The art and magic of
    creating these tattoos has been passed down from mother to daughter for
    thousands of years, along with the race's oral history and legends. Their
    origins now lost to history, these tattoos are always the same (with minor
    cosmetic variations between the sexes and between different prides) and
    always have the same effects. Under no circumstances are these tattoos ever
    given to non-maftets.
