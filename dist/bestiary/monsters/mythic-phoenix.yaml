SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When killed, a mythic phoenix explodes in a blinding flash that deals 75
      points of damage (half of this is fire damage, the other half is holy
      damage) to anything within 50 feet (Reflex DC 25 for half). The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Incinerate (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature killed by fire damage from a mythic phoenix is entirely
      destroyed, leaving behind only a trace of fine ash. The creature's magical
      equipment is unaffected. Self-Resurrection (Su) Unless its body is
      completely destroyed by an effect such as disintegrate, a slain mythic
      phoenix remains dead for only 1d4 rounds, emerging fully healed from its
      remains as if brought back to life via resurrection. A phoenix can
      self-resurrect only once per year. If a phoenix dies a second time before
      that year passes, its death is permanent. A mythic phoenix that dies
      within the area of a mythic desecrate spell cannot self-resurrect until
      the spell ends, at which point the phoenix immediately resurrects. A
      phoenix brought back to life by other means never gains negative levels as
      a result.
  - name: Shroud of Flame (Su)
    description: >-
      A mythic phoenix can cause its feathers to burst into fire as a free
      action. As long as its feathers are burning, any creature within reach
      must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save each round to avoid taking 4d6 points
      of fire damage at the start of its turn. A creature that attacks the
      phoenix with natural or non-reach melee weapons takes 1d6 points of fire
      damage (no save) with each successful hit. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic phoenix is appointed by the gods to watch over the birth, death,
    and renewal of significant things-such as heroes, religions, or even entire
    worlds. It uses its powers to destroy evils that would interfere with the
    great cycle.
