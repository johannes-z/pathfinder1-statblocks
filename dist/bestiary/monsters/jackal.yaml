Description:
  - >-
    Jackals are usually encountered alone or as a mated pair, but sometimes they
    associate for a time with a small pack composed of two parents and their
    adult offspring, with the offspring serving a deferential support role to
    their parents. Although considered craven and foul by humans, jackals are
    relatively friendly and gentle with members of their own small packs.
  - >-
    Attracted to the edges of human settlements in their territory, jackals
    often make opportunistic raids on fruit crops and vulnerable domesticated
    animals. They're also attracted to large deposits of garbage that they can
    sift through for leftover food. Jackals are remarkably adaptable, and
    readily forage for insects or fruit, feed on found carcasses, or hunt small
    or vulnerable game as the opportunity presents itself.
  - >-
    Jackals are notorious for their craftiness in evading pursuit, and they've
    been known to feign death when caught in order to lull opponents into
    complacency and gain another chance to escape. A jackal can attempt a Bluff
    check opposed by its opponent's Sense Motive check to play dead. If
    successful, after combat ends, the jackal can begin a new encounter with
    surprise. During the surprise round, only the jackal and any opponents who
    succeeded on their Sense Motive checks can act.
