  - >-
    Wholly monstrous, these disgusting creatures have been known to sometimes
    attack still-living foes, particularly when they are hungry or living
    creatures disturb their meals. Some species of giant fly bear their larva
    live, ejecting piles of undulating giant maggots from their engorged
    abdomens rather than laying eggs in decaying corpses.
