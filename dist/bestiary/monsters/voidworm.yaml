SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Confusion (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature struck by a voidworm's tail slap must make a DC 12 Will save or
      become confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Debate rages as to whether or not the strange and capricious creatures
    called voidworms are actually proteans at all. To the wizards and sorcerers
    who summon them as familiars, the answer seems obvious- these tiny dwellers
    of Limbo have all the requisite racial traits of proteans, down to their
    serpentine shapes. Yet the established protean castes find such claims
    outright insulting, claiming instead that it is such acts of conjuration
    that call voidworms forth from the raw stuff of Limbo, giving them shape and
    life according to the spellcasters' expectations, and that these lesser
    beings are but pale ref lections of their formidable kin. Voidworms
    themselves have little to say on the matter-creatures of the moment, and
    sparing little thought for the constantly mutable concept of "reality,"
    voidworms only barely grasp cause and effect, and the past has no more
    substance or signif icance for them than a dream. In order to gain a
    voidworm as a familiar, a spellcaster must be chaotic neutral, be caster
    level 7th, and have the Improved Familiar feat.
  - >-
    Regardless of their actual origins, voidworms maintain a thriving Ecology in
    the chaos of Limbo, forming together into darting, flashing schools that are
    often hunted for sport by naunets and other predators of chaos. Mortal
    wizards, however, most commonly encounter voidworms as summoned familiars.
    These tiny, serpentine creatures are particularly valued by illusionists,
    evokers, and other magical practitioners who deal with distorting or molding
    reality, though the familiars' bizarre logic and miniscule attention spans
    sometimes make them more trouble than they're worth. Still, their confusing
    attack and remarkable hardiness have saved more than one wizard on the
    battlef ield, and their strange thought processes can sometimes offer unique
    insights in the laboratory. When traveling in more mundane lands, wizards
    often order voidworm familiars to use their change shape ability to disguise
    themselves as ordinary pets or animal familiars, though these disguises tend
    to slip when the voidworm grows curious or playful.
  - >-
    A voidworm is only 2 feet long and weighs a mere 2 pounds. No two voidworms
    are exactly alike in their coloration or markings. Their two feathery wings
    generally take on brighter colors than the rest of their bodies, and in the
    case of voidworms conjured as familiars, these "wings" are the same color as
    their masters' eyes.
