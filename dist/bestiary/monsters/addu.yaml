Description_Visual: >-
  Striped with the brilliant colors of a maritime sunset, this beast winds its
  enormous body through the waves, a pair of wiry, talon-tipped arms and a snout
  full of horrendous teeth preceding a fan of razorlike fins.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Miasmic Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, an addu can exhale a 30-foot cone of poisonous
      breath. Creatures caught in the area must make a successful DC 25
      Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage. This is a poison
      effect and the save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Rip Current (Su)
    description: >-
      An addu can stir the water in such a way that it creates powerful currents
      in its immediate area. As a move action, an addu can either push creatures
      and objects up to 30 feet away from it or draw creatures and objects
      within 30 feet toward it. Creatures and objects caught in the rip current
      can resist being moved with a successful DC 25 Reflex save. This ability
      can only be used in the water, and the save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    As enigmatic as they are dangerous, addus hail from the most hellish corners
    of Golarion's deepest seas. Addu encounters are thankfully rare, but those
    who have faced one and survived tell tales of the beasts' unimaginable
    powers. As a result, merchant and pirate lookouts alike carefully watch the
    watery horizons for jagged, fiery-hued spines, which have come to signal
    seafarers' imminent doom.
  - >-
    The colors of the tropical deep-simmering reds, yellows, and
    oranges-decorate addus' long, serpentine bodies. In addition to the ominous
    fins on their backs, smaller spines jut from addus' snouts, heads, and
    necks. Their short but powerful forearms can strip flesh from bone,
    especially when the beasts employ them alongside their barge-sized jaws,
    which bear teeth the length of daggers. With long tails that can sweep from
    the water with whiplike velocity, addus can reach up to 50 feet long and
    weigh up to 14,000 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Legends claim that when Golarion was young, fissures in its deepest seaf
    loors began spewing noxious gases left over from the planet's formation.
    These geysers helped provide life-giving heat to the equatorial oceans, but
    also rendered small pockets of deep-sea waters uninhabitable. Golarion's
    thriving aquatic ecosystem pushed back, however, and from these poisonous
    environs emerged the hardy addus. The geysers nurtured and strengthened
    these enormous, tropically colored creatures, instilling in them a mindless
    cruelty and a voracious hunger for raw meat.
  - >-
    Legends maintain early addus trolled the edges of their toxic haunts,
    harnessing the power of rip currents to kill any prey lurking within the
    tolerable waters beyond. Eventually, addus evolved to embrace the poison
    native to their homes, and even to expel it as a weapon, bringing instant
    death to any creature unlucky enough to inhale it. Experts are unsure just
    how the addus developed their hunting techniques-whether magically or
    through a fluke of nature-but all agree that nothing known to modern
    scholarship explains their deadly abilities.
  - >-
    In time, the deep-sea creatures developed heightened instincts that kept
    them far away from the telltale haze of addus' watery lairs. It was then
    that hunger drove the beasts to establish hunting grounds in shallower
    waters. Their natural maliciousness led addus to fight among themselves
    until each survivor had enough space to roam and feed alone.
  - >-
    Scholars believe that every few weeks, addus experience a blinding hunger
    that prompts them to turn the seas red with the blood of their meals, which
    often consist of hundreds of pounds of raw, still-twitching meat. Addus are
    known to feed on whales, giant squid, dire sharks and-when other prey is
    scarce-sea serpents. Tales of epic battles between addus and sea serpents
    exist among many seafaring nations, scaring children and serving as a
    warning to sailors. Even more terrifying, however, are rumors that claim
    addus periodically crave humanoid flesh, and will capsize ships as large as
    their own bodies to obtain just a few bites of this succulent treat.
    Scholars debate whether addus hunt ships or rather attack them by mistake,
    confusing the vessels' shadows with those of surfacing whales. Regardless,
    addus pose a major threat to any vessel that frequents the vast stretches of
    open water where these beasts tend to stake their claims.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Owing to their violent natures, addus are nearly always found alone. They
    are said to be most concentrated in Golarion's southern seas, where legends
    allege ancient, noxious underwater geysers once were plentiful. A
    particularly unsettling tale speaks of an area several hundred miles west of
    the Shackles archipelago where addus' hunting grounds perfectly abut one
    another like a deadly, invisible puzzle.
  - >-
    Although an addu that intrudes on another's hunting grounds can most
    certainly expect to battle its fellow beast to the death, some pirate
    legends maintain that these creatures occasionally cooperate-when it suits
    them. For example, an Ollo-based pirate captain once claimed that after
    happening upon a vicious battle between two addus, his vessel came under
    attack when the beasts spotted his ship's sails. Once the pirates outran
    them, the addus turned on each other again, intent on settling their
    original quarrel. But given that survivors of addu attacks speak of the
    speed with which the creatures dispatch their targets, most old salts
    conclude the captain invented a compelling but ultimately fictitious tale.
    It's believed that no one has yet survived a battle involving more than one
    addu.
  - >-
    Scholars believe that female addus typically patrol hunting grounds
    measuring only a few square miles, while male members of the species are
    more nomadic, often moving on to new territories every few weeks. This may
    explain the beasts' reproductive practices. Aquatic elves report that up to
    five times during the creatures' fertile years, female addus deposit groups
    of six to eight eggs at the edge of their hunting grounds. The eggs secrete
    the noxious fumes that lend addus their infamy, attracting any nearby males,
    which then fertilize them. Addlets (as their young are called) appear to be
    born into a state of frenzy, immediately initiating brawls among their
    siblings. As is fitting for such vicious creatures, only the strongest
    addlet of a litter survives to seek its own hunting grounds and wreak havoc
    on its own victims.
  - >-
    Despite their violent tendencies, addus appear to be long-lived creatures.
    Native tales speak of single addus that have terrorized the same waters for
    up to 6 centuries. These stories say the longer addus live, the more they
    crave humanoid flesh-or the more they crave maritime battle, depending on
    the variety of the tale. Either way, some of these stories describe addus,
    wizened through millennia of survival, capsizing ships before their
    unfortunate crew members ever realize they're being targeted. Then, the
    tales claim, the ancient addus pluck their victims from the sea, stripping
    the flesh from their bones one by one and offering no mercy save the final
    rest of death.
