Description_Visual: >-
  This creature looks like a cross between a spider and a scorpion. It has six
  legs and two thin antennae that constantly writhe and wriggle. Two large
  scorpion-like pincers protrude from just in front of its foremost legs, and a
  whip-like tail extends from the end of its abdomen.

Description:
  - >-
    Pedipalps are also called whip scorpions. The average pedipalp is 5 feet
    long but can grow to a length of 10 feet. Poisonous Pedipalp A rare variety
    of the common pedipalp exists. Rarely encountered, the poisonous pedipalp is
    a solitary creature. No more than one has ever been encountered at a given
    time. They do not associate with others of their kind or with normal
    pedipalps. The poisonous pedipalp uses the same statistics as the normal
    pedipalp with the additions below. The poisonous pedipalp is CR 3. Poison
    Cloud (Ex) When threatened, a poisonous pedipalp releases a cloud of noxious
    fumes in a 20-foot radius around its body. Living creatures within the cloud
    must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d6 rounds. The
    poisonous pedipalp can use this cloud three times per day. The save DC is
    Constitution-based. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the
    effect from the nauseated creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are
    unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on
    their saving throws.
