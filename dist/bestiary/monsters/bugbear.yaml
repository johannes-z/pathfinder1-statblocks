Description:
  - >-
    The bugbear is the largest of the goblinoid races, a lumbering brute that
    stands at least a head taller than most humans. They are loners, preferring
    to live and kill on their own rather than form tribes of their own kind, yet
    it isn't uncommon to find small bands of bugbears working together, or
    dwelling in goblin or hobgoblin tribes where they function as elite guards
    or executioners. Bugbears do not form large warrens like goblins or nations
    like hobgoblins; they prefer smaller-scale mayhem that lets them keep their
    favorite acts (murder and torture) on a more personal level. Humans are a
    bugbear's favored prey, and most count the flesh of humanity as a dietary
    staple. Grisly trophies of ears or fingers are common bugbear decorations.
    Bugbears, when they turn to religion, favor gods of murder and violence,
    with various demon lords being favorites. A typical bugbear stands 7 feet in
    height and weighs 400 pounds. The Nature of Goblinoid Evil Goblins,
    hobgoblins, and bugbears, despite having superficial similarities, each
    represent a different face of evil. Hobgoblins are ordered and methodical in
    their evil, forming vast armies, warbands, and despotic nations. Goblins are
    the primal evil, seeking only cruelty and petty victimization as they can
    find it, be that among their own kind or against their neighbors. Yet the
    evil personified by the bugbear may be the most terrifying, for they
    actively seek to inf lict pain and suffering in the most destructive ways
    possible. When a hobgoblin kills, it's because of tradition and order. When
    a goblin kills, it's for fun. But when a bugbear holds its blade, it kills
    only when it can be assured that the murder will cause maximum pain and
    suffering to those its weapon does not touch; to a bugbear, the true goal of
    murder is to strike not at the victim, but at those who held the victim
    dear.
