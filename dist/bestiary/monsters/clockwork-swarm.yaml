    description: >-
      A clockwork swarm regains 3 hit points per round. Damage dealt from acid,
      cold, or fire effects cannot be self-repaired. If a clockwork swarm takes
      damage from an area attack, it is unable to repair itself for 1d6 rounds
      following the attack. If reduced to 0 or less hit points, it regains 1 hit
      point per round (but still cannot repair damage caused by acid, cold, or
      fire effects) until it has at least 1 hit point (at which time it begins
      to self-repair at its normal rate of 3 hit points per round).
Description:
  - >-
    Clockwork swarms are a collection of tiny, insect-like clockworks that work
    together as a single creature. An individual member of the swarm poses
    little threat. Yet when acting in concert, a swarm poses a deadly threat to
    adventurers. Much like the clockwork warrior, the clockwork swarm forms a
    fighting frame from random pieces of trash, debris, and other cast-offs. The
    swarm, however, is much more capable of adapting to new situations and
    surviving combat. Unless the individual components of the swarm are
    destroyed, it simply reforms and continues its attack.
  - >-
    Area of effect attacks, such as burning oil, fireball, or lightning bolt are
    the most effective means of destroying the swarm. A clockwork swarm
    typically appears as a ramshackle collection of spare parts and garbage
    draped in a thick, web-like substance and arranged in a vaguely humanoid
    form.
  - >-
    A swarm prefers to lie in wait and strike from ambush, collecting innocuous
    looking piles of debris that adventurers overlook as harmless but that the
    swarm is capable of quickly forming into a combat-worthy frame. If the swarm
    attempts to assemble itself from a pile of debris, assume that the swarm
    starts the round with -10 hit points and self-repairs from there.
