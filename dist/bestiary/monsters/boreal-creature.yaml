Description_Visual: >-
  Since Baba Yaga's invasion, many creatures native to the eastern Linnorm
  Kingdoms have died out, unable to adapt to a land now dominated by ceaseless
  supernatural winter. However, despite this dramatic change in climate, a few
  particularly strong and hardy specimens managed to survive, and over the
  centuries the magical forces holding this realm in its grip have aided the
  evolution of species better suited to this harsh environment.

      A boreal annis hag does not leave a trail in snow and cannot be tracked.
      She can choose to leave a trail if she so desires.
Description:
  - >-
    Though boreal creatures mostly resemble their temperate kin, the effects of
    sorcerous winter have bolstered them, making them stronger and much more
    dangerous. In basic shape and form they appear similar to their ancestors,
    but other characteristics reveal the creatures' altered nature. Their fur
    and skin are much paler, often shades of blue, gray, or simply white, and it
    is not uncommon for parts of these creatures to be cloaked in frost,
    especially their jagged claws and shaggy hair.
