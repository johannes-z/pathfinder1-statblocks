SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fey Bargain (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per week, a Candlestone courtier can grant a limited wish or a
      permanent +2 inherent bonus to one ability score. In exchange, the
      bargainer is cursed to be carried off in its dreams each night by the
      courtier to a never-ending fey ball that, while pleasant as often as not,
      affects the dreamer as nightmare, requiring a saving throw each night
      (Will DC 21 negates). The DC to remove this curse is reduced by 4 if the
      courtier is killed, and a successful coup de grace on the courtier with a
      cold iron weapon automatically ends the curse. Ending the curse also ends
      any noninstantaneous effects of the bargain. A creature can have only one
      fey bargain at a time.
  - name: Spellthrust (Su)
    description: >-
      When a courtier threatens a critical hit, it can trigger a spell-like
      ability with a range of touch against the target. If the critical hit is
      confirmed, the target must save twice, using the lower result.
Description:
  - >-
    Candlestone courtiers are emissaries of Queen Frilogarma and the Court of
    Ether. Venturing up from their Darklands domain, they make deals to the
    benefit of their queen, forge secret alliances with citizens of foreign
    lands, and inveigle mortals into endless revels in the inverted fey city
    while sapping the vitality of their victims to sate their alien appetites.
    Candlestone courtiers prefer to employ trickery and extortion over direct
    violence, but don't shy away from a fight if it is the fastest way to get
    what they want.
