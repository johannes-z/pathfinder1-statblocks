SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A caryatid column is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. A transmute rock to mud
      spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to a caryatid column,
      with no saving throw, while transmute mud to rock heals all of its lost
      hit points. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the column's
      structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1
      full round.
  - name: Shatter Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a character strikes a caryatid column with a weapon (magical or
      nonmagical), the weapon must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or shatter
      into pieces. A magic weapon uses its own save bonus or that of the
      wielder, whichever is higher. If the weapon breaks, the caryatid column
      takes no damage from the attack. The save DC is Constitution-based and
      includes a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    A caryatid column is akin to the stone golem in that it is a magical
    construct created by a spellcaster. Caryatid columns are always created for
    a specific defensive function. The caryatid column stands 7 feet tall and
    weighs around 1,500 pounds. The column always wields a weapon (usually a
    longsword) in its left hand. The weapon itself is constructed of steel, but
    is melded with the column and made of stone until the column animates. When
    melded, the sword is likely to be overlooked (DC 20 Perception check to see
    it). Caryatid columns are programmed as guardians and activate when certain
    conditions or stipulations are met or broken (such as a living creature
    enters a chamber guarded by a caryatid column). A caryatid column attacks
    its opponents with its longsword. It does not move more than 50 feet from
    the area it is guarding or protecting. Construction A caryatid column's body
    is chiseled from a single block of hard stone, such as granite, weighing at
    least 1,500 pounds. The stone must be of exceptional quality, and costs
    2,000 gp. CARYATID COLUMN CL 12th; Price 17,000 gp Requirements Craft
    Construct, lesser geas, limited wish, polymorph any object, shatter, creator
    must be caster level 12th; Skill Craft (sculptures) or Craft (stonemasonry)
