Description:
  - >-
    A mythic griffon is a superior specimen-perhaps augmented by magic, blessed
    by a nature goddess, or the descendant of an exceptional line of mighty
    griffons dating back to the first of its kind. Stronger and faster than
    other griffons, it is aware of its superiority (even though it is no more
    intelligent than a non-mythic griffon) and will only consent to a truly
    heroic rider who respects it as an equal rather than as a mere steed.
  - >-
    If approached by a suitable rider, a mythic griffon is no more difficult to
    train than a non-mythic griffon. The eggs of a mythic griffon usually sell
    for twice as much as those of a common griffon, though there is no way to
    tell if a particular hatchling is mythic until it is several weeks or months
    old. Mythic griffons are extremely protective of their mates, eggs, and
    offspring, and may spend the rest of their lives in the search for vengeance
    against thieves or murderers- even working with lesser beings as allies or
    riders.
  - >-
    A mythic griffon who cannot find a suitable griffon mate may consort with
    unicorns, awakened horses, or mythic horses or unicorns. The offspring of
    such unions is usually a hippogriff (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 156), but in
    rare cases is a mythic hippogriff. Because of prejudice against a
    hippogriff's animal-level intelligence, a mythic griffon usually leaves its
    offspring once they are grown.
  - >-
    A mythic griffon can carry up to 400 pounds as a light load, 800 pounds as a
    medium load, and 1,200 pounds as a heavy load.
