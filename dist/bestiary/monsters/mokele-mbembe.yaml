    description: >-
      When not submerged, a mokele-mbembe can crack its tail as a standard
      action, creating a sonic boom in a 5-foot burst, up to 20 feet away. Any
      creature in the burst's area must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or be
      stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based. Other
      mokele-mbembe are immune to this effect.
Description:
  - >-
    The mokele-mbembe is a predatory saurian that measures up to 40 feet in
    length and weighs up to 10 tons. Inhabitants of the deep tropics,
    mokele-mbembe dwell in lakes, rivers, swamps and other aquatic regions where
    they feed on fish, birds, small mammals, and even reptiles. When food runs
    short and mokele-mbembe grow hungry, they have been known to seek prey from
    local tribes and villages.
  - >-
    Despite being an aggressive hunter, a mokele-mbembe shares some traits with
    nonpredatory sauropods. Its body is massive and elephantine, with four long
    legs that end in webbed feet. Its neck is long and flexible like that of
    herbivorous dinosaurs or giraffes, but its head is triangular, with strong
    jaws and sharp teeth like a carnivore. A mokele-mbembe's hide is mottled
    greenish-brown and has the texture of tree bark. Large, defensive spines
    grow from its back.
  - >-
    The mokele-mbembe's natural habitat normally lies far from populous regions.
    For this reason, they are rarely glimpsed by outsiders, though they are well
    known to locals who hunt in such lands. Many stories are told about the
    creatures' size, strength, and ferocity, and some groups even believe them
    to have a special sacred status as messengers of the gods-or agents of their
    wrath.
