SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Caizel's body courses with a virulent poison that she can intensify or
      suppress at will. It is not secreted through her skin (therefore her touch
      is not poisonous); rather it is delivered through the exchange of body
      fluids with another creature (kissing, consummating an encounter, etc.).
      If a target is not willing to be kissed, she must start a grapple to do
      so. Caizel's Poison: Kiss-contact; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for
      6 rounds; effect 1d8 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Touch of Ecstasy (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round, by making a melee touch attack against a foe, Caizel can
      flood the creature's mind with the most pleasurable images it can conjure
      if it fails a DC 25 Will save. This effect stuns the creature for 1d4
      rounds while its mind processes the information. A creature that
      successfully saves cannot be affected by Caizel's touch of ecstasy for one
      day. The save DC is Constitution-based. Caizel can suppress this ability
      at will. Bonerazor: Bonerazor is a finely crafted and perfectly balanced
      +2 dagger. Because of its expert craftsmanship it deals 2d4 points of
      damage on a successful hit. Additionally, a creature hit must make a DC 25
      Fortitude save or be held (as by a hold person spell, CL 20th). The
      creature can make a new save each round to escape. A creature remains held
      as long as Bonerazor remains embedded in its body or until it makes a
      successful Fortitude save. So long as Caizel is within 50 feet of it, she
      can command the dagger to return to her hand as a free action.
Description:
  - >-
    Caizel is an exquisitely beautiful demoness known throughout the planes for
    her ability to seduce just about any being she desires. Many dukes of Hell
    and lords of the Abyss have fallen prey to her; some have met their demise
    at her hands as well. She was once the concubine of a demon lord (some say
    it was Kostachard) and self-styled Queen of the Succubi, but he grew
    displeased with her after she killed several of his other concubines and
    targeted her for death. She fought back and managed to slay the demon lord
    before making her escape. She now resides on her own and serves no one,
    though she does often sell her services to a demon prince or lord who wishes
    to employ her for some scheme or plot. Caizel detests Beluiri and would like
    nothing more than to destroy her. Likewise, Beluiri would like to see Caizel
    gone once and for all. Beluiri once worked with Caizel on a mission to
    seduce a powerful demon prince. When the ruse was discovered, Beluiri
    betrayed Caizel; leaving her to the devices of the prince and his fiendish
    minions. Thinking her gone, Beluiri began calling herself "The Temptress"
    and touted herself as the seductress of the lower planes. Since Caizel's
    return, she has attempted to reclaim that title and now seeks revenge
    against Beluiri. Caizel is an astonishing beautiful creature standing just
    under 6 feet tall. Her skin is delicate, soft, and copper in color. Her eyes
    are blue-green. Two tiny horns are hidden beneath her long, raven-black
    hair. Her hands, while clawed, are shapely and delicate. Small leather wings
    protrude from her back, but she usually keeps these hidden beneath her robes
    and gowns. Caizel prefers clothes of gold, silver, sapphire, or black.
    Caizel tries to avoid melee combat if possible, preferring to use her skills
    and abilities against a lone target that she can easily manipulate and
    control. If forced into combat, she immediately uses her summon demons
    ability to summon a pack of hezrous to her aid. After summoning her demonic
    allies, she throws up a protection from good or magic circle against good
    and uses her wall of fire ability against her aggressors. In battle, she
    uses her touch of ecstasy ability to disable opponents and then finishes
    them off with a kiss or allows her comrades to finish them off. If combat is
    going against her, she uses her ethereal jaunt or greater teleport to
    escape. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
