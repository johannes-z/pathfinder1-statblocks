Description_Visual: >-
  The sound of clashing steel upon a battlefield resounds with every step of
  this ironclad giant. Its armor bears harsh but elaborate flourishes, as though
  it were the war regalia of some merciless warlord. Each plate looks impossibly
  thick and heavy, like the hulking titan within is completely hidden by layer
  upon layer of tightly woven chain and impregnable steel.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blade Slam (Ex)
    description: >-
      The First Blade's slam attacks deal bludgeoning and slashing damage. Its
      slams count as natural weapons or manufactured weapons (whichever is most
      beneficial to it) for the purpose of spells that enhance attacks. Its
      attacks count as adamantine, chaos, and magic for the purpose of
      overcoming damage reduction.
  - name: Breathless (Ex)
    description: Unlike most outsiders, the First Blade does not need to breathe.
  - name: Ever Armed (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, at will, the First Blade can cause a mundane melee
      weapon of any type or size to appear in its hands. Although it typically
      battles unarmed, it sometimes makes use of weapons as needed. These
      weapons come from Gorum's divine realm, and this ability cannot be used to
      claim a specific weapon.
  - name: Heavy Fortification (Ex)
    description: >-
      The First Blade has a 75% chance to treat a critical hit or sneak attack
      as a normal attack, as if it were wearing heavy fortification armor.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      The First Blade is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow
      spell resistance. The First Blade can lower this resistance for 1 round as
      a standard action (similar to a creature with spell resistance lowering
      its spell resistance) to allow other creatures to cast spells on it; it
      can use its spell-like abilities on itself without difficulty. Certain
      spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below. • A
      magical attack that deals electricity damage slows the First Blade (as the
      slow spell) for 1 round, with no saving throw. • A magical attack that
      deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the First Blade and heals 1
      point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise
      deal. If the amount of healing would cause the First Blade to exceed its
      full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The
      First Blade gets no saving throw against fire effects. • The First Blade
      is affected normally by rust attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a
      rusting grasp spell.
  - name: Ironsense (Ex)
    description: >-
      The First Blade automatically detects iron objects (including steel)
      within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.
  - name: Lord of Battle (Ex)
    description: >-
      The First Blade is treated as an 18th-level barbarian and fighter for any
      game rule (such as a feat prerequisite) that requires levels in barbarian
      or fighter. It is proficient in all weapons.
  - name: Powerful Blows (Ex)
    description: >-
      The First Blade inflicts one and a half times its Strength modifier and
      threatens a critical hit on a 19-20 with its slam attacks.
  - name: Rage Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Willing creatures within 100 feet of the First Blade gain the effects of a
      rage spell automatically, whether they are allies or enemies of the
      Herald. Those who choose not to be affected are immune to the aura until
      they leave the area and return (at which point they may again accept or
      refuse the aura's effect).
  - name: Swarm Form (Su)
    description: >-
      The First Blade can shift between its manlike body and a floating swarm of
      Diminutive and Tiny sharp metal fragments as a standard action. In swarm
      form it has the swarm subtype; it cannot use its slam attacks but instead
      can make a swarm attack (4d6 and distraction). Though its individual
      components may float up to 10 feet above the ground as they move, the
      Blade's swarm form cannot fly. The First Blade remains in one form until
      it chooses to assume its other form. A change in form cannot be dispelled,
      nor does the First Blade revert to any particular form when killed (both
      shapes are its true form). A true seeing spell reveals both forms
      simultaneously.
Description:
  - >-
    Said to have been formed from an unthinking sliver of steel dashed from
    Gorum's blade during one of his first clashes with a long-felled god-beast
    of the Outer Sphere, the First Blade is a living tool of war. Inspired by
    Gorum's divine bloodlust, this shard of the god of battle's blade continues
    to obey and do battle in the service of its divine master. Having been
    reforged through the eons into a manifestation of Gorum's perfect warrior,
    the First Blade serves as the war god's herald, traveling where its master
    desires. Yet while the heralds of most deities go forth to bear the word of
    their divine patrons or answer the most desperate summons of their gods'
    most pious servants, the First Blade endlessly marches to battle. Never
    interested in diplomacy or subtlety, Gorum has little need for a messenger
    other than one capable of communicating in the language of the battlefield.
    The god of battle answers the calls only of those who please him in battle
    and request his heralds' aid in epic clashes dedicated to his honor-
    weakling priests seeking salvation or cowardly revenge never have their
    entreaties for the herald's presence answered. The appearance of the First
    Blade changes to match a style of armor impressive to those against whom it
    will be doing battle, though typically notched as if it has been employed in
    numerous battles. Rarely seen in the same form twice, its plate mail form
    might vary from the elegant mail of angelic hosts to slabs of spiked iron
    over thick bestial hides more common to orc warlords. Whatever the shape,
    the interior of the armor is never visible. Those who have come close enough
    to the First Blade and survived claim that only more layers of armor lie
    beneath its plates, though the hint of something glowing within sometimes
    spills forth should the herald suffer a rare but occasional wound.
    Regardless of the specifics of its warlike form, the herald of Gorum
    typically stands about 15 feet tall and weighs nearly 2 tons. Ecology
    Although a living creature, the First Blade is little more than a weapon of
    Gorum, knowing little beyond its lord's command and going only where he
    wills. Like a golem in many respects, the herald leaves but scant traces
    upon the lands it passes through between battles, eating little and having
    no need even to breathe. In war, however, its presence and passage are
    obvious, marked by rent bodies and blood-soaked earth. Although the First
    Blade can speak a variety of languages, few of those encountering the herald
    have heard it do so. Like its master, the First Blade prefers
    actions-especially violent, purposeful ones-to words. Typically its words
    are brief refutations of those who have summoned it for an unfit purpose,
    though several legends tell of the divine messenger offering its respect or
    the pleasure of its master before striking the final blow upon an opponent
    who has put up a particularly capable fight or proven her prowess on the
    field of battle. Habitat & Society While the herald of Gorum answers the
    call of servants of the lord of battle who seek their lord's intervention in
    appropriately glorious battle, no accounts exist of the First Blade
    responding to any summons involving a task other than combat. Most accounts
    of the herald tell of the gory swaths it cuts through battlefields of
    heroes, in clashes between titanic armies, or in weeks-long battles between
    history's greatest warlords. Rumors among Gorum's clergy also suggest that
    sometimes the herald appears when summoned to a lesser battle, but upon
    finding a mere skirmish or clash among weaklings, it slaughters all
    involved. Whether such an end is an honor or a disgrace for those killed
    remains a subject of some debate among theologians.
