SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ghost Touch Jaws (Su)
    description: >-
      A drocha swarm's many biting jaws are considered to have the ghost touch
      special ability. This allows it to deal its swarm damage to corporeal
      foes, and to deal normal damage to incorporeal creatures such as ghosts,
      shadow demons, and even other drocha swarms.
  - name: Project Death (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a drocha swarm can target a creature within 30 feet
      and cry mournful wails that fill the listener with images of its own
      death. The targeted creature must succeed at a DC 18 Will save to steel
      itself against this morbid onslaught. If that save fails, the victim must
      succeed at a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save
      succeeds, the victim takes 4d6 points of damage. A creature that
      successfully saves against the initial Will save is not subject to the
      same drocha swarm's project death ability for 24 hours. This is a
      mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The opening of the Worldwound brought many horrors to the world, and one of
    the more tragic and horrible results was the elimination of the Sarkorian
    people. The mass deaths of these people spawned roiling clouds of unquiet
    spirits called drocha swarms. Each made of the spirits of hundreds of
    Sarkorians who died at once, these ghostly swarms reveal the screaming faces
    of those who once lived and thrived in this verdant land. Their lives were
    cut short either by the ripping open of the terrain itself or by the demons
    that subsequently poured forth from the Abyss. Now, these tortured swarms of
    spirits roam the Worldwound, alone or in packs. Drocha swarms are devoid of
    the goodliness and respect for nature they had in life. All these tortured
    souls can do is scream and torment others, and though incorporeal, their
    razor-sharp teeth materialize just long enough to tear at any creatures they
    happen across.
  - >-
    Mostly translucent, drocha swarms contain only the faintest traces of black
    and green delineating the writhing mouths and rolling eyes of the faces
    within. The faces moan independently, creating a cacophony of voices, each
    shouting rage at its death or screaming for others to listen to the story of
    its plight. It would be maddening to pick out individual voices and follow
    their terrible cries. The swarm can expand and contract as necessary,
    pouring over enemies and draining them of the life drocha swarms were so
    violently denied, an action that does not seem to bring the pitiful
    creatures any relief from their hideous afterlife.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    It is postulated drocha swarms can form anywhere death has occurred on a
    massive scale. Before the Worldwound opened, they were virtually nonexistent
    in the Inner Sea region, though some theorize the Sodden Lands could have
    their own form of drocha swarms made up of those who perished when the Eye
    of Abendego formed and ravaged the Lirgeni people, practically eliminating
    them from the Inner Sea.
  - >-
    The dead individuals that make up a drocha swarm have lost any identity they
    once had and are hideously transformed; they are now horrific vehicles of
    undeath, created only when the conditions are right. As dead souls trapped
    on the Material Plane are wont to do, drocha swarms are angry and vengeful,
    and attack any living thing near them with impunity.
  - >-
    Since these swarms are composed of undead spirits, once reduced to 0 hit
    points, drocha swarms are immediately destroyed instead of dispersing.
    Whether these unquiet spirits are then freed from their connection to the
    Material Plane and are able to pass on to the Boneyard is unclear. Many
    scholars believe that destroyed drocha swarms do not pass on to their final
    judgment and instead are flung to different edges of the Worldwound, where
    they slowly reform. These scholars state that the real tragedy in regard to
    putting these horrifying beings out of their tortured misery is that those
    who defeat them are not liberating the tortured souls, but rather just
    postponing future encounters with new drocha swarms. This theory is telling,
    for if drocha swarms were indeed destroyed, there would be fewer and fewer
    of them every year. However, encounters with these deadly swarms have shown
    no hint of letting up.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Drocha swarms typically stay in the area in which they died, repeatedly
    going over the same territory in an ostensible attempt to understand why the
    villages and cities in which they lived are no longer there. In contrast,
    some drocha swarms float all about the Worldwound attacking demons and
    humanoids alike. When drocha swarms attack demons, their screams and wails
    change tone and pitch, as if the spirits understand demons were responsible
    for their demise.
  - >-
    Because of their roaming nature, these swarms infrequently encounter each
    other. As unintelligent undead, drocha swarms have no society. Even when
    swarms come across each other, they seem unaware of each other's
    existence-which is perhaps unsurprising since drocha swarms focus on living
    things.
  - >-
    On rare occasions, drocha swarms have been reported to collide with each
    other. When this event occurs, a strange thing happens. The two (or more)
    swarms appear to merge together, the translucent cloud of screaming faces
    darkening and billowing out in an even more chaotic roil. The screaming
    faces that float within the deadly mass pass through one another in a
    twisted dance and the volume of their wails increases to a painfully
    uncomfortable level. The merged swarm pulses and continues to grow larger
    than the volume of the two individual drocha swarms. This horrid mass
    coalesces and ceases flying, coming to rest on the ground, and remaining
    stationary for hours at a time. During this period, living creatures can
    actually approach the merged swarm without the drocha swarms pursuing them,
    though some have reported that pseudopod-like appendages stretch out from
    the mass and probe the air in the direction of the living. After several
    hours, the wails and shrieks build to a crescendo loud enough to make one's
    ears bleed and the area of the swarm's fear aura doubles. Once this happens,
    the merged cloud of drocha swarms rapidly pulses, then dramatically
    contracts to the size of a single drocha swarm. It's unknown whether the two
    merge and take up the same space or one swarm takes over the other. Some
    believe the two swarms engage in a brutal battle with one another until a
    single swarm is destroyed. It's believed this is the only way the component
    spirits can be freed from their tortured existence, but what truly happens
    in these rare circumstances is unknown.
  - >-
    To the few untainted individuals who still call the Worldwound home, drocha
    swarms are as infamous as demons for their ability to cause destruction and
    turmoil wherever they go. Because they are clearly not demons, however, a
    few stories have emerged in the hundred years that drocha swarms have
    existed. Some say the Sarkorians, who nervously predicted the thinness of
    their realm, deserve their fate for not fleeing. Others say there was no way
    the Sarkorians could have predicted their fates. Still others claim the
    Sarkorians are the victims of a greater force, which needed thousands of
    lives to manifest its evil nature on the Material Plane. Who is correct is
    anyone's guess.
