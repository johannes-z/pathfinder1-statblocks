SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Disease (Su)
    description: >-
      An iku-turso's bite inflicts a strange, supernatural disease called
      tursas. This disease causes the victim's skin to grow painfully scaly,
      causes strange hallucinations, and eventually transforms the victim into
      an iku-turso. Tursas: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 20; onset 1 minute;
      frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Wis damage and 1d6 Cha drain; cure 2
      consecutive saves. As long as a victim suffers any ability damage from
      tursas, it gains the ability to breathe water. A creature reduced to 0
      Charisma by this disease transforms into a fully grown and healthy
      iku-turso-it immediately forgets its previous life and abilities and seeks
      out the nearest iku-turso community to join it. A wish or miracle can
      reverse this transformation. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Light Lure (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an iku-turso can call forth a few small points of
      light, functioning like a dancing lights spell (CL equals the iku-turso's
      HD) except as described here. Creatures within 100 feet of one of these
      lights must make a DC 19 Will save upon sighting them or be compelled to
      approach them by the safest and most direct path. A creature that
      successfully saves is immune to the same iku-turso's light lure for 24
      hours. If a subject of this effect has to move through hazardous terrain
      to reach the lights, that subject receives another saving throw to end the
      effect before entering the hazardous terrain. This effect ends once the
      character reaches the light or takes any form of damage. This is a visual
      mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Iku-tursos are hideous denizens of the deep sea. There, they venerate
    sinister gods of plague and contagion and torment victims plucked from ship
    and shore in special air-filled torture chambers. Disease is sacred to the
    iku-tursos, and those who suffer from sickness are considered blessed-an
    iku-turso often chooses to leave obviously diseased victims to their fates
    rather than attempt to capture them.
