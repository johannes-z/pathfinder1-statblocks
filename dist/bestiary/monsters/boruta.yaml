  Piercing yellow eyes gaze from the mossy skull of this ivy-covered skeleton.
  Where bones should be, gnarled roots grow, and tangles of vines hang from its
  moldering chest like spilt viscera.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Electric Fortitude (Ex)
    description: >-
      Borutas take no damage from electricity. Instead, any electricity attack
      used against a boruta temporarily increases its Constitution score by 1d4
      points. The boruta loses these temporary points at the rate of 1 per hour.
  - name: Grounding Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      Any living creature that takes damage from a boruta's claws must make a DC
      20 Fortitude save or have hundreds of tiny seed pods injected into its
      body. These seeds grow rapidly; they explode through the victim's skin on
      its next turn, dealing 1d6 points of damage and entangling it as runners
      and vines grow from its flesh and root themselves in the ground. The
      victim cannot move unless it makes a DC 10 Strength check to tear the
      plants from the ground, but doing so also deals 1d4 points of damage to
      the victim. This effect lasts for 10 minutes. Remove curse, blight,
      diminish plants, and similar spells instantly end this effect. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Treespeech (Ex)
    description: >-
      A boruta has the ability to converse with plants as if subject to a
      continual speak with plants spell, and most plants greet them with an
      attitude of friendly or helpful.
  - name: Wild Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A boruta can wild shape three times per day as a 7th-level druid. In any
      form a boruta takes, its appearance remains plantlike, with wooden
      features and leaves rather than fur or feathers.
Description:
  - >-
    A distant cousin of shambling mounds, borutas are powerful wielders of
    natural magic that make their homes in marshes or wetlands, where their
    mysterious control over the natural environment is most useful.
  - >-
    Though none are sure of the specific relationship between borutas and
    shambling mounds, the connection is clear when comparing the two, their
    powers and affinity for the marshlands being the most obvious similarities.
  - >-
    Borutas-or "swamp lords," as they're sometimes called- resemble mossy,
    skeletal humans at first glance, with bonelike wooden frames, viny covering,
    and vivid yellow eyes. Considerably more intelligent than their shambling
    mound cousins, they claim wide territories-typically swamps, forests,
    jungles, or other lands thick with plant-life-and brook no insult to their
    realm. Highly defensive of the life within their lands, especially plants
    and thinking plant creatures, borutas view themselves as the avengers of
    those that can't defend themselves, and mercilessly repay destructive
    invaders with verdurous force. On the rare occasions when they deal
    peaceably with non-plant creatures, borutas cover their frightening forms
    with thick veils of grass or peat moss.
  - Borutas generally stand about 7 feet tall and weigh just over 200 pounds.
  - >-
    Ecology Surfacing from the dark waters of bogs and marshes, borutas are
    birthed from swamps and forested caves in isolated pods. Cocooned in a thick
    shell of reeds and swampy grasses, a boruta grows inside its own chamber
    until it reaches maturity, about 2 years after the emergence of the pod.
    Upon reaching this stage of maturity, a swamp lord breaks out of its
    protective shell fully grown.
  - >-
    Though formidable upon emergence, infant borutas are incredibly vulnerable
    while developing in their cocoons.
  - >-
    If the shell-like pod is ruptured before development is complete, the boruta
    within ceases to grow, usually causing it to simply wither away. Few can say
    where borutas come from, though some claim that natural lands threatened
    with destruction or with strong ties to the First World produce them.
  - >-
    A boruta's viny flesh typically takes a greenish hue, though these colors
    change with the natural progression of the seasons or to otherwise blend in
    with the foliage of its homeland. As a boruta ages, its leaves continues to
    darken, and the most ancient swamp lords possess foliage almost as black as
    the murky waters from which they emerge. How long a boruta might survive, no
    one knows, as the reclusive creatures sometimes vanish into their fecund
    homes and aren't seen for decades. Some propose the creatures are
    immortal-or at least have life spans on par with the oldest trees-so long as
    the territory they watch over remains healthy.
  - >-
    Habitat & Society Borutas hold plant and animal life in the same esteem as
    humans typically hold members of their own race or other sentient creatures.
    As sentient plants, borutas share kinship with the oldest trees and
    slightest blades of grass in their territories, viewing all as members of
    their extended family and watching over all. Their manner of thinking and
    philosophies differ wildly from these of humanoids, being far more
    fundamentally tied into the cycle of seasons and the mysterious rhythms of
    the earth. Borutas understand that nature is rarely calm or peaceful, and
    that the mere act of moving can often be disruptive or outright destructive
    to other organisms, yet do what they can to keep forces outside of nature
    from disturbing or destroying the environments of their homes.
  - >-
    Left to their own devices, they tend to plants and vulnerable animals,
    commune with the oldest growth and natural creatures of their territories,
    and encourage new growth. Should their homes be violated, however, whether
    by the axes of enterprising humanoids or the depredations of rampaging
    monsters, borutas do all they can to prevent future harm. Sometimes this
    might mean slaying a dangerous interloper, but in more extreme cases their
    vengeance might launch an extended campaign of natural violence against an
    entire community. Borutas try not to harm the innocent, but if they view
    certain neighboring creatures as fundamentally destructive, or are forced to
    choose between the lives of invaders and those of their plants, they will
    always side with nature. Such decisions often put borutas at odds with
    expanding humanoid communities, leading to tales of violent swamp monsters
    or evil spirits of the forest, though rarely do such stories consider the
    plants' points of view. Borutas are intelligent enough to reason with, but
    are stolid in their defense of their lands and will no more accept partial
    loss or brook lessened defilement of their homes than a community might
    assent to the murder of a mere fraction of its populace.
  - >-
    Borutas rarely encounter others of their kind, being born alone and never
    leaving their territories of their own accord. They typically find
    themselves at odds with humanoids, and even the most nature-sensitive elves
    often find them disagreeable or alien enough to bear avoidance. Druids who
    know of a boruta in a region typically go out of their way to placate it and
    serve as peacemakers between the swamp lord and the communities of other
    humanoids; they often preach avoidance to all who would pass through the
    proud plant creature's lands. Despite their similar interests in watching
    over nature, treants rarely share territories with borutas, preferring
    highly forested lands while the swamp lords tend to favor darker lands and
    the meaner plants of the forest. When members of the two races do share
    lands, they might brief ly cooperate in defense of their forest, though
    treants typically disfavor boruta tactics, which they view as shortsighted
    and provocative. Fey, too, have mixed opinions of borutas, with goodly fey
    avoiding them, while the more neutral hold them in high regard. Yet borutas
    share a special alliance with shambling mounds, treating the wild plants as
    primitive cousins, often assembling and guiding tribelike communities of the
    mounds and cooperating with them to drive off those who threaten their
    lands.
