SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dense Mind (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a mythic hill giant fails its saving throw against a hostile
      mind-affecting effect, at the start of its turn it automatically expends
      one use of mythic power (if it has any) as a free action to reroll its
      saving throw against the effect. It rerolls for each ongoing
      mind-affecting effect each turn.
  - name: Earth Bond (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mythic hill giant gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls,
      and saves while touching the ground (including a stone or earthen floor in
      a building). As a standard action, a hill giant touching the ground can
      expend one use of mythic power to rejuvenate itself, gaining the benefits
      of cure critical wounds and restoration.
  - name: Ground Pound (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a mythic hill giant can expend one use of mythic
      power and hit the ground with a bludgeoning weapon. Choose one
      intersection within reach; creatures touching the ground within a 20-foot
      burst centered on that intersection take double the damage normally dealt
      by that bludgeoning weapon (Reflex DC 23 for half). Creatures that fail
      their saves are knocked prone and moved 5 feet directly away from chosen
      intersection. This ability has no effect on creatures with the earth bond
      ability. The save DC is Strength-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic hill giant is a relic from an earlier age, smarter than its
    degenerate kin and gifted with magic of stone and earth. Some seek to rule,
    creating tribes with their non-mythic kin and using smaller beings as serfs.
    Others prefer lives of solitude, intolerant of all other creatures.
