Description:
  - >-
    Silverblood werewolves are a rare type of lycanthrope found almost
    exclusively in the Arthfell Forest. They are the survivors of an
    experimental process conceived by jeweler-turned-werewolf Garrick Argentum,
    and developed by his allies in the Shadow Pack, a group of werewolf druids
    in the forest. The Shadow Pack conducted an eldritch ritual involving
    successive exposures to pure silver under the light of the full moon in an
    attempt to desensitize the werewolves to the deadly touch of silver (in
    theory, this process could also produce other types of silverblood
    lycanthropes). The experiment was a success, and the werewolves lost their
    vulnerability. Swollen with pride at their new ability, the Shadow Pack
    joined forces with the hobgoblins of the wood and attacked the town of
    Olfden. Turned back after a savage battle known as the Night of Silver
    Blood, the werewolves sought to regroup and prepare a new assault, but on
    the night of the next new moon they discovered a fatal flaw in their
    blasphemous rite. Tied now more than ever to the lunar cycle, most of the
    silverblood werewolves wasted away and died when the moon darkened. Even
    those few that survived are greatly weakened when each new moon comes,
    though the surge of power when the moon waxes full still earns them great
    respect, and many have found positions of leadership among the werewolves of
    the wood.
  - >-
    Though the Night of Silver Blood was a failure, many hobgoblins and
    werewolves within the Arthfell Forest believe it is proof that major towns
    and even small cities could be totally ravaged by a somewhat larger,
    better-prepared force spearheaded by silverblood werewolves. Some groups of
    silverblood werewolves continue to maintain close connections to the local
    hobgoblins, forming war parties with them that raid farther and farther from
    the woods during the nights of the full moon. If one such band were to have
    a noteworthy success, its leaders might be able to gather a much larger
    force that could once again threaten Olfden or similarly sized settlements.
  - Creating a Silverblood Lycanthrope
  - >-
    "Silverblood lycanthrope" is an acquired lycanthrope template (Pathfinder
    RPG Bestiary 196) that can be added to any humanoid or lycanthrope. If added
    to a creature that already has the lycanthrope template, it replaces that
    template.
  - >-
    Challenge Rating: Same as base creature +2 (this includes the +1 increase
    for being a natural lycanthrope).
  - >-
    Size and Type: The creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature)
    gains the shapechanger subtype. The silverblood lycanthrope takes on the
    characteristics of the base animal. Its hybrid form is the same size as the
    base animal or the base creature, whichever is larger.
  - >-
    AC: In animal or hybrid form the silverblood lycanthrope gains a +4 natural
    armor bonus to AC.
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: A silverblood lycanthrope gains DR 1/- in animal or
    hybrid form. When the moon is at least half full, this increases to DR 3/-,
    and during the nights of the full moon the silverblood lycanthrope gains DR
    10/-.
  - >-
    Speed: Same as the base creature or base animal, depending on which form the
    lycanthrope is using. Hybrids use the base creature's speed.
  - >-
    Melee: A lycanthrope gains a bite attack in animal and hybrid forms
    according to the base animal.
  - >-
    Special Attacks: A silverblood lycanthrope retains all the special attacks,
    qualities, and abilities of the base creature. In animal or hybrid form it
    gains any special attacks associated with its natural weapons. A silverblood
    lycanthrope also gains low-light vision, scent, and the following abilities.
  - >-
    Change Shape (Su): All silverblood lycanthropes have three forms: a humanoid
    form, an animal form, and a hybrid form. Equipment does not meld with the
    new form when changing between humanoid and hybrid form, but does when
    changing between those forms and animal form. A silverblood lycanthrope can
    shift to any of its three forms as a move action. A slain silverblood
    lycanthrope reverts to its humanoid form, although it remains dead.
  - >-
    Curse of Lycanthropy (Su): A silverblood lycanthrope's bite attack in animal
    or hybrid form infects a humanoid target with lycanthropy (Fortitude DC 15
    negates). If the victim's size is not within one size category of the
    silverblood lycanthrope, this ability has no effect. Creatures that become
    lycanthropes as a result of this curse become standard afflicted
    lycanthropes rather than silverblood lycanthropes.
  - >-
    Lunar Sympathy (Su): A silverblood lycanthrope is filled with enthusiastic
    vigor when the light of the moon is strongest. When the moon is at least
    half full, a silverblood lycanthrope gains the benefit of bless whenever it
    is outdoors at night. On nights of the full moon, a silverblood lycanthrope
    gains the effect of heroism rather than bless, and retains the benefit
    indoors.
  - >-
    When the moon is less than half full, a silverblood lycanthrope becomes
    fatigued during the night. On nights of the new moon, a silverblood
    lycanthrope becomes fatigued
  - >-
    during the day and each night becomes exhausted and takes 1d4 points of
    Constitution damage. A successful DC 20 Fortitude save reduces the
    Constitution damage by half.
  - >-
    Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex): In any form, silverblood lycanthropes can
    communicate and empathize with animals of the same species as the base
    animal. They can use Diplomacy to alter such an animal's attitude, and when
    so doing gain a +4 racial bonus on the check. Due to their near-legendary
    reputation, silverblood lycanthropes gain a +8 racial bonus on Diplomacy and
    Intimidate checks against standard lycanthropes of the same base creature.
  - >-
    Ability Scores: +2 Wis, -2 Cha in all forms; +2 Str, +2 Con in hybrid and
    animal forms. Silverblood lycanthropes have enhanced senses but are not
    fully in control of their emotions and animalistic urges. In addition to
    these adjustments to the base creature's statistics, a silverblood
    lycanthrope's ability scores change when she assumes animal or hybrid form.
    In human form, the silverblood lycanthrope's ability scores are unchanged
    from the base creature's form. In animal and hybrid forms, the silverblood
    lycanthrope's ability scores are the same as the base creature's or the base
    animal's, whichever ability score is higher.
