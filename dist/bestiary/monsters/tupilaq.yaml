SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Scrimshaw Magic (Sp)
    description: >-
      When a tupilaq is created, its creator can inscribe a single spell he
      knows (as long as that spell is no higher than 2nd level and requires no
      material components) into the tupilaq as a complex scrimshaw design. The
      tupilaq gains the ability to use that spell as a spell-like ability (CL
      7th) three times per day. The tupilaq's creator can inscribe a new spell
      onto the tupilaq if he wishes, replacing the previous scrimshaw.
      Inscribing a new scrimshaw requires 24 hours of work and an expenditure of
      500 gp in materials. The tupilaq presented here utilizes invisibility in
      this manner. Erase can destroy a tupilaq's scrimshaw if it fails a
      Fortitude save against the spell. If a tupilaq's scrimshaw is removed in
      this manner, it loses access to the spell as a spell-like ability, and
      seeks out its creator to attack and kill him. The tupilaq's creator
      becomes the target of the tupilaq's seek target ability in this case. If a
      tupilaq's creator is already dead, the tupilaq instead seeks out the
      nearest living creature and attacks this new target on sight, continuing
      this spree of murder until it is itself destroyed.
  - name: Seek Target (Su)
    description: >-
      A tupilaq's creator can place a drop of blood, lock of hair, or other
      portion of a creature's body in the tupilaq's maw as a standard action.
      From that point on, the tupilaq constantly knows what direction that
      creature is located in, and gains a +20 insight bonus on all Perception
      checks made to locate the creature. A new target cannot be assigned to a
      tupilaq in this manner until its previous target is dead.
  - name: Shearing Jaws (Ex)
    description: >-
      All tupilaqs are crafted with oversized jaws capable of tearing and
      pulling. A tupilaq applies twice its Strength modifier to damage with a
      successful bite attack and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. A
      tupilaq is treated as Large for all checks made to move a grappled
      opponent.
Description:
  - >-
    Tupilaqs are small constructs crafted out of whale bones and whale teeth for
    the sole purpose of murdering the creator's enemies. A tupilaq's appearance
    can vary based on its construction, but all have prominent jaws and a small
    body with hands and feet fit for swimming. A tupilaq usually stands 3 feet
    tall and weighs only 30 pounds.
  - >-
    Tupilaqs must be created in secrecy-if any other person discovers the
    tupilaq is being created, the attempt to build the construct immediately
    fails. As part of its creation, the creator invites or lures a host spirit
    to possess the tupilaq. Most often, the animus of a tupilaq is that of a
    dead child or other small humanoid, and the parity of size between the new
    vessel and the spirit's previous body is what gives the creature a speed and
    agility on land and in water that is atypical for most constructs. This
    trapped spirit is also what makes a tupilaq so savage and murderous.
  - Construction
  - >-
    A tupilaq is built from 30 pounds of whale bones, bound together with sinew
    worth 750 gp. When the creature's creation is complete, the sinew falls away
    and the bones fuse together to create the creature.
