Description_Visual: >-
  Armored in the ceremonial garb of some grim knight, this figure stands
  unnaturally still, though the intricate metalwork patterns of its sculpted
  mantle writhe and shift as if alive. Claws the length of longswords extend
  from its armored fingers in razor-sharp fans, and no head or helm rests upon
  its ironclad shoulders. Instead, there hovers only a plain mask, an unnatural
  facade devoid of all empathy, emotion, or mercy.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Boundless Reach (Su)
    description: >-
      A deimavigga's claws slice through reality, allowing it to make melee
      attacks against any creature it is aware of-typically meaning creatures
      within 100 feet. The devil still only threatens the 10-foot area around it
      and it cannot make attacks of opportunity against creatures farther away.
      This ability can span vast distances, allowing a deimavigga making use of
      divination magic to detect distant creatures and attack foes separated by
      miles or even planes. Spells like forbiddance, which prevent planar
      travel, also protect against a deimavigga's claws. The spell dimensional
      anchor also prevents a deimavigga from using this ability for the duration
      of that spell. An attacked creature can retaliate that round, striking at
      the devil's claws with weapons or spells as if its entire body were
      present, but cannot grapple or otherwise prevent the claws from vanishing
      out of reach at the end of the round.
  - name: Evangelization (Su)
    description: >-
      The words of deimaviggas are poison to the mind. Every round a deimavigga
      speaks (a free action), all non-devils with an Intelligence score of 3 or
      higher within 30 feet must make a DC 28 Will save or become vulnerable to
      its blasphemous discourse. The DC of this Will save increases by +1 for
      each consecutive round a creature has listened to the same deimavigga
      speak. Creatures must be listening to a deimavigga to be affected by its
      oration. Deafened creatures and those in combat-either with the deimavigga
      or other creatures-are not considered to be listening. Victims cannot
      simply declare they are not listening without taking steps to impede their
      hearing. Upon failing this save, a victim can be affected by the heretical
      power of a deimavigga's words. The devil may use its speech to affect a
      listener in ways that mimic any of the following spells: calm emotions (DC
      21), charm monster (DC 23), command (DC 20), confusion (DC 23), crushing
      despair (DC 23), deep slumber (DC 22), enthrall (DC 21), modify memory (DC
      23), rage (DC 22), or suggestion (DC 22). Victims still receive saving
      throws against these spell effects, but if they fail their saves they are
      not aware the devil is working its power upon them. A deimavigga can
      affect multiple victims with different spell effects in the same round. A
      creature that makes its save against this ability is immune to that
      particular devil's evangelization for the next 24 hours. This is a sonic
      mind-affecting effect. The base save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Indomitable Oration (Su)
    description: >-
      A deimavigga's speech is always perfectly clear and cannot be silenced or
      warped. In areas of incredible noise, through water or airless voids, even
      in areas of magical silence, these devil's voices can still be heard
      normally. All beings understand deimaviggas, as if these devils constantly
      spoke in all tongues at once.
  - name: Malleable Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A deimavigga has complete control over its physical form, and if
      transformed into another shape against its will, it can revert to its own
      form as a free action.
  - name: Ohrwurm (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, three times per day, a deimavigga can whisper a
      fundamental and terrifying multiversal truth to one creature within 5
      feet. The target must make a DC 28 Will save or have the devil's words
      take root in its psyche. Outsiders and elementals have a +2 bonus on their
      saves to resist this ability. Initially, the deimavigga's words seem to
      have no effect. Anytime the victim tries to rest, though, he must make an
      additional DC 28 Will save or be affected as per the spell nightmare (even
      if the victim doesn't technically sleep). After a night of suffering vivid
      dreams and wrestling with the devil's words, the victim must make yet
      another DC 28 Will save or have its alignment shift one step toward lawful
      evil. Only by unlearning what the deimavigga told it can a victim be free
      of this effect, requiring a spell such as miracle, modify memory, or wish.
  - name: Summon Devil (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day a deimavigga can attempt to summon 1d6 osyluths or 2d4
      barbazu with a 50% chance of success, or 1 gelugon with a 20% chance of
      success. This ability is the equivalent of an 8th-level spell.
  - name: Wisdom Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A deimavigga drains 1d6 points of Wisdom each time it hits with its claw
      attack. (A deimavigga does not heal any damage when it uses its Wisdom
      drain.)
Description:
  - >-
    Regal, fearsome, and unfeeling, deimaviggas seek to turn the faithful from
    their gods, using cold logic to proselytize the path of atheism, the freedom
    of the mortal spirit, and the order offered by Hell. Their slowly
    ever-shifting masks speak envenomed words and imply the hollow nature of
    their lies. Speaking out against all deities-except for Asmodeus, whom they
    subtly tout as a bringer of discipline even as they downplay his
    divinity-these deadly intellectuals know that those who turn from their
    deities are more likely to succumb to the temptations of their diabolical
    brethren. Rather than attempting to sway the souls of individual mortals,
    these cunning fiends take on the roles of prophets of reason, disguising
    themselves beneath layers of illusion to evangelize the virtues and freedoms
    of lives unshackled from demanding deities. Occasionally one might focus its
    arguments on a soul of particular piety, delighting in throwing deities'
    most devoted servants into endless crises of faith. Deimaviggas care little
    for what gods their depredations affect, disenfranchising the worshipers of
    the divine and the profane alike. In their natural shapes, deimaviggas stand
    7 feet tall and weigh a mere 120 pounds. When disguised, though, they
    typically take the forms of wise old men, priests who have "realized their
    folly," and even "angels" of truth. Habitat & Society Deimaviggas prefer to
    spend their time upon the Material Plane, swaying the weak and corruptible
    souls of mortals. There they seek out either vast mortal cities, where their
    heresy might reach many ears, or small communities where the isolated might
    fall to their blasphemous philosophizing. When in Hell, though, they linger
    in Caina, tormenting the souls of those trapped upon its lonely islands,
    developing and testing complicated and often confusing arguments. Preferring
    to operate alone, these poison-tongued devils rarely work with others of
    their kind, even though their status as greater devils affords them great
    control over their lesser brethren. They find their arguments benefit from
    simplicity, their endeavors complicated by even the most obedient minions.
    Pit fiends and infernal dukes sometimes utilize deimaviggas as spies and
    spreaders of dissension and confusion, though even among devilkind these
    enigmatic fiends are considered strange and unnerving.
