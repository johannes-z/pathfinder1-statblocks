Description_Visual: >-
  This floating creature looks like an orc's animate, hollow skin. Its upper
  half is intact, but its lower half is in tatters.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Control Body (Su)
    description: >-
      A shredskin can wrap itself around a corpse (or a corporeal undead it
      controls using command undead). When wrapping a host body in this way, the
      shredskin gains Strength 14 or the host body's Strength, whichever is
      higher, but cannot use its grab or enshroud abilities which doing so.
      Attacks targeted at the shredskin deal half damage to it and half damage
      to the host body; area attacks deal normal damage to both the shredskin
      and its host. If the host is destroyed, the shredskin unwraps itself as a
      free action on its next turn. A typical Medium corpse has 15 hit points
      for this purpose, while a Small corpse has 10 hit points. A shredskin can
      only use this ability on a generally humanoid-shaped creature (two arms,
      one head, humanoid torso) of Medium or Small size.
  - name: Enshroud (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shredskin that successfully pins a creature can wrap itself around that
      target like a shirt. The target gains the pinned condition, but the
      shredskin has neither the grappled or pinned condition, and can move
      itself and the target as if it controlled the target's body. The shredskin
      deals constrict damage to the target on its turn each round (no combat
      maneuver check needed). Attacking the shredskin while it's using this
      ability damages both it and the target as described in the control body
      ability. The shredskin can release the target as a free action.
Description:
  - >-
    A shredskin is a wretched undead creature created either when a humanoid is
    skinned alive to be preserved as a trophy or otherwise killed in a
    terrifying way that leaves much of its upper half unharmed, such as being
    dissolved feet-first in acid. A fragment of the creature's soul animates the
    skin and seeks vengeance on those who created it, all the while trying to
    find a comfortable body for it to use as it did when it was alive. A
    shredskin may attack on its own and try to squeeze the life out of a living
    humanoid to use it as a body, or it might control another undead such as a
    skeleton, zombie, or ghoul, covering it like a morbid costume. In either
    case, it abandons its borrowed body if it finds a better one or the old one
    is destroyed. A shredskin is usually recognizable by creatures who knew it
    in life. Because it lacks a lower half, a shredskin is 3-4 feet tall and
    weighs only 10-15 pounds.
