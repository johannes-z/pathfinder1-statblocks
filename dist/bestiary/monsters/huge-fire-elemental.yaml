Description:
  - >-
    Fire elementals are quick, cruel creatures of living flame. They enjoy
    frightening beings weaker than themselves, and terrorizing any creature they
    can set on fire. A fire elemental cannot enter water or any other nonf
    lammable liquid. A body of water is an impassible barrier unless the fire
    elemental can step or jump over it or the water is covered with a flammable
    material (such as a layer of oil). Fire elementals vary in appearance-they
    usually manifest as coiling serpentine forms made of smoke and lame, but
    some fire elementals take on shapes more akin to humans, demons, or other
    monsters in order to increase the terror of their sudden appearance.
    Features on a fire elemental's body are made by darker bits of flame or
    patches of semi-stable smoke, ash, and cinders. Elemental Height Weight
