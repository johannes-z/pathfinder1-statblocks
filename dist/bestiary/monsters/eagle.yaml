Description:
  - >-
    Among the most majestic of raptors, these predatory birds pluck fish from
    streams and lakes, drop down on rodents and small mammals in alpine meadows,
    and have even been known to pull young mountain goats from the assumed
    safety of their cliffs.
  - >-
    These creatures, like all birds of prey, have powerful clawed talons and
    sharp, hooked beaks perfect for tearing flesh. Their enhanced eyesight
    allows them to spot prey from great distances, and they typically hunt in
    wide circling patterns high above the ground.
  - >-
    Eagles typically build their massive nests in the tops of tall trees or
    among the rocky crags of steep cliffs. During breeding season, an eagle lays
    two eggs, but only one chick normally survives, as the stronger of the two
    usually kills and eats the weaker.
  - >-
    Eagles generally weigh between 8 and 15 pounds, with a wingspan of up to 7
    feet, depending on the species.
