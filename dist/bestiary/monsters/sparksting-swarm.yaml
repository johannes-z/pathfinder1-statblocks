      A sparksting swarm can detect the tiny charges caused by electrical
      impulses of brain activity in living creatures within 60 feet. Creatures
      without an Intelligence score or creatures immune to mind-affecting
      effects cannot be detected using this ability.

    description: >-
      A sparksting swarm can increase its speed by 10 feet for 1d6 rounds. After
      using this ability, it must wait 1 minute before it can use it again.
Description:
  - >-
    Sparkstings are found in remote swamps and marshes and from a distance, when
    the electricity in a swarm flashes, are often mistaken for will-o-wisps.
    These electrical flashes are used not only for attracting a mate, but also
    for luring in prey. Sparkstings are insectivores, and hunt by flying into a
    swarm of insects and flailing about with their tentacles. Electrocuted
    insects adhere to the tentacles, which the sparksting then draws into its
    mouth, located under its body.
  - >-
    Sparkstings are asexual and reproduce by budding. Mating season for these
    creatures is every few months, and the number of spawn is controlled by the
    amount of readily available light. Newborn sparkstings have tiny tentacles
    and do not generate the electrical discharge adults do. The tentacles grow
    rapidly however, and within three months, the creature reaches adulthood.
    The typical lifespan of a sparksting is roughly 1 year. The sparksting has
    few natural predators: other sparkstings and a few larger insects seem to
    enjoy dining on these creatures.
  - >-
    A sparksting is a tiny creature about 2 inches across. It consists of a
    membranous, fleshy bag with the consistency of egg yolk. Beneath the main
    body of a sparksting hang its tentacles, a fibrous mass that flickers with
    electrical arcs.
  - >-
    Sparksting swarms cloud the air around any creature that disturbs them,
    attacking like angry bees.
  - >-
    Some spellcasters have begun experimenting with using sparkstings as
    alternate spell components for lightning bolt spells and in the construction
    of shock-based magic weapons.
