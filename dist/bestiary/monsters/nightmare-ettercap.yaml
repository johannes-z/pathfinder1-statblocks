Description_Visual: >-
  This strange humanoid looks like a gangly, distorted caricature of an
  ettercap, with spiderlike fingers and an enormous wicked grin.
Group: Nightmare Creature
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 4
IsTemplate: '1'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 1d2
      Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Spider Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy, except that an ettercap
      can only use this ability on spiders. An ettercap gains a +4 racial bonus
      on this check. Spiders are mindless, but this empathic communication
      imparts to them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing ettercaps to
      train giant spiders and use them as guardians.
  - name: Traps (Ex)
    description: >-
      An ettercap is particularly skilled at crafting cunning traps with its
      webs. Deadfalls, nooses, and spear traps are the most common traps
      ettercaps build with their webs. An ettercap doesn't require gold to build
      its traps, merely time. Rules for crafting traps can be found in Chapter
      13 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. Ettercap traps can be found on
      page 129 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary.
Description:
  - >-
    Nightmare creatures have an unnatural link to the most terrifying parts of
    the Dimension of Dreams, allowing them to turn others' dreams into
    nightmares and sow fear even in the waking world. Corrupted by their power,
    they become evil and use their abilities to torment their enemies and abuse
    creatures weaker than themselves. Eventually this dream connection corrupts
    the creature's appearance into a bizarre caricature of its original form. A
    nightmare creature uses its ability to control dreams to confuse and
    frighten its target with horrendous imagery- visions of failure or betrayal
    and horrific scenes of murder and death. A nightmare creature may even allow
    the target to think it is in control of the dream or has awakened from a
    nightmare, only to snatch away that hope and send its target into a downward
    spiral of misery and self-doubt. The most wicked nightmare creatures tend to
    become ghosts if slain, returning again and again to haunt their chosen
    victims.
  - CREATING A NIGHTMARE CREATURE
  - >-
    "Nightmare creature" is an acquired or inherited template that can be added
    to any creature with Intelligence and Charisma scores of at least 6
    (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most nightmare creatures were
    once aberrations, fey, humanoids, or outsiders. A nightmare creature uses
    the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here. If the
    base creature has 10 or more Hit Dice, it instead becomes a nightmare lord
    (see below).
  - 'CR: Same as the base creature +1.'
  - 'Alignment: Any evil.'
  - 'Type: If the base creature is an outsider, it gains the evil subtype.'
  - 'Senses: A nightmare creature gains darkvision 120 feet.'
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: A nightmare creature gains DR 5/ good or silver and the
    following defensive abilities.
  - >-
    Feign Death (Ex): Whenever a nightmare creature is unconscious, it appears
    dead. A conscious nightmare creature can also make itself appear dead as an
    immediate action. Any creature that physically interacts with a nightmare
    creature feigning death must succeed at a Heal check or Will saving throw
    (DC 10 + 1/2 the nightmare creature's Hit Dice + the nightmare creature's
    Intelligence or Charisma modifier, whichever is higher) to recognize it is
    actually alive.
  - >-
    Illusion Resistance (Ex): A nightmare creature automatically disbelieves
    illusions (no saving throw required) and has a +4 bonus on saving throws to
    resist illusion effects.
  - >-
    Regeneration 5 (Ex): Good-aligned weapons, silver weapons, and spells with
    the good descriptor cause a nightmare creature's regeneration to stop
    functioning for 1 round.
  - >-
    Speed: Same as the base creature. If the base creature does not have a fly
    speed, the nightmare creature gains a fly speed of 10 (perfect
    maneuverability) as a supernatural ability.
  - >-
    Special Attacks: A nightmare creature gains several special attacks. Save
    DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the nightmare creature's Hit Dice + its Charisma
    modifier unless otherwise noted. The nightmare creature's caster level is
    equal to its total Hit Dice (or the caster level of the base creature's
    spell-like abilities, whichever is higher).
  - >-
    Fear Aura (Su): All creatures within a 60-foot radius that see or hear a
    nightmare creature must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for as long as
    they are within the aura. Whether or not the save is successful, that
    creature cannot be affected again by the same nightmare creature's fear aura
    for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear affect.
  - >-
    Frightful Presence (Su): This ability activates when the nightmare creature
    charges, attacks during a surprise round, or succeeds at a DC 15 Intimidate
    or Perform check. Its frightful presence has a range of 30 feet.
  - >-
    Night Terrors (Su): Once a nightmare creature enters a target's mind with
    its dream or nightmare spell-like ability, it can attempt to control the
    target's dream. If the target fails a Will saving throw, it remains asleep
    and trapped in the dream world with the nightmare creature. Thereafter, the
    nightmare creature controls all aspects of the dream. Each hour that passes,
    the target can attempt another saving throw to try to awaken (it
    automatically awakens after 8 hours or if the nightmare creature releases
    it). The target takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage each hour it is trapped
    in the dream; if it takes any Charisma damage, it is fatigued and unable to
    regain arcane spells for the next 24 hours. The target dies if this Charisma
    damage equals or exceeds its actual Charisma score.
  - >-
    Spell-Like Abilities: A nightmare creature gains the following spell-like
    abilities: Constant-protection from good; 3/day-detect thoughts, dream,
    nightmare, suggestion; 1/day-shadow walk.
  - 'Ability Scores: Dex +4, Int +2, Cha +4.'
  - >-
    Skills: A nightmare creature gains a +4 racial bonus on Intimidate and
    Stealth checks.
  - NIGHTMARE LORDS
  - >-
    Nightmare lords are especially powerful nightmare creatures who live in the
    Dimension of Dreams. They rule over lesser nightmare creatures in bizarre
    puppet courts staffed by the maddened and soul-shriveled husks of kidnapped
    dreamers. They have all the abilities of nightmare creatures, plus the
  - >-
    following. Special Attacks: A nightmare lord gains several special attacks.
    Dream Slave (Su): Instead of killing a target with its night terror ability,
    a nightmare lord may instead enslave it with a permanent dominate monster
    effect. The enslaved creature is healed of all Charisma
  - >-
    damage taken from night terrors. Nightmare Magic (Su): The nightmare lord
    gains a +4 bonus to the DCs of its spells and spell-like
  - >-
    abilities of the phantasm and shadow subschools. Spell-Like Abilities: A
    nightmare lord gains the following spell-like abilities: 3/day—deep slumber,
    invisibility, plane shift (from the Material Plane to the Dimension of
    Dreams or back again), shadow walk; 1/day—feeblemind, modify memory, shadow
    conjuration, shadow evocation. Ability Scores: Dex +2, Int +2, Cha +2.
