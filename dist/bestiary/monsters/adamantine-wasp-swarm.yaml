      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The adamantine wasp is a flying construct capable of bringing down the most
    powerful of opponents with its deadly sting.
  - >-
    Adamantine wasps are constructed by spellcasters and used to guard or patrol
    areas the creator wishes to keep "off limits." From a distance, they
    resemble 1-foot long silver wasps, and some spellcasters further enhance
    this ruse by constructing fake nests nearby to detract would-be trespassers.
  - >-
    An adamantine wasp is 1-foot long and looks like its namesake only made out
    of metal. Its body is segmented like a normal wasp (head, thorax, and
    abdomen) and has carefully and delicately been fitted together to form the
    wasp. A wicked-looking adamantine stinger protrudes from its abdomen. Its
    wings are formed of paper-thin adamantine, specially treated during the
    construction process.
  - >-
    Adamantine wasps, being constructs, are non-intelligent and are programmed
    to carry out simple tasks such as "guard this room" or "attack any who enter
    here." When following their commands, adamantine wasps fight until
    destroyed. A swarm attacks by stinging its foes and injecting its
    blood-freezing poison.
