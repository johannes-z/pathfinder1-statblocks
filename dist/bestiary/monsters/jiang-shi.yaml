Description:
  - >-
    Jiang-shis (often known as "hopping vampires") are undead humanoid creatures
    that feed on the exhaled life energy of the living. A jiang-shi's appearance
    is based on the state of the creature's corpse at the time of its
    reanimation. Regardless of the state of decay, most jiang-shis wear clothing
    or armor that is at least one generation out of style. Additionally, each
    has a short parchment prayer scroll affixed to its brow by stitches;
    originally intended to protect the body from restless spirits, this scroll
    grants a
  - >-
    jiang-shi immunity to magical effects unleashed by items like scrolls and
    wands.
  - >-
    A jiang-shi is created when a restless spirit does not leave its corpse at
    the time of death, and is instead allowed to fester and putrefy within. At
    some point during the body's decomposition, the thing rises in its grotesque
    form and seeks living creatures to feed upon.
  - CREATING A JIANG-SHI
  - >-
    "Jiang-shi" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature
    with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most
    jiang-shis were once humans, but any creature that undergoes specific rites
    can acquire the template. A jiang-shi uses the base creature's stats and
    abilities except as noted here.
  - 'CR: Same as the base creature +2.'
  - 'Alignment: Any evil.'
  - >-
    Type: The creature's type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate
    class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.
  - >-
    Senses: A jiang-shi vampire gains darkvision 60 feet. It also gains the
    ability to sense the breathing of living creatures-a jiang-shi has
    blindsight to a range of 60 feet against creatures that breathe. A creature
    may hold its breath to prevent a jiang-shi from noticing it in this manner.
  - 'Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +2.'
  - >-
    Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected.
    As undead, jiang-shis use their Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit
    points (instead of Constitution).
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: A jiang-shi gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/magic
    and slashing, and resistance to cold 20, in addition to all of the defensive
    abilities granted by the undead type. A jiang-shi also gains fast healing 5.
    In addition, all jiang-shis gain the following defensive ability.
  - >-
    Prayer Scroll (Su): The scroll attached to the brow of a jiang-shi grants
    immunity to any effects generated from spell-completion or spell-trigger
    magic items, such as scrolls and wands. Such magical effects treat the
    jiang-shi as if it had unbeatable spell resistance. A jiang-shiâ€˜s prayer
    scroll can be removed with a successful steal combat maneuver (Advanced
    Player's Guide 322), which immediately ends the jiang-shi's immunity to
    these effects. If a jiang-shi's prayer scroll is destroyed (a standard
    action), the vampire also loses its fast healing ability. A jiang-shi may
    create a replacement prayer scroll by using any strip of parchment and a
    writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work.
  - >-
    Weaknesses: Jiang-shis recoil from mirrors or the sound of handbells rung
    within 10 feet of them. Cooked rice, which to jiang-shis mocks the
    fundamental fact that they no longer eat food, shames them into recoiling as
    well. These things don't harm a jiang-shi vampire-they merely keep
  - >-
    it at bay for a period of time. A recoiling jiang-shi vampire must stay at
    least 5 feet away from the object of its revulsion, and cannot touch or make
    melee attacks against a creature brandishing the object during that round.
    Holding a jiang-shi vampire at bay takes a standard action. After being held
    at bay for 1 round, a jiang-shi vampire can attempt to overcome its
    revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 20
    Will save at the start of its turn.
  - >-
    Destroying a Jiang-Shi: If reduced to 0 hit points, a jiang-shi vampire
    crumbles to dust but is not destroyed. It reforms in 1 minute with 1 hit
    point in the same space, or the nearest unoccupied space. Scattering the
    dust before the jiang-shi reforms destroys it permanently, as does mixing
    rice into the dust with a dose of holy water. Jiang-shi vampires are also
    susceptible to wooden weapons carved from peach trees, as such weapons
    represent the unity of all elements and life to these creatures. A wooden
    weapon carved from a peach tree automatically bypasses a jiang-shi vampire's
    damage reduction. Additionally, any successful hit from such a weapon that
    reduces a jiang-shi to 0 hit points immediately destroys the creature.
    Although they normally retreat from daylight, jiang-shi vampires are not
    destroyed by sunlight like regular vampires and can move around during the
    day without harm.
  - >-
    Speed: A jiang-shi moves only by hopping. This mode of movement is somewhat
    less swift than regular movement, and thus a jiang-shi's base speed is
    reduced by 10 feet from the base creature's speed, to a minimum of 10 feet.
    This unusual mode of movement allows the jiang-shi to ignore the effects of
    difficult terrain on movement, and makes it impossible to trip. Other speeds
    (like fly or swim speeds) are not affected by this reduction.
  - >-
    Melee: A jiang-shi gains a bite attack and 2 claw attacks if the base
    creature didn't have them. Damage for the bite attack depends on the
    jiang-shi's size, but its claw attacks do damage as a creature two size
    categories larger. For a Medium jiang-shi, a bite attack deals 1d6 points of
    damage and a claw attack deals 1d8 points of damage. A jiang-shi's claws are
    even more dangerous than this, though-see the "brutal claws" special attack
    below. A jiang-shi's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
  - >-
    Special Attacks: A jiang-shi gains several special attacks. Save DCs are
    equal to 10 + 1/2 the jiang-shi's Hit Dice + the jiang-shi's Charisma
    modifier unless otherwise noted.
  - >-
    Brutal Claws (Ex): A jiang-shi's nails are brutally sharp and can extend and
    retract at will. They threaten a critical hit on a roll of 19-20 and grant
    the grab ability. A jiang-shi with monk levels gains this enhanced critical
    threat range and grab ability with its unarmed attacks, and uses its unarmed
    monk damage or its claw damage, whichever is higher, when making such
    attacks.
  - >-
    Drain Chi (Su): Instead of draining blood, a jiang-shi vampire drains "chi,"
    or life energy, from a victim's breath. When a jiang-shi makes a successful
    grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful
    check, including additional damage), the jiang-shi can attempt to drain chi
    by drinking the victim's breath. The victim can resist this attack by making
    a successful Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim gains 1 negative
    level and is staggered for 1d4 rounds.
  - >-
    Ability Scores: Str +4, Dex +6, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +2. As an undead
    creature, a jiang-shi has no Constitution score.
  - >-
    Feats: Jiang-shis gain Alertness, Dodge, Mobility, Skill Focus (Acrobatics),
    and Spring Attack as bonus feats.
  - >-
    Skills: Jiang-shis gain a +8 racial bonus on Acrobatics, Perception, and
    Stealth checks.
