  This small dwarf-sized bipedal lizard has mottled gray and brown flesh with a
  short dorsal fin that runs the length of its body, tapering off as it meets
  the tail. Its underbelly is yellow and its eyes are white. Its feet are webbed
  as are its tiny  "hands."

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blinding Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      By filling its mouth with muddy water, a muckdweller can fire a stream of
      muddy water in a 10-foot line. A creature hit must succeed on a DC 10
      Reflex save or be blinded for 1d2 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. A muckdweller can take a move action to refill its
      mouth with muddy water so it can use its spray again.
Description:
  - >-
    The muckdweller is a small, swamp-dwelling bipedal lizard that lives on a
    diet of carrion, fresh meat, plants, and insects. It has a long tail that
    allows it to swim rapidly through the water or maintain its balance when
    standing upright. Muckdwellers sometimes associate with lizardfolk.
  - >-
    Muckdwellers stand about 4 feet tall. They speak their own language of
    croaks and hisses, and a rare few speak Draconic.
  - >-
    The muckdweller attacks by squirting muddy water at its foes. When it
    successfully blinds an opponent, it darts in and bites with its sharp teeth.
