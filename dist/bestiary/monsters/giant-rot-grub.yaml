      A rot grub that is grappling a foe and chooses to damage the foe with an
      additional grapple check deals twice its normal bite damage (2d6+6 for
      most giant rot grubs), in addition to injecting an additional dose of
      poison with each successful check.

Description:
  - >-
    Rot grubs are foul, nauseating parasites that feed on flesh and use corpses
    as nests in which to grow. While a rot grub can derive nourishment from dead
    flesh, its true hunger is for the flesh of the living. Thankfully, rot grub
    swarms occur only rarely, as they require the infested carcass of a Huge or
    larger creature and many weeks to build up the numbers necessary to
    constitute a swarm.
  - >-
    In some cases, a rot grub continues to feed and grow, eventually reaching
    enormous size as a giant rot grub.
