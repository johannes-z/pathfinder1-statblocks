Description_Visual: >-
  This centaur-like creature is at least twice as long as a human and stands
  about 8 feet tall. Its lower body is that of a great golden lion and its upper
  body is a coal-black humanoid with glaring crimson eyes. Its mane-like hair is
  thick, long, and dark brown, and the creature wears it draped over its broad
  shoulders and down its massive back. Its mouth is lined with sharpened fangs
  and its arms end in large, powerful hands. Splatters of dried and caked blood
  can be seen in the creature's mane and fur.

Description:
  - >-
    The Blood Duke, Gorson, is a great lion-bodied humanoid that serves Great
    Mammon as 2nd general of his infernal army. Gorson leads 5 legions of barbed
    devils in service to his lord. Gorson is called "The Lion" for his ferocity
    in battle and his general appearance. He often takes the entrails of those
    he has slain and makes a necklace, wrapping it around his neck or entwining
    them in his bloody mane-like hair.
  - Gorson stands 8 feet tall and is 12 feet long. He weighs 1,200 pounds.
  - >-
    Gorson usually begins combat by leaping on a foe and rending it to pieces
    with his forepaws and rear claws. Those that survive this onslaught are
    subjected to a massive assault by his great battleaxe. Gorson attacks
    relentlessly and only stops when all foes are dead. Those that attempt to
    flee are run down and slaughtered.
