SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    description: >-
      A fungus weird is effectively invisible in its pool until it attacks. It
      takes a successful DC 20 Spot check to notice a fungus weird in its pool
      before it attacks. Fungus Pool A fungus weird's "pool" is not a pool at
      all, but an entanglement of leaves, branches, mosses, funguses, and
      plants. A typical pool covers a 20-foot radius, and a fungus weird (being
      bound to its pool) can never leave this area. A creature that enters a
      fungus weird's pool (on its own or with the aid of the fungus weird) is
      automatically entangled (as the entangle spell) until it escapes. An
      entangled creature can break free and move half its normal speed by using
      a full-round action to make a DC 15 Escape Artist check or a DC 19
      Strength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based and the Strength
      check includes a +4 racial bonus.
  - name: Sleep Spores (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, a fungus weird can release a
      puff of greenish-yellow spores in a 10-foot cone. These spores induce
      sleep (as the sleep spell) if the opponent fails a DC 15 Will save. Unlike
      the sleep spell, there is no HD limit or maximum HD affected. The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Reform (Ex)
    description: >-
      When reduced to 0 hit points or less, a fungus weird collapses back into
      its pool. Four rounds later, it reforms at full strength minus any damage
      taken from fire-based spells and effects.
Description:
  - >-
    Though this creature resembles other weirds, initial suggestions are that
    this creature is in fact not related to those creatures at all (since other
    weirds are extraplanar and this creature seems to be native to the Material
    Plane). The origin of the fungus weird is shrouded in mystery. Legends hint
    that this weird was created by an ancient race of druids for less than
    honorable purposes (the exact purpose is unknown).
  - >-
    A fungus weird's diet consists of flesh and blood (which there never seems
    to be a shortage of in the Underdark thanks to meddlesome adventurers).
    Though the creature isn't required to eat that often (and can actually go
    the entire winter months without requiring any food at all), when it does
    consume food, it ravenously devours it all, leaving nothing but a mass of
    bent and broken bones (and any other things, such as gear and equipment).
  - >-
    A fungus weird resembles a 10-foot long snake composed of various hues of
    plants, vines, mushrooms and other funguses. Two dark splotches function as
    eyes. A vine-like tongue flicks in and out of its mouth.
  - >-
    A fungus weird is an ambush and opportunity hunter, lying in wait in its
    pool until its prey comes within range. Once a potential target is close by,
    the fungus weird springs from its pool and attempts to bite and grab its
    target. A grabbed opponent is pulled into its pool where it is entangled. A
    creature that struggles, or any additional creatures assaulting the fungus
    weird are met with a spray of sleep spores.
