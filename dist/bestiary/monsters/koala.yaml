Description:
  - >-
    The koala's cute appearance belies the tree-climbing marsupial's aggressive
    nature. Koalas subsist solely on the leaves of the eucalyptus tree, which
    are all but inedible to most other mammals. Because of their highly
    selective diet, most koalas see little reason to stray from eucalyptus trees
    at all, and so spend most of their lives hanging onto branches or moving
    from crook to crook by swinging between boughs. When a koala walks (usually
    just to get from tree to tree), it does so on all fours.
  - >-
    A koala measures about 2-1/2 feet from tail to nose and can weigh up to 30
    pounds.
