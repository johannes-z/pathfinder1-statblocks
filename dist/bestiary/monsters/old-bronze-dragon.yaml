SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Electricity Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      An old or older bronze dragon has an aura of electricity. All creatures
      within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the start of the
      dragon's turn. An ancient dragon's aura is 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage
      increases to 2d6. A bronze dragon can suppress this aura at will.
  - name: Repulsion Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Instead of a line of electricity, a bronze dragon can breathe a cone of
      repulsion gas. Targets must make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing
      but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age
      category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.
  - name: Water Breathing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bronze dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and
      abilities underwater.
Description:
