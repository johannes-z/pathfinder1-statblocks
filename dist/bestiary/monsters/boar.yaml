Description:
  - >-
    Much more ill-tempered and dangerous than their domesticated kin, boars are
    omnivorous creatures common to temperate forests, although they are not
    unknown in tropical climes. Other variants exist as well, such as the
    particularly ugly warthogs that dwell in tropical plains and savannahs.
    Boars are often hunted for their flesh, which is considered delicious by
    most humanoids. Those who hunt boars often do so with a special spear fitted
    with a cross beam to prevent an impaled boar from pushing forward along the
    spear shaft to gore its tormentor.
  - >-
    The boar's stubborn nature and habit of eating even bones makes it well
    suited as a pet for certain folk. Many thieves' guilds keep boars for the
    disposal of bodies, while orc tribes let them run loose in their lairs,
    where they do a relatively good job at keeping these warrens clean of
    refuse.
  - A boar is four feet long and weighs 200 pounds.
