Description:
  - >-
    In addition to being a sailor of consummate ability and a cunning
    strategist, a successful captain of a pirate ship must possess a number of
    skills that enable him to lead a crew of independent-minded ruffians who
    don't relish taking anyone's orders. A judicious application of diplomacy,
    intimidation, charm, and inducement is necessary to maintain one's position
    as captain, and while most pirate captains are elected by their crews, they
    are just as easily unelected, either by vote or a well-placed blade.
  - >-
    Pirate captains are typically both fighters and rogues, as the occupation
    necessitates a strong arm as well as a firm grasp over various skills.
    Clerics also make for potent leaders, their ability to confront various
    perils emboldened by their comprehension of divine powers as well as magical
    anomalies.
