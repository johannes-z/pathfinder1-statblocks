Description_Visual: >-
  This creature has a long, straight beak-fully half the length of its body-that
  tapers to a fine point. Wicked claws sprout from its wings.  Its eyes are
  whitish-pink and its feathers are a mixture of blues, reds, yellows, and
  greens.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Birdsong (Su)
    description: >-
      An ahlinni can freely communicate with any bird or bird-like creature
      (such as rocs, giant eagles, and giant owls), perfectly mimicking any bird
      song or vocalization. Communication with non-intelligent bird creatures is
      on an empathic level, and can only take place if the bird is within 100
      feet of the ahlinni. In these cases, this ability functions as speak with
      animals (caster level 4th). This ability is always active, but can be
      negated. The ahlinni can restart it as a free action on its next turn.
  - name: Impale (Ex)
    description: >-
      When an ahlinni charges a foe, it deals double damage on a successful
      strike with its bite attack.
Description:
  - >-
    The ahlinni, or cackle bird, is a flightless bird that dwells in the
    treetops of thick forests or canopies of thick marsh trees. It is covered in
    greenish feathers of varying hues, and when it lies motionless in its leafy
    surroundings it is nearly invisible.
  - >-
    Cackle birds live in small flocks, and their laughter-like calls can be
    heard for great distances through the woods they call home. They have an
    affinity for small sparkly objects, and often line their nests with bits of
    colored glass or gemstones in order to attract a mate.
  - >-
    An ahlinni attacks first with its breath weapon and, being cowardly, usually
    flees the encounter if possible. When on the offensive, an ahlinni leaps
    from its treetop and attempts to impale its opponent on its beak.
