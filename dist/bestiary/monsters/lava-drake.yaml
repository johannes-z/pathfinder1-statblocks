SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Magma Shake (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a lava drake exits from being submerged in molten rock (either
      magma or lava), on the next round as a full-round action, it can shake its
      body, flicking a fine spray of scalding molten rock in every direction.
      All creatures within a 30-foot radius of the lava drake take 5d6 points of
      fire damage from the shower of scalding rock; a successful DC 18 Reflex
      save halves the damage. Performing a magma shake clears the drake's scales
      of all excess molten rock and it must resubmerge itself in order to use
      this attack again. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Pyroclastic Vomit (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a lava drake can vomit forth a ball of molten rock
      that explodes upon striking a target, showering the target and adjacent
      creatures in magma. This attack has a range of 100 feet, and deals 6d6
      points of fire damage (Reflex DC 19 half) to the primary target and 3d6
      points of fire damage to any creatures within 20 feet of the primary
      target. The magma continues to burn for 1d3 rounds, dealing an additional
      3d6 points of fire damage per round to the primary target and 1d6 points
      of fire damage per round to any secondary targets. After the magma cools,
      it crumbles to dust. Once a lava drake has used its pyroclastic vomit, it
      cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Speed Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a swift action, a lava drake can draw on its
      draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that allows it to take
      an addition move action that round.
Description:
  - >-
    The deviant and destructive cousins of primal magma dragons, lava drakes
    rise from smoldering volcanic crevasses to terrorize and devour those
    creatures weaker than themselves. While far less intelligent that their
    draconic kin, they are equally arrogant and seek out the adoration of
    humanoids. They can and often do submerge themselves in molten rock,
    burrowing through the lava to sneak up on prey, or to provide a dramatic
    display of power to those who worship them. Thick, black-crusted scales
    cover a lava drake's body. Stockier than other drakes, adults can grow up to
    18 feet in length and weigh over 3,000 pounds.
