SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Damage Reduction (Ex)
    description: >-
      A lukwata's damage reduction is penetrated only by nonmagical weapons
      (temporary magical weapons, such as those created by the spell magic
      weapon and similar effects, count as magical weapons).
  - name: Digest Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      A magic item swallowed by a lukwata must make a DC 22 Fortitude save after
      an hour or become permanently nonmagical. Artifacts are immune to this
      effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Dispelling Bite (Su)
    description: >-
      When a lukwata scores a critical hit with its bite, the victim is affected
      as if targeted by a greater dispel magic spell. The caster level for this
      effect is equal to the lukwata's Hit Dice (CL 14th for most lukwatas).
  - name: Eldritch Encrustation (Su)
    description: >-
      Crystalline growths along the lukwata's digestive tract contain large
      deposits of magical energy. These nodes are responsible for the magical
      feedback that surrounds each lukwata, granting it its spell resistance,
      damage reduction, dispelling bite, and digest magic abilities. Dispel
      magic cast on a lukwata can negate these powers for 1 minute-the CL of the
      effect is treated as the lukwata's Hit Dice (CL 11th for most lukwatas).
Description:
  - >-
    Lukwatas slip through dark tropical waters, preying upon all who dare enter
    their deep jungle rivers and pools, including beasts typically considered
    apex predators. While scholars say the beasts favor the dark, light doesn't
    deter them in their relentless pursuit of prey. Their long, flat bodies are
    reminiscent of those of dolphins or large fish, but lukwatas' heads are
    distinctively eel-like. A lukwata's unusual ability to disrupt magical
    effects rises from the strange crystalline growths that line its throat and
    stomach-crystals that allow the lukwata to gain nutrients from magical items
    as efficiently as from flesh and blood. These same growths give the lukwata
    an unusually strong resistance to all manner of magic attacks.
  - >-
    Lukwatas hate crocodiles, their chief predatory rivals, and attack them on
    sight, even if the lukwata has recently fed. Most crocodilians are not large
    enough to pose a significant threat; however, some accounts exist of
    lukwatas and dire crocodiles crossing paths. These fights are renowned for
    inf licting great destruction, with the embattled creatures smashing to bits
    piers, flotillas, and even dams in their fury.
  - A lukwata is 20 feet long and weighs 4,000 pounds.
