SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hands of War (Su)
    description: >-
      Any weapon a hekatonkheires wields gains a +3 enhancement bonus while the
      titan holds it. A hekatonkheires's attacks are treated as epic and evil
      for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. In addition, a
      hekatonkheires's multitude of arms allows it to effectively block attacks,
      granting it a +8 armor bonus to its AC. Hundred-Handed
  - name: Whirlwind (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hekatonkheires carries several dozen weapons of various types in its
      hundred hands, but when it attacks in melee, you don't have to resolve
      each of these as a separate attack. Instead, when the titan attacks with
      its weapons, it rolls its attacks normally (either one attack for a
      standard action, or four as a full-round action) and hits every creature
      in its reach each time an attack roll exceeds that creature's AC. If any
      such attack roll results in a possible critical hit, the critical is
      applied to one creature of the hekatonkheires's choosing. The
      hekatonkheires can choose to deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing
      damage as a free action on each separate hit.
  - name: Planar Leap (Su)
    description: >-
      A hekatonkheires traverses the planes by physically smashing through
      planar boundaries and crashing devastatingly into the target plane itself.
      Once per year as a full-round action, a hekatonkheires can, as part of a
      jump, plane shift to any other plane (as per the spell of the same name).
      It can only bring itself and its gear when it travels in this manner. When
      the hekatonkheires reaches its destination plane, it falls from the sky
      and crashes to the ground, creating a devastating explosion of thunder and
      fire. Any creature within 300 feet of the point where the hekatonkheires
      lands (including the titan itself ) takes 20d6 points of bludgeoning
      damage and 20d6 points of sonic damage (Reflex DC 38 half ). The save DC
      is Constitution-based.
  - name: Stunning Slam (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a hekatonkheires may forgo any weapon attacks to
      make a single slam attack against any creature in reach. If it hits, the
      target takes damage and must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude save to avoid
      being stunned for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Horrifying abominations shunned by the gods immediately upon their creation,
    the hekatonkheires are perhaps the most powerful and devastating race of
    titans in existence. When the titans-envious of the gods' divine strength-
    rebelled against the deities, the hekatonkheires were among the first to
    pick up arms, weary of the scorn their own creators felt for them. The
    betrayal of the Elysian titans led to the hekatonkheires' swift capture by
    the gods, who found the hekatonkheires' power to be so immense that they
    were not banished to the Abyss with their Thanatotic brethren. Instead, the
    gods cast the hekatonkheires into the furthest reaches of the multiverse
    they could find. There, the hekatonkheires drifted in expanses of
    nothingness for unknown eons, and the madness wrought upon them by isolation
    destroyed their memories. Yet from their madness these shattered
    monstrosities spawned progeny to
  - >-
    replace them in their pursuit to destroy, and some of these monstrous
    offspring discovered ways to break through planar boundaries and wander the
    multiverse freely.
  - >-
    The gods initially created only three hekatonkheires, seeking to make the
    ultimate warriors in order to guard the gates to the Abyss. These three
    ancient titans still drift in the unknown expanses between planes-the
    hekatonkheires that now walk the worlds are their lesser spawn. But these
    so-called "lesser" titans remain almost unimaginably powerful themselves.
    They have no knowledge of why their forgotten ancestors were originally
    banished, and so they wander in search of answers, all the while destroying
    entire worlds. They are warped engines of mayhem, their existence based
    wholly on the devastation of life and anything that might remind them of
    their age-old war against the gods, having inherited only the haunting
    ghosts of such memories from their ancestors.
  - >-
    Those hekatonkheires who have emerged back into the multiverse have done so
    in different realms, and to date, no record of any two of these spawn
    meeting one another exists. It is fortunate that only one hekatonkheires is
    encountered on a world at any given time, as even scholars cannot fathom the
    power that would arise out of two or more of the titans' collective
    strength. They traverse the planes alone, caring not for allies of any sort
    until they can remember what their purpose was when they were born eons ago.
  - >-
    Though hekatonkheires are as intelligent as the rest of their titan
    relatives, they wander with such destructive and seemingly mindless
    intentions that they spare no time in communicating with other creatures,
    especially those that would beg for mercy. The hekatonkheires were created
    to destroy, and so that is all they desire to do; the crushing blows of
    their fists and the goring slashes of their weapons speak for themselves.
    They serve no master, and halt their otherwise endless rampage only if
    called by their true names, which few-if any-mortals know. Those that do
    know these names speak them only in whispers, for their mere utterance seems
    to carry with it immeasurable power.
  - >-
    A hekatonkheires can only be called via mighty spells such as gate if a
    conjurer knows the plane the titan is currently on, and only if the conjurer
    knows the true name of the hekatonkheires it is seeking to call. Only the
    mad or depraved would dare such a feat, however, as the might of one of
    these unique goliaths is so massive that the being cannot be controlled, and
    even if it is banished back to the realm from whence it came,
  - >-
    it is never long before the hekatonkheires sets its sights on the world it
    visited so brief ly, if only to sate its lust for destroying it.
  - >-
    Each hekatonkheires has 50 heads and 100 arms so that one is never caught
    off guard. The stones that it hurls with its 100 hands are as big as
    boulders, and those who have seen a hekatonkheires hurl such rocks and lived
    to tell the tale have said that it is as though an entire mountain is
    falling from the sky. In addition to their unworldly strength,
    hekatonkheires are known for their awesome control over the powers of
    lightning and thunder, and an individual hekatonkheires's arrival is often
    prefaced by an abrupt and tumultuous storm in the area. Like all titans,
    hekatonkheires are immortal, and do not die unless they are slain.
  - A hekatonkheires is 50 feet tall and weighs 25 tons.
