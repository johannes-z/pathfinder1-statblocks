Description:
  - >-
    The ratling is a hideous amalgamation of rat and human: a long-haired rodent
    with handlike front paws and a face reminiscent of the face of a leering old
    man. Within the ratling's humanoid mouth are long, yellow incisors more akin
    to those one might find in the jaws of a rat. Ratlings are carnivores. While
    they can subsist on grubs, other rodents, and carrion, they prefer living
    food and fresh blood, particularly that of humanoid children and elderly
    folk. They also have a sense for magic, and lurk around temples and
    universities searching for scraps of knowledge or overlooked books and
    scrolls to steal. Ratlings associate with common rats and even mate with
    them, producing anything from large, aggressive rats (often with vestigial
    humanlike features or other sickening deformities) to infant ratlings to
    deformed rats. In a mixed litter, the infant ratling usually kills and eats
    its siblings, then arranges the dismembered and disemboweled corpses in
    semi-occult patterns. Elder ratlings often gain the advanced simple template
    or levels in cleric, oracle, witch, or wizard (a rare few gain rogue levels,
    especially if they associate with a thieves' guild or wererats). These
    elders often become leaders of their own kind, creating cabals organized
    like the universities they frequently inhabit. If the ratling can gain a
    familiar, it usually chooses a rat-an association that often brings with it
    more than mere supernatural companionship. Ratlings can never select another
    ratling as a familiar. A chaotic evil spellcaster can gain a ratling as a
    familiar at 7th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat. A ratling
    familiar gains commune once per week as a spell-like ability, which it can
    use on its master's behalf. The master usually allows the familiar to drink
    her blood at least once per week. A ratling measures just over 2 feet long
    (although half that length is its long, ratty tail) and weighs 10 pounds.
