Description_Visual: >-
  A skeletal carcass pulls itself from the ground, its body formed as much from
  earth and soil as from bones and rotting flesh.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Broken Ground (Su)
    description: >-
      The ground in a 30-foot radius around a guecubu ripples and shudders
      unnaturally. This transforms the area surrounding a guecubu into difficult
      terrain. A guecubu can move through this area with no penalty. Consecrated
      ground cannot be affected by this ability, nor can any area warded by a
      magic circle against chaos or a magic circle against evil.
  - name: Misfortune (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature struck by a guecubu must make a DC 20 Will save or become
      permanently cursed with misfortune. The victim of this curse takes a -4
      penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, and any
      critical threat against the victim automatically confirms. If a guecubu
      hits a creature already suffering from this curse, the victim must make a
      DC 20 Will save or be staggered for 1 round. This is a curse effect. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Often when a particularly evil criminal is executed, suspicious folk fear
    that the criminal's remains might rise from death to continue to plague the
    living. To combat this possibility, many mobs or rural justices take to the
    practice of burning the bodies, grinding the bones, and scattering the
    remains in the wild. Yet in the case of particularly evil criminals, even
    these steps are in vain, for their will is enough to reassemble a body from
    earth, stone, roots, and plants drawn from the region into which the remains
    were scattered. Such an undead horror rises as a guecubu, a harbinger of
    misfortune and vengeance from beyond the grave.
  - >-
    A newly formed guecubu remembers well how its enemies treated it, and while
    the undead creature retains none of its previous life's talents, its undead
    state grants it many new tools to seek revenge with. Typically, a guecubu
    does not limit its revenge to those directly involved with its
    execution-entire villages and towns fall victim to its rage. The guecubu's
    tactics tend toward the subtle, and it seeks to spread misfortune and death
    on a person-by-person basis, slaying its enemies one at a time until they
    flee, so that all that remains is a ghost town.
  - A guecubu is 6 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.
