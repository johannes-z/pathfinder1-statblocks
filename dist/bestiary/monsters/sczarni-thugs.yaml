Description:
  - >-
    The notorious ruffians known as the Sczarni constantly prowl the civilized
    areas of Varisia in search of easily bamboozled merchants, travelers, and
    aristocrats to prey upon. Countless Sczarni thugs operate throughout
    Magnimar, their sheer quantity spawning numerous gangs that each possesses
    its own illicit specialty as well as a clearly defined turf. Indisputably,
    the most powerful Sczarni gang in the city is the Gallowed, who operate from
    a caravan of wagons perched directly below Lord-Mayor Grobaras's home,
    Defiant's Garden. The Gallowed sports a large number of thugs and
    leg-breakers, as well as its infamous Fish Tank, a 4-foot-tall glass
    aquarium hidden in one of the caravan's wagons and filled with swamp
    barracuda used to coax information out of unwilling victims.
  - >-
    As a rule, Sczarni thugs are not needlessly violent, and prefer to
    concentrate their efforts on crimes that will make them the most money
    rather than spill the most blood. Sczarni tend toward swindles and illicit
    trade instead of rape or murder, leaving such brutal acts of violence to
    sociopaths and unscrupulous thieves' guilds.
  - >-
    Though the Gallowed make up the most powerful Sczarni gang in Magnimar, they
    are far from alone, and numerous other small families constantly vie for
    turf and wealth throughout the City of Monuments.
  - >-
    The Tower Girls specialize in robbery as well as extortion, and are often
    hired by quarreling nobles to help shame or blackmail rivals with evidence
    of infidelity, bastard children, or other secret failures. When not ruining
    lives, the Tower Girls display their impressive acrobatics onstage in the
    various playhouses and nightclubs of Lowcleft.
  - >-
    Shunned even by other Sczarni gangs, the Creepers seed the streets with
    drugs and other illicit substances. They concoct many of the drugs in their
    base near Underbridge, using their runners to keep the whole city stocked
    with a handful of vices at any time.
