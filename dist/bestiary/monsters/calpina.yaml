  Pearlescent, membranous wings hold this small insectile woman aloft in the

  tongue resembles a proboscis.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ego Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A calpina feeds on her target's ego at the end of its turn if she grapples
      a foe, dealing 1d4 points of Charisma damage. Once a calpina has dealt
      Charisma damage equal to her Constitution score, she is fully sated and
      cannot use this ability again for 24 hours.
  - name: Fragrant Haze (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a calpina can release magical vapors that cause
      stupor and vertigo in creatures other than calpinas or their larvae. Each
      living creature within 20 feet must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be
      exhausted for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune
      to that calpina's fragrant haze for 24 hours. The DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Calpinas are strange, primordial fey whose bodies possesses a combination of
    insectile and humanoid features. An exoskeleton the color of dull brass
    encases a calpina's boneless form, and four pink wings that resemble those
    of a dragonf ly emerge from the center of her back. Each calpina has a group
    of sensitive feelers on her head, which she controls nearly as dexterously
    as a humanoid wiggles its fingers. She uses her feelers to detect slight
    alterations in the air currents as well as to latch on to her victims more
    tightly when feeding.
  - >-
    Calpinas view their victims as little more than sources of nutrition. They
    are, however, intensely curious creatures and may sometimes, albeit rarely,
    interact with other creatures without harmful intentions.
  - >-
    Calpinas are usually just over 3 feet tall, with a wingspan of 5 to 6 feet.
    Most weigh only 25 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Calpinas originate in the First World, where they thrive in the vast, lush
    expanses of eldritch forests and impossible mountains. They share their
    First World habitat with clusters of giant flowers and sentient plant
    creatures,
  - >-
    both of which they rely upon for sustenance. Thanks to their natural
    curiosity, quite a few calpinas cross to the Material Plane, following the
    beckoning lights, smells, and sounds that seep in through planar breaches.
  - >-
    Most calpinas' lives are more difficult on the Material Plane than on the
    First World, where the abundant greenery and free-f lowing magic makes
    finding suitable meals easy. With sentient plants being relatively rare on
    the Material Plane, calpinas that leave the First World adopt a new method
    of sating their unusual fey diets- feeding on the egos of non-plant
    creatures.
  - >-
    A calpina's tongue is actually a tough, razor-edged proboscis-like
    appendage, well suited for piercing a victim's flesh. When a calpina begins
    feeding, she wraps her wings tightly around her target's body to prevent it
    from escaping. Her supernatural venom draws in a victim's ego, which combine
    to form a sticky-sweet "psyche honey" that she extracts through the same
    proboscis.
  - >-
    The compound eyes of a calpina are usually a dull, dark red, but after
    feeding they glow brighter. A typical humanoid victim can provide sustenance
    to a single calpina for up to 2 weeks, but in the spring calpinas become
    particularly voracious and may feed daily to gather sufficient nutrients for
    egg production.
  - >-
    A calpina fertilizes her own eggs. Although calpinas do not need mates, some
    join together into colonies each year, forming tight-knit sisterhoods.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Calpinas make their nests in hollow, rotting trees or shallow caves in cliff
    sides at the lower altitudes of mountains. The nests are rather simple, with
    only leaves, twigs, and other natural materials added for cushioning,
    warmth, and camouf lage.
  - >-
    The social and territorial tendencies of calpinas change with the seasons.
    In early spring, calpinas become largely solitary and nomadic, wandering in
    search of appetizing prey. A few months later, when they lay their eggs,
    calpinas band together into colonies of their own kind for mutual protection
    of their young. They also become fiercely territorial and attempt to kill
    anyone they can't persuade to leave their territory. Once the eggs have
    hatched, though, calpinas welcome visitors, as their larvae require
    substantial quantities of food to grow. Small groups of calpinas called
    eclipses often work together to lure victims into ambushes, draining their
    egos to the last drop before leaving the comatose victims for the fey's
    mindless offspring to eat.
  - >-
    Calpinas feed primarily upon the animals inhabiting their forests. However,
    more charismatic victims provide larger and well-flavored egos, and for this
    reason, most calpinas prefer humanoid prey. Especially creative or willful
    sorts-artists, performers, politicians, and
  - >-
    especially half lings and gnomes-prove particularly irresistible to these
    fey. They may sometimes even capture an unfortunate soul and keep it for
    their amusement and nourishment for weeks before growing bored. Lucky
    captives are released alive, though weakened by starvation, and left hazed
    and covered in curious scars by the constant feeding on their egos. More
    often than not, a captured creature becomes food for the calpinas' larvae or
    for forest predators that take advantage of its disoriented state.
  - >-
    Calpinas may engage in conversation with intelligent creatures if approached
    cautiously. They vocalize in short chirps, habitually repeating the same
    word over and over again with different nuances. While they are capable of
    more complex communication, they quickly grow tired of prolonged or abstruse
    conversations and prefer to savor only a few ideas at a time. Even when they
    don't intend to feed on an individual, they like to provoke strong emotions
    and pry at deeply held beliefs. Topics that stir up passions influence the
    flavor of a victim's ego, and a calpina never knows at the beginning of a
    conversation whether she'll be hungry by the end.
  - >-
    When calpinas face an enemy too powerful to kill or chase away, they may
    offer useful advice about mountain passes or other local creatures, if only
    to encourage the intruder to move on. They are cautious by nature, and
    rarely initiate fights they don't believe they will win. Unless they are
    defending their young in the summer months, calpinas are quick to flee from
    a losing battle.
  - >-
    Calpinas are most active in the twilight hours, but they also hunt on
    moonlit nights, using magical lights to locate, attract, or distract prey so
    that they can approach close enough to launch an attack. They try to tire or
    disorient their victims before latching on to feed.
