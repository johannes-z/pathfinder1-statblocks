SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Electricity Sense (Ex)
    description: >-
      Shocker lizards automatically detect any electrical discharges within 100
      feet.
  - name: Shock (Su)
    description: >-
      Shocker lizards can deliver an electrical shock to a single opponent
      within 5 feet. This attack deals 1d8 points of nonlethal electricity
      damage to living opponents (Reflex DC 12 half ). This save DC is
      Constitution-based. Additionally, if two or more shocker lizards are
      within 20 feet of each other, they can work together to create a lethal
      shock once every 1d4 rounds. This effect has a radius of 20 feet, centered
      on any one contributing lizard. All creatures within that radius take 2d8
      points of lethal electricity damage for each lizard contributing to the
      shock, to a maximum of 12d8. A Reflex save (DC 10 + the number of lizards
      contributing) halves the damage.
Description:
  - >-
    A shocker lizard has a pale yellow underside, with bright green scales
    elsewhere on its 3-foot-long body, and weighs about 25 pounds. Shocker
    lizards tend toward group living, as their electrical abilities grow in
    power when they are close to another lizard.
  - >-
    A shocker lizard colony is usually located near a source of water. Once the
    colony has settled on a location, the lizards become very territorial and
    attack anything that intrudes on them. A solitary shocker lizard is a timid
    and hesitant creature-but when several of them gather they become formidable
    and fearsome opponents capable of killing creatures several times their own
    size.
  - >-
    A shocker lizard relies on its electricity abilities in combat, and a lizard
    tends to bite only after its shock has rendered an opponent unconscious, or
    when the shock seems to have no effect at all. A solitary lizard flees once
    it delivers its shocks, but if other shocker lizards are nearby, they all
    hone in on their comrade's discharges and attempt to administer lethal
    shocks to their foe.
  - >-
    Many have attempted to capture and tame shocker lizards, but this often
    proves a difficult and painful task. Alone and in captivity, shocker lizards
    tend to wither and die swiftly unless their keepers spend a lot of time
    grooming and playing with the lizards to keep them company. Kept in pairs or
    larger numbers, captive shocker lizards thrive, but their increasing
    electrical ability makes them more difficult to manage for keepers who
    aren't themselves immune to electricity.
