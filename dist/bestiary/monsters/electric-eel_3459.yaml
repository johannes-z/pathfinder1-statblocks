    description: >-
      Once per hour, an electric eel can produce a jolt of electricity in a
      10-foot radius centered on its body. Creatures within 5 feet take 3d8
      points of electricity damage. Those further away than 5 feet but within 10
      feet take 2d8 points of electricity damage. Affected creatures can make a
      DC 13 Fortitude save to reduce the damage by half. Electric eels are
      immune to their own electrical attacks and that of other electric eels.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Electric eels resemble snakes ranging from 9 to 20 feet long and weighing 50
    to 120 pounds. Its body is grayish-brown and lightens near the head. Small
    yellow splotches can be seen near the mouth. The electric eel is slimy to
    the touch and has no scales (the electric eel is not a true eel, but a
    fish).
  - >-
    An electric eel prefers to discharge its electricity when it first enters
    combat. Those slain or rendered unconscious by the shock are devoured.
  - >-
    Should any opponents survive the attack, the eel either flees (if
    outnumbered) or attacks its remaining foes with its bite.
