  - name: Water Dependency (Ex)
    description: >-
      Giant crabs can survive out of the water for 1 hour per point of
      Constitution. Beyond this limit, a giant crab runs the risk of
      suffocation, as if it were drowning.
Description:
  - >-
    Giant crabs behave much like their smaller cousins, feeding on both plant
    material like algae and fungus and animal matter such as fish, seabirds, and
    even unwary humanoids. The coloration of a giant crab's hard exoskeleton
    varies widely depending on species, and over time even shifts in response to
    its diet. Other species of giant crab exist as well, some smaller but most
    quite a bit larger. You can adjust the stats given here by changing Hit Dice
    and size (changing Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution as appropriate) to
    represent a wide range of different species of giant crab. The following
    table lists the most common variants. Species CR Size H D King crab 1/4 Tiny
