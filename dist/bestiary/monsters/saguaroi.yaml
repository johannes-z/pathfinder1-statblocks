SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Needle Cone (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, as a standard action a saguaroi can eject a barrage
      of needles from its body. This effect creates a 15-foot-cone burst of
      needles that deals 4d6 points of piercing damage to all creatures in the
      area (Reflex DC 20 for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Needle Hide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A saguaroi is covered with needles and spines, and its slam attacks deal
      both bludgeoning and piercing damage. Any creature grappling a saguaroi or
      attacking it with a natural attack or unarmed strike takes 1d4 points of
      piercing damage (manufactured weapons with the reach special feature do
      not endanger the user this way). A creature grappling a saguaroi takes
      this damage each round of the grapple.
  - name: Produce Water (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once per hour, a saguaroi can cut itself (taking 1
      point of damage) to produce 1 gallon of water. After producing 4 gallons,
      it becomes fatigued. After producing 8 gallons, it becomes exhausted and
      cannot produce more water for 24 hours.
Description:
  - >-
    Saguarois, also called cactusfolk by desert-dwelling humanoids, make their
    homes in rocky badlands, hot scrublands on the edge of vast deserts, and
    sandy dunes baked by the sun. They are generous but territorial, offering
    aid to travelers who brave the blistering deserts-often in the form of their
    own watery blood-but don't tolerate guests who overstay their welcome.
    Civilization rarely attempts to push far into the deserts, leaving these
    creatures relatively isolated from other intelligent races. In cases where
    belligerent settlements threaten the way of life for tribes of saguarois,
    however, the cactusfolk respond with terrifying violence. Saguarois live in
    small nomadic tribes, traveling under the life-giving sun by day and rooting
    themselves each night in places where they can draw minerals from the pebbly
    and sandy soil and absorb water. Saguarois produce flowers once a year that
    go to seed and grow into young saguarois if the adult creatures properly
    care for them. If planted, a seed must be attended by one or more saguarois
    over the course of a year before the infant saguaroi sprouts. After
    sprouting, it takes 4 years before the infant saguaroi can uproot itself and
    move about, and decades more to reach maturity. Some saguarois have lived
    for hundreds of years, and these old cactusfolk often sprout additional
    limbs or strange twisting growths stretching out from their cylindrical
    torsos. Usually these additional limbs and growths are nonfunctional, but
    significantly advanced saguarois have been known to learn how to use them as
    if they were their primary arms and legs.
