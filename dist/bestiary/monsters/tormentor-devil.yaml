Description_Visual: >-
  This reddish-gray scaled humanoid stands taller than a human. Its hands are
  clawed and its feet cloven. Oversized fangs jut from its upper jaw and drip
  foul-smelling saliva. Small horns protrude from just above its eyes, curving
  backwards. Its head and body are hairless and a small curving tail trails
  behind it. It wields a battleaxe and carries a wickedly-barbed net slung
  across its back.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ghost Touch (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tormentor devil deals damage normally with its claws against incorporeal
      creatures.
  - name: Soul Track (Su)
    description: >-
      A tormentor devil can track the soul of any creature that enters any of
      the planes of Hell. Tracking a soul has a base DC of 20 and follows the
      rules for tracking. A tormentor devil must be on the same plane as the
      soul it is tracking. Soulcatcher Net: A tormentor devil's net looks like a
      normal net and follows the rules for net attacks. The net has 20 hit
      points; the Escape Artist check to get free is DC 30; the net can be
      broken with a successful DC 30 Strength check. The net can entrap
      incorporeal creatures. The net has many small razor-sharp barbs lining it.
      These barbs deal 1d6 points of damage each round to any creature caught in
      the net, including incorporeal creatures. (The incorporeal creature's 50%
      chance to avoid damage from a corporeal source does not apply to this
      attack.)
Description:
  - >-
    Tormentors of Souls, known as tormentor devils, make their way across the
    uppermost plane of Hell searching for souls that have entered the realms of
    evil. Various arch-devils and dukes employ tormentor devils to capture and
    return souls to them for their devilish uses. Tormentors often employ hell
    hounds when pursuing renegade or runaway souls.
  - Tormentors stand 7 feet tall and weigh about 400 pounds.
  - >-
    Tormentor devils attack using their battleaxes and nets. They hunt in packs
    when tracking souls and are rarely encountered alone. If leading a pack of
    hell hounds, tormentors let the hell hounds attack first while they stay at
    range and attack with their nets.
