Description:
  - >-
    Air elementals are fast, flying creatures made of living air. Primitive and
    territorial, they resent being summoned or doing the bidding of mortals, and
    much prefer to spend their time on the Plane of Air, swooping and racing
    through the endless skies. Although all air elementals of a similar size
    have identical statistics, the exact appearance of an air elemental can vary
    wildly between individuals. One might be an animated vortex of wind and
    smoke, while another might be a smoky bird-like creature with glowing eyes
    and wind for wings. An air elemental prefers to attack flying or otherwise
    airbone targets, not only because its mastery over flight gives it a slight
    advantage, but also because it detests the thought of having to touch the
    ground. An air elemental can move underwater, and although it is an
    elemental and thus runs no risk of drowning, it has no ranks in Swim and
    loses much of its speed and mobility when underwater. Whirlwind Whirlwind
