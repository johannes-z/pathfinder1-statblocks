SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Expel Pathogens (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a kirrix hits with its bite attack, it can infect its target using
      its harbor pathogens ability (if any) with one disease it has stored, even
      if that disease can't normally be contracted via an injury. It can do this
      a number of times per day equal to its Constitution modifier.
      Alternatively, a kirrix can expend two uses of this ability to spray a
      disease in a 15-foot cone, exposing all creatures in the cone to the
      disease even if it can't normally be contracted by contact. Doing so
      depletes the kirrix's reserve of that disease.
  - name: Harbor Pathogens (Ex)
    description: >-
      A kirrix's body has innate features that let it clean up and contain
      diseases within ratfolk warrens. A kirrix collects diseases by consuming
      them off of objects or from the air (typically contact, ingested, or
      inhaled diseases), by ministering to a diseased creature (typically
      ingested or injury diseases), or by fighting a creature that imparts
      diseases and being subjected to one. The kirrix can store up to two types
      of diseases at a time in an organ near its throat. (A typical kirrix has
      filth fever and bubonic plague stored.) A kirrix can harmlessly digest an
      unwanted disease as a full-round action. If the creature consumes a mold
      or another substance that causes disease, it clears the surface of
      disease. If it ingests a diseased creature's blood (either by licking an
      open wound or biting the creature), it can produce an antiplague
      secretion, which it can use on itself or apply to others. Treat this as
      though the kirrix were using the Heal skill to treat disease with a +12
      bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Ratfolk have just as much enthusiasm for alchemy as they do for rodents, and
    they combined these two interests to create the kirrix-the result of
    generations of riding rat husbandry combined with regular infusions. These
    alchemical modifications have given kirrixes six legs and the ability to
    consume and transmit diseases without ill effect to the creatures
    themselves.
  - >-
    Many ratfolk settlements raise these gregarious creatures, with whom the
    ratfolk share their warrens in a symbiotic relationship. The kirrixes prowl
    the ratfolk tunnels and act as scavengers-searching for unfamiliar scents,
    consuming detritus, and removing harmful diseases from the ratfolk
    settlement. If the warren comes under attack, the kirrixes act as guards,
    and squeeze through or block tunnels as necessary to buy time for their
    ratfolk allies to escape.
  - A typical adult kirrix is 9 feet long and usually weighs under 500 pounds.
