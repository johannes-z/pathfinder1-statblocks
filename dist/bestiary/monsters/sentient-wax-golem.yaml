Description_Visual: >-
  This eerily expressionless man has a glistening quality about him, as though
  he were completely covered in an oily sheen. His clothes' colors are
  unsaturated and bland, his skin slightly gray, and his features and lines
  unnaturally soft.

Description:
  - >-
    A wax golem is an exact replica of a particular person, composed completely
    of wax. While skilled artists pride themselves on their ability to make wax
    sculptures look lifelike, builders of wax golems go one step further and
    actually bring their art to life. Though eerily silent and unblinking,
    well-built wax golems bear such striking similarity to the subjects they are
    modeled after that some golems begin to think they are in fact that person.
  - >-
    A wax golem can be constructed to resemble any person or creature, though
    they typically look like human subjects, standing at the same height and
    weighing about three times as much.
  - >-
    Ecology Wax golems are often constructed by artistic spell-casters who fancy
    making their work a little more authentic-looking.
  - >-
    Though these golems can look like anything from faceless, colorless drones
    to finely detailed reconstructions, they all share the commonality of being
    formed purely from hard wax. Most wax golem crafters choose to create these
    lifelike statues not for aesthetic purposes, however, but to undertake
    devious chores such as infiltration, espionage, or assassination.
  - >-
    Habitat & Society Wax golems possess the mysterious ability of possibly
    gaining self-awareness, an attribute almost exclusively reserved for
    humanoid creatures born of natural means. By resembling a subject so
    greatly, wax golems have a small chance of gaining conscious thought and
    higher-level thinking, effectively manifesting their own sentience.
  - >-
    This extraordinary ability has no logical explanation, though some
    constructors of these beings who have witnessed this transformation theorize
    that wax golems obtain self-awareness by watching humanoids over an extended
    period of time. Wax golems that spend a significant amount of time around
    people who mistake them for the subjects they resemble (such as golems sent
    to perform espionage) have an even greater chance of gaining sentience.
  - >-
    Oddly, wax golems that gain sentience also develop the genuine belief that
    they are who they are modeled after. This notion is so strong that if such a
    wax golem were to encounter the individual it is modeled after, it would go
    to great lengths to exterminate the person and take his or her place in
    society, even adopting a code of morals and principles similar to those of
    the murdered subject. In this way, wax golems stealthily inject themselves
    into roles as diplomats, leaders, and authority figures, often to the
    detriment of people close to the usurped individual.
  - >-
    So meticulously designed are wax golems, however, that few can identify a
    wax golem as a fraud, even when in close proximity. Along with sentience,
    wax golems achieve moderate intelligence, as well as the ability to
    communicate and speak. In order to mask the glossy sheen associated with
    their wax bodies, deceptive golems take special care to garb themselves in
    clothes that hide their peculiar complexions. They still do not eat, sleep,
    or breathe, but crafty golems easily avoid the complications associated with
    these trivialities. The only definitive clue a well-built wax golem cannot
    easily hide is the distinct texture of its skin, which, even to the most
    unobservant individual, does not feel anything like flesh. Because of this,
    wax golems tend to be aloof and secretive, never allowing any one person to
    get too close, a trait that does not go unnoticed by those well-acquainted
    with the original individual, who tend to pick up on the rather sudden shift
    in demeanor.
  - >-
    Environmental hazards such as heat from the sun or cold precipitation have
    little effect on wax golems, though constant exposure to temperatures over
    100 degrees for more than an hour does produce a rather odd sheen, and
    spending longer than a day in such weather begins to take its toll on the
    golem, dealing 1d4 points of fire damage every hour spent in the elements
    after the first.
  - >-
    Construction The construction of a wax golem requires a block of solid wax
    the size of whatever individual it is to be molded after, typically weighing
    over 1,000 pounds.
  - >-
    The wax is treated with dyes and magical unguents worth at least 500 gp. The
    simplest wax golems require the creator to make a Craft (sculptures) check,
    with wax golems resembling specific races or individuals requiring higher
    DCs. While wax golems that look like living creatures possess greater
    versatility, they also have the potential of gaining a strange sort of
    sentience.
