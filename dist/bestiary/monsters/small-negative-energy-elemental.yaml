  - name: Negative Energy (Ex)
    description: >-
      A negative energy elemental infuses a target hit by its slam attack with
      negative energy. This deals extra damage to a living target (as listed in
      the statistics block) but heals undead (and other negative energy based
      creatures) by the same amount. Undead (and other negative energy based
      creatures) can be healed above their normal hit point total, gaining extra
      hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear 1
      minute later. Creatures healed to twice their normal hit points (that is,
      a creature whose hit points are effectively doubled) must succeed on a
      Fortitude save or explode in a burst of negative energy. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. See the table below for each negative energy
      elemental's save DC. Negative energy (such as an inflict spell or negative
      energy channeling) can heal negative energy elementals.
  - name: Negative Energy Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A negative energy elemental radiates an aura of pure negative energy
      around it. (See the table for the area each elemental affects.) Within a
      negative energy elemental's aura, class abilities that use negative
      energy, such as negative energy channeling or the Command Undead feat,
      function as if the user were 2 levels higher. Additionally, spells and
      spell-like abilities that use negative energy are maximized (as if the
      Maximize Spell metamagic feat had been used on them, but the spells don't
      require higher-level slots). Spells and spell-like abilities that are
      already maximized are unaffected by this benefit. This aura does not
      affect the negative energy channeling ability of the negative energy
      elemental using it, and its effects do not stack with those of other
      negative energy elementals. Within a negative energy elemental's aura,
      class abilities that use positive energy, such as positive energy
      channeling or the Turn Undead feat, function as if the user were 2 levels
      lower. Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy, including
      cure spells, require the caster to succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15
      + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function
      but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check
      succeeds, the spell functions normally.
  - name: Negative Energy Channeling (Su)
    description: >-
      A Large or larger negative energy elemental can channel negative energy as
      a cleric whose level equals the elemental's Hit Dice. The Will save DC
      includes a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Negative energy elementals are creatures of pure negative energy. They are
    found primarily on the Negative Energy Plane, but on rare occasions, one
    slips through a portal or is summoned to the Material Plane. These creatures
    seem to be able to communicate with others of their kind by changing the
    intensity of energy in their bodies and altering their shape ever so
    slightly. They do not speak any known languages. Negative energy elementals
    hate positive energy elementals and always attack them on sight. Aside from
    that, negative energy elementals rarely engage in combat. If confronted
    however and forced into battle, the creature responds by pummeling its foes
    with its powerful fists dealing negative energy to its foe. Copyright Notice
