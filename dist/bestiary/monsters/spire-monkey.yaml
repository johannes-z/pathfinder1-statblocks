Description_Visual: >-
  The Spire Monkey is a two-headed, six-armed monkey that lives on roofs (spires
  and minarets are preferred) and high in the treetops. In some tropical
  countries they are tolerated in cities as messengers of the gods, and roam
  temples with impunity.
Group: Monkey

Description:
  - >-
    Omnivorous and foul-tempered, spire monkeys race from rooftop to rooftop and
    steal food (and occasionally loose coins or trinkets) from the streets
    below. Spire monkeys attack by clawing, as well as by throwing rocks or
    other small objects (such as roof tiles), and can divide their attacks
    between two opponents. They can climb as fast as they can run, and leap from
    tree to tree or building to building.
