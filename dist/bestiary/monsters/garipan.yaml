Description:
  - >-
    Vicious beings with little memory of who or what they might once have been,
    garipans know only two things: that they were once evils in service to the
    legions of Hell, and that they are no longer bound to that infernal
    hierarchy. With resistant, stony hides; sharp claws; and a flaming core to
    rival the inferno of Hell, garipans combine some of the worst depravities of
    devils with the freedom of beings with nothing at all to lose.
  - >-
    These hulking, winged creatures often masquerade as gargoyles, but are
    actually the final state of failed conjurations. If a summoning is cast
    incorrectly, pulling only a portion of a devil's essence to Golarion,
    unidentifiable magical environmental conditions combine with the shard of
    the outsider's being to create a garipan.
  - >-
    Garipans are rarely aware of the full details of their previous existence;
    much in the same way that lesser devils can forget their lives when they
    ascend to more powerful forms, newly formed garipans are overwhelmed by
    unfamiliar sensations. Unfettered by conjuring magic, unrestricted by magic
    that protects against extraplanar intrusion, and free from the threat of
    banishment back to Hell, garipans experience freedom for the first time, and
    this freedom most often results in a break from their previous lives.
  - >-
    In combat, a garipan uses flight and the fire raging within it to its
    greatest advantage, swooping overhead with its breath weapon first, then
    closing in for a full attack with its bite and claws while its breath weapon
    recharges.
