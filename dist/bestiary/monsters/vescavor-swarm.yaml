SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Gibber (Su)
    description: >-
      Vescavors yammer the endless chorus of the Abyss. Any creature within 15
      feet of a vescavor swarm or inside it must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or
      be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion insanity
      effect. A creature that saves cannot be affected by the same vescavor
      swarm's gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Ravenous (Ex)
    description: >-
      Vescavors can devour nearly anything, with the exception of adamantine. If
      the swarm attacks an object or structure, the vescavors ignore its
      hardness if it is made of any substance other than adamantine.
      Additionally, every round that a creature is in the same space as the
      swarm, the vescavors begin devouring one object on the creature. The
      object takes half its maximum hit points in damage and gains the broken
      condition. If the vescavors attack an object with the broken condition, it
      is destroyed. An attended or magic object can make a DC 15 Reflex save to
      negate this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Traumatizing (Su)
    description: >-
      Vescavors embody the meanest depravities of the Outer Rifts, and walking
      among them is akin to being trapped in the Abyss itself. Any creature that
      spends more than 3 rounds inside a vescavor swarm must succeed at a DC 13
      Will save or gain one of the types of madness presented on page 250 of the
      Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide. Roll on the Types of Insanity table to
      determine which type of insanity affects the creature-the creature does
      not make another Will save against the specific insanity. This affliction
      is permanent, but can be healed as detailed in the Curing Insanity section
      of the Sanity and Madness rules. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    And those who linger near the Worldwound eventually discover that more than
    demons clawed through the rift between worlds. Once known only to the
    lightless crevices and shrieking half-live jungles of the Abyss, the
    yammering, gnashing stray teeth of the Outer Rifts have also been unleashed
    upon Golarion-the gluttonous vermin of the Abyss called vescavors.
