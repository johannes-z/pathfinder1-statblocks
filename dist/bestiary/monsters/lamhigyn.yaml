  This small, three-eyed creature lets out garbled, piercing shrieks as it flits
  about on ragged batlike wings, its barbed tail flicking with menace.

  - name: Wrap Wings (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a lamhigyn uses its wing attacks to grab an opponent, it wraps its
      wings around its opponent's head, causing the victim to gain the blinded
      condition for as long as the lamhigyn grapples that creature. A grappling
      lamhigyn automatically deals wing damage while grappling, but it takes the
      normal -2 penalty on attack rolls for its sting attack. This ability has
      no effect on creatures that do not have sensory organs in their heads.
Description:
  - >-
    Simple creatures, lamhigyns emerged from the chaotic fabric of the Abyss.
    Abyssal pests might be a good description of these strange creatures; their
    stings have left many adventurers insane and debilitated, opportune victims
    for the Abyss's insatiable predators. Viewing intruders with evil disdain,
    lamhigyns are always looking for new victims, which they slowly lap apart,
    piece by piece, with their rasping mouths.
  - >-
    Lamhigyns are strange-looking creatures that are often characterized by
    mortals visiting the Abyss as overgrown, flying tadpoles with the wings of a
    bat and a stinger-tipped tail. They lurk within dark places in the Abyss and
    in similarly lightless places on the Material Plane near rifts to their
    homeland. Their bulbous, unblinking eyes are vaguely froglike, and are often
    the first and last things unprepared adventurers see, as the pesky creatures
    are fond of wrapping their wings around their victims' heads to blind their
    prey. Their tiny mouths house thick tongues that flicker when intruders
    arrive.
  - >-
    Lamhigyns have thick, scaly skin on their bodies ranging in color from red
    to green. Though lamhigyns are typically encountered flying, on the ground
    they stand on four insectile legs that they keep tucked beneath them while
    nesting. Although they are small, their 2-foot-high, 8-pound bodies pack an
    impressive punch when hurtling through the air at their victims.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Lamhigyns are pests from another plane and have no proper place in the
    Material Plane's natural order. Chaotic creatures with an inherent streak of
    evil, they lie in wait, eager for mortal life to happen by. When this
    occurs, lamhigyns instantly attack and try to immobilize their victims
    before slowly devouring them alive.
  - >-
    Lamhigyns that have slipped through to the Material Plane breed in dark
    caves and shadowed forests. Their mating rituals are dangerous, messy
    affairs. Approximately once every year, the fertile females- which are
    nearly indistinguishable from the males- fly to the highest corners of the
    cave or den where they live. There, they squawk uncontrollably. The males
    hurtle toward these females; the ensuing flapping and screeching results in
    the females' three or five eggs becoming fertilized. The females then lay
    these eggs in slime-covered clusters, where they incubate for 6 to 8 weeks
    before hatching. Lamhigyn mothers typically die shortly after laying their
    eggs, their bodies exhausted by the violent process of reproduction.
  - >-
    As they grow, lamhigyn hatchlings join any others of their kind in nearby
    caverns or find their own comfortable, dark places in which to live. Some
    find the Material Plane uncomfortable and spend all of their energy trying
    to find a way back to the home world they've never known but feel
    intrinsically drawn to.
  - >-
    Being from the Abyss, lamhigyns do not need to sleep; however, many choose
    to stay very still within the darkness-their wings wrapped around their
    bodies and their tiny legs curled underneath-waiting for the simple pleasure
    of scaring anything that may wander nearby. Similarly, lamhigyns have no
    need or desire to eat, but they spend much of their energy focused on
    predation. Though they don't require sustenance, they delight in bloodshed
    and violence.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Found in all corners of the Abyss, lamhigyns often slip through to the
    Material Plane (or other planes in the Great Beyond) as a result of being
    caught up by portals or flying too close to a rift between worlds. The
    greatest known rift on Golarion is the Worldwound. Here, lamhigyns are found
    in great abundance, almost invariably in caves, cliffs, or even the fabric
    of the Worldwound itself-sites chosen because of their similarity to
    lamhigyns' darkened homes in the Abyss. In fact, some of these simple-minded
    creatures believe this region of Golarion is part of the Abyss. For the most
    part, however, they're more delighted with the abundance of food in the
    Worldwound than they are concerned with geography.
  - >-
    When it comes to their own kind, lamhigyns can be volatile and violent in
    nature. In general, they tend to get along with other lamhigyns, though
    almost anything can set them off: living in too close proximity to each
    other, mating disputes, or arguments over the torn bodies of victims. When
    this happens, lamhigyns turn the full force of their chaotic fury onto each
    other, tearing and grappling until only one-sometimes none-of the bizarre
    creatures remain. When lamhigyns turn against each other, they are even more
    vicious than when they attack other creatures. Sometimes a petty squabble
    between two boisterous lamhigyns can spread through an entire hive as they
    infect each other with a chaotic bloodlust. Before long, entire caverns full
    of lamhigyns erupt in screeching echoes that crash against the rocky walls.
  - >-
    When they're not fighting among themselves, lamhigyns occupy shared spaces
    in noisy, flapping hives, waiting for hapless creatures to stumble into
    their dens. Intelligent creatures susceptible to fear-such as adventurers,
    creatures whose minds have been warped by the Worldwound's infestations, or
    unlucky natives- then suffer lamhigyns' gleeful ire. Lamhigyns ignore most
    normal animals unless they have waited too long for fresh prey and have
    grown bored. When it comes to victims, lamhigyns prefer those that can think
    and walk, for they provide the most deliciously terrified reactions. There
    is nothing lamhigyns love more than to tear the life from terrified,
    screaming humans while they are out of their minds with fear.
  - >-
    Lamhigyns fill parts of the Abyss like pigeons fill large cities, and many
    demons regard the creatures as terrible pests. Some demons take to hunting
    the creatures for target practice or pest control. Lamhigyns avoid most
    demons, especially those more powerful than dretches.
  - >-
    They enjoy harassing dretches and quasits, however, and often flock around
    individuals, screeching and battering them with their wings. This hazing
    goes both ways, and in the Abyss dretch hunting parties scour caverns for
    lamhigyns.
  - >-
    Unlike many other creatures, lamhigyns show little racial preference between
    a solitary existence or one with others of their kind. Although lamhigyns
    are more potent in groups, a single lamhigyn might occupy a small cave near
    the Worldwound for generations, waiting patiently for just one victim.
    Lamhigyns can live to be nearly 500 years old, though most die through acts
    of violence before reaching half that age.
  - >-
    When the Worldwound first opened, lamhigyns poured through the tear in
    reality along with the demons. They were also some of the first to die, as
    the Sarkorians could defeat the strange, small creatures in combat more
    easily than they could the more durable demons. However, the winged
    creatures kept pouring through, foreshadowing the Abyssal onslaught that was
    to come. In short time, lamhigyns began populating the region, and now tens
    of thousands of these creatures are said to live near the Worldwound alone.
    Though lamhigyns are rare outside the Worldwound, their appearance elsewhere
    on Golarion is a sign that chaos-and the pain of draining, pesky stings-is
    sure to follow.
