Description_Visual: >-

  beak.

Description:
  - >-
    The hippogriff bears the wings, forelegs, and head of a great raptor bird
    and the tail and body of a magnificent horse. As horses are a preferred meal
    for griffons, sages claim some flesh-warping wizard with an ironic sense of
    humor long ago created this unfortunate fusion of horse and hawk as a joke.
  - >-
    A hippogriff 's feathers bear coloration similar to those of a hawk or an
    eagle; however, some breeders have managed to produce specimens with stark
    white or coal black feathers. A hippogriff 's torso and hind end are most
    often bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing pinto or even palomino
    coloration. Hippogriffs measure 11 feet long and weigh upward of 1,500
    pounds.

    Territorial, hippogriffs fiercely protect the lands under their domain.
    Hippogriffs must also watch the skies for other predators, as they are a
    preferred meal of griffons, wyverns, and young dragons. Hippogriffs nest in
    sweeping grasslands, rugged hills, and flowing prairies. Exceptionally hardy
    hippogriffs make their home nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which
    they comb the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid.
    Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, yet they graze after every meal of flesh
    to aid their digestion. Their dietary habits can be dangerous to both
    ranchers and their livestock, so ranching communities often set bounties on
    them. Victims of these hunts are often taxidermied, and preserved
    hippogriffs frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote outposts.
  - >-
    Far easier to train than griffons, yet easily as intelligent as horses,
    hippogriffs are trained as mounts by some elite companies of mounted
    soldiers, patrolling the skies and swooping down on unsuspecting enemies.
    Although they are magical beasts, if captured young, hippogriffs can be
    trained using Handle Animal as if they were animals. An adult hippogriff is
    more difficult to train, and attempts to do so follow the normal rules for
    training magical beasts using the skill. A hippogriff saddle must be
    specially crafted so as to not impact the movement of the creature's
    wings-these saddles are always exotic saddles.
  - >-
    Hippogriffs lay eggs rather than birthing live young- as a general rule, a
    hippogriff nest only contains one egg at a time. A hippogriff 's egg is
    worth 200 gp, but a healthy young hippogriff is worth 500 gp. A fully
    trained hippogriff mount can command prices of up to 5,000 gp or more. A
    hippogriff can carry 198 pounds as a light load, 399 pounds as a medium
    load, and 600 pounds as a heavy load.
