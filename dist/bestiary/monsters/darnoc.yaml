SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoid slain by a darnoc becomes a darnoc in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are
      under the command of the darnoc that created them and remain enslaved
      until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in
      life.
  - name: Curse of the Grave (Su)
    description: >-
      Any damage dealt by a darnoc's slam attack does not heal naturally and
      resists all magical healing (potions, cure spells, and so on). Before the
      damage can be healed, the curse must first be broken with a break
      enchantment or remove curse spell (requiring a DC 20 caster level check
      for either spell).
  - name: Ghost Form (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a darnoc can become incorporeal for up to 10 minutes
      each day. While incorporeal, the darnoc has AC 14 (+2 Dex, +2 deflection)
      and can use its slam attack as an incorporeal touch against corporeal
      targets dealing 1d6+1 points of negative energy damage as well as curse of
      the grave.
  - name: Symbol of Discord (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a darnoc can scribe a symbol in the
      air. All creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within 60
      feet who see the symbol must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or immediately
      fall into loud bickering and arguing. Meaningful communication is
      impossible. If the affected creatures have different alignments, there is
      a 50% chance that they attack each other. Bickering lasts 5d4 rounds.
      Fighting begins 1d4 rounds into the bickering and lasts 2d4 rounds. Once
      triggered, the symbol lasts 2 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The darnoc is a corrupting evil presence whose very touch sucks the life
    from an opponent bit by painful bit. The darnoc are said to be the restless
    spirits of oppressive, cruel, and power hungry individuals cursed forever to
    a life of monotony and toil, forbidden by the gods to taste the spoils of
    the afterlife they so desperately craved in life. Often seen in the clothes
    and guise it wore in life, a darnoc often walks the same halls and repeats
    the same actions of its insipid existence over and over again. Due to their
    great greed, a darnoc may be found within its treasury endlessly counting
    its coins, or within a graveyard noting the headstones of its vanquished
    foes with cruel mirth. When distracted from its reverie of its remembered
    past life, the creature flies into an inconsolable rage, often lashing out
    without warning or provocation at the first individual who attempts to speak
    to it. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
