    description: >-
      An overseer can move beyond the brain gear's normal area of influence
      while maintaining contact with it. Normally, a brain gear can control only
      clockworks that are within two miles of its position. A brain gear can
      control an overseer that stays within 10 miles of its position. In
      addition, the overseer can act as a field commander for up to 20 HD worth
      of clockworks that are within 100 feet of its position. These clockworks
      are considered to be in contact with the brain gear so long as the
      overseer is in contact with it.
Description:
  - >-
    Overseers are a recent invention of the brain gears. An overseer can journey
    up to 10 miles away from a brain gear while maintaining contact with it. In
    addition, an overseer acts as a sort of field commander for brain gears,
    controlling clockworks beyond the brain gear's reach. Rumors say some brain
    gears are researching ways to improve the overseers, hoping to extend the
    range at which they can operate and allow for the creation of fully
    functional armies that can terrorize civilized lands.
  - >-
    An overseer avoids direct combat at all costs under direct orders of a brain
    gear. If cornered with no way of escaping, an overseer fights, and attempts
    to flee as soon as possible.
