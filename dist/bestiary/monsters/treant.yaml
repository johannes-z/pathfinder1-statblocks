SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animate Trees (Sp)
    description: >-
      A treant can animate any trees within 180 feet at will, controlling up to
      two trees at a time. It takes 1 full round for a tree to uproot itself,
      after which it moves at a speed of 10 feet and fights as a treant
      (although it has only one slam attack and lacks the treant's animation and
      rockthrowing abilities), gaining the treant's vulnerability to fire. If
      the treant that animated it terminates the animation, moves out of range,
      or is incapacitated, the tree immediately takes root wherever it is and
      returns to its normal state.
  - name: Double Damage Against Objects (Ex)
    description: >-
      A treant or animated tree that makes a full attack against an object or
      structure deals double damage.
  - name: Treespeech (Ex)
    description: >-
      A treant has the ability to converse with plants as if subject to a
      continual speak with plants spell, and most plants greet them with an
      attitude of friendly or helpful.
Description:
  - >-
    Treants are guardians of the forest and speakers for the trees. As
    long-lived as the forests themselves, and seeing themselves as parents and
    shepherds rather than gardeners, treants are slow and methodical in most
    things but terrifying when forced to fight in defense of their flock. Though
    they rarely seek out the companionship of the short-lived races, and have an
    inherent distrust of change, they have been known to tolerate those who seek
    to learn from their long, rambling monologues, especially if the pupils
    express a desire to help protect the wildlands. Yet against those who would
    threaten the forest, especially loggers who seek to harvest wood for lumber
    or those who try to clearcut a section of forest in order to build a fort or
    establish a town, the treants' wrath is swift and devastating. They are
    particularly gifted at tearing down what others build-a trait that serves
    angry treants well. Treants are primarily solitary creatures, with a given
    individual sometimes responsible for an entire forest, but they occasionally
    come together in small groups called groves to share news and reproduce. In
    times of grave danger, all of the groves in a region may gather for a great
    months-long meeting called a moot, but such events are exceedingly rare, and
    millennia may go by between them. The typical treant is 30 feet tall, with a
    trunk 2 feet in diameter, and weighs 4,500 pounds. Treants tend to resemble
    the species of trees most common in their woodland territories.
