Description:
  - >-
    The people of Kalva are a brutal and merciless tribe of cannibalistic
    barbarians. While they are most often encountered on their desolate, dreary
    isle, their hunger sometimes drives them to nearby shorelines. That the
    Kalvamen are poor shipbuilders and even worse at navigation is a blessing,
    for it keeps them from being a greater danger than they already are.
    Nevertheless, enough of them make it to the mainland to cause problems, and
    the fact that they often wreck their ships in the process and thus become
    stranded makes them even more dangerous.
  - >-
    Often known as berserker cannibals, these degenerates delight in stalking,
    ambushing, and devouring foreign humanoids. Well practiced at hunting in
    Kalva's forbidding terrain, berserker cannibals prefer to silently creep up
    on a victim before launching forward with gargling shrieks. Eager to
    dismember prey with their greataxes in a bloody frenzy, these berserkers
    tend to only use their javelins against flying creatures, or those that can
    outrun them.
  - >-
    Those unfortunate enough to survive the initial attack, or who make the poor
    choice to surrender to the berserkers, face a horrific fate. The berserkers
    drag living bounty back to their camps or caves, where they keep their
    prisoners "fresh" as long as possible by amputating and consuming their
    limbs one at a time.
  - >-
    Each tribe has a few members capable of forging high-quality weapons and
    armor. Iron and steel aren't common on the isle of Kalva, and when the
    metals do appear in their societies, shamans are quick to use them to forge
    magical greataxes for the berserkers.
  - >-
    While the berserkers spend much of their time roaming the island's interior
    on the hunt for sentient creatures, they also take time to plant and harvest
    hidden fields of crops in the island's rich volcanic soil. The crops serve
    as a contingency for times when the berserkers can find neither human nor
    beast to slaughter. The berserkers also gather lichens from the center of
    the island-not for nourishment, but because these can provide euphoric
    visions or fuel the berserkers' battle rage. Continued consumption of these
    lichens is the cause of the Kalva berserkers' white eyes.
