Description:
  - >-
    Undead mimics are believed to be the result of experimentation on mimics by
    insane necromancers. What possessed them to create an undead version of a
    truly horrid creature is beyond most scholars' comprehension.
  - >-
    Undead mimics, unlike standard mimics, are evil, poisoned by the necromantic
    magic that created them. They desire flesh and blood and dine on the souls
    of those they slay.
  - >-
    Undead mimics do not associate with standard mimics (or most other creatures
    for that matter). Often times, an undead mimic is found in the employ of an
    evil necromancer, possibly the one that created it.
