Description_Visual: >-
  Two sinewy tentacles sprout from what appears to be an ancient and
  slime-covered chest.
Group: Mimic
Source: Tome of Horrors 4
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adhesive (Ex)
    description: >-
      An undead mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive,
      holding fast any creatures or items that touch it. An adhesive-covered
      undead mimic automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam
      attack. Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the undead mimic is
      alive without removing the adhesive first. A weapon that strikes an
      adhesive-coated undead mimic is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on
      a DC 18 Reflex save. A successful DC 18 Strength check is needed to pry
      off a stuck weapon. Strong alcohol or universal solvent dissolves the
      adhesive, but the undead mimic can still grapple normally. An undead mimic
      can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 5 rounds
      after the creature is destroyed. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Mimic Object (Ex)
    description: >-
      An undead mimic can assume the general shape of any Medium object, such as
      a massive chest, a stout bed, or a door. The creature cannot substantially
      alter its size, though. An undead mimic's body is hard and has a rough
      texture, no matter what appearance it might present. An undead mimic gains
      a +20 racial bonus on Disguise checks when imitating an object in this
      manner. Disguise is always a class skill for an undead mimic.
  - name: Soul Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      An undead mimic can take a move action to devour the soul of an adjacent
      creature it has recently (within the last hour) killed. A creature whose
      soul is drained cannot be restored to life until the undead mimic
      containing its soul is destroyed. Each time an undead mimic drains a soul
      it gains 1d8 temporary hit points and gains a +2 bonus to Strength for 1
      hour. These bonuses stack with themselves. After 24 hours, the soul is
      completely devoured, and the deceased creature cannot be brought back to
      life via raise dead (resurrection and more powerful effects work normally
      though the undead mimic must still be destroyed before this magic works).
  - name: Weeping Discharge (Ex)
    description: >-
      An undead mimic constantly leaks and oozes its foul adhesive in a
      20-foot-radius area around its body. The area quickly becomes coated in
      the fluids and is considered difficult terrain. Undead mimics are not
      hampered by this secretion (their own or that of another undead mimic).
      The slimy coating lasts for 1 hour before becoming inert.
Description:
  - >-
    Undead mimics are believed to be the result of experimentation on mimics by
    insane necromancers. What possessed them to create an undead version of a
    truly horrid creature is beyond most scholars' comprehension.
  - >-
    Undead mimics, unlike standard mimics, are evil, poisoned by the necromantic
    magic that created them. They desire flesh and blood and dine on the souls
    of those they slay.
  - >-
    Undead mimics do not associate with standard mimics (or most other creatures
    for that matter). Often times, an undead mimic is found in the employ of an
    evil necromancer, possibly the one that created it.
