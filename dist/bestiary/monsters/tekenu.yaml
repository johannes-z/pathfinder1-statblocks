  A collection of cast-off organs rolls and squeezes against itself, forming a
  writhing mass of viscera that hovers in the air.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Canopic Consumption (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a tekenu can consume a single organ from the body
      of a helpless or recently dead humanoid or monstrous humanoid. This organ
      must either be magically preserved or come from a creature that is alive
      or has been dead no longer than 3 days. Only one organ may be harvested
      from each body; all others are destroyed in the process as the tekenu rips
      the body apart. Each organ consumed grants the tekenu a unique ability
      listed below. When discovered, a tekenu typically has 1d4 of the following
      abilities, each corresponding to the most recent organs the creature
      absorbed. Even when the creature has absorbed all four organs (thus
      gaining a full suite of abilities), it still hungers for more. The
      challenge rating of a tekenu that possesses all four canopic organs
      increases by 1. Intestines: The tekenu gains the grab ability when using
      its slam attacks. A tekenu can grapple Medium or smaller creatures with
      this attack, and it gains a +2 racial bonus on its CMB and to its CMD. In
      addition, the tekenu gains the constrict ability, dealing 2d6 points of
      damage. Liver: The tekenu's slam attacks deal 1d3 points of Constitution
      damage to any living creature that fails a DC 17 Fortitude save. This is a
      poison effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based. Lungs: As a standard
      action, the tekenu can expel most of the air and moisture from its form,
      turning into a pile of desiccated viscera. While in this form, the tekenu
      gains a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks, and its fly speed increases to
      60 feet with good maneuverability. It can revert to its normal form as a
      free action. Stomach: The tekenu deals an additional 1d6 points of acid
      damage with its slam attacks.
  - name: Odd Anatomy (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a collection of various individual organs and flesh, a tekenu is in
      many ways similar to a swarm. The creature is not subject to critical hits
      or flanking, and it is immune to any spell or effect that targets a
      specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as
      disintegrate).
  - name: Vulnerable to Channeled Energy (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tekenu takes 150% as much damage as normal from channeled positive
      energy.
Description:
  - >-
    Guardians of long-abandoned tombs, tekenu are the result of a vile practice
    that instills the discarded piles of flesh left over from the mummification
    process with an unholy awareness. Separated from the sacred organs placed in
    canopic jars, tekenus attempt to reconnect with their counterparts among the
    living by killing creatures so that they can absorb intestines, livers,
    lungs, and stomachs into their squirming
  - forms-a process that grants the undead creature additional powers.
  - >-
    Tekenus have been known to hide inside canopic jars collected from
    excavations (cleverly pulling the lid closed), attacking passersby like a
    trapdoor spider. Adventurers searching through lost reliquaries and tombs of
    ancient Osirion commonly call these foul creatures "gutswarms"; however, the
    name scholars give them is derived from an ancient Osirian term for the cast
    off remains of mummification rituals. A tekenu has an ever-changing form
    roughly 3 feet long and 2 feet wide, essentially the size of a robust
    humanoid's torso and abdomen. The mass weighs about 40 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Scholars debate the genesis of the tekenu. Some propose these atrocities are
    the creations of sects of evil priests in ancient Osirion, as they have been
    encountered only in tombs in that nation and of that era. However, several
    groups claim responsibility for the creation of the tekenu, including modern
    cults of Kabriri and Urgathoa. More cautious and traditional scholars claim
    that the tekenu are instead undead abominations resulting from improperly
    conducted mummification rituals, specifically ones in which the incision to
    remove organs was performed by a criminal or laborer.
  - >-
    The viscera that constitute a tekenu make it less susceptible to weapon
    damage and provide it with defensive abilities similar to those of swarms.
    In fact, until a tekenu absorbs one of the sacred canopic organs, it poses
    no stronger a threat than that of a swarm of Tiny vermin. The absorption of
    a sacred organ, however, prompts a radical transformation in the tekenu.
    Only fresh organs or those preserved by magic enhance the tekenu in this
    way. Unearthed tekenu have typically consumed one or two organs, normally
    those belonging to laborers trapped in the tomb at the time it was sealed.
  - >-
    Intestines merge with the discarded remnants to act as long, rope-like
    appendages, which the tekenu uses to snag and pummel prey. Consuming a liver
    allows the tekenu to poison its victims and wither their bodies. A set of
    lungs gives the swarm the ability to hide as a pile of dried gore and
    increases its mobility. When the tekenu consumes a stomach, its attacks
    carry a digestive acid to help break down their victims. Of these organs,
    the tekenu shows particular affinity for absorbing the lungs first, as most
    adventurers discover a tekenu after being deceived by desiccated viscera
    they assume to be harmless.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Created in ritual chambers and tombs, most tekenus have no choice of where
    they are found. Only the most perverse of ancient nobility would have tekenu
    present
  - >-
    in their final resting places. In the most heinous of cases, tekenu would be
    stealthily placed into a resting chamber immediately prior to the tomb's
    sealing. This serves as a final insult to the dead, leaving the undead
    abomination to break into the holy canopic jars and consume the vital organs
    within while they were still fresh enough to bestow power. In cases where a
    tekenu was used as a guardian, a fifth jar was placed inside the tomb to
    house it.
  - >-
    In some cases, either because the canopic jars were exceptionally sealed or
    because they were absent altogether, a tekenu may have none of the abilities
    granted by its canopic consumption ability. Once its tomb prison is breached
    (by explorers or some natural calamity), the tekenu becomes a roaming
    hunter, leaving its lair in search of fresh organs to consume. Acting on
    base instinct, the creature hunts until it successfully absorbs all four
    required organs. Upon gathering these absent parts, the tekenu then moves
    back to the tomb of its creation, where it dutifully guards the site from
    future intruders. Although a tekenu is barely intelligent, it is drawn to
    the site of its creation, a lingering result of the ritual that created it.
  - >-
    A tekenu has no ability to communicate or interact, and its thoughts, if
    read by some form of magic, are simple and instinctual. As it preys upon
    only living and recently dead creatures, it often overlooks constructs and
    undead. Rare necropolises can be found filled with larger groups of these
    undead creatures, sealed away in remote chambers or allowed to wander the
    greater complex unopposed. These groups of tekenus-given stewardships by the
    priests of Ancient Osirion-ignore other tomb guardians, provided they are
    not living creatures. These tekenus are set to roam the necropolis consuming
    small rodents and vermin in the same manner a wizard might use an acidic
    ooze to dispose of waste.
