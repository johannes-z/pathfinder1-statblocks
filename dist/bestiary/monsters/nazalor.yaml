      Three times per day, a nazalor can whip itself into a maddening frenzy. As
      long as it rages it gains +4 Strength, +4 Constitution, and -2 AC. This
      rage lasts up to 1 minute, but the nazalor can end it early if desired. It
      is not fatigued when its rage ends. While raging, a nazalor has the
      following changes made to the statistics block above: AC 16 (+3 Dex, +5
      natural, -2 rage), touch 11, flat-footed 13; hp 92; Atk 2 claws +15
      (1d8+7) and bite +15 (1d8+7); Fort +12; Str 25; Con 22.

      If a nazalor hits an opponent with both claws and its bite in the same
      round, that opponent must succeed on a DC 18 (DC 20 when raging) Fortitude
      save or be stunned for 1d2 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Nazalors are nocturnal carnivores that derive great pleasure by wading into
    combat and shredding their foes to pieces with their wicked claws. These
    vicious bipedal beasts like nothing more than stalking and hunting their
    prey, toying with it, before finally striking in one swift killing blow. A
    nazalor is a solitary creature. It is a highly territorial creature and will
    drive away any creature attempting to lair in what it considers its hunting
    ground (especially other nazalors). Even during mating season, once the
    mating ritual is ended, each nazalor goes its own way. Gestation is 7 months
    and young are born live. They reach maturity within about 15 months.
    Nazalors feast on anything they can kill, with the exception being one of
    their own kind; they do not eat other nazalors. These creatures may fight to
    the death if one moves into another's territory or may fight over a kill,
    but a nazalor will starve to death before it eats another of its kind. A
    nazalor stands 7 feet tall and looks like a stocky, fur covered hyena. Its
    claws and fangs are large for its build. Its fur is bronze in color with
    varying shades depending on the creature's age (young nazalors are brighter
    in color while an aged nazalor's coat is dull). Its eyes are usually green
    or brown. A nazalor rages into combat swinging its deadly claws and gnashing
    at its opponents with its sharp teeth. Though the creature can move across
    the ground on all fours, it always enters and fights in a bipedal stance. A
    nazalor fights to the death if defending its lair, hunting ground, or if
    hungry. Otherwise, if combat goes poorly for it, it seeks immediate escape
    through the quickest route possible (though it may continue to stalk its
    prey and attack again in the future when it thinks it has the advantage).
