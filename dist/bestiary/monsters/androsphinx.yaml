SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Roar (Su)
    description: >-
      An androsphinx can roar up to three times per day as a standard action.
      Each progressive roar has a different effect, depending upon whether it is
      the first, second, or third of the androsphinx's roars for that day. All
      of these roars are sonic effects that fill a 60-foot-radius burst,
      centered on the androsphinx; the save DCs are Charisma-based. Sphinxes are
      immune to all of the effects of an androsphinx's roars. First Roar:
      Affected creatures become frightened for 2d6 rounds (DC 19 Will negates).
      This is a mind-affecting fear effect in addition to being a sonic effect.
      Second Roar: Affected creatures are paralyzed with fear and deafened for
      1d4 rounds (DC 19 Will negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect in
      addition to being a sonic effect. Third Roar: Affected creatures take a
      2d4 penalty to Strength for 2d4 rounds and take 2d8 points of sonic
      damage. Creatures smaller than the androsphinx are knocked prone. A DC 19
      Fortitude save negates the Strength penalty and being knocked prone.
      Spells An androsphinx casts divine spells as a 6th-level cleric. They do
      not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.
Description:
  - >-
    The mightiest of the common sphinxes, androsphinxes see themselves as all
    that is worthy and noble in the species and carry themselves as though the
    weight of the world rests upon their good example. They view criosphinxes
    with paternalistic condescension, hieracosphinxes with poorly veiled
    disgust, and gynosphinxes as the only other sphinxes worthy of their time.
  - >-
    Androsphinxes put on a gruff and cantankerous front to outsiders. They make
    no effort to hide annoyance when displeased. Androsphinxes tend to be
    territorial, though less so than other sphinxes. They almost invariably warn
    and bluster before attacking, and nearly always heed a call to parley.
    Androsphinxes barter information and conversation for safe passage, not
    treasure.
  - Androsphinxes are 12 feet tall and weigh 1,000 pounds.
