Description:
  - >-
    Lightning mephits come from the Elemental Plane of Air and Quasi- Elemental
    Plane of Lighting. Rarely are they encountered elsewhere unless summoned or
    called by a spellcaster. If encountered on a material plane it is usually in
    the employ of some spellcaster who has called it to do his or her bidding.
    Occasionally however, a lightning mephit stumbles into a material plane by
    way of a lightning storm (when said storm reaches into the Plane of Air and
    opens a temporary portal). Lightning mephits found anywhere except their
    home plane will be encountered in areas where lightning and storms are most
    prevalent. A lightning mephit is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 1 pound.
  - >-
    A lightning mephit begins combat with a lightning bolt attack, targeting the
    opponent closest to it. On the following round it breathes a cone of
    lightning on its foes if most are within range; otherwise it moves to melee
    combat. Once in melee, a lightning mephit uses its natural attacks and
    shocking grasp, as well as its breath weapon (if it can catch most of its
    opponents in the cone).
  - >-
    A lightning mephit's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
