Description:
  - >-
    Embolotherium are squat, stocky creatures with hollow, bony protrusions on
    their snouts that are used as sound resonation chambers, allowing the
    creatures to create very loud noises to communicate across great distances.
    An average embolotherium stands 5 feet tall at the shoulder, with a
    nose-to-tail length of about 8 feet and a weight of 6,000 pounds.
  - >-
    Embolotherium are strict herbivores, grazing on grasses and flowering
    plants. Their eyesight is very poor, but extremely acute hearing makes up
    for this deficiency. A herd of embolotherium can be quickly provoked into a
    stampede, and travelers should be wary of even whispered conversation when
    near a group of these creatures.
  - >-
    Naturally social with others of their kind, embolotherium are generally
    found in large groups in flat, grassy areas. Their many layers of tough skin
    serve as deterrents to attack as well as thermal buffers, allowing them to
    survive in even frigid temperatures as long as there is sufficient food.
