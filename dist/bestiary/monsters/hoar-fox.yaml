    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, a hoar fox can expel a blast
      of frigid ice in a 30- foot cone. A creature in the area takes 2d6 points
      of cold damage (DC 13 Reflex save for half). The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Hoar foxes hunt in packs and can often be found lairing near settled areas.
    Hoar foxes are often hunted for their fur as it brings a handsome sum on the
    open market. Hoar foxes are timid creatures and rarely aggressive unless
    threatened. They bite an attacker to try to scare it away, but if that
    tactic fails, they use their breath weapon. While attacking a hoar fox with
    fire seems like a sensible solution (given their vulnerability to it), such
    an attack destroys its pelt and renders it worthless.
