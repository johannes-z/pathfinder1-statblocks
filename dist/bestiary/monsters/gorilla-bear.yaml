Description:
  - >-
    Gorilla bears are the result of a magical crossbreeding and merging of two
    distinct species a gorilla and a black bear. A gorilla bear's fur is always
    dark and ranges in color from jet black to brownish-black. Its paws and feet
    end in elongated nails, brown in color. A typical gorilla bear stands 8 feet
    tall and weighs almost 1,700 pounds. Its eyes are always one of two colors
    crimson or emerald green. No other eye color has ever been seen on a gorilla
    bear (though legends speak of an immensely powerful white-Furred gorilla
    bear with eyes the color of amethysts).
  - >-
    Gorilla bears make their lairs in caves or caverns, often hidden among the
    twisted tangle of trees and shrubs of jungles. They are diurnal (daylight)
    hunters and feast on a diet of meat, savoring the taste of goblins and
    elves. A typical lair contains a mated pair and 1d4 young.
  - Gorilla bears are highly aggressive and attack their prey relentlessly.
  - >-
    Gorilla bears never retreat and always fight until either they are all dead
    or their opponents are all dead. Opponents that attempt to flee are usually
    run down. Gorilla bears attack with their claws, cutting huge chunks of
    flesh from a foe when a claw attack hits. When presented with the
    opportunity, gorilla bears grab their opponent and squeeze them until dead,
    gnashing and biting at a grappled foe with their pointed teeth. Slain prey
    is dragged back to the lair and divided among the young and adults.
