      The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing's 10- foot long eyestalks allow it to look in
      any direction, thereby granting it a +4 racial bonus on vision-based
      Perception skill checks. A wolf-in-sheep's-clothing cannot be flanked.
      Lure-Growth (Ex) A wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can sprout a small furry
      animal from its stump as a free action. It uses this ability to lure
      potential prey into range where it then attacks with its tentacles. A
      creature viewing the lure-growth must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom check to
      detect the deception. The check DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing is perhaps the single strangest monster sages
    have cataloged to date. It appears as a gray-brown tree stump about 3-4 feet
    in diameter. Two 10-foot long eyestalks protrude from the creature's base.
    Each eyestalk is brownish-green in color and is topped by a violet
    flower-like eye. Seven to ten root tentacles, black-brown in color, give the
    monster its means of locomotion. Its mouth is located on its trunk-like body
    and appears to be nothing more than a deep scar, except when the creature
    opens it. The mouth is lined with razor-sharp and jagged greenish-white
    teeth. Its strangest and perhaps deadliest characteristic is its ability to
    "sprout" a growth on its top that resembles a small furry animal (such as a
    rabbit or squirrel). The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing uses this ability to lure
    in its prey, when it strikes with deadly force and aim.
  - The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing uses its lure-growth ability to draw in prey.
  - >-
    When a creature moves within 10 feet of the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing, it
    lashes out with a tentacle. If it hits, it drags the prey to its mouth and
    bites until the creature dies.
