Description:
  - >-
    The bonesnapper is a descendant of a long-extinct dinosaur (exactly which
    one is unknown). Though unintelligent, it is fond of collecting and
    decorating its lair with the jawbones of its victims.
  - A bonesnapper stands about 5 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds.
  - >-
    The bonesnapper attacks with its powerful bite and tail slap. After biting a
    foe, it swings its tail around to smash the same opponent. If flanked or
    attacked by more than one creature, the bonesnapper divides its attacks
    between its foes. The bonesnapper fights to the death.
