SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Boil Water (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a scylla uses its heat ability (see below) for 3 consecutive rounds and
      doesn't move more than 5 feet from its current location, the water
      surrounding it (in a 10-foot radius and to a depth of 10 feet) begins to
      rapidly churn and boil. Creatures caught in the boiling water take 3d6
      points of fire damage each round they remain in the area. A successful DC
      22 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. Creatures wearing heavy
      clothing or medium or heavy armor take a -2 penalty on their saving throw.
      In addition, those wearing metal armor or coming into contact with very
      hot metal are affected as if by a heat metal spell. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Once the scylla moves from its location or shuts its
      heat ability off, the boiling water takes 3 rounds to return to its normal
      temperature (it still deals full damage during its cooling off period). A
      scylla is immune to its own boil water ability and to the boil water
      ability of other scyllas.
  - name: Heat (Ex)
    description: >-
      A scylla raises the temperature of its body in order to generate intense
      heat. It does so as a free action. Creatures attacking a scylla unarmed or
      with natural weapons take 1d6 points of fire damage each time their
      attacks hit. In addition, a scylla can use its heat ability to boil the
      surrounding waters.
  - name: Scalding Blast (Ex)
    description: >-
      A scylla can gulp some of the boiling water surrounding it as a move
      action. Each head that gulped water can then unleash a line of scalding
      steam on the scylla's next action to a range of 50 feet. The scylla can
      target the same or different opponents with each head, if it wishes. Each
      blast deals 3d6 points of fire damage or half that amount if the target
      succeeds on a DC 22 Reflex save. The save DC is Constitution-based. This
      is effective both on the surface and underwater. In any round that a head
      does not gulp water, it can bite.
  - name: Water Dependency (Ex)
    description: >-
      A scylla can survive on land for a number of hours equal to its
      Constitution modifier (minimum 1 hour). After that, refer to the drowning
      rules in Chapter 13 of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook.
Description:
  - >-
    Scyllas are thought to be related to hydras, though no proof exists
    connecting the two. They are found in climates from temperate to warm (they
    don't like the cold) and prefer to lair in natural underwater caves and
    caverns, only emerging when hungry. A scylla is a predatory creature,
    existing on a diet of large fish such as shark, octopus or squid, or
    unlikely swimmers and sailors. Prey is usually devoured in the same spot it
    is killed; rarely does a scylla return to its lair with prey except when
    nursing its young. Scyllas are solitary creatures and even during mating
    season it is rare to actually encounter more than one of these creatures.
    The mating ritual lasts but a short time with the male swimming away
    afterwards, never to return to the lair. Young are born about 6 months later
    and reach maturity in just under a year. Young scyllas are noncombatants and
    do not possess the heat ability of adult scyllas. A scylla is gray-blue to
    dark gray in color with a lighter shaded underbelly. Its fins are gray-blue
    to dark gray. Its eyes are golden or gray and each mouth is lined with
    triple rows of whitish-gray teeth. Scyllas can grow to a length of 50 feet.
    Scyllas attack their foes with vicious bites from their multiple heads. When
    facing more than one opponent, a scylla uses its heat ability to boil the
    water surrounding it and burn its foes. Scyllas prefer to attack when it is
    most advantageous, such as surfacing under a foe. If combat goes against a
    scylla it dives beneath the waves and swims away. A cornered or hungry
    scylla, or one defending its lair, always fights to the death. Copyright
