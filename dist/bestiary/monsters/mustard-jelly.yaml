SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mustard jelly secretes a digestive acid that dissolves only flesh. Any
      melee hit deals acid damage.
  - name: Divide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mustard jelly can, as a standard action, split itself into two identical
      jellies, each with half of the original's current hit points (round down).
      A jelly with 10 hit points or less cannot divide itself. When divided,
      each jelly moves faster than the original (base speed 40 feet per round).
  - name: Energy Absorption (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mustard jelly is immune to electrical effects and magic missiles. If
      targeted by an electricity effect (including area effects) or a magic
      missile spell, the mustard jelly gains temporary hit points equal to the
      amount of damage it would have otherwise sustained. These temporary hit
      points last for 1 hour.
  - name: Poison Aura (Ex)
    description: >-
      The mustard jelly exudes an aura of poison in a 10-foot radius centered on
      it that slows (as the slow spell) any creature in the area as long as it
      remains in the area and for 1d4 rounds afterward if it fails a DC 21
      Fortitude save. A new save must be made each round a creature is within 10
      feet of the mustard jelly. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Mustard jelly appears to be a yellowish-brown form of the ochre jelly and is
    thought to be a distant relative of said creature. However, the mustard
    jelly is far more dangerous than its supposed relative because it is
    intelligent.
  - >-
    The mustard jelly gives off a faint odor of mustard plants to a range of 20
    feet. Though it possesses intelligence, a mustard jelly cannot speak.
  - >-
    A mustard jelly attacks by forming a pseudopod from its body and either
    slashing or enveloping its foes. Mustard jellies prefer to attack from
    ambush or where they have the upper hand on an opponent. If combat goes
    against a mustard jelly, it does not hesitate to flee, though often it uses
    this tactic to lure unsuspecting foes in closer.
  - >-
    A mustard jelly's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
