  - name: Cursed Bite (Su)
    description: >-
      A coral capuchin can deliver a bite that bestows some of the creature's
      benefits and weaknesses upon the victim. The curse delivered by this bite
      persists for 1d6 hours, and cannot affect the same creature more than once
      in a 24-hour period. Affected creatures begin drying out when exposed to
      air, but can hold their breath for double the normal amount of time.
      Targets of this cursed bite take 1d6 points of damage for every 10 minutes
      they are out of water, though spending a full-round action to bathe the
      victim in any sort of water halts this damage. Victims must succeed at a
      DC 12 Constitution check to avoid this effect. Remove curse ends this
      curse's effect as normal. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Moisture Dependency (Ex)
    description: >-
      A coral capuchin can breathe both air and water and survive indefinitely
      on land, but the creature must regularly be either submerged in water or
      thoroughly wetted down, or else it dries out in the air. A coral capuchin
      can survive out of water for a number of hours of equal to its
      Constitution score before it takes any negative effects. After this time,
      the creature takes 1d6 points of damage for every hour it remains dry.
      Bathing the creature in water of any sort resets this time frame.
Description:
  - >-
    Coral capuchins, when encountered outside of the water, look like a wizard's
    practical joke-they have the body of a small monkey, slick pink skin, a
    fishlike head, and membranous appendages that are a cross between a bat's
    wings and a fish's fins. They possess a monkey's innate intelligence and
    curiosity, displaying little fear of humanoids, but are also compulsive
    pickpockets that love the glimmer of gold and jewels, and posses the manual
    dexterity to relieve unsuspecting sailors and dockworkers of their
    hard-earned pay. An adult coral capuchin is a foot and a half in length,
    with a foot-long tail, a 4-foot wingspan, and a weight of 25 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Sages believe coral capuchins evolved from highly adaptive creatures living
    in the world's oceans. It is believed these creatures first developed as
    wholly aquatic creatures much like fish, and lived among brightly colored
    coral reefs where they used a form of camouf lage to hide and escape
    predation, much like a cuttlefish or octopus. The creatures developed
    multiple methods of locomotion through evolution, and these biological
    changes allowed these creatures to crawl from the sea and walk on land.
    Eventually their fins transformed into wings, granting the creature greater
    mobility, and the ability not only to breathe the air above the waves, but
    also to soar through it.
  - >-
    Coral capuchins are capable of surviving out of the water in their
    air-breathing form for part of the day, although they quickly deteriorate
    and die if they do not keep their bodies moist. They spend most of their
    lives below the waves, subsisting on small fish and all manner of
    vegetation, but often venture onto land to find a particularly tasty morsel,
    or to satisfy their overactive natural curiosity. They also love to fly and
    can often be seen circling the crow's nests of ships entering and leaving
    harbor. On land, they hunt small rodents, pick nuts and berries, and find
    the eggs of birds a particular delicacy. Coral capuchins also display an
    intense interest in the food and belongings of all manner of humanoid
    species. They are especially drawn to small, shiny objects, and can be
    counted on to abscond with anything interesting that is not nailed down.
    Coral capuchins' hands allow them to manipulate objects, but they cannot
    wield weapons.
  - >-
    A coral capuchin is born as a wholly aquatic creature. Young coral capuchins
    lack the ability to fly or leave the water until they reach adulthood after
    approximately their first year of life. They are an incredibly fecund race,
    and females can produce a clutch of up to 100 eggs three times a year,
    though local aquatic predators usually devour most of these.
  - >-
    Because of their dependence on returning to the water, some coral capuchins
    venturing too far inland risk stranding themselves. Explorers find the
    creatures sickly and weak, sprawled out on the jungle floor covered in
    biting ants or picked apart by predators as they lie there dying. Coral
    capuchins that die on land dry, out to a husk that often turns to dust
    leaving only its brittle bones behind.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Living in greater numbers along the southeastern coast of Garund, these
    creatures have slowly spread out, making their way north and east over the
    last few centuries. A large colony of the creatures resides off the coast
    south of Sargava and within the Lower Korir River Delta. The canopies of the
    Jungle of Hungry Trees and the jungles of the Kaava Lands ring with the
    calls of coral capuchins. An infestation of the clever creatures has
    recently plagued the port city of Senghor on the Fever Sea, and a city
    authority has begun offering a bounty on the creatures in an attempt to
    reduce their numbers. A few colonies of the creatures exist farther north,
    with some making their homes in the warmer waters of the Inner Sea, while
    other curious tribes of these mischievous creatures inhabit the warm waters
    of the Obari Ocean on Garund's western coast.
  - >-
    Coral capuchins live in tropical coastal areas, generally in small familial
    groups of fewer than 30 adults led by an older female. The first part of
    their name refers not only to their pinkish skin color, but also to their
    preferred nesting place-the coral reefs off of Garund's coast, where they
    make their homes in the countless caves and crevices found therein. They
    populate these vivid reefs to lay their eggs and hide among the protective
    growth, adapting their skin pigmentation to blend in.
  - >-
    Wholly unafraid of most humanoid species, coral capuchins are often
    domesticated by sailors and fisherman willing to put up with the creatures'
    incurable curiosity and penchant for petty larceny. They are often trained
    to fish for their masters, and are particularly sought after by those who
    make their living bringing up treasures from the ocean floor. Because of
    their love for shiny objects, they make excellent pearl divers, although it
    can sometimes be a struggle to get them to part with their treasures. Their
    voracious, omnivorous appetites also make them popular on long ocean
    voyages, as they are happy to reduce ships' endemic rat populations. Perhaps
    because of this, many sailors see them as good-luck mascots, although they
    are most popular with pirates, smugglers, and other such seafaring folk, who
    more willingly accept their thieving nature.

    Coral Capuchins as Familiars Despite their mercurial temperaments and
    propensity for theft, coral capuchins are prized by wizards because of the
    creatures' exceptional mobility and their strange cursed bite. This bite
    allows spellcasters greater ability to explore below the waves, as long as
    they pay close attention to their time outside of the water. Despite this
    benef it, coral capuchins are more popular among spellcasters who don't mind
    running afoul of the law, as the small creatures' thieving behavior is diff
    icult to fully control and often gets their masters into trouble. In
    addition, coral capuchins' need to stay moistened means they are better
    suited to serve as familiars for those living near water or willing to make
    compensations for this unusual physiology. Spellcasters of 3rd level or
    higher with an alignment within one step of neutral can gain a coral
    capuchin as a familiar by taking the Improved Familiar feat.
