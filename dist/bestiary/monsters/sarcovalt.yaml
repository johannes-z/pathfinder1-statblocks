Source: Inner Sea Gods
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Detach Head (Su)
    description: >-
      A sarcovalt can survive without its head. Attacks that sever its head
      (such as those of a vorpal weapon) do not kill it. If attacked by multiple
      creatures, it grapples one opponent, detaches its head (which continues to
      drain blood), and uses its body to continue attacking with spell-like
      abilities. Its head and body share a common pool of hit points but are
      otherwise treated as different creatures while separated. The head is AC
      19, touch 15, flat-footed 16 (+3 Dex, +4 natural, +2 size) and can fly at
      the creature's normal speed. The head cannot initiate attacks on its own,
      and if removed from a target, it flies back to the body on its next turn.
      The body cannot see, but it can perceive through the head's eye cavities
      if it has line of effect to the head.
  - name: Disease Swarm (Su)
    description: >-
      A sarcovalt's vomit swarm ability summons a cloud of flies instead of
      spiders, which has a fly speed of 40 feet (good) and infects its target
      with filth fever (DC 12) instead of poison.
  - name: Disease (Ex)
    description: >-
      Filth Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 15; onset 1d3 days; frequency 1
      day; effect 1d3 Dex and 1d3 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Description:
  - >-
    Sarcovalts are disgusting carrion-eating servants of Urgathoa that pick over
    the filth and the remnants of devoured souls in her planar realm. They have
    little personal identity and barely remember events more than a few hours
    old. While they are intelligent enough to converse and recognize their own
    kind, other servitors of the Pallid Princess, and daemons, they tend to
    think of other creatures as either threats or food. Sarcovalts sometimes
    work together to kill larger prey, but are usually content to eat scraps
    left behind by more powerful outsiders.
  - >-
    A sarcovalt resembles an enormous fly with a vulture's neck-but instead of a
    fleshy head, its head is the naked skull of a vulture with glistening black
    eyes.
  - >-
    When its skull is detached, its bald neck ends in a stump of tattered flesh.
    It savors the opportunity to drink blood, but cannot swallow it, and
    therefore its skull is normally painted with the life-f luid of its victims.
    In their eagerness to shred bodies, especially living flesh, these eager
    scavengers often get small treasure like amulets, rings, and other equipment
    worn close to the body trapped within their skulls. After letting such items
    rattle around in their heads for a few days, they unceremoniously vomit them
    up coated in the vile remains of their last several meals. Sarcovalts use
    their skulls similarly to how psychopomps wear masks, and the first
    sarcovalts might have been created in mockery of Pharasma's servants.
  - >-
    Servants of Urgathoa frequently summon sarcovalts to serve either as scouts
    and sentinels, or as menaces to sow fear and disease in places they seek to
    terrorize. In the best cases, a single sarcovalt can spread disease
    resulting in the deaths of dozens, giving Urgathoa's priests ample bodies to
    raise as undead or use in more terrible plots when they reveal themselves.
  - Sarcovalts measure 2 feet long and weigh 5 pounds.
