Description:
  - >-
    Officers are the captain's most trusted mates, individuals who see to it
    that their leader's orders are obeyed and ensure the ship's safety and
    autonomy. Many officers are either bards or fighters, though any seasoned
    buccaneer who gains the captain's trust may take on such a role. Dealing
    directly with grievances, identifying troublemakers, meting out punishments,
    and advising the captain are all part of a pirate officer's daily duties.
