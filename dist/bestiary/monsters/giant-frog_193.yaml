SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Tongue (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant frog's tongue is a primary attack with reach equal to three times
      the frog's normal reach (15 feet for a Medium giant frog). A giant frog's
      tongue deals no damage on a hit, but can be used to grab. A giant frog
      does not gain the grappled condition while using its tongue in this
      manner.
