  - name: Great Claw (Ex)
    description: >-
      One of the daughter's hands is a tremendous scythe-shaped claw. This
      attack inflicts x4 damage on a critical hit, and is treated as an evil
      weapon for the purposes of penetrating damage reduction. Spells A daughter
      of Urgathoa casts spells as a 6th-level cleric of Urgathoa-but although
      she selects two domains to determine bonus spells, she does not gain any
      domain powers.
Description:
  - >-
    Within the church of the goddess of undeath, few more coveted stations exist
    than daughter of Urgathoa, yet no high priest can bestow the title, and no
    living worshiper can take the role. Rather, daughters of Urgathoa are
    selected by the fickle goddess herself, chosen from her most zealous and
    accomplished priestesses only at the moment of their deaths.
  - >-
    Even after their transformations into things of pestilence and dead flesh,
    daughters of Urgathoa remain social beings who typically surround themselves
    with fanatical cults.
