  This mothlike creature has a long, three-pronged tail akin to peacock

Source: Inner Sea Gods
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      The Night Monarch's breath weapon creates sticky webbing (as the web
      universal monster ability). It can use this ability in the air to entangle
      flying creatures without requiring the use of anchor points to hold the
      web in place.
  - name: Dream Dust (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, the Night Monarch can flutter its wings to create
      a 30-foot burst of dust centered on itself. This dust affects creatures as
      deep slumber, but with no Hit Die limit (Will DC 25 negates). This ability
      is usable once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison Flesh (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature that bites the Night Monarch is exposed to black lotus
      extract poison (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 558). Eating the Night
      Monarch's flesh gives the attacker a -4 penalty on the poison's saving
      throw.
Description:
  - >-
    The Night Monarch serves the goddess Desna, and resembles a titanic moth or
    butterf ly with brightly colored wings. The shifting patterns depicted upon
    its wings always ref lect some aspect of the quest the goddess has willed it
    to take up. Depending on the herald's progress, these markings may resemble
    elaborate constellations and star shapes, swift blowing winds and clouds, or
    even harsh streaks of falling meteorites. Sighting the Night Monarch is
    thought to bring good luck and favorable dreams, which many hold to be
    visions from the goddess herself. The Herald of Desna's head rises 14 feet
    off the ground, and its body is about 30 feet long. It weighs approximately
    2,000 pounds.
