  flicks in and out of its mouth. The monster's powerful arms and legs end in
  filthy wicked claws that sport broken, black fingernails.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Evil (Su)
    description: >-
      A grimm constantly exudes an aura of evil around its form. This aura deals
      2d6 points of profane damage to all creatures in any space adjacent to the
      grimm. Evil creatures do not take this damage.
  - name: Blur (Su)
    description: >-
      As a move action, a grimm can blur its form (as the spell of the same
      name). This grants it concealment (20% miss chance).
  - name: Devour (Su)
    description: >-
      If a grimm pins a grappled creature, it deals 1d6 points of Strength drain
      each round the pin is maintained. Each time the grimm drains Strength, it
      gains a +1 bonus to its Strength score. These bonus points are temporary
      and the grimm loses them at the rate of 1 per hour.
  - name: Ethereal Jaunt (Su)
    description: >-
      A grimm can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as part of
      any move action and shift back again as a free action. It can remain on
      the Ethereal Plane for 3 rounds before returning to the Material Plane.
      The ability otherwise resembles the spell of the same name (caster level
      20th).
  - name: Fey Spell Resistance (Ex)
    description: >-
      Against fey magic (spells or spell-like abilities used by any fey creature
      including elves) a grimm's spell resistance is 28.
Description:
  - >-
    A grimm is perhaps one of the most evil of all fey. Conceived and created by
    members of the Unseelie Court, the monster's only purpose seems to be the
    destruction of life and that which is beautiful. Legends among the fairy
    folk say powerful members of the Unseelie Court (specific legends say a
    circle of powerful quicklings sorcerers are the grimm's creators) created
    this fell beast to avenge the death of their own who were slain in battle
    when the Unseelie Court and Seelie Court did battle.
  - >-
    Grimms dwell in the deepest and darkest mountains making their lairs in deep
    recesses or hard to access caves and caverns, venturing forth only to kill
    and to eat. Grimms prefer a diet of meat, particularly good-aligned fey
    creatures, but they are not particularly picky and will gladly eat anything
    (or anyone) that crosses their path. Slain prey that is not immediately
    eaten is stored in the grimm's lair for later consumption.
  - >-
    These creatures are highly territorial and do not associate with other
    creatures, not even their own kind.
  - >-
    A grimm stands 9 feet tall and weighs in excess of 1,200 pounds. Stout and
    powerfully built, its body teems with muscle and is always covered in a
    glossy sheen.
  - >-
    A grimm opens combat slashing with its claws and gnashing with its terrible
    bite. If it can grab a foe, it does so, pinning it and draining its strength
    in order to increase its own. If fairing poorly, a grimm employs its
    spell-like abilities and blur special ability. Against overwhelming odds, a
    grimm shifts to the Ethereal Plane to avoid its foes.
