SpecialAbilities:
  - name: s Dagger (Su)
    description: >-
      The dagger wielded by a guardian doll is treated as a masterwork weapon
      and delivers 1d6 points of cold damage in addition to its normal damage.
      Those struck by the dagger must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be
      paralyzed by the supernatural cold of the weapon for 1d4 rounds. If the
      guardian doll is destroyed, its weapon becomes a useless child's toy. The
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Soul Focus (Su)
    description: >-
      The soul bound to the doll lives within a focus integrated into the doll
      or its apparel, typically one of the doll's eyes or a gem embedded into
      its neck or chest. As long as this soul focus remains intact, it can be
      used to animate another doll, using the same cost as creating a new
      construct. Once bound into the soul focus, the soul continues to learn. If
      it is put into a new doll body, the soul retains its personality and
      memories from its previous bodies. A soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit
      points, and a break DC of 20. Susceptible to Mind-Affecting
  - name: Effects (Ex)
    description: >-
      Like a soulbound doll, a guardian doll is susceptible to mind-affecting
      effects. However, due to the singular purpose with which it is imbued, its
      saves against such effects are made with a +1 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Guardian dolls are constructs created by the White Witches to serve as spies
    and sentries at places that require ever-vigilant wardens-especially the
    wintry nation's borders. Similar to soulbound dolls (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary
    2 255), these strange automatons are infused with fragments of the souls of
    living beings slain during the dolls' creation. The doll is sentient, and
    though a small part of the soul's original personality remains, the witchery
    employed largely strips it of its individuality. Many guardian dolls sit
    inside another form of construct-a sentinel hut- and stand vigil at one of
    Irrisen's borders and monitoring those who would enter. Others are sent on
    scouting missions or to spy on targets, usually posing as inanimate dolls to
    hide their true nature.
  - Construction
  - >-
    A guardian doll's body is made of porcelain or wood, plus one exquisite item
    worth at least 600 gp to serve as the soul focus. Creation requires a soul
    fragment from a dead creature that dies at some point during the creation of
    the doll. An unwilling soul can resist with a successful DC 20 Will save.
    Stripping a soul fragment from a dead creature does not prevent the rest of
    the soul from continuing to the afterlife, nor does it prevent the body from
    being resurrected or raised from the dead.
