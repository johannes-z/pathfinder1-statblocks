  Barely contained in thick glass, this deformed humanoid creature wriggles in
  its jar.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Attach (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a pickled punk hits with a bite attack, it automatically grapples its
      foe, though the target is not considered to be grappling the punk. Each
      round the pickled punk is grappling its foe, it automatically deals bite
      damage each round.
  - name: Death Throes (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a pickled punk is destroyed, it discorporates into a fleshy sludge.
      Any creatures adjacent to a pickled punk when it is destroyed must succeed
      at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round.
  - name: Irritant (Ex)
    description: >-
      The water in a pickled punk's jar is highly irritating to all living
      creatures. A creature damaged by a pickled punk's bite that deals damage
      to pickled punk with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, or that otherwise
      comes into contact with a pickled punk or the water in its jar, must
      succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or break out in an itching rash. A
      creature affected by this rash takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity and
      Charisma for 24 hours (multiple allergic reactions do not stack). Remove
      disease or any magical healing removes the rash instantly. This is a
      disease effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Opportune (Ex)
    description: >-
      Though Tiny, a pickled punk can extend its deformed limbs to make attacks
      of opportunity as if it had a reach of 5 feet. This ability doesn't allow
      a pickled punk to attack adjacent creatures as if it truly had a reach of
      5 feet.
Description:
  - >-
    Grotesque curiosities, pickled punks are deformed, often-humanoid fetuses
    raised by necromancers and stored in jars of embalming fluid. Every pickled
    punk is different and the level of deformity spans a spectrum between the
    mildly lopsided to the utterly unfathomable. Though they seem harmless at
    first- even laughable-pickled punks are hungry creatures that attack without
    provocation when freed from their jars. Some pickled punks rock and wriggle
    in their jars in hopes of falling off a shelf or table and shattering their
    glass prison (such jars typically have hardness 1 and 2 hit points). Once
    freed, a pickled punk pulls itself across the ground with its malformed
    limbs in search of sustenance. Unless weaned from its taste for blood or
    constantly controlled, pickled punks become a danger to their creators. Some
    necromancers (especially those on the edge of sanity) and some intelligent
    undead cultivate a fondness for pickled punks and regard them as their
    children. They talk to their various jars in cooing tones and are known to
    even carry around favored specimens on outings and social calls, often
    granting them names and imagined personalities.
