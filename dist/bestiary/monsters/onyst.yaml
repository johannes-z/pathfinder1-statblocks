SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Command Elementals (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an elemental lord can attempt to gain control of any
      elemental creature of the same element within 100 feet. Elementals receive
      a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10
      + 1/2 the elemental lord's + its Charisma modifier. Elementals that make
      their save are immune to the command of that elemental lord for one day.
      Elementals that fail their saves fall under the elemental lord's control,
      obeying its commands to the best of their ability. An elemental lord does
      not need to concentrate to maintain control over commanded elementals.
      Once commanded, an elemental serves until either it dies, the elemental
      lord dies, the elemental lord dismisses it, or the summoning magic ends
      (if the elemental was summoned). An elemental lord can command any number
      of elementals, so long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed twice the
      elemental lord's Hit Dice. If an elemental creature is under the control
      of another creature, the elemental lord can attempt an opposed Charisma
      check to gain control of the elemental.
  - name: Earth Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      Onyst can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth
      except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against
      fire damage, he can even glide through lava. His burrowing leaves behind
      no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of his
      presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing him flings him
      back 30 feet, stunning him for 1 round unless he succeeds on a DC 15
      Fortitude save.
  - name: Earth Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Onyst gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both he and his foe
      are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, Onyst
      takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to
      bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether Onyst is initiating or resisting
      these kinds of attacks. (These modifiers are not included in the
      statistics block.)
Description:
  - >-
    Onyst makes his home in a gigantic complex of caverns hollowed into the side
    of an enormous mountain of stone on the Plane of Earth. He is constantly
    attended by various earth elementals, stone giants, and xorn. He has a blue
    dragon of advanced age; some say the dragon serves as advisor and counsel,
    others say it is nothing more than a pet.
  - >-
    In battle, Onyst likes to pound his foes with his enormous fists. Creatures
    that prove meddlesome are turned to stone and then pulverized, their remains
    scattered to the winds.
