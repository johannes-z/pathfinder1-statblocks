Description:
  - >-
    The average pirate is a free-spirited renegade who would have great
    difficulty surviving in the cultured depths of polite, civilized society.
    Rogues and fighters typically make up the majority of a pirate ship's crew
    of sailors, as they possess both the skill and brawn necessary for
    day-to-day raids and heists. These colorful, adventurous characters chafe at
    society's laws and restrictions, and the exciting life of the buccaneer is
    well suited to pirates' ferocious independence.
