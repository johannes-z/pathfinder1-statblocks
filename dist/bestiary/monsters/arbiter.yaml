      superiors. It cannot sense the range to this inevitable.
Description:
  - >-
    Stealthy, observant, and frequently persuasive, arbiter inevitables are the
    scouts and diplomats of the inevitable race. Found throughout the multiverse
    in courts and on battlefields, arbiters keep a close eye on the forces of
    chaos and do their best to keep the lawful from straying, while
    simultaneously winning over the hearts and minds of those who might yet be
    saved. Though their assorted abilities make them extremely useful, arbiters
    see themselves less as servants than as advisers and counselors, preferring
    to ride around on their summoners' shoulders and help guide their "partners"
    on the path of law. They detest being summoned by chaotic individuals, and
    when teamed with such a creature, they aren't above using Diplomacy to try
    to inf luence the summoner's friends or refusing to undertake actions that
    seem contrary to their programming. An arbiter who comes across evidence of
    a significant insurgence of chaos upon a given plane does everything in its
    power to rally its allies against the dangerous instability, and in
    situations that are clearly beyond its ability to handle, it may refuse to
    continue onward until the group agrees to help it reach the nearest greater
    inevitable and make a full report, or else may travel to Utopia itself and
    present its urgent information in person. Arbiters typically bear the shapes
    of tiny clockwork spheres with shiny metal wings. Generally peaceful unless
    combating true creatures of chaos, arbiters prefer to cast protection from
    chaos on their allies and use command to make opponents drop their weapons
    and run. Their most powerful weapon, the ability to release their internal
    energy as a deadly burst, is reserved for dire need and battles of the
    utmost service to law, as the resulting period of darkness while they're
    powered down is the only thing that seems to truly scare the tiny
    automatons. An arbiter inevitable can serve a spellcaster as a familiar.
    Such a spellcaster must be lawful neutral, must be at least caster level
    7th, and must have the Improved Familiar feat. Arbiter inevitables measure 1
    foot in diameter but are surprisingly heavy, weighing 60 pounds. Their
    ability to fly on metal wings is as much a supernatural ability as a
    physical one.
