    description: >-
      Any creature within 30 feet viewing a fachan must succeed on a DC 16 Will
      save or be shaken for 1d4+2 rounds. A creature that makes its save is
      immune to the horrific visage of that fachan for one day. The save DC is
      Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. One-Legged

    description: >-
      Fachans are surprisingly nimble while hopping on their single leg. This
      unusual mode of movement allows the fachans to ignore the effects of
      difficult terrain on movement and makes it impossible to trip.
  - name: Powerful Grip (Ex)
    description: >-
      A fachan can wield a two-handed weapon in its single hand, gaining all the
      usual benefits for wielding a two-handed weapon.
Description:
  - >-
    Fachans are foul-tempered and foul-smelling beasts with a taste for human
    flesh. Despite having only one leg and arm, they are extremely agile. Having
    only one eye does not hamper their vision any more than one leg hampers
    their mobility. Some sages believe fachans are an offshoot of one of the
    giant races while others believe fachans are the deformed offspring of a
    failed hill giant and ogre or cyclops mating. These creatures are shunned by
    other giant races, except hill giants with whom they have a distant but
    tolerable relationship. They rarely associate with other races for any
    reason.
  - >-
    Fachans take up residence wherever they can find a warm, dry spot. They are
    not against building huts and hovels when they must, but they prefer the
    convenience of driving out the residents of an existing structure and
    claiming it as their own. They are most often encountered in wastelands and
    swamps. Fachan villages can consist of up to 30 individuals plus 30%
    noncombatant young. Fachan leaders are always fighters or barbarians.
  - >-
    Fachans stand 12 feet tall and weigh 1,000 pounds. Their hair is unkempt and
    matted. Skin tone is usually bronze or brown, and their hair is dark.
  - >-
    A fachan makes for an odd opponent at best. It most often attempts a bull
    rush against its largest foe in the first round of combat, and tries to
    avoid spellcasters. After this, it moves in with its melee attacks.
