SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Link (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a standard action, the Blood Queen may psychically
      link to up to 23 Hit Dice of kuru within 100 feet of either itself or one
      of its kuru surrogates; it may choose which specific kuru it would like to
      affect with this ability, but HD that are not sufficient to affect a
      creature are wasted. Any kuru linked to in this way must succeed at a DC
      28 Will save or be forced to carry out the Blood Queen's telepathic
      commands to the best of its ability. In addition, a linked kuru gains a +4
      morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and is immune to mind-affecting
      effects. The blood link lasts for 1 minute or until the Blood Queen ends
      the effect (a free action). When the blood link is broken, the affected
      kuru takes 1 point of Intelligence damage and cannot be linked to again
      for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Horrifying Bellow (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a standard action, the Blood Queen can release a
      terrifying bellow that affects a 30-foot-radius spread. Any creature
      within the affected area must succeed at a DC 34 Will save or be paralyzed
      for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Surrogate Senses (Su)
    description: >-
      In addition to its blindsight, the Blood Queen can constantly see and hear
      through its unholy kuru surrogates as though with a permanent
      clairaudience/ clairvoyance spell. If at any time one of the Blood Queen's
      surrogates is killed, it is dazed for 1 round.
  - name: Unholy Gestation (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever the Blood Queen swallows an unconscious humanoid or renders a
      humanoid unconscious with its swallow whole ability, it moves the victim
      through its digestive track, where the victim no longer takes damage, but
      rather begins to gestate within the Blood Queen's transformative stomach
      for 1d4 rounds. After the creature has finished gestating, it is
      regurgitated from the hindquarters of the Blood Queen, encased in an
      opaque mucous pod. Any attempt to remove a gestated humanoid from its pod
      causes massive system shock, and the humanoid takes 6d6 points of damage
      unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Fortitude save or those releasing it succeed
      at a DC 25 Heal check. As a swift action, the Blood Queen can send strong
      telepathic emanations to any pod within 100 feet, causing it to violently
      explode. The resulting spray of bilious ooze deals 6d6 points of acid
      damage to the creature encased in the pod and to any creatures in a
      15-foot-radius burst. Alternatively, the Blood Queen may allow an encased
      humanoid to continue to gestate for at least 24 hours, and after that
      duration may release the fully metamorphosed creature from its pod at any
      point. When released, the victim completes its transformation into a kuru
      surrogate (see the Kuru Surrogate section below). The Blood Queen may
      create any number of pods, but can only possess up to six kuru surrogates
      at any one time (if the Blood Queen releases a seventh kuru surrogate from
      its mucus pod, the oldest surrogate immediately dies no matter where it is
      and the Blood Queen is dazed for 1 round). The save DCs are
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Millennia ago, when the repugnant cyclops empire of Ghol-Gan populated the
    Shackles, its foul and alien gods sent powerful servants from beyond to act
    as their intermediaries, guiding and corrupting the empire until its
    ignominious collapse, at which point the gods and their minions fled
    Golarion altogether. However, one of these vile servants remained even after
    Ghol-Gan's collapse, a wretched horror known as the Blood Queen. It has
    dwelt for centuries in its foul subterranean chamber in a ruined Ghol-Gan
    temple called Ganagsau in the Cannibal Isles, and it was this blasphemous
    being who transformed the kuru into the degenerate race they are today,
    convincing them that it is a living goddess worthy of their veneration. The
    Blood Queen has a kuru high priest who goes by the name Bukrugsor, and this
    devoted thrall sees to it that his dark patron is brought regular
    sacrificial victims and offerings of blood.
  - >-
    The Blood Queen has no eyes, per se-rather, what look like angry pustules
    all over its bloated body act as sensory organs. In addition, it is able to
    see and hear the world through the various kuru surrogates its followers
    have interspersed throughout the Cannibal Isles. Its grotesque mouth is
    capable of articulating a number of languages, though if it deigns to speak
    with a creature it usually does so via its telepathy. While the Blood Queen
    uses the short tentacles that extend from its mouth to devour prey and
    sacrificial offerings, the tentacles that emanate from its hindquarters are
    long, muscular, and tipped with bonelike stingers that allow it to
    manipulate objects and electrify victims.
  - >-
    The Blood Queen is nearly immobile, being a massive, swollen beast that sits
    in the middle of a huge underground temple chamber in its ruined cathedral.
    While it may slowly undulate its bulk in one direction or another, in the
    years since its appearance on Golarion, the Blood Queen has grown far too
    large to fit through any of the limestone chamber's exits. Only the Blood
    Queen's high priest, those destined to become surrogate kuru, or sacrifices
    to the behemoth monster are allowed within this foul throne room. Sometimes
    unwilling sacrifices are dropped into the chamber from a hole in the ceiling
    and the exits are sealed so that the Blood Queen may toy with its food
    before it feeds. A being of monumental evil, the Blood Queen expresses its
    rage at its divine abandonment by spreading as much pain and havoc as it
    can. Whether it ever escapes its ancient, self-made prison remains to be
    seen, though all right-thinking creatures that know of its existence shudder
    at the prospect.
  - >-
    Kuru Surrogates The Blood Queen's favored deacons are known as kuru
    surrogates, and such monstrosities are created when the horror digests a
    creature and entombs the victim in one of its paralytic sacs for long
    enough. The creature that emerges is essentially brain-dead, having been
    completely stripped of its wits and nervous system. A kuru surrogate remains
    in its vegetative state until it starves, is killed, or is affected by a
    heal spell or a similar effect of equal or greater power. Kuru surrogates
    are revered among the Blood Queen's devout, who transport the immobile
    things around the Cannibal Isles, perpetually caring for the "blessed"
    individuals. The Blood Queen acts through these surrogates and uses them to
    augment and command its kuru followers, linking with its minions in order to
    capture any who oppose it or its wicked cult of cannibals.
