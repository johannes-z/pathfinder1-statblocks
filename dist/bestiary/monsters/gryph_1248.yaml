SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Grab (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gryph can use its grab attack on a creature of up to Medium size. It has
      a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks to maintain a grapple (in addition to
      the +4 from the grab ability).
  - name: Implant Eggs (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a gryph can implant eggs into a helpless target or a target
      it is grappling. As a fullround action, the gryph extends an ovipositor
      from its abdomen and penetrates the victim's flesh by making a successful
      sting attack (+5 melee). On a hit, the ovipositor deals 1 point of damage
      and implants 1d4 eggs in the victim. The eggs draw nutrients from the
      target's flesh, and give the target the sickened condition. The eggs grow
      swiftly, hatching in a mere 1d4 minutes into ravenous gryph chicks that
      immediately burrow out of the victim's body. This deals 2 points of
      Constitution damage per gryph chick, after which the hatchlings
      immediately take wing and fly away (if needed, use game statistics for a
      bat familiar to represent a hatchling). Removing implanted eggs requires a
      DC 20 Heal check (a full-round action); each attempt deals 1 hit point of
      damage. Although immunity to disease offers no special protection against
      gryph egg implantation, remove disease, heal, or similar effects
      automatically destroy any implanted gryph eggs.
Description:
  - >-
    Gryphs are bird-like creatures usually found underground, but they also
    favor dark and tangled forests. Gryphs normally survive on carrion and small
    animals, but take on larger game when driven by hunger or if they feel
    threatened.
  - >-
    Most disturbing is their means of reproduction. Gryphs are hermaphroditic
    and mate frequently, such that their egg pouches are rarely empty. When they
    encounter a suitable host-a warm-blooded creature of size Small or larger,
    ideally alone-the gryphs swoop down, latch on to the target, and implant
    their eggs directly into its flesh.
  - >-
    As long as the target is conscious, the flock continues its assault, though
    if the target flees the area, the gryphs return to their nest. The eggs
    quicken swiftly once implanted, and gryph chicks hatch forth mere minutes
    later in a bloody birth that is often fatal to the host.
  - >-
    Gryphs have a strange affinity for vermin, often lairing in close proximity
    to one or more insect swarms or vermin of Medium size or smaller. The
    insects avoid the gryphs instinctively, feeding off the remains of the
    flock's meals and on creatures too small for the gryphs to bother with.
  - >-
    Most gryphs have six legs, but some have four or even eight. Individual
    flocks are always made up of gryphs with the same number of limbs. A gryph
    is 3 feet tall and weighs 45 pounds.
