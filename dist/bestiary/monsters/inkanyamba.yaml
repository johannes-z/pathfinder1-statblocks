Description_Visual: >-
  This monstrous serpent rises to a great height, unfurling an opalescent hood
  the size of a tower shield. Swaying from side to side, the creature drops open
  its elongated jaw to reveal an assortment of different-sized fangs. As it
  hisses, lightning slashes the storm-gray sky behind it.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, an inkanyamba can spit a 60-foot line of venom at
      its foes as a standard action. Any creatures struck must make a DC 23
      Reflex save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage and be blinded for
      1d6 rounds. A successful save halves the Constitution damage (minimum 1
      point) and negates the blindness.
  - name: Hold Breath (Ex)
    description: >-
      An inkanyamba can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times
      its Constitution score before it risks drowning or suffocating.
  - name: Hypnotic Sway (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, an inkanyamba can unfurl its hood and sway back
      and forth. Any nonmindless creature within 30 feet that views an
      inkanyamba's hypnotic sway must make a DC 23 Will save or be fascinated
      for 1d4 rounds. Any attack by the inkanyamba breaks the fascination
      effect. Any creature that successfully saves or has the fascination effect
      broken cannot be affected by the same inkanyamba's hypnotic sway for 24
      hours.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      An inkanyamba's body contains a host of different venoms. Once per round
      as a swift action, it can change which ability score its poison affects.
      Vacillating Venom: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 4
      rounds, effect 1d4 ability damage, cure 1 save. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Venomsense (Ex)
    description: >-
      An inkanyamba that makes physical contact with a living creature through
      either its bite, tail slap, or constriction ability gains an automatic
      knowledge of the target's ability scores, allowing the inkanyamba to
      better use its protean venom on its victims.
Description:
  - >-
    Sometimes called elder serpents, inkanyambas are enormous, malevolent
    snake-like creatures that dwell in tropical lakes and deep jungle rivers.
    Measuring over 60 feet long and weighing nearly 3,000 pounds, an inkanyamba
    resembles a dense snake with a vaguely crocodilian head, filled with
    multiple sets of fangs of varying lengths. Its long body is covered in
    multicolored scales that range from emerald green to golden and even
    vermilion. Males have larger hoods than females, who also have small,
    pointed frills running the length of their bodies.
  - Inkanyambas live for centuries; their maximum possible lifespan is unknown.
  - >-
    Ecology Larger than the biggest constrictors and possessing more venom than
    a hundred asps, the inkanyamba combines the deadliest and most efficient
    predatory traits of serpentkind with a diabolical intelligence. Able to
    attack from the water or the land, an inkanyamba is always the top predator
    in its region, capable of devouring prey as large and formidable as rhinos,
    dire crocodiles, and even elephants. Sages once thought that the
    inkanyamba's elongated head was evidence of the creature being crossed with
    some other species, suggesting magic in the inkanyamba's origin.
  - >-
    In reality, the inkanyamba's long skull is necessary to house the numerous
    glands storing the creature's venom.
  - >-
    Once thought to be a shifting, mutating poison, the inkanyamba actually
    carries several different toxins in its body, each type linked to a
    different set of fangs within the creature's mouth. Making this ability even
    more potent, all inkanyambas have a latticework of small sensory organs
    inside their mouths and throughout their bodies in the small spaces between
    scales. When an inkanyamba makes physical contact with a living creature,
    these sensory organs detail the target's physiology in a manner that allows
    the inkanyamba to know which of its many types of venom would be deadliest.
    Additionally, special ducts on the inside of the inkanyamba's frontmost
    fangs allow the creature to spray gouts of venom up to great distances.
  - >-
    Although an inkanyamba can only spit a single life-sapping venom, this spray
    needs only to make contact with a target to take effect and can blind
    victims caught in its blast.
  - >-
    Even without their fabled variety of poisons, inkanyambas are capable
    predators. When an inkanyamba unfurls its massive hood and sways back and
    forth, a scintillating pattern of multi-hued scales on the inside of the
    creature's neck can cause a hypnotic state in those that observe it.
  - >-
    Inkanyambas often use this ability to approach targets on land or when
    confronted with multiple enemies. Once a target has been bitten, an
    inkanyamba can throw the rest of its body forward like a coiled rope, biting
    and then wrapping the victim in the creature's crushing body.
  - Inkanyambas dwell near large lakes and deep rivers.
  - >-
    Such locations not only allow them to attack from the cover of water, but
    inkanyambas also lair in underwater caves where pockets of air have become
    trapped. Such nests are inaccessible to most intruders and allow the great
    serpents to slumber safely after gorging themselves.
  - >-
    Habitat & Society Inkanyambas are solitary creatures except for the brief
    couplings that occur during mating. They favor areas that are populated by
    both animal life and human settlements. Pathfinders chronicling the history
    of the Mwangi Expanse have recounted instances of human and lizardfolk
    tribes alike revering inkanyambas as gods. In such cases, the monsters use
    their ability to control the weather and call up storms to create false
    portents that instill awe in the local inhabitants, extorting offerings and
    even living sacrifices from their terrified "subjects." Cruel, malicious,
    and accustomed to being worshiped, inkanyambas are likely to attack anything
    they perceive as a threat. When facing well-prepared or powerful opponents,
    inkanyambas retreat deep beneath the closest body of water to exert their
    control over weather, using high winds to ground airborne opponents and
    thunderstorms to bolster their ability to summon lightning. If threatened,
    inkanyambas prefer escape to surrender, but some have been known to parlay
    with powerful groups of adventurers, usually to help the serpent acquire an
    item that it cannot gain for itself. Such offers, however, are never
    genuine, as all inkanyambas seek only their own selfish ends.
  - >-
    In the depths of the Mwangi Expanse, the Zenj have a saying: "Speaking to an
    inkanyamba only gives it time to encircle you."
