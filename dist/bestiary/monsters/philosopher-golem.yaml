SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A philosopher golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that
      allows spell resistance . In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature as noted: A shatter spell deals damage to
      a philosopher golem as if it were a crystalline creature. A keen edge
      spell affects a philosopher golem's slam attacks as if they were slashing
      weapons. A magical attack that deals cold damage slows a philosopher golem
      (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds (no saving throw). A magical attack that
      deals fire damage ends any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of
      damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the
      amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit
      points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A philosopher golem
      gets no saving throw against fire effects. Spells When a philosopher golem
      is created, it is programmed with spells. The creator can add as many or
      as few spells as desired up to the limit of the golem's caster level. A
      philosopher golem has a caster level equal to one-half its Hit Dice. A
      philosopher golem does not require any spell components or focuses to cast
      its spells, and once a spell is cast, it is expended until the golem
      recharges it. To recharge its expended spells, a philosopher golem must
      remain idle (resting, more or less) for 8 hours.
Description:
  - >-
    The philosopher golem is a completely self-aware construct, designed as an
    aid to powerful spellcasters. The philosopher golem is subservient to its
    master but acts more as a companion and confidant, having its own mind as to
    choices of right and wrong or good and evil. Philosopher golems are often
    used as proxies in the crafting of dangerous magical items by their creators
    who use the philosopher golem in the handling of volatile spell components
    or in the acquisition of reagents from hostile environments. Philosopher
    golems can, or so it is rumored, teach other spellcasters the spells they
    have programmed if the spellcaster is of sufficient level to cast the spell.
    A philosopher golem cannot change its programmed spells, but its creator or
    another spellcaster can. Spells can be added, removed, or changed by the
    creator or another spellcaster.
  - >-
    Philosopher golems are most often found in the employ of wizards, sorcerers,
    and clerics. In combat, philosopher golem uses its programmed spells and
    powerful slam attacks to dispatch its foes. It can also attack with its
    platinum rod (treat as a club).
  - Reprogramming a Philosopher Golem
  - >-
    A spellcaster can add, remove, or change the philosopher golem's programmed
    spells.
  - Adding a New Programmed Spell
  - >-
    The following rules apply when adding a new spell to an existing philosopher
    golem.
  - >-
    The philosopher golem must have available spell slots. A golem has as many
    spell slots as would a spellcaster equal to its caster level.
  - >-
    A new spell can only be added in a spell slot of the spell's level or
    higher.
  - >-
    The spellcaster must be able to cast the spell to be added and must have
    access to it (that is, it must appear on his spell list and he must have
    access to it via spellbook, prepared spell or known spell, scroll, etc.)
  - >-
    Adding a new spell takes 1 hour per spell level and the spellcaster must
    expend a number of gold pieces equal to the spell's level x the philosopher
    golem's caster level x 500 gp. 0th level spells cost one-half this price.
    The spellcaster makes a Spellcraft check (DC 20 if the spellcaster is the
    golem's creator; DC 25 if not + the spell's level). If successful, the new
    spell is added to the golem. If the check fails, both time and cost are
    wasted.
  - Removing a Programmed Spell
  - >-
    Removing a programmed spell from a philosopher golem takes 1 hour per spell
    level and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. Modify the DC as follows (add
    all that apply).
  - Circumstance DC
  - Spellcaster is not the golem's creator +5
  - Spell doesn't appear on spellcaster's list (or doesn't know the spell) +5
  - Spell is of a higher level than spellcaster can cast +5 per level over
  - >-
    If the Spellcraft check succeeds, the spell is removed. If the check fails,
    the spell is not removed. The spellcaster can try again, but the DC to
    remove that spell increases by +5 each time he fails this check.
  - Changing a Programmed Spell
  - >-
    Changing a spell requires the spellcaster to first remove the spell (using
    the rules above), and then add the spell to the golem (using the rules
    above).
  - Construction
  - >-
    A philosopher golem's body is chiseled from a single block of lapis lazuli,
    weighing at least 2,000 pounds. The lapis lazuli must be of exceptional
    quality, and costs 10,000 gp.
