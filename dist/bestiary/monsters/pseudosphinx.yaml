SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aided Insight (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a pseudosphinx can tap into the wisdom of its ancestors to
      answer a question for another creature. To do so, the pseudosphinx
      attempts a Wisdom check, gaining a bonus on the check equal to the
      querent's level and treating the result of the check as the result of an
      appropriate Knowledge check. The pseudosphinx must be touching the querent
      to use this ability.
Description:
  - >-
    Pseudosphinxes are cat-sized, fairylike creatures thought to be distant
    cousins to the larger and better-known true sphinxes. They most resemble
    gynosphinxes, though the pseudosphinxes' monkeylike heads and tiny bodies
    ensure that the two species are never confused for each other. A typical
    pseudosphinx is 2 feet long and weighs 10 pounds.
  - >-
    Pseudosphinxes are rarely found in groups, and scholars are unsure whether
    to attribute their cryptic origins to elusive demeanors or amnesic memories.
    Whether they're the misbegotten progeny of generations of lesser sphinxes or
    the result of some magical experiment in the same deserts where sphinxes are
    found, none can say.
  - >-
    A pseudosphinx can serve as the familiar for a 7th-level spellcaster with
    the Improved Familiar feat.
