  An immense boulder-like creature emerges from the earth. It props itself upon
  two large legs and feet, which also seem to serve as the creatures hands. Two
  large recesses on its surface function as eyes and its moth stretches wide.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animate Boulders (Sp)
    description: >-
      A geon can animate rocks within 180 feet at will, controlling up to two
      rocks at a time. Boulders move at a speed of 10 feet and fight as a geon
      in all respects. Animated boulders lose their ability to move if the geon
      that animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. The ability is
      otherwise similar to liveoak (caster level 15th), but affects rocks rather
      than trees. Animated boulders have the same vulnerability to cold that a
      geon has.
Description:
  - >-
    Geons are natives of the Elemental Plane of Earth. They are sometimes
    summoned by powerful spellcasters to do their bidding, usually acting as
    protectors or guardians. Some, however, find their way to the Material Plane
    on their own when a portal between the two planes opens. On the Material
    Plane, geons are found in mountains, barren hills, and other rocky
    environments.
  - >-
    Most geons have been given a task by an earth god and live to faithfully
    carry out that task.
  - >-
    A geon's voice is low and rumbling, sounding like stones grinding together
    whenever the creature speaks.
  - >-
    Geons shun combat if possible, using their special abilities to hide in the
    surrounding earth. If the geon has a task and that task is threatened, the
    guardian does not hesitate to enter combat or use its abilities to animate
    boulders to attack its foes and create walls of stone to contain them.
