Description:
  - >-
    Swamp trolls are large, stocky, dark gray or brown hunched humanoids. Their
    flesh is slick and slimy like moss. Swamp trolls make their lairs deep in
    swampland and marshes away from more settled areas, but not far enough away
    where they cannot hunt humans if game and other food runs scarce in the
    swamps. Swamp trolls are 7-foot tall hunched humanoids and weigh about 400
    pounds. Swamp trolls are aggressive predators that attack living creatures
    on sight (especially when a swamp troll is hungry). When hunting a swamp
    troll moves quietly along, easing closer to its prey and then finally
    striking with its claws and bite when within range. Swamp trolls rarely
    fight to the death unless threatened or hungry. Swamp Troll Characters Swamp
    troll characters possess the following racial traits. +8 Strength, +4
    Dexterity, +10 Constitution, -4 Intelligence (minimum 3), -2 Wisdom, -6
