SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dweomer Leap (Su)
    description: >-
      When a dweomercat is targeted by a spell or within the area of effect of a
      spell, it can, as a swift action, choose to teleport to a square adjacent
      to the spell's caster, effectively appearing mid-leap and aimed toward the
      caster. This ability takes effect regardless of whether or not the spell
      overcomes the dweomercat's spell resistance. If it chooses, the dweomercat
      can immediately make a full attack against the spell's caster as though
      pouncing. Using this ability does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If
      there is no safe space adjacent to the caster-or if the dweomercat
      chooses-the dweomercat can forgo using this ability.
Description:
  - >-
    Powerful and regal, dweomercats stalk the First World, preying upon lesser
    creatures, but more voraciously hunting new and ever stranger sources of
    magic. Beings as much composed of sculpted arcane eddies as of flesh and
    blood, these capricious felines flourish along the intangible ley lines of
    their home realm, drinking in its weird powers as a plant thrives on light.
    Yet even more potent than their thirst for magic and the euphoria they draw
    from being in proximity to the reshaping of reality is dweomercats' racial
    curiosity, which leads them endlessly across the First World-and often
    beyond. The average adult dweomercat is about 4 feet tall and 7 feet long,
    weighing over 250 pounds, while their cubs are approximately 1 foot tall and
    weigh no more than 15 pounds. Ecology A newly born dweomercat cub is
    connected to its homeland by only a thin tether of fey magic, and can only
    tap into its true potential during the instant a spell is cast upon it. The
    burst of magical energy brought forth by a freshly cast spell momentarily
    intensifies the bond between the First World and the dweomercat. This link
    manifests itself clumsily as a sort of sudden teleportation that heaves the
    fey cat through space and time toward the source of the spell, fueled by the
    magnetic reaction between the dweomercat and the magic's origin. A
    dweomercat grows not by the passage of time, but through direct exposure to
    fey magic. Thus, a dweomercat cub on the Material Plane is stunted
    developmentally. Though it ages and gains experience and practical wisdom
    anywhere, only by spending several lifetimes on the First World can the cub
    reach adulthood. Once it has reached this stage, however, a fully grown
    dweomercat may freely travel between its native land and the Material Plane
    without adverse effects. Habitat & Society In the First World, dweomercats
    travel in packs while hunting. Beyond this predatory advantage, however,
    they have little use for organized society, as the evershifting nature of
    their homeland impedes it anyway. Dweomercats that are born on or come to be
    stranded on the Material Plane are often forced to live on their own. Cut
    off from the direct magical eddies of the First World, dweomercat cubs prove
    unable to grow into adults. While they might become slightly stronger and
    more learned, they never reach the size and prowess of those constantly
    subjected to the magic of their homeland. Were a dweomercat cub to return to
    the First World, it would eventually grow into a normal dweomercat, but only
    over the course of numerous humanoid lifespans. Those dweomercats marooned
    on the Material Plane seek out areas of great age, changeability, and
    magical potency- lands most like the First World. Sometimes this means not a
    specific place, but rather a period spent journeying with a mortal
    spellcaster. While an adult dweomercat would scoff at the idea of following
    a humanoid's orders, adolescents see the benefit of journeying alongside an
    intelligent creature native to the alien world. Should a dweomercat cub find
    a magic-user reckless or whimsical enough to keep its attention, it might
    join the caster as a familiar, gaining a measure of constant magical
    exposure from the intangible connection inherent in such a mystical
    relationship. Dweomercat Cubs as Familiars Attracted to flashy displays of
    magic and the strange powers inherent in a bond between a magic-user and her
    familiar, a dweomercat cub that's wandered from the First World might find
    its taste for magic and adventure satisfied in the service of a particularly
    whimsical or ostentatious arcane spellcaster. A spellcaster with the
    Improved Familiar feat can acquire a chaotic neutral dweomercat cub at 7th
    level or higher. Should the spellcaster settle into a life of research and
    predictability for a span of months, the dweomercat cub familiar might take
    to wandering off and, eventually, might not return-deliberately severing the
    master-familiar bond and freeing the spellcaster to summon a new familiar.
