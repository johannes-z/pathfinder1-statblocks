Description_Visual: >-
  A brightly colored creature swoops down to land on the branch above. Its head
  is overly large, with a mouth full of sharp teeth and bright, shiny eyes. The
  thing chirps, lashes its long thin tail, and then with a flap of leathery
  wings is in the air once again.

    description: >-
      If a rhamphorhynchus makes a charge attack while flying, it does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity when it enters an opponent's space to make
      a melee attack. It also gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls with its bite
      attack when it makes a sudden swoop.
Description:
  - >-
    Pterosaurs are often found in regions where dinosaurs and other prehistoric
    creatures are commonly encountered, yet they are not dinosaurs themselves.
    The pteranodon is the most well known and widespread of these flying
    reptiles, but numerous other species exist, such as the relatively small
    rhamphorhynchus, the venomous dimorphodon, and the lumbering, giraffe-sized
    quetzalcoatlus. While the larger pterosaurs are awkward fliers, the smaller
    ones can be quite agile and quick. Pterosaurs generally dwell on coastlines,
    along rivers, or near swamps or lakes, for the majority of their diet
    consists of fish snatched from the water in daring dives. Pterosaurs are
    quite territorial, though, and most won't hesitate to swoop down and hiss,
    shriek, and attack things their size or larger. Rhamphorhynchus This
    pterosaur is a quick-moving reptile with a 5-foot wingspan, a narrow snout
    filled with dozens of needle-like teeth, and a long tail tipped with an
    arrowheadshaped ridge. Males are generally quite brightly colored,
    displaying brilliant reds, greens, and bright blues, often bearing complex
    patterns like stripes; females tend to be more drably colored. Although
    tiny, the rhamphorhynchus is swift and aggressive, and its attack method of
    swooping down suddenly to attack creatures allows it to bite with increased
    damage and ferocity. At the end of a sudden swoop, a rhamphorhynchus is
    typically at a disadvantage, and most won't stick around to keep fighting in
    melee, instead taking to the air once more to gain enough height to swoop
    again in a few rounds. Their tiny size, erratic flight patterns, and swift
    ref lexes make them difficult to affect with area effects. A pterosaur on
    the ground walks in a quadrupedal gait; the tips of its wings arc up
    alongside its body, while its lower torso remains closer to the ground than
    its shoulders and head as it moves. Rhamphorhynchus Familiars
    Rhamphorhynchuses (also called swoop lizards) make excellent familiars for
    spellcasters who are looking for a quick and nimble minion. A
    rhamphorhynchus familiar grants its master all of the typical benefits
    familiars grant, but their jittery and quick reactions also impart a +2
    bonus on the master's Initiative checks. A rhamphorhynchus is generally too
    small to serve well as an animal companion- if a character wishes to take
    one as a companion anyway, they have the same statistics as bird animal
    companions.
