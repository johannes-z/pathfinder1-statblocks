Description:
  - >-
    Half-ogres are rare crossbreeds of human and ogre. Standing a few feet
    shorter than their ogre kin and a few feet taller than their human kin,
    half-ogres have strength as well as speed and intelligence (relative to
    other ogres) in their favor. Their skin and hair color generally match that
    of their ogre parent, with dark tones such as gray, brown, or olive being
    the most prevalent. Half-ogres speak Common. Those with an Intelligence
    score of at least 10 also speak Giant. A half-ogre's usual weapon of choice
    is a greatsword or a longspear. They sometimes employ longswords and large
    wooden shields. Half-Ogre Society Half-ogres, though generally outcasts
    among humans and feared for their ugliness and size, can find some
    acceptance among ogres. Half-ogres in an ogre band need to prove themselves
    constantly to their larger kin, however. For this reason, half-ogres found
    among an ogre band are cruel, violent, and strong; weaker half-ogres usually
    wind up in the stew pot. Most half-ogres found among full-blooded ogres are
    leaders of the ogre band or are at least well on their way to becoming
    leaders. Their long years suffering the harsh treatment of their kin help
    half-ogres develop a sense of cunning and a strong will to survive.
    Therefore, ogres under the leadership of a half-ogre fight more effectively,
    even engaging in planned ambushes and complicated tactics that are beyond
    most ogres. On rare occasions, half-ogres collect into hybrid communities of
    other half-ogre races (such as orogs and ogrillons) or humanoids (such as
    orcs and half-orcs). These rogue bands of outcasts form bandit clans or
    marauding groups that are the bane of other humanoid communities in their
    area. Half-ogre Characters Half-ogres possess racial Hit Dice and may have
    class levels. Halfogres have the following racial traits. +6 Strength, +4
    Constitution, -2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma. Halfogres are fierce warriors,
    but weak minded. Darkvision: Half-ogres can see in the dark up to 60 feet.
    Racial Hit Dice: A half-ogre begins with two levels of humanoid, which
    provide 2d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +1, and base saving throw
    bonuses of Fort +3, Ref +0, and Will +0. Racial Skills: A half-ogre's
    humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 2 x (2 + Int modifier). Racial
    Feats: A half-ogre's humanoid levels give it one feat. AC: +2 natural armor
    bonus. Weapon proficiency: A half-ogre is proficient with the greatsword and
    all simple weapons. Special Qualities: Ogre blood (see above). Languages:
    Half-ogres begin play speaking Common, and can also speak giant if they have
    an Intelligence of at least 10. Half-ogres with high Intelligence scores can
    choose from the following languages: Orc, Goblin, Troll Credit The Half-Ogre
