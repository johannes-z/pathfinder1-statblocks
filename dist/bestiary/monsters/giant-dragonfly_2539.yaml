Description:
  - >-
    Giant dragonflies appear as normal dragonflies about 5 feet long. Their
    skin, if it can be removed and preserved, brings a very good price on the
    market. Giant dragonflies are dangerous predators and hunt humans and other
    humanoids as prey.
  - >-
    A giant dragonfly is very aggressive and hunts warm-blooded creatures
    fearlessly. It attacks until either it or its prey is dead.
