Description_Visual: >-
  This barbaric humanoid bears ragged equipment and armor in sullen colors. It
  has coarse body hair and a stooped posture like some primitive man but with a
  grayish-green skin tone and bestial facial features beneath a black hood.
  Burning red eyes peer below a low, sloping brow, just above a flattened nose,
  and prominent tusk-like teeth.

Description:
  - >-
    As seen by civilized races, half-orcs are monstrosities, the result of
    perversion and violence-whether or not this is actually true. Half-orcs are
    rarely the result of loving unions, and as such are usually forced to grow
    up hard and fast, constantly fighting for protection or to make names for
    themselves. Half-orcs as a whole resent this treatment, and rather than play
    the part of the victim, they tend to lash out, unknowingly confirming the
    biases of those around them. A few feared, distrusted, and spat-upon
    half-orcs manage to surprise their detractors with great deeds and
    unexpected wisdom-though sometimes it's easier just to crack a few skulls.
    Some half-orcs spend their entire lives proving to full-blooded orcs that
    they are just as fierce. Others opt for trying to blend into human society,
    constantly demonstrating that they aren't monsters. Their need to always
    prove themselves worthy encourages half-orcs to strive for power and
    greatness within the society around them.
