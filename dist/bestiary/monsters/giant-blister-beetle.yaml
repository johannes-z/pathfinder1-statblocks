    description: >-
      20-ft. line, 1d3 acid damage, Reflex DC 12 negates, usable every 4 rounds.
      Anyone damaged by the inky-black acidic fluid also develops painful
      blisters and welts, and suffers a -2 circumstance modifier on attack rolls
      and ability and skill checks for 10 rounds. A Heal check (DC 10) or any
      cure spell heals the blisters and negates the penalties. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - Blister beetles are nocturnal scavengers found in forests or underground.
  - >-
    They are non-aggressive creatures, but have voracious appetites and will, if
    food is scarce, attack just about anything that comes close to them. Their
    favored meal, however, is bees; both giant and normal. Their immunity to
    poison aids grants them protection from the deadly sting of giant bees
    (normal bees cannot penetrate their carapace). A cluster of beetles waits
    near an area frequented by bees and then spring to attack when a bee lands
    on a flower or plant. Another favored meal is grasshoppers. Blister beetles
    ambush these large insects and drag the prey back to their lair.
  - >-
    Blister beetles reproduce and mature rapidly. The female deposits a group of
    2d4 eggs in a hole in the nest. The male then sprays the eggs with its
    blister spray. Within three days the eggs burst open with an audible pop and
    out swarm the young blister beetles. Young reach maturity in about three
    weeks.
  - >-
    When attacked, a blister beetle releases a foul stream of black oily liquid
    that irritates the skin of any living creature it hits. Afterwards, it moves
    to combat and strikes with its mandibles.
