Description_Visual: >-
  This bizarre creature is about three feet long with a feline-like hairless
  body. Its sickly gray and translucent flesh allows its skeletal and muscular
  systems to be easily seen. The creature's head seems to be a weird mix of
  feline and avian.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Detect Magic (Sp)
    description: >-
      A thought eater can use its detect magic spell-like ability to detect
      magic-using creatures. Magic-using creatures are defined as creatures with
      levels in a spellcasting class or creatures with spell-like abilities or
      the ability to cast spells.
  - name: Eat Thoughts (Su)
    description: >-
      The touch of a thought eater deals 1d2 points of Intelligence damage. A
      thought eater is sated when it has consumed at least 12 points of
      Intelligence in a given 24-hour period.
  - name: Ethereal Jaunt (Su)
    description: >-
      A thought eater can shift from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as
      part of any move action, and then shift back again as a free action. This
      ability is otherwise identical to the ethereal jaunt spell (CL 10th).
  - name: Precognition (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a thought eater can concentrate and glimpse
      fragments of potential future events-what it sees probably happens if no
      action is taken to change it. The vision, however, is incomplete, and
      makes no sense until the events begin to unfold. On its next action, a
      thought eater gains a +2 insight bonus on a single attack roll, damage
      roll, saving throw, or skill check. The bonus can be applied to the roll
      after the results of the dice are known.
  - name: Spell Absorption (Su)
    description: >-
      If a thought eater's spell resistance protects it form a magical effect,
      the creature absorbs that magical energy into its body. Absorbing a spells
      heals a thought eater a number of hit points equal to the absorbed spell's
      level. This cannot increase a thought eater's hit points above its normal
      maximum hit points.
Description:
  - >-
    Thought eaters are bizarre creatures that spend their time swimming the
    Ethereal Plane feeding on the thoughts and intelligence of living creatures.
    What little is known of these strange creatures has only recently been
    discovered. Thought eaters, on average, live about 15 years in the Ethereal
    Plane. Whether this low life expectancy is the result of predation, natural
    selection, or the result of some anomaly is unknown. Their diet consists of
    only the thoughts, intelligence, and mental powers of other creatures. They
    need not eat or drink anything else to survive. No juvenile or young thought
    eaters have ever been seen, but it is hypothesized that young are born live
    and mature very quickly.
  - >-
    When a thought eater detects an intelligent creature, it manifests on the
    Material Plane and attacks from ambush, seeking to feed its insatiable
    appetite. A thought eater can spend a maximum of 1 minute (10 rounds) on the
    Material Plane before its wispy flesh disintegrates and the creature falls
    dead. If badly wounded, a thought eater seeks escape to the Ethereal Plane
    rather than continuing the fight.
