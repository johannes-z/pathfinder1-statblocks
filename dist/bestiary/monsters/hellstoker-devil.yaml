  This man-sized creature has loosely hanging, rubbery flesh, grayishblack in
  color, and its entire body is smeared with a yellowish-brown mucus. Its head
  is ovoid, devoid of hair, and sports upward curving horns. A hardened ridge of
  bone runs from its brow, across the top of its head, and disappears into its
  spine. Its long, serpentine tail is dark grayish-red.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bellows (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hellstoker can use its burning hands to light its bellows as a standard
      action. This allows the hellstoker to fire a jet of flame from its bellows
      in a line to a range of 30 feet, once per round as a standard action. It
      must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit a foe. A creature hit by
      the fire takes 1d8 points of fire damage and must succeed on a DC 15
      Reflex save or catch on fire.
  - name: Fiery Body (Ex)
    description: >-
      The oil coating a hellstoker's body is highly flammable. As such, a
      hellstoker hit with a fire effect bursts into flames. This deals no damage
      to the hellstoker, and deals 1d6 points of fire damage to any creature
      touching or grappling the hellstoker. The fire burns for 10 rounds before
      extinguishing. This does not damage the hellstoker's oily hide; therefore,
      it still retains its racial bonus to Escape Artist checks (see oily hide
      below), and it can be caught on fire again.
  - name: Oily Hide (Ex)
    description: >-
      Hellstokers do not secrete oil naturally, but their constant contact with
      it leaves them coated with a thick layer of the substance at all times.
      This grants hellstokers a +10 racial bonus to Escape Artist checks
      (included in the statistics block). The oil cannot be washed off or
      removed. Additionally, if a hellstoker is hit with a fire effect, it
      bursts into flames. See the hellstoker's fiery body above for details.
Description:
  - >-
    Hellstokers (or marnasoths) maintain the oil, made from the flesh of
    mortals, in the infernal boilers located on the lowest region of Hell. They
    are rarely encountered anywhere else, though on occasion a team or retinue
    of hellstokers enters the Material Plane in search of fuel. Most just wait
    for the foolhardy mortals that enjoy plane-hopping to pop into their realm
    where any number of devils finish them off, leaving their rotting carcasses
    to the hellstokers. When fuel is running low and the hellstokers are short
    on mortals, they form bands that hunt down and kill the least ranking devils
    (such as lemures), tossing their slain bodies into the boilers.
  - >-
    Hellstokers attack using their longspears or natural weapons. They sometimes
    use burning hands to set one another on fire, or they use it to ignite the
    oil in their bellows. When outnumbered, hellstokers usually use burning
    hands against their foes and then teleport away to safety.
