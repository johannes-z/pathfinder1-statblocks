Description:
  - >-
    The Stabbing Beast is the herald of Norgorber, the god of greed, murder,
    secrets, and poison. It is an incredibly dangerous predator that uses its
    keen intellect and deadly poison to stalk and kill its prey. Its natural
    form is that of a huge scorpion, but it can also assume an armored humanoid
    shape suitable for stealth or interacting with Norgorber's followers. Though
    its main purpose for coming to Golarion is to kill, it has also been called
    to aid great thefts and bury terrible secrets.
