Description:
  - >-
    Killer frogs are similar to their dire cousins, except that they stand
    partially erect and use their front claws as well as their bite. Killer
    frogs are created by an evil mutation of dire frogs through a practice
    thought to be known only to the worshipers of Tsathogga. Killer frogs, being
    more humanoid in appearance, do not have adhesive tongues.
