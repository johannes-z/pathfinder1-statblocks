SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Charging Trip (Ex)
    description: >-
      A festrog that hits with its bite after making a charge attack on all
      fours can attempt to trip its opponent (+4 bonus). This trip does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity.
  - name: Diseased Pustules (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a festrog takes damage from a piercing or slashing weapon, some of
      its boils rupture, squirting the attacker with puslike fluids. The noxious
      secretions carry a potent contact disease that causes those infected to
      break out into painful necrotic boils. Necrotic Boils: Disease-contact;
      save Fort DC 11; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con; cure 1
      save.
  - name: Feed (Su)
    description: >-
      Every time a festrog makes a successful bite attack, it feeds on its
      opponent's flesh and gains 5 temporary hit points. The festrog cannot have
      more than 5 temporary hit points gained by this ability at one time.
      Four-Footed
  - name: Run (Ex)
    description: >-
      A festrog can run on all fours at speed of 50 feet if it doesn't hold or
      carry anything in its hands. When running on all fours, it is treated as
      if it had the Run feat.
Description:
  - >-
    A festrog is an undead abomination spawned when a creature is killed by a
    massive release of negative energy (perhaps due to planar bleeding, the
    destruction of a potent artifact, or even certain magical attacks by
    powerful undead), and then mutilated by an outside force, such as the
    scavenging of wild animals. Sometimes called dog-ghouls for their ability to
    run on all fours, the name often causes opponents to misinterpret this
    creature's abilities and grossly underestimate its intelligence, for the
    festrog is in fact a rather canny monstrosity.
  - >-
    Festrogs inhabit remote areas near places where they were slain. It's not
    uncommon for a tribe of festrogs to share territories with ghouls. Most
    festrogs gather in small bands, based on whatever loose affiliations they
    might recall from when they were alive, and choose dwellings in sunless
    areas easily defended with group tactics. Like ghouls, they tend to skulk
    about graveyards, though they prefer ones with tombs and mausoleums so they
    can hide during the day. They hunt nocturnally in packs, preferring open
    areas like plains, farmlands, or open forests where they can track down prey
    with few places for it to run or hide. These packs wander seminomadically,
    often traveling miles beyond their dwellings in pursuit of mortal flesh.
