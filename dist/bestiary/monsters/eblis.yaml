      Each eblis flock has one individual capable of using arcane magic. A
      spellcasting eblis has 2d4 spells, each spell usable once per day. Each
      spell is caster level 4th and has a save DC of 11 + the level of the
      spell. Eblis spells require no material or verbal components; only
      somatic, which consists of dancing and vocalizations. The save DCs are
      Charisma-based. Choose or randomly determine (using the table below) the
      eblis's spells. 1d8 Spell 1 ghost sound 2 disguise self 3 hypnotism 4

Description:
  - >-
    The eblis are a semi-civilized society of birdmen that make their homes in
    desolate swamps and marshes. They rarely have interactions with other races,
    preferring the company of their own kind and the serenity of their marshland
    homes. An eblis is a large bird that strongly resembles a stork - so much so
    that eblis are often called "stork men." An eblis stands about 8 feet tall,
    and the neck is extremely long and snake-like and is unnaturally flexible
    and capable of blindingly fast movements. An eblis' beak is long, sharp, and
    deadly. A male eblis has gray-brown feathers with reddish patches on its
    head, while a female lacks the red patch. Storkmen are very fast at shifting
    and striking, and their necks are very powerful despite their slenderness.
    They attack by stabbing with their beak. Credit The Eblis originally
