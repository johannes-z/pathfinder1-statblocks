SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Deadly Slam (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Spellscar fext threatens a critical hit with its slam attack on rolls of
      18-20.
  - name: Dispelling Critical (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a Spellscar fext successfully scores a critical hit with its slam
      attack, the creature struck must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be
      affected as though by the targeted dispel version of a dispel magic spell
      (caster level 10th). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Ravage Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      Any targeted spell or spell-like ability that fails to penetrate a
      Spellscar fext's spell resistance is absorbed by the fext and warped into
      a form of primal magic. A Spellscar fext can twist only a number of spell
      levels per round equal to its Charisma modifier (4 for most Spellscar
      fexts); any spells in excess of this limit automatically bypass a
      Spellscar fext's spell resistance and don't trigger this ability. Roll on
      the following table to determine the effect of a spell that has been
      affected by a Spellscar fext's ravage magic ability. Alternatively, a
      Spellscar mutant may use any of the sample primal magic events found
      effects with the CR of the Spellscar fext. d% Effect 01-40 The spell has
      no effect. 41-70 The Spellscar fext emits a burst of negative energy,
      dealing a number of points of negative energy damage equal to 1d6 x the
      spell level of the triggering spell to all creatures in a 30-foot-radius
      burst. 71-90 The Spellscar fext instantly switches places with the
      spellcaster that targeted the fext with the triggering spell as though by
      dimension door. 91-100 The spell is immediately turned back on its caster
      via spell turning.
  - name: Vulnerable to Glass (Ex)
    description: >-
      A Spellscar fext's hide is particularly vulnerable to the penetrations of
      glass and glass-based weapons. Spellscar fexts take 150% as much damage as
      normal from glass-headed piercing or slashing weapons.
Description:
  - >-
    The abominable undead known as Spellscar fexts are formed by wayward
    spellcasters who perish in the sprawling badlands of the Mana Wastes, their
    bodies and souls perverted by the unpredictable primal energies that surge
    throughout the Spellscar Desert. The average Spellscar fext stands about 6
    feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.
  - >-
    The unnatural and corruptive transformations a fallen victim undergoes as it
    turns into a Spellscar fext render its body hard and especially resilient to
    the magical energies of most spellcasters. In a peculiar twist, the same
    corruptive energy that causes spells to bounce off of Spellscar fexts' hides
    also strangely renders them susceptible to glass and glass-based weapons.
    Talented gunsmiths from Alkenstar have managed to craft glass bullets for
    rif le-wielding adventurers and monster hunters for the purpose of
    eradicating Spellscar fexts.
