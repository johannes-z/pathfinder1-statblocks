Description:
  - >-
    Water striders are aquatic insects that skate across the surface of still
    water. Their bodies are long and narrow, with an individual measuring less
    than 1 inch in length. The body and legs of a water strider are covered with
    a layer of water-repelling hairs, making it possible for the strider to
    resist the surface tension of the water. The insect stands on its front and
    rear legs, and pushes against the water surface with its middle legs to
    propel itself forward. Water striders are also excellent jumpers, launching
    themselves distances of up to 5 feet. Any movement on land is limited to
    jumping. Swarms of particularly vicious water striders commonly gather at
    the edges of bodies of water, attacking anything that disturbs the surface
    of their pools.
