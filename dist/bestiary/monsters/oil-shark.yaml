Description:
  - >-
    The Sea of Fire located on the Plane of Molten Skies and the Plane of Fire
    is home to strange aquatic life (if they can be called that), but perhaps
    none is stranger than the mighty oil shark. These creatures spend their days
    swimming beneath the burning surface of the Sea of Fire, searching for prey.
    Their diet consists of other aquatic creatures found in the Sea of Fire such
    as fire crabs, oil worms, and the great fire whales. The latter is a
    particular favorite of the oil shark, and while the typical great fire whale
    outweighs (and is generally larger) than the typical oil shark, an oil shark
    pack has been known to attack and kill with ease a lone fire whale. Oil
    sharks have never been encountered outside the Plane of Molten Skies or
    Plane of Fire though sages believe the oil shark can exist in normal water.
    Oil sharks are completely blind and rely completely upon their "sonar" to
    hunt their prey. Oil sharks generally behave as other sharks; circling their
    prey before striking with their powerful jaws. Non-aquatic prey (i.e.,
    creatures that breathe air) are often grasped in its jaws and dragged below
    the surface of the burning sea where it drowns in the oily waters. Their
    oily hides allow them to glide smoothly and quickly through normal water.
    Oil sharks are a delicacy of volcano giants and are often hunted by such
    creatures. The thick, metallic hide of an oil shark is prized by salamanders
    and they often hunt these creatures, kill them, and sculpt armor from the
    hide. Oil shark armor is detailed in the sidebar. Oil Shark Armor (Medium
    Armor) Because of the natural oily nature of the metal in an oil shark's
    scales (which retain these properties even after its death), a creature
    suffers no penalty to Swim checks for wearing this armor and also adds a +5
    bonus to all Escape Artist checks. In addition, a creature wearing oil shark
    armor is unaffected by obstructions such as webs (magical or otherwise). Oil
    Shark Armor: Cost 1,000 gp (usually can't be bought); Armor Bonus +6;
    Maximum Dex Bonus +2; Armor Check Penalty -4; Arcane Spell Failure 30%;
    Speed 20 ft. (Base 30 ft.), 15 ft. (Base 20 ft.); Weight 40 lb.
