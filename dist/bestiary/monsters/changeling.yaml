Description:
  - >-
    Born of mysterious origins and raised by unknowing foster parents,
    changelings are the children of hags and their tricked lovers. Most don't
    know of their monstrous origins, but there comes a time in every
    changeling's life when these roots begin to call out to their host, urging
    the confused girl toward some end she can't identify. When a hag of any sort
    conceives a child with a man, the result is a changeling. The male parent is
    usually killed and eaten by his partner before he can see the offspring.
    Changelings are, without exception, female, and almost always tall and
    slender. A changeling's hair is typically long and dark, and her skin
    abnormally pale, but she otherwise looks for all practical purposes like a
    member of her father's race. A frequent-but not universal-trait of
    changelings is noticeably mismatched eyes, each of which is a different
    color common among her father's race. Upon reaching puberty and adulthood,
    the average changeling born to a human father stands approximately 5-1/2
    feet tall and weighs about 110 pounds.
