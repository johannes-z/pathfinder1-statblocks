Description:
  - >-
    The mighty shaggy demodands are the ruling class of the demodand race. No
    greater demodands are known to exist, though rumors lately hint at a single,
    powerful demodand of near-deity status. Shaggy demodands are by far the most
    malign, selfish, evil, and ruthless of the tripartite race of demodands.
    They are the nobility and upper class of demodand society and commanders of
    the demodand armies. A typical shaggy demodand stands 6 feet tall and weighs
    about 550 pounds. Shaggy demodands usually attack with their powerful claws
    and bite, though they sometimes employ weapons (morningstars or bastard
    swords). Credit The Shaggy Demodand originally appeared in the First Edition
