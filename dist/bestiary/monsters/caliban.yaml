SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Share Deformity (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a caliban can make a melee touch attack
      against a humanoid creature. If it hits, the opponent must succeed at a DC
      12 Fortitude save or have its form warped horribly. An affected creature
      takes 4 points of ability damage to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution
      (caliban's choice). Until this ability damage is healed, the caliban gains
      a +4 bonus to that same ability score. This ability damage heals
      automatically after 24 hours. A creature can't be affected by more than
      one instance of this ability at a time. This is a curse effect, and the
      save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Unsettling Scream (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a caliban can wail horribly. All non-caliban
      creatures within 60 feet that can hear must succeed at a DC 12 Will save
      or be deafened for 1 round and shaken for 1 minute. A creature affected by
      this ability is immune to the unsettling scream of the same caliban for 24
      hours, regardless of whether its save is successful. This is a sonic fear
      effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    While an individual hag who has coupled with a human can only hope to birth
    a changeling (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 29), hag covens prove far more
    versatile in spawning monstrous progeny. The hags in such covens
    occasionally use their combined witchcraft to supernaturally create
    abominable male children-brutish monsters born of foul sanies and unholy
    ablutions that are stewed for days and then allowed to ferment into living
    creatures. These monsters go by many names among the hags who "birth" them,
    but among civilized races they are known by just one word: caliban.
  - >-
    Calibans are free-willed but invariably inherit much of the vileness of
    their monstrous parents. Unlike changelings, calibans are usually raised
    among hags rather than in human settlements, since most societies would find
    a caliban's form too repulsive for any purpose other than obliteration. Thus
    calibans learn from an early age to trust only their mothers and to revile
    anyone else. Those calibans who for whatever reason find themselves apart
    from their hag mothers are the most likely to shed their evil ways and forge
    a path of their own, but such individuals are few and far between.
  - >-
    Just as changelings are always female, calibans are always male, and since
    they are the result of hags' foul magics it is impossible for them to
    reproduce. The average caliban is 7 feel tall and weighs about 260 pounds.
