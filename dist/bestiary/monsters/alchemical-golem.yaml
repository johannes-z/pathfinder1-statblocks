SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alchemy (Ex)
    description: >-
      When an alchemical golem strikes a foe, the attack has an additional
      random effect, chosen from the options below. The attack can either deal
      1d6 points of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, or cause the target
      to become sickened (Fortitude DC 16 negates) or entangled (Reflex DC 16
      negates) for 1d4 rounds. These save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Bombs (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an alchemical golem can throw a bomb as a ranged
      touch attack to a distance of 60 feet (no range increment). If the attack
      misses, treat it as a thrown splash weapon to determine where it lands.
      Anyone struck by an alchemical golem's bomb takes 8d6 points of acid,
      cold, electricity, or fire damage (determine type randomly). All creatures
      adjacent to the location where the bomb hits take 1d6 points of energy
      damage of the same type.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      An alchemical golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow
      spell resistance, save for spells with the sonic descriptor. Shatter
      damages an alchemical golem as if it were a crystalline creature.
  - name: Splash (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any strike on an alchemical golem with a non-reach melee weapon deals 1
      point of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage (determine type randomly)
      to the attacker. This amount increases to 1d6 points of damage if the
      attack is a critical hit.
Description:
  - >-
    This golem is a walking alchemical nightmare, capable of inflicting all
    manner of painful wounds on its foes.
  - >-
    Its ability to follow orders is granted by the otherwise mindless humanoid
    brain that floats in its dome-like head, while its animating force is a
    curious combination of alchemy and elemental spirits bound into the fluids
    and metals of its body.
  - >-
