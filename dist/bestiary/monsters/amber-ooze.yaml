Source: Tome of Horrors Complete
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ability Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      If not purged form the host body, the acids and protoplasm of an amber
      ooze begin damaging its host's body and mind. After 1 week, the host takes
      1 point each of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain per day. When one
      of the three abilities reaches 0, the host dies.
  - name: Infuse (Ex)
    description: >-
      A victim that has ingested an amber ooze must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude
      save or the amber ooze infuses itself into his body. The ooze merges with
      flesh and bone, and can only be removed by a remove disease spell. The
      save DC is Constitution-based. A detect magic (or similar magic) cast on
      the host reveals the amber ooze. If the victim succeeds on the Fortitude
      save, the amber ooze takes 1 point of acid damage per round from the
      host's digestive juices. Once it begins to take damage, the ooze retreats
      from the host's body through its mouth.
  - name: Weaken Will (Su)
    description: >-
      An amber ooze that has infused itself into a host weakens the will of its
      victim. As long as the amber ooze remains in the host, he takes a -4
      penalty on Will saves to resist mind-influencing spells and effects (such
      as charm person and suggestion.)
Description:
  - >-
    Amber oozes were created by an evil wizard as a means of gaining control
    over the elders of a powerful city. He bred many of the creatures in secret
    and sealed them into kegs of ale, then hired merchants to distribute this
    ale throughout the city. The wizard was ultimately slain and the city saved
    by a band of heroic adventurers. Unknown to the adventurers, the merchants
    had wanted to line their own pockets without the knowledge of their
    employer. Unaware of the plot they sold some of the kegs of ale in illegal
    markets. Now, many of the kegs containing amber oozes have been shipped to
    other cities and the creatures are spreading. When an amber ooze divides,
    one of the new creatures seeps out of the keg to find its own lair. Stacked
    in rows with other kegs of uncontaminated ale, amber oozes can quickly take
    over a store room or pantry. An amber ooze is approximately 1 foot in
    diameter, and is a dark amber color. The designs of the mad mage even
    provided the amber ooze with the scent of mead or heady ale. Amber oozes can
    lay in a state of hibernation for years, coming out of it only to replicate
    - a process they undergo once every few months - or when they are alerted by
    movement of the keg. When a keg containing an amber ooze is tapped, the
    creature makes its way to the opening. Within the drawing of a few drinks,
    the amber ooze squeezes out of the tap and into the mug. As soon as the
    victim drinks, the ooze forces itself down the victim's throat and into its
    belly. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.
