SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fast Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A thyrlien has fast healing 1 only when outside under a night sky (whether
      the sky is cloudy or clear).
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3
      Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Starlight Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a thyrlien can tap into
      Desna's divine radiance and unleash a blast of holy twilight in a 5-foot
      burst. All creatures in this area take 2d4 points of holy damage, plus 1
      point for each step their alignment deviates from chaotic good. For
      example, a chaotic neutral or neutral good creature would take 2d4+1
      points of damage, a neutral creature would take 2d4+2 points of damage,
      and a lawful evil creature would take 2d4+4 points of damage. A DC 14
      Reflex save negates this damage. Chaotic good creatures are unaffected by
      this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - A thyrlien is a unique type of azata created by Desna.
  - >-
    Intended as rare warrior counterparts to lyrakien, thyrlien are tasked with
    watching over nighttime travelers. Specifically hunting the servants of
    Lamashtu and Ghlaunder, thyrlien wander lonely roads and dark alleys, hoping
    to confront or counter the dark things that so often hunt such ominous
    spots. Superficially humanoid, a thyrlien's attacks reveal its nonhuman
    origins. Venomous saliva coats mouth and its delicate-looking wings are
    actually as stiff as wood and have razor sharp edges. A thyrlien is skilled
    at tracking using conventional and magical methods and is savvy to the ways
    of its chosen prey. These servants of the goddess of luck stand about 2 feet
    tall and weigh around 15 pounds.
