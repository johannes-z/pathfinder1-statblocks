Description:
  - >-
    Giant ants are as industrious as their normal-sized kin. While their nests
    generally don't consist of thousands, their greatly increased size more than
    compensates. The statistics given above are for soldier ants-the variety
    most commonly encountered. The following simple templates can be used to
    create variants of the standard soldier ant. Worker (-1 CR) Worker ants do
    not have a poison sting attack or a grab special attack. Drone (+1 CR)
    Drones have the advanced simple template and a fly speed of 30 feet
    (average). Queen (+2 CR) The queen of a nest is an immense, bloated
    creature. She gains the advanced and the giant simple templates, but drops
    her speed to 10 feet and loses her climb speed entirely.
