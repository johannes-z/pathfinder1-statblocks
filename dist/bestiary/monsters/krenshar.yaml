Description_Visual: >-
  This earless, panther-like beast snarls as the skin of its face twitches, then
  peels back to reveal the bone and flesh beneath.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Skullface (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a krenshar can pull the skin back from its face,
      revealing the musculature and bony structures of its skull. This counts as
      using Intimidate to demoralize an opponent, and is an extraordinary
      ability. The krenshar can emit a loud screech while peeling back its skin,
      causing potent fear in a single creature within 100 feet that can see the
      krenshar. The targeted creature must make a DC 12 Will save or become
      frightened (if the target has 6 or fewer Hit Dice) or shaken (if the
      target has more than 6 Hit Dice) for 1d4 rounds. A creature that
      successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same krenshar's
      skullface ability for 24 hours. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear
      effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The krenshar is a strange creature that resembles a large but earless
    hunting cat, save that it can retract the fur and skin on its face to reveal
    the glistening skull and musculature underneath. Combined with its strange,
    keening wail, this horrifying display is enough to paralyze prey and send
    formidable opponents running.
  - >-
    Krenshar's retractable skin allows it to dine on carrion with a lower risk
    of picking up disease-carrying vermin, much like a vulture's bare head and
    neck. When the creature finishes eating, restoring the facial skin to its
    normal position scrapes off gore and clinging bugs. The ability to retract
    their skin is demonstrated in other contexts as well-male krenshars bare
    their skulls at rivals as a challenge over mates, females use this ability
    to ward off undesired suitors, and hunting adults use it to scare prey into
    ambushes.
  - >-
    Though krenshars generally prefer to stalk herd animals like deer or cattle,
    they have no qualms about taking on humanoids when food is scarce. They
    average 4 to 5 feet in length and weigh approximately 175 pounds.
  - >-
    Scholars have long debated the confusing nature of krenshar intelligence.
    While clearly more intelligent than mere animals, the creatures seem to lack
    all but the most rudimentary language of snarls and yowls, and aside from
    the scare tactics that make them notorious, tend to behave much like mundane
    cats or wolves, even going so far as to occasionally be befriended by
    rangers or druids. Those who deny krenshars' intelligence, however, need
    only look into their strange violet eyes or observe the ease with which they
    manipulate and outmaneuver their prey to realize their folly-an error few
    make twice.
