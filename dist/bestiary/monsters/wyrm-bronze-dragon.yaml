SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Electricity Aura (Su)

      An old or older bronze dragon has an aura of electricity. All creatures
      within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the start of the

      repulsion gas. Targets must make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing
      but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age
      category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.
  - name: Vortex (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, an ancient or older bronze dragon can create a vortex as a
      standard action, just like an elder water elemental. A bronze dragon can
      maintain this vortex for 1 round per age category.
