      Unless a wolliped is specifically trained for combat (see the Handle
      Animal skill on page 97 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook), its gore is
      treated as a secondary attack and the creature lacks the trample ability.
  - name: Spit (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per hour, a wolliped can regurgitate the contents of its stomach,
      spitting the foul material at a single target within 10 feet. The target
      must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Believed to be native to the Parapet Mountains, wollipeds were among the
    first beasts of burden domesticated by Triaxians. Some claim wollipeds
    weren't domesticated initially to be working animals, but rather were herded
    and bred for their extremely warm and plentiful fleece. In any case,
    Triaxians have a long history of using these magnificent animals for many
    purposes, even employing them as mounts in battle. A typical wolliped stands
    between 5 and 6 feet at the front shoulder and weighs upward of 1,000
    pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Wollipeds are social herd animals that subsist on a diet of grasses, leaves,
    and other plant material. Wollipeds in high mountainous environments obtain
    much of their food from lichens and mosses, while herds of wollipeds on the
    plains graze on more substantial fare. Wild wollipeds tend to migrate to
    more plentiful foraging lands when winter comes to Triaxus, though these can
    be difficult to find. Domesticated wollipeds, tended to by their Triaxian
    herders, are found throughout nearly all of Triaxus.
  - >-
    Walking on eight sturdy legs, wollipeds are exceptionally sure-footed. These
    creatures can climb steep mountain trails and march through heavy snow with
    little effort, and Triaxian cavalry have often charged up scree-choked
    hillsides to raid fortresses on the backs of armored wollipeds. The great
    beasts' facility at maneuvering in challenging environments and generally
    submissive nature have resulted in a long relationship with the humanoids on
    Triaxus. Wollipeds live for about 15 years, mating and giving birth every 11
    months, and can be ridden until the final month of pregnancy.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Wollipeds are social animals, grouping together into herds for protection.
    When threatened, wollipeds gather in a tight cluster with the young animals
    kept in the very center of the herd. Domesticated wollipeds are used for
    casual riding, pulling plows, and walking circles to power wollimills.
  - >-
    While other exotic fabrics are available during a Triaxian summer, the
    mainstay of Triaxian winter textiles is spun wolliped fleece. Wolliped
    fibers wick water away, and still provide adequate warmth even when soaked,
    while the variations in coat colors and textures provide a wide array of
    design options.
  - >-
    Like Triaxians, wollipeds exhibit distinct seasonal variance. Wollipeds born
    during the winter have long, thick, shaggy coats of fine fibers with a
    hollow core, while those born in the summers have shorter, thinner coats.
    Rather than the coats of individuals changing, the change happens
    generationally; winter wollipeds give birth to short-coated summer wollipeds
    as the planet warms, and vice versa. The process happens quickly, usually
    beginning in eastern Aylok, though no one knows precisely why.
  - >-
    In addition to wolliped fleece, some Triaxian artisans use the ivory from
    wolliped tusks as a raw material, but this is most common for wollipeds born
    during the winter, as their tusks are three times the size of those born in
    summer. Winterborn wollipeds use their foot-long tusks for a variety of
    purposes. In addition to using them to dig in the ice and snow for deep
    green tubers, burmoss, and patches of sentient tulbos fungus that stretches
    beneath the ice, wollipeds clash their tusks together in competitions for
    dominance within a herd and as part of their mating displays.
  - >-
    Wollipeds use spitting as a form of communication as well as for defense.
    Most wollipeds only spit at one another, typically in the course of their
    tusk-clashing shows of dominance, but when threatened they can launch a
    nauseating wad of partially digested fodder at their attackers. Some trained
    wolliped mounts have honed this nature into a weapon guided by their riders.
  - >-
    The dragons of Triaxus have little use for terrestrial mounts, and instead
    use wollipeds as a consistent source of food. More than half of all
    domesticated wollipeds eventually feed Triaxus's dragon population, though
    most wollipeds used for meat are older animals whose fleece has turned
    coarse and brittle. Triaxians also eat wolliped flesh, but most consider
    young and healthy animals too valuable to eat except during desperate winter
    years.

    Regional Variants The statistics on the facing page represent the most
    common breed of wolliped native to the Drakelands, the Allied Territories,
    and the Skyfire Mandate. In addition to these, a multitude of other breeds
    exist throughout Triaxus.
  - >-
    Alurals: Triaxians of the Unbound Tribes breed the best wollipeds for
    battle, with their steeds recognized worldwide as being the strongest and
    most aggressive. Alurals are also the only known breed of wolliped that is
    carnivorous. Tribes here collect wolliped milk, fermenting it into a potent
    alcoholic beverage used for rituals, feasts, and holy days. Alurals have the
    advanced simple template.
  - >-
    Ningese Wollipeds: The remote nation of Ning breeds the smallest wollipeds
    on Triaxus. Ningese wollipeds are quick and nimble, using these traits to
    elude the hordes of monsters threatening the civilized regions of the
    nation. Wollipeds here are primarily used for fleece and food. In the
    summer, Ningese wollipeds grow to Medium size and their speed increases by
    10 feet. Ningese wollipeds born in the harsh winter are Small and have 2
    fewer Hit Dice; their Strength and Constitution decreases by 2, and their
    Dexterity increases by 2.
