Description_Visual: >-
  This slimy, sticky, worm bears a striking resemblance to humanoid entrails.
  Its lengthy body looks like a lumpy, veined, gray tube approximately 10 feet
  long, but no thicker than a sword handle. It has no eyes, and its large, round
  mouth resembles the suckered mouth of a leech.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gutslug that grapples a foe drains blood. This deals 1d4 points of
      Constitution drain each round the grapple is maintained. Once a gutslug
      has drained 8 points, it detaches and flies or slithers away to digest its
      meal.
  - name: Vulnerabilities (Ex)
    description: >-
      Gutslugs are vulnerable to salt. A pint of salt deals 1d4 points of damage
      to a gutslug for 1d2 rounds and causes it to lose its racial bonus to
      grapple checks. A pint of alcohol poured or thrown on a gutslug deals no
      damage but causes it to lose its racial bonus to grapple checks.
Description:
  - >-
    These hideous creatures have many names-entrail worms, intestine crawlers,
    viscera worms, and several others. The most common name assigned to these
    leech-like parasites is gutslug. Gutslugs are most often found in
    underground caverns, though some do lair above ground. Aboveground gutslugs
    build their nests in forested areas, often near lakes or rivers. They are
    never encountered in warm or cold regions as they detest both extremes. They
    are nocturnal hunters and generally avoid the sunlight if possible.
    (Sunlight does not damage them, they just don't like it.) Subterranean
    gutslugs nest in crevasses, or in small caves or natural caverns, sometimes
    near a source of water. The lair is coated with a thick layer of slimy and
    sticky mucus (regurgitated by the gutslug). This mucus has a strong acidic
    stench and is easily detected at ranges of 30 feet or less. At irregular
    intervals (especially after feeding), the body of a gutslug widens to
    accommodate a bag-like stomach. When a warm-blooded living creature is
    detected, a gutslug flies or crawls directly toward it, attacking and biting
    almost mindlessly. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.
