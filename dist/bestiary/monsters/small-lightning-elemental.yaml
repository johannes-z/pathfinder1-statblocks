  - name: Spark Leap (Ex)

Description:
  - >-
    Though most think of the Plane of Air as a vast expanse of clear sky, that
    plane also holds the power of the storm, including monstrous hurricanes
    larger than entire worlds and thunderstorms whose peals and claps can
    shatter stone. Whether lightning elementals are the byproduct of common air
    elementals spending too much time near these electrically charged storms or
    are merely calved off like forgotten flurries, they are aggressive and
    almost suicidal in their willingness to leap into battle. They particularly
    enjoy attacking creatures that are made of metal and creatures that wear
    metal armor or wield metal weapons. Many lightning elementals have a roughly
    humanoid shape, but some prefer animalistic shapes (particularly birds and
    dragons), and a few appear to be nothing more than large disembodied heads
    made of dark clouds with flickering lightning tongues. Regardless of the
    shape a lightning elemental takes, the air around the creature hums and
    throbs with the promise of electrocution and the tangy stink of ozone.
