Description:
  - >-
    Shaggy demodands are obese outsiders that occupy the highest status within
    demodand society. The fleshy tyrants stand just under 7 feet tall and have
    huge bat wings capable of supporting their 600-pound weight. Their faces
    have the broad-set eyes of a toad and toothy underbites.
  - >-
    Although they still answer to their titanic masters, shaggy demodands are
    the masters of their kind, and serve the thanatotic titans as advisors,
    covert agents, or battlefield generals. In the Abyss, shaggy demodands
    command great armies, leading them against demonic hordes as the balance of
    Abyssal power ebbs and flows. Often underestimated due to their shape, these
    demodands are both intelligent and cunning, and approach battle with an
    effective mixture of strategy and ruthless detachment.
