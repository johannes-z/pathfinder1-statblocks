Description_Visual: >-
  Before you stands a shimmering white humanoid with eyes of sparkling fire. It
  has no other discernable features and slender form is draped only in thin
  black robes. In its fist, it clenches a shimmering greatsword. The being moves
  with an elegant grace, almost as though floating just a few inches above the
  ground.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Foresight (Su)
    description: >-
      A time flayer can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents
      a time flayer from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It
      also grants the time flayer an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom
      bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time flayer can restart it as
      a free action on its next turn.
  - name: Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      Time flayers are immune to all time-related spells and effects (including
      time stop, temporal stasis, and the like).
  - name: Reality Bend (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a time flayer can fold the dimensional space surrounding
      it so its true location is hard to discern. Attackers have a 50% miss
      chance each time they attack with melee or ranged weapons. This is similar
      to the miss chance granted by a displacement spell. See invisibility does
      not reveal the creature's location, but true seeing does.
  - name: Temporal Displacement (Su)
    description: >-
      As a melee touch attack, a time flayer can send a creature a few seconds
      into the future. A DC 18 Fortitude save negates. The save is
      Constitution-based. On a failed save, the creature disappears in a flash
      of white energy only to reappear in the same space 1d4 rounds later. This
      effectively removes that creature from combat for the duration. If the
      space is occupied when the creature returns, it suffers no damage and is
      shunted aside. The time flayer can use this ability three times per day.
  - name: Time Jaunt (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a time flayer can slip through the time stream and
      appear anywhere on the same plane of existence as if by greater teleport.
      This ability transports the time flayer and up to four other creatures
      within a 30-foot radius that the time flayer designates. Unwilling
      creatures can attempt a DC 18 Will save to avoid being carried away. This
      ability is otherwise similar to the greater teleport spell. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Unmaking (Su)
    description: >-
      An opponent slain by a time flayer is unmade-erased from the very fabric
      of time. No memories or recollections of the unmade creature exist
      anywhere in reality. Past events the creature was responsible for are now
      attributed to an unknown-even if they recently took place. For example,
      suppose a great hero saved a kingdom from certain doom and then suffers
      the unmaking. The kingdom is still safe, but no one can quite recall who
      saved it. A creature that suffers the unmaking cannot be raised,
      resurrected, or restored to life by any means-not even a wish can restore
      an unmade creature. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore
      one who suffers this fate.
Description:
  - >-
    Time flayers are natives to the Elemental Plane of Time and are most often
    encountered on that plane, the Astral Plane, or the Ethereal Plane.
    Occasionally a time flayer slips into the Material Plane, but most such
    encounters occur when a hole is torn in the time continuum and it pulls a
    time flayer through, depositing it on the Material Plane. When such an event
    occurs, a time flayer usually looks for a way back to its native plane
    (which usually consists of a place on the Material Plane where the time
    fabric has been weakened). Some time flayers purposefully journey to the
    Material Plane as if they are searching for something-sages and scholars are
    unsure what it is they are looking for. Time flayers coexist on their native
    plane with time elementals who they detest. Why this animosity exists is
    unknown, but neither creature likes the other and they always attack each
    other on sight. Note that time flayers often gain the upper hand in this
    battle as they are unaffected by the aging attack of a time elemental. Time
    flayers fight with their greatswords in battle all the while attempting to
    discern the most powerful foe in a group. Once it has targeted such a foe,
    it uses its temporal displacement ability to effectively remove that
    creature from combat for a few rounds. If faced with certain extinction, a
    time flayer rips a hole in the time continuum and slips away using its time
    jaunt ability. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
