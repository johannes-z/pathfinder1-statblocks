      A carrionstorm never initiates an attack on a creature that openly wears a
      symbol of Urgathoa or that is itself undead. If attacked first by such a
      creature, the carrionstorm's swarm attack deals only 1d3 points of damage
      to that creature rather than the usual 1d6 points.

      A carrionstorm takes 150% as much damage as normal from channeled positive
      energy.

    Where the dead walk, the carrion birds follow. In most cases, the
    unfortunate birds that feast on the remains of fallen undead creatures
    simply grow diseased and die. Yet the flesh of some ghouls has an altogether
    different effect upon such scavengers, and when they die of the poisoned
    repast, they do not stay dead for long. Alone, an undead crow or vulture is
    little more than a hideous mockery, but in rare cases where ghoulish
    activity is thick, entire colonies of carrion birds can succumb to undeath,
    retaining their flock mentality yet no longer seeking the flesh of the
    freshly dead to sate their hunger. Carrionstorms, as these flocks of undead
    birds are called, find brief respite from their morbid hunger only when
    their meals are warm and screaming.

    Carrionstorms are typically found near graveyards, haunted structures, or
    abandoned villages where ghouls have been active. Many necromancers and
    cultists of Urgathoa have a particular fondness for carrionstorms, and since
    the birds have a strange respect for the symbol of the Pallid Princess,
    rookeries of them are often found roosting in the nooks of the goddess of
    undeath's macabre cathedrals.

    Although the individual undead birds that make up a carrionstorm are little
    more intelligent than they were in life, as a whole, a carrionstorm forms a
    rudimentary hive mind that grants its members a slight bit more intellect
    than the typical bird. This not only allows the undead birds to utilize
    basic tactics, but allows rudimentary speech as well. Most carrionstorms
    understand a few dozen words in Necril, the language of the dead, and the
    sound of thousands of these undead carrion birds croaking out strange words
    can be truly unsettling to those who aren't prepared for the horror. This
    same hive mind allows necromancers to treat an entire carrionstorm as a
    single undead creature with regard to the effects of spells like command
    undead and control undead, or feats like Command Undead. The swarms make
    excellent scouts, and even better threats against small towns and
    superstitious communities.
