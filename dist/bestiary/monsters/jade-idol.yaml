  Masterfully carved, this elegant jade figurine stands no more than a hand's
  breadth tall, yet its delicate limbs and incredible details bear all the
  features of a seductive maiden cast in miniature.
Group: Idol

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Jade Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a jade idol can exhale a
      breath of gas that unerringly snakes its way through the air to envelop a
      single target within 50 feet. If the target is reduced to 0 Dexterity, it
      is instantly turned to jade-colored stone. Inanimate corpses targeted by
      this attack are instantly turned to stone, but benefit from the perpetual
      effects of gentle repose while petrified. The spell stone to flesh
      reverses this effect. Poison-inhaled; save DC 14; frequency 1/ round for 6
      rounds; effect 1d4 Dexterity damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
  - name: Inanimate (Ex)
    description: >-
      An idol is effectively a statuette and does little to suggest otherwise.
      Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is
      indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. Unless noted in its
      description, an idol can make use of the majority of its special abilities
      without moving, though the round after it does so observers can make a DC
      25 Perception check to notice minute hints-magical glimmers, minute
      contortions, etc.-suggesting that the idol is actually animate. Overt
      actions, such as an idol moving or attacking, make its nature obvious to
      witnesses, and to others who make a Perception check (as previously noted)
      even 1 round after it moves.
  - name: Share Abilities (Su)
    description: >-
      An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect
      itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or
      allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them
      specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are
      marked with an asterisk (*). Skills In addition to the challenge of
      detecting a stationary idol, these constructs gain a +4 racial bonus on
      Stealth checks made to hide amid the materials that comprise their bodies.
  - name: Tainted Air (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures within 30 feet of a jade idol take a -2 penalty on saving
      throws against poison. The effect lasts as long as a creature remains
      within the jade idol's aura.
  - name: Venom Affinity (Su)
    description: >-
      Any poisonous animal or vermin that comes within 10 feet of a jade idol or
      a creature bearing the idol must make a DC 14 Will save or be charmed as
      per the spell charm animal. Beasts affected by this effect remain charmed
      for 10 minutes, obeying either the idol's will or its bearer's. Any
      creature that makes its save cannot be affected by the same jade idol's
      venom affinity for the next 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    From the moldering depths of the Sodden Lands to far away Tian Xia, jade
    idols stand watch over sacred temples, royal tombs, the monuments of
    powerful ancients, and the hidden lairs of plotting assassins and cruel
    wizards.
  - >-
    Crafted primarily to serve as unassuming killers, jade idols possess
    unnatural patience, waiting for weeks, months, or even years for the
    opportune time when they might be delivered into their victims' hands and
    forgotten before striking. Jade idols are also particularly valued for their
    ability to transform living flesh into a stone similar in appearance to
    jade, but far more brittle and ultimately worthless (a DC 14 Appraise or
    Knowledge [nature] check reveals the difference). Regardless of the stone's
    value, the tombs of many forgotten dynasties bear small legions of jade
    idols, left by their departed masters to keep the residents preserved in
    lifeless jade for all time.
