Description_Visual: >-
  Hanu-nagas are a predominantly tropical and subtropical form of naga; rather
  than a human-headed giant snake, hanu-nagas have a feral monkey head upon a
  great serpentine body.
Group: Naga
Source: Tome of Horrors 4
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Call Monkey Dance (Su)
    description: >-
      A hanu-naga calls 1d6 ghoul monkeys every 1d4 rounds as a 9th-level
      sorcerer. The call lasts as long as the hanu-naga performs its swaying
      dance. The naga may use the dance 3/day.
  - name: Control Simians (Su)
    description: The hanu-naga may command any simian within 60 ft. (no save).
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury or spit-contact; save DC 17 Fort; frequency 1/round for 6
      rounds; effect 1d2 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Spit (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hanu-naga can spit its venom up to 30 feet as a standard action. This is
      a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Opponents hit by this
      attack must make successful saves (see above) to avoid the effect.
Description:
  - >-
    The Hanu-nagas lair in jungles and rainforests, haunting forgotten temples
    and ancient ruins, where many are worshipped by tribes of wild monkeys
    and/or apes. The most intelligent of hanu-nagas may have followings of
    tribesmen or cavemen.
  - >-
    The stylized, writhing dance of a hanu-naga allows it to exert a mystic
    control over apes and monkeys within a radius of 300 ft. These controlled
    creatures act at the naga's mental command. It is not necessary for the apes
    to actually see the naga's dance to fall under its control; indeed, when a
    hanu-naga begins its dance, simian creatures within one mile (to a maximum
    of 20 apes) immediately begin moving at top speed to the dancing naga's
    presence. The naga may dance and attack at the same time.
  - >-
    The bite of a hanu-naga is poisonous, and if the naga hits with its
    constricting attack it inflicts automatic damage of 1d6 per round until
    killed.
