  - name: Stampede (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stampede occurs when three or more creatures with stampede make a
      trample attack while remaining adjacent to each other. While stampeding,
      the creatures can trample foes of their size of smaller, and the trample's
      save DC increases by 2.
Description:
  - >-
    Scholars will explain that though many animals fight to defend their
    territory and their young, only a few apex predators hunt humanoids for
    food. Yet any villager across the Inner Sea region can recount tales about
    man-eating beasts that once lurked in the local wilderness (and might
    still). Any sort of animal can become a man-eater, from known predators to
    seemingly harmless herbivores. Though the creatures and locations may
    change, certain elements remain the same in tales of man-eating animals.
    Having tasted human flesh, these animals can't be sated by any other type of
    food. Man-eaters have terrible bites, and hunters' arrows bounce off their
    hides. Man-eaters are unusually bold, no longer frightened by human presence
    like their kin. Yet they are also canny, employing tactics no mere animal
    could conceive. Man-eaters appear able to understand human speech, and some
    of the more fanciful stories even claim the animals can speak.
  - >-
    A man-eating animal can be distinguished from its common relatives by its
    carnivorous teeth, enlarged jaws, and the glint of intelligence in its eyes.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Most tales of man-eating animals are sparked by rabid or starving (but
    otherwise normal) animals, but true man-eaters do exist. Such abominations
    are the result of a fiendish spirit fusing with that of a mundane animal.
    Though not wholly fiendish in nature, the beast gains limited sentience,
    increased resilience, and unnatural appetites. Despite popular belief,
    eating humanoid flesh isn't enough to turn an animal into a man-eater. The
    creature must be exposed to chaotic and evil inf luences, whether from a
    planar gate, demonic altar, or transformative elixir (such as the blood of
    Baphomet). Man-eating animals can also result from botched summonings and
    incomplete exorcisms. A fiendish spark set loose might inhabit an animal's
    form so that the foul spirit can continue to spread suffering.
  - >-
    Man-eating animals are no longer part of the natural Ecology. They hunt
    almost ceaselessly, preferring intelligent prey above all else. They rarely
    die of natural causes, almost always meeting their ends in bloody conf lict.
    These creatures can and do mate with members of their original species. In
    cases of multiple births, only one of the litter inherits this corruption,
    and it soon devours its siblings.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Individual man-eaters might be found anywhere-the freak results of black
    magic and vicious natures-but they're encountered in numbers only where
    fiendish inf luence is strong. Man-eating animals are most common in the
    blasted landscape of the Worldwound, where they nearly outnumber their
    natural counterparts. In Kyonin, man-eaters have been born to otherwise
    normal animals, a sign to the elves that Tanglebriar's corruption is
    expanding.
  - >-
    Man-eating animals, especially large bovines such as aurochs and bison, are
    sacred to the followers of Baphomet, demon lord of beasts. Away from
    civilized lands, cults of Baphomet raise small herds of these carnivorous
    cattle, feeding them on corpses when live victims are unavailable.
    Man-eating animals serve as guards and pets for dark cultists and the demons
    they worship. Though too intelligent and willful to be trained like normal
    animals, man-eaters gladly serve those who encourage their bloodlust. A
    dissatisfied man-eater, however, is likely to turn on its so-called master
    the second its master displays a moment of weakness.
  - >-
    With their rudimentary intelligence, man-eating animals are able to
    understand the guttural tongue of the Abyss, and to learn common words in
    the language of those they hunt. Many take advantage of hunters who assume
    they are dumb animals.
  - >-
    Man-eaters' combination of animal instinct and demonic cunning allows them
    to more easily hunt their preferred prey: humanoids. Man-eating animals are
    known to track victims over long distances, their enhanced senses and great
    endurance allowing them to continue the chase long after their prey becomes
    fatigued. An innate sense of direction sometimes allows a man-eater to
    anticipate (or overhear) its victim's destination and reach it before the
    creature. Even latched gates and animal traps prove ineffective against the
    man-eater's cunning.
  - Creating a Man-Eating Animal
  - >-
    "Man-Eating" is an inherited or acquired template that can be added to a
    creature of the animal type. A man-eating animal uses all the base
    creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.
  - >-
    CR: HD 4 or fewer, as base creature + 1; HD 5 to 10, as base creature + 2;
    HD 11 or more, as base creature + 3.
  - 'Alignment: Chaotic evil.'
  - >-
    Type: A man-eating animal's type changes to magical beast. It retains any
    subtypes except for alignment subtypes.
  - 'Armor Class: A man-eating animal''s natural armor improves by +2.'
  - 'Hit Dice: A man-eating animal''s racial HD change to d10s.'
  - >-
    Defenses/Qualities: A man-eating animal gains darkvision 60 feet, and DR
    5/slashing (if HD 11 or fewer) or 10/slashing (if HD 12 or more).
  - >-
    Melee: A man-eating animal gains a bite attack. Damage from the bite attack
    depends on the creature's size (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 301-302). If the
    base creature already has a bite attack, it gains Improved Natural Attack
    (bite) and Improved Critical (bite) as bonus feats. It also adds 1-1/2 times
    its Str bonus to the damage (or twice its Str bonus if a bite is its only
    natural attack).
  - 'Abilities: Con +4, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +4.'
  - 'BAB: A man-eating animal''s base attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice.'
  - >-
    Skills: A man-eating animal gains a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks to
    follow tracks.
  - >-
    Languages: A man-eating animal understands Abyssal and Common, but cannot
    speak.
  - Blood of Baphomet
  - >-
    The demon lord of beasts grants dedicated followers the means to turn
    ordinary animals into man-eaters by means of a magical elixir. Called the
    blood of Baphomet, this ichorous fluid is purported to contain the distilled
    essence of animal savagery. A cleric of Baphomet can gain access to the
    required spells from her domains: beast shape III from the Animal domain or
    Fur subdomain and rage from the Demon or Ferocity subdomain.
