Description_Visual: >-
  Twin pairs of mangy, disease-riddled vulture wings flap in concert, keeping
  this lean raptor fiend aloft. Twisted horns rise from a head like a monstrous
  skull and noxious fumes leak from between its yellowed fangs. Hovering with
  impossible control, its vicious foottalons clench and unclench, while its
  clawed hands wield a long, three-pointed ranseur.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Infernal Wound (Ex)
    description: >-
      The damage a magaav deals with its claws or rend causes a persistent
      wound. An injured creature loses 1 additional hit point each round. The
      wound does not heal naturally and resists healing spells. The continuing
      hit point loss can be stopped by a DC 16 Heal check or any spell that
      cures hit point damage; casting a curative spell on the injured creature
      requires a successful DC 15 caster level check, otherwise the spell has no
      effect. The check DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Master Grappler (Ex)
    description: >-
      A magaav can wield a weapon and still make grapple checks. If it's not
      wielding a weapon, a magaav gains a +4 bonus on grapple checks.
  - name: Noxious Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a magaav can exhale a breath that reeks of pure
      corruption upon a creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 16
      Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitutionbased. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by
      the same magaav's noxious breath for 24 hours. A delay poison or
      neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature.
      Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant
      to poison receive their normal bonuses on their saving throws. Once a
      magaav uses its breath weapon, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds
      later.
  - name: Shared Senses (Su)
    description: >-
      All gaavs (and magaavs) within 100 feet of one another share the same
      senses. Thus, if one individual perceives something (for example, with a
      successful Perception check), all others within range are immediately
      aware of it. Senses are instantly relayed from one gaav or magaav to the
      next, allowing for the senses of a single devil to potentially spread
      through and inform an entire massive swarm instantly. It is still possible
      for a magaav to be surprised or flat-footed even if other gaavs or magaavs
      nearby are not. All magaavs may telepathically communicate with all other
      gaavs and magaavs within 100 feet at once, allowing the greater host
      devils to command entire swarms. Although magaavs rarely contradict one
      another, if faced with competing orders, gaavs follow the commands of the
      closest magaav.
  - name: Summon Devil (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day a magaav can attempt to summon 1d2 gaavs with a 60% chance of
      success. This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.
Description:
  - >-
    Hunters of souls, host devils retrieve Hell's most elusive property. Whether
    souls that have long evaded capture upon the plains of Avernus, damned
    beings who have somehow managed to escape Hell, or creatures that have
    reneged upon infernal contracts, vast flocks of these winged fiends swarm
    from the Pit to recover their prey. Rarely seen alone, host devils travel in
    great swarms that often number in the thousands. Amid these great hosts flap
    the swarm leaders, the magaav, fierce mockeries of the angelic form capable
    of directing and redirecting massive columns of their brethren like the
    brain of a single colossal infernal beast. Gaavs stand 4 feet tall and weigh
    approximately 110 pounds, their wingspans stretching to just over 6 feet
    wide. Magaavs stand 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh 150 pounds, with wingspans
    reaching 10 feet across.
