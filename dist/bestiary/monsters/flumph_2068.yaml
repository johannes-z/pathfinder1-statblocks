SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid Injection (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a flumph strikes an opponent with its spikes, it injects a burning,
      irritating acid that deals 1d4 points of acid damage immediately and
      another 1d4 points of acid damage on the round after the attack. The
      target can end the acid's effects by submerging the wound in water for a
      round or by being treated with a DC 15 Heal check. A creature that
      grapples or swallows the flumph takes this acid damage automatically every
      round it maintains this contact with a living flumph.
  - name: Stench Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      A flumph can spray a 20-foot line of foul-smelling liquid once every 1d4
      rounds. This spray functions like the stench universal monster ability,
      except it only affects creatures struck by the spray, which must make a DC
      11 Fortitude save or be sickened for 5 rounds. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Alternatively, the flumph can concentrate the spray on
      a single target within 5 feet. To use this version of its stench spray,
      the flumph must succeed at a ranged touch attack (+5 for most flumphs). If
      the target is hit, it must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or become nauseated
      for 5 rounds; otherwise, it is sickened for 5 rounds. The odor from this
      spray lingers in the area and on all creatures struck for 1d4 hours, and
      can be detected at a range of 100 feet (creatures with the scent ability
      can smell it at double this range).
Description:
  - >-
    Come from distant stars to protect unprepared worlds from cosmic horrors,
    flumphs are jellyfish-like creatures that float in the air and hunt with
    acidic spikes growing from their undersides. Gentle at heart, flumphs
    understand that their appearance often terrifies viewers, and thus conceal
    themselves and observe neighboring settlements from afar, only revealing
    themselves when absolutely necessary. They also know full well the
    limitations of their fragile forms, and rather than directly opposing the
    horrors they seek to defeat, they prefer to recruit and advise heroes to
    tackle these dangerous tasks instead.
  - >-
    Flumphs float and speak via a constant flow of air through tiny pores in
    their white bodies, emitting a rhythmic puffing whenever they're aloft.
    Typical flumphs weigh 15 pounds and are 3 feet across. Flumphs deeply revere
    dreams, seeing them as omens and portents. While they normally mate and
    reproduce on the world of their birth, flumphs occasionally engage in a
    ritual called the Seeding, in which seed pods are flung into outer space in
    order to provide other planets with guardians.
