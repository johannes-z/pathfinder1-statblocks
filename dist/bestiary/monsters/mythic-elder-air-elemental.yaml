SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Air Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against a
      mythic air elemental.
  - name: Create Vacuum (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a mythic elder air elemental can suck the air out of
      the lungs of creatures it has swallowed or that are trapped in its
      whirlwind (Fortitude DC 27 negates). Creatures that fail the save take 2d6
      points of damage and must attempt Constitution checks each round as if
      they had run out of breath. An affected character can't speak, use breath
      weapons, cast spells with verbal components, or do anything else that
      requires breathing. A trapped creature that succeeds at its save must
      succeed at a concentration check to cast spells. The air elemental can
      maintain this vacuum as a move action. If it stops, the trapped or
      swallowed creatures can breathe again. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Elevated Ejection (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a mythic air elemental in whirlwind form ejects a trapped creature,
      it can do so from any point up to the whirlwind's current height, dropping
      the creature into the whirlwind's space or within the elemental's normal
      reach. The creature takes falling damage as normal. If the elemental
      expends one use of mythic power, it can instead throw a trapped creature
      as if using the uncanny grapple path ability (see page 23) with no grapple
      check needed.
  - name: Swallow Whole (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mythic air elemental can use this ability on a creature it has grabbed.
      If a trapped creature cuts itself free, the hole heals itself closed at
      the start of the elemental's next turn, allowing it to use swallow whole
      again.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic elder air elemental is pure fury and strength, capable of throwing
    wooden splinters through stone walls and tearing creatures apart with fists
    of solid wind. Its greatest speed is within its empty core, able to
    suffocate enemies in moments.
