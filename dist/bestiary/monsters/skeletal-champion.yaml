Description:
  - >-
    Some skeletons retain their intelligence and cunning, making them formidable
    warriors. These undead are far more powerful than their mindless kin, and
    many gain class levels. Creating a Skeletal Champion "Skeletal Champion" is
    an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than
    an undead) that has a skeletal system (referred to hereafter as the base
    creature) and a minimum Intelligence of 3. CR: A skeletal champion's CR is
    +1 higher than a normal skeleton with the same HD (see page 250). Type: The
    creature's type becomes undead. It keeps subtypes save for alignment
    subtypes and subtypes that indicate kind. Alignment: Any evil. Armor Class:
    Natural armor as per skeleton (see page 250). Hit Dice: Change all of the
    creature's racial HD to d8s, then add 2 racial Hit Dice to this total
    (creatures without racial HD gain 2). HD from class levels are unchanged.
    Defensive Abilities: A skeletal champion gains DR 5/ bludgeoning, channel
    resistance +4, and immunity to cold. It also gains all of the standard
    undead traits. Speed: As standard skeleton (see page 250). Attacks: As
    standard skeleton (see page 250). Abilities: Str +2, Dex +2. As undead, it
    has no Constitution score. BAB: Its BAB for racial HD equals 3/4 of its HD.
    Skills: Gains skill ranks per racial Hit Die equal to 4 + its Int modifier.
    Class skills for racial HD are Climb, Disguise, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge
    (arcana), Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, and
    Stealth. Skills gained from class levels remain unchanged. Feats: A skeletal
    champion gains Improved Initiative as a bonus feat. Saves: Base save bonuses
    for racial Hit Dice are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD + 2.
