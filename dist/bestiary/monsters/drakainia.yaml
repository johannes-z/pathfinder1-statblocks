SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Birth Spawn (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a drakainia can give birth to a spawn, which is a
      Large or smaller creature of her choice with a single random mutation (see
      the facing page). Each day she can produce any number of creatures whose
      combined total base CR does not exceed 3 + her Constitution modifier
      (usually 21).
  - name: Gestation Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A drakainia's aura pulses with developing life. All poisons or diseases
      active within her 30-foot aura have an onset of 1 round and a frequency of
      1/minute. Impregnated creatures within her aura gestate in 2d4 rounds. Any
      creature born within her aura gains a mutation as if it were the
      drakainia's spawn, though if the creature's parent was not impregnated by
      the drakainia, the creature born is an infant of the kind its biological
      parents would produce, and doesn't count toward the CR limit the drakainia
      can spawn per day.
  - name: Impregnate Surrogate (Su)
    description: >-
      A drakainia can disgorge a monstrous embryo into the mouth of a living,
      corporeal creature that is pinned or helpless. She makes a grapple combat
      maneuver check, and if she succeeds she impregnates that creature
      regardless of its gender. A mythic character must succeed at a DC 38
      Fortitude saving throw to avoid being impregnated; a non-mythic character
      is impregnated automatically. An impregnated creature's pregnancy lasts
      for 2d4 rounds. During this pregnancy, the victim is nauseated until the
      monster bursts forth from the victim's abdomen, which deals 10d6 points of
      damage to the pregnant creature and applies the broken condition to any
      armor it is wearing. Remove disease (DC 28) eliminates the unnatural
      embryo. Alternatively, as a full-round action another creature can attempt
      to cut out the growing monster with a DC 38 Heal check. On a successful
      check, the offspring is removed, and the formerly pregnant creature takes
      1d4 points of bleed damage. On failed check, the pregnant creature takes
      2d6 points of bleed damage and is stunned for 1 round, but the offspring
      is not removed. The creature spawned by means of this impregnation is any
      creature of the drakainia's choice that is at least one size category
      smaller than the creature she impregnated. These spawn count against the
      drakainia's daily CR allowance for birth spawn (see above).
  - name: Invert Birth (Su)
    description: >-
      When a drakainia uses her dimension door spell-like ability, instead of
      the normal range, she can choose to teleport to any space occupied by one
      of her spawn that is within 1 mile of her. She doesn't need line of sight
      or knowledge of the spawn's location. If she chooses a spawn that is
      farther than a mile away, she does not lose the use of the spell-like
      ability, but does lose the action. On arrival, she explodes out from her
      offspring, destroying it entirely.
  - name: Polymorphism (Ex)
    description: >-
      The spawn gestating inside the drakainia constantly alter her internal
      construction, making her immune to bleed, disease, poison, and polymorph
      effects. When she is subject to a critical hit or a sneak attack, this
      polymorphism grants her a 75% chance of negating such attacks.
  - name: Razor Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      A drakainia's claws are razor sharp with a critical threat range of 17-20
      and a critical multiplier of x4.
  - name: Transfer Suffering (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a drakainia can transfer a single harmful spell effect
      or condition from herself to one of her offspring that is currently within
      her gestation aura.
  - name: Well of Life (Su)
    description: >-
      A drakainia can unleash the primal life energy within in her body to
      channel positive energy as if she were a 20th-level cleric (DC 35). She
      can use this ability 18 times per day and can choose to expend 1 use of
      mythic power at each use to maximize the damage healed.
Description:
  - >-
    Primal life energy, raw and uncontrolled, seethes through this mother of
    monsters. Her churning, distended belly mocks creation, birthing horrors and
    dismal failures. The weak are torn apart in the writhing mass of her
    nursery, while the strong transcend their hideous origins to become
    creatures of greatness in their own right. She is always encountered with at
    least a handful of her favored children, as well as other progeny she can
    sacrifice to protect herself. With their help, she impregnates those who
    come across her with twisted, monstrous life.
  - DRAKAINIA SPAWN
  - >-
    When a drakainia spawns, either through her own body or through a surrogate,
    what issues forth is a mutated abomination. Any impregnated creature that's
    within the drakainia's gestation aura has a child of the parents' race, but
    with one of the following mutations.
  - >-
    d% Mutation 01-10 Fatal Mutation The creature is birthed stillborn and
    horribly disfigured. 11-20 Covered in Eyes (Ex) Eyes cover the front and
    back of the creature's head. It gains all-around vision. 21-30 Chameleon
    Scales (Ex) This creature is covered in scales that shift their hue to blend
    in with their surroundings. The creature gains a +8 racial bonus on Stealth
    checks and gains hide in plain sight. 31-40 Poison Glands (Ex) The creature
    has a pair of poison sacs near its mouth. It gains immunity to poison, and
    three times per day it can spit a dose of poison up to 20 feet as a ranged
    touch attack. Poison: Contact-injury; save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 the creature's
    HD + its Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3
    Con damage; cure 1 save. 41-50 Sticky (Ex) The creature's limbs are covered
    in tiny, hooked hairs that give its skin a downy appearance. It gains the
    grab ability on its primary natural attacks (if it has any) or its unarmed
    strike, and a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks. 51-60 Serpent-Headed Tail
    (Ex) The creature has a tail that ends in a snake head. This provides a +4
    circumstance bonus on Perception checks and a primary bite attack (1d3 + the
    creature's Strength modifier for a Medium creature). In addition, the
    creature gains Improved Trip as a bonus feat. 61-70 Vestigial Companion (Ex)
    The creature has the head of an animal (usually a goat, chicken, or dog)
    growing out of its back or torso, providing the scent ability. If the base
    creature already has scent, this mutation allows it to determine the
    direction of a particular scent as a free action. 71-80 Multiple Heads (Ex)
    The creature has 2d4 heads, granting it a +4 racial bonus on saving throws
    against illusions and enchantments and a +8 racial bonus on Perception
    checks. The creature speaks an additional number of languages equal to its
    total number of heads. Each head speaks with a different voice. 81-90
    Tentacles (Ex) The creature's legs are replaced with multiple tentacles. It
    can't be tripped and gains a +8 racial bonus to CMD and a +8 racial bonus on
    combat maneuver checks to grapple. 91-99 Impenetrable Skin (Ex) The
    drakainia spawn's skin is tough and scaly. It gains DR/- equal to half its
    HD (maximum 10). 100 Favored Spawn (Su) Favored spawn are those a drakainia
    has marked as successful or quasi-successful mutations. These powerful spawn
    gain a +4 luck bonus on all saving throws, a +4 increase to natural armor, a
    +4 inherent bonus to two ability scores, and 1 mythic rank.
