    description: >-
      A dire wolverine that takes damage in combat flies into a rage on its next
      turn, madly clawing and biting until either it or its opponent is dead. It
      gains +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, and -2 to AC. The creature
      cannot end its rage voluntarily.
Description:
  - >-
    Dire wolverines tend to be even more territorial than their smaller
    wolverine cousins, and they defend to the death the areas where they choose
    to live, often selecting humanoidsettled regions as their own and then
    fearlessly tearing the settlements apart.
  - >-
    Dire wolverines grow to about 12 feet in length and can weigh as much as
    2,000 pounds.
