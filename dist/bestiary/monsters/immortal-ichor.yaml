SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Corrupt Ally (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature charmed by an immortal ichor takes 1d6 points of Wisdom
      damage per day. When a charmed creature's Wisdom damage equals its Wisdom
      score, it becomes completely subservient to the immortal ichor (as
      dominate monster, except it even obeys self-destructive orders) and loses
      the Wisdom damage it has taken from this ability. A subservient ally who
      is killed rises the next round as a juju zombie under the immortal ichor's
      control. If the ichor is killed, these zombies are immediately destroyed.
Description:
  - >-
    An immortal ichor is an intelligent mass of blood from a dead evil deity.
    Blessed with profane powers and the will to dominate other creatures, these
    oozes are a threat to all living things. The rare few that exist are
    banished underground or sealed away in chambers that block their magical
    abilities. Over time these seals break or erode, allowing a trickle of an
    ooze's substance to escape and giving it a narrow aperture to exert its
    power through. Retaining vague memories of the god it was taken from, an
    immortal ichor uses its minions to find a body to possess, and either sets
    itself up as a godling or tries to find a way to revive its divine source.
