Description:

    Wyverns are nasty, brutish, and violent reptilian beasts akin to more
    powerful dragons. They are always aggressive and impatient, and are quick to
    resort to force in order to accomplish their goals. For this reason, dragons
    generally look down upon wyverns, considering their distant cousins nothing
    more than primitive savages with a distinct lack of style or wit. In most
    cases, this generalization is spot-on. Although far from animalistic in
    intellect, and capable of speech, most wyverns simply can't be bothered with
    the subtlety of diplomacy, and prefer to fight first and parley later, and
    even then only if faced with a foe they can neither defeat nor flee from.

    Wyverns are territorial creatures. Though they occasionally hunt in small
    groups for large prey, they are generally solitary creatures, hunting in
    areas ranging in size from 100 to 200 square miles. Wyverns have been known
    to fight to the death among themselves for the right to hunt a territory
    rich with prey.

    Although constantly hungry and prone to mayhem, a wyvern that can be
    befriended (usually through a delicate combination of flattery,
    intimidation, food, and treasure) becomes a powerful ally. They often serve
    giants and monstrous humanoids as guardians, and some lizardfolk and boggard
    tribes even use them as mounts, although such arrangements are quite costly
    in terms of food and gold, for few are the wyverns who would willingly serve
    as steeds for lesser creatures for long.

    A wyvern is about 16 feet in length, half of which is tail. The average
    wyvern weighs 2,000 pounds.
