  - name: Invisible in Shadows (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a ghost-faced orc stands still or moves slowly (no more than 5 feet
      per round) in shadowy illumination or complete darkness, it becomes
      effectively invisible to all natural and extraordinary sight, including
      darkvision and other sight-based senses. A ghost-faced orc invisible in
      shadows can still be detected by hearing and smell. A true seeing spell
      (or other similar magic) reveals its location as well.
Description:
  - >-
    When they may be seen at all, ghost-faced orcs appear as normal orcs who
    paint their faces in grotesque skull like patterns. Invisible in shadow and
    darkness to all but one another due to unholy pacts with their dark god,
    their face paint gives them the impression of floating disembodied skulls.
    Ghost-faced orcs are similar in every way to their common cousins- filthy,
    smelly, aggressive and thoroughly cruel. Their hair is ranges from black to
    slate grey to shock white. Their equipment is ill kempt and crudely made,
    leaving most to forage for better gear amongst their victims. Ghostfaces are
    seldom seen above ground except on moonless nights. Ghost-faced orcs are
    proficient with all simple weapons. Most are warriors, fighters or
    barbarians and favor greataxes and longspears to any other weapon. They on
    occasion carry shortbows for hunting or ambushes. Ghost-Faced Orc Society
    Ghost-faced orcs differ little from their kin with the exception that a
    larger portion of their population are clerics in service of Grotaag. As
    such these battle priests hold a revered place in society. The priesthood is
    referred to as the Ghost Face Cabal which is made up of the highest level
    clerics amongst the tribe. The cabals outfit themselves and their most
    powerful slayers with enchanted weapons, armor and potions. Ghost-Faced Orc
