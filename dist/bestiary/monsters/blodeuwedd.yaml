Description_Visual: >-
  Clothed in verdant lichen and flowers of broom, meadowsweet, and oak, this
  shapely maiden has skin of velvety moss and living grass for hair. An eldritch
  serenity graces her countenance as she approaches, her outstretched, root-like
  hands brushing the tips of the tallest grass-the wind itself whispers around
  her feet as patches of clover, heather, and milkweed mark her every step.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Allergen Aura (Ex)
    description: >-
      A blodeuwedd exudes an aura of pollen and other irritating allergens that
      forces living creatures within 30 feet to make a DC 18 Fortitude save or
      become sickened, coughing and sneezing for 1d6 rounds. Creatures who
      successfully save cannot be affected by the same blodeuwedd's aura for 24
      hours. A blodeuwedd can suppress this aura at will as a free action. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A blodeuwedd can assume a single unique humanoid shape or the form of a
      prairie owl once per day for up to 7 hours as if using the spell
      polymorph. These hours do not need to be consecutive and a blodeuwedd can
      return to her normal shape as a free action. Nature's
  - name: Infusion (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, while surrounded by any field or fertile plain, a blodeuwedd
      may infuse herself with borrowed life energy from nearby plants and
      nutrients in the ground. This ability functions exactly like false life
      (CL 7th) but lasts only 1 hour.
  - name: Verdant Step (Su)
    description: >-
      Every stride taken by a blodeuwedd causes small plants, grasses, and
      wildflowers to sprout from the ground, though she can suppress this effect
      if she desires. While within a plain of tall grass, brush, or similar
      undergrowth, a blodeuwedd may also step through such plant-life and emerge
      at any other point within the same field (potentially miles away). This
      ability functions similar to transport via plants, but a blodeuwedd can
      only transport herself and does not require a plant equal to her size.
      This ability is usable three times per day.
  - name: Wild Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      This works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except a
      blodeuwedd has a +6 racial bonus on the check. A blodeuwedd with druid
      levels adds this racial modifier to her wild empathy checks.
Description:
  - >-
    The mysterious blodeuwedds stand apart from dryads, their tree-bound sisters
    of the forest, instead watching over the open plains and prairies. They
    frequently guard the approaches to primeval, fey enclaves as well as various
    gateways and entry points into the First World-a task they take very
    seriously. Blodeuwedds hide such regions behind veils of illusion and
    trickery, quietly observing anyone passing through their lands, and
    occasionally sending mysterious messages to warn them away or to summon
    allies that can drive them out. Even when not standing sentinel over a point
    of otherworldly importance, blodeuwedds find spots of particular natural
    beauty, transforming such fields-usually only a few acres in size-into sites
    of unearthly lushness and natural wonder. A typical blodeuwedd stands a
    little over 5 feet tall, weighs 120 pounds, and may live up to 800 years.
    Ecology Instead of developing a lifelong bond with trees, blodeuwedds hold
    an affinity for open grasslands, moors, and plains. They survive off the
    land, taking nourishment from all that nature provides, while also looking
    after prairie animals in times of drought or lean winters. Unlike dryads,
    blodeuwedds have no dependency on the plants around them; they can willingly
    leave their chosen moor to visit their fey kin, scout their domain in owl
    form, or even mingle with frontier communities, changing shape to appear
    elven or human. Every 15 or so years, blodeuwedds may reproduce through a
    natural ritual of fertility known as the Blooming, a process by which they
    commune with the adopted plants of their surrounding field. At the height of
    the spring season, they then exchange pollen with every flower within 300
    yards, a complicated and sensuous act that eventually allows a blodeuwedd to
    conceive. It takes 6 months to carry a new blodeuwedd to term, and they
    frequently come together to act as midwives during this time to ensure
    successful deliveries for one another. Some tales tell of blodeuwedds
    displaced from their homes or in captivity capable of performing the
    Blooming by drawing off the lifeforce of amorous men, ending in the
    withering death of the would-be father. Such legends give blodeuwedds a
    reputation for being dangerous seductresses in some regions. Blodeuwedds
    typically establish their own prairie holdings within 7 miles of each other
    for mutual support and ease of communication. Habitat & Society Blodeuwedds
    make their homes out of sod, carving them from the landscape and then
    encouraging prairie grass to grow over the exterior to hide them. These
    elaborate structures resemble small rises and hillocks that overlook ley
    lines and fairy paths between sites of great power and importance to the
    fey, which the blodeuwedds jealously guard from nonfey creatures. Most fey
    recognize such service by referring to blodeuwedds with honorific titles
    meant to curry their favor. As a result, many blodeuwedds set themselves up
    as queens or wardens to receive tribute from favored kin who pass through
    their realms. Blodeuwedds also rely on plant growth and their ability to
    speak with plants to manage the surrounding fields, encouraging them to grow
    into complex mazes of hedgerows, tangles, and thickets to better shape their
    territory. Often they use hallucinatory terrain to hide the best routes
    through these areas. Interlopers typically find themselves impeded by
    entangle or areas of spike growth when they enter a blodeuwedd's territory.
    Any who persist then become targeted by deep slumber or modify memory to
    lead them in false directions. More rarely, a blodeuwedd might aid one on an
    important quest, but she usually requires some form of guarantee before
    agreeing to do so. All blodeuwedds possess tremendous knowledge of and
    influence over the lands and creatures that border their fields. They often
    involve themselves in the politics of elves, gnomes, and humans who live
    nearby-even if only to warn against destructive trespasses or wasteful
    farming practices. They enjoy playing wind flutes, dancing under the stars,
    and chasing one another's fairy lights like fireflies among the tall grass.
    Blodeuwedd Queens Particularly old and active blodeuwedds- typically the
    eldest within a region that more than 10 blodeuwedds inhabit-sometimes
    ascend to the status of queens, gaining additional power and prestige among
    their own kind. They develop a greater affinity for the lands they rule and
    attract even more followers. The following adjustments to a standard
    blodeuwedd represent a young blodeuwedd queen at CR 8. More powerful
    varieties typically add class levels in druid or sorcerer, both of which are
    considered favored classes for a blodeuwedd queens. • 9 Hit Dice • +2
