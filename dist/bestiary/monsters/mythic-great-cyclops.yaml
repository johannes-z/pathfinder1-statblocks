Group: Cyclops
Source: Mythic Adventures
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Contemptuous Toss (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a mythic great cyclops uses Awesome Blow and expends a use of mythic
      power, its target flies up to 60 additional feet and takes 1d6 points of
      damage for every additional 20 feet traveled. If the cyclops uses its gore
      attack for this ability, it can hurl the target up to 60 feet upward
      instead of sideways.
  - name: Earthquake (Su)
    description: >-
      A mythic great cyclops can punch the ground and expend two uses of mythic
      power to cause an earthquake (as the spell). Add the cyclops's rank to the
      save DCs for the earthquake's effects. Other mythic great cyclopes are not
      affected by the earthquake.
  - name: Flash of Brutality (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a swift action, a great cyclops can gain a burst of savage
      inspiration. When it does, it doubles the threat range of all weapons,
      natural attacks, and rocks it attacks with until the start of its next
      turn. Once per day, when the cyclops reaches 0 or fewer hit points and is
      conscious because of its Diehard feat, this ability recharges, allowing it
      to use the ability a second time that same day.
Description:
  - >-
    Mythic great cyclopes are the first and oldest of their kind to succumb to
    visions of rage and destruction. Said to be the lost offspring of gods of
    lightning and the forge, they wield power over earth and energy, using it to
    blast open humanoid defenses so they can pluck out the tasty morsels within.
