Description:
  - >-
    Mythic great cyclopes are the first and oldest of their kind to succumb to
    visions of rage and destruction. Said to be the lost offspring of gods of
    lightning and the forge, they wield power over earth and energy, using it to
    blast open humanoid defenses so they can pluck out the tasty morsels within.
