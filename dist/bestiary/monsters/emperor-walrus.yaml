  - >-
    Towering over common walruses, emperor walruses live in only the most
    secluded arctic areas. They might be throwbacks to an earlier age of giant
    animals or bred by druids to be superior arctic predators. They often live
    in the company of common walruses, but are far more aggressive, driving off
    or killing any potential threats to the herd. Emperor walruses have a
    similar diet to common walruses, but may also eat giant crabs, seals, large
    fish, and seabirds. A full-grown male emperor walrus measures 20 feet in
    length and weighs around 16 tons, with tusks up to 6 feet long. It can live
    up to 80 years.
