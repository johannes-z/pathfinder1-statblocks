    description: >-
      Tentacle-injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect
      1 Con and 1 Cha; cure 2 consecutive saves. If a creature fails two
      consecutive saving throws, its jaw locks, its tongue swells, and its lips
      pull back, making speech impossible. This condition ends when the Charisma
      damage is healed.
Description:
  - >-
    Most common in warm or temperate waters, the death's head jellyfish is an
    aggressive predator. The creature derives its name from the pattern on its
    4-foot-wide bell and from the poison it delivers with its tentacles. Those
    unfortunate enough to be subjected to this toxin develop rigor of the facial
    muscles that results in a wide-eyed grimace if left untreated.
