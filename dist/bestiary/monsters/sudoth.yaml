Description_Visual: >-
  This vaguely humanoid creature has a head that resembles a large jelly fish.
  Extending down from its large head is a manlike torso and arms that again
  change into a long knot of feathery writhing tentacles which it uses as a
  means of propulsion beneath the waves. Its lower torso is a mass of writhing
  and twitching tentacles.

Description:
  - >-
    Sudoth are a curious species thought to be the offspring of sailors stranded
    in windless seas and some cursed horror of the deep. For this reason they
    are often attacked by mariners on sight. In truth, the sudoth are a
    peaceable if dangerous species that trade freely between locathah, sahaugin,
    and occasionally sea elves and merfolk. Their pliable flesh proves immune to
    the pressures of deep waters, allowing them to salvage riches from the
    depths that even other races of the seas find impossible to retrieve. They
    are enemies of krakens and aboleth who find them a delicious tasting
    delicacy. Sudoths make their lairs deep under the oceans and sustain
    themselves on a diet of small fish and plant life. Hunters by nature, they
    often employ spears and nets when on a hunting excursion. The fleshy parts
    of this creature vary in color from a milky white transparent color to a
    deep, rich bluish-green. Its tentacles range in color from gray to dark blue
    and vary in size with the sudoth (the larger specimen's tentacles reach
    lengths of 10 feet or more). A small almost unnoticeable band of eyes (the
    same color as its flesh) ring the circumference of its head. Sudoth attack
    with weapons such as spears or with slam attacks. Their tail tentacles
    excrete a paralytic substance. A common tactic is to grapple and paralyze a
    foe with its tentacles, and finish them off with stabs from their spear. Its
    malleable form protects it against most bludgeoning attacks; thus opponents
    are advised to employ piercing or slashing weapons when combating a sudoth.
