Description:
  - >-
    Lammasus are protectors of the weak and ever-vigilant champions against
    evil. These noble creatures dwell in crumbling desert ruins or other remote
    areas, where they tirelessly fight against the forces of darkness, hoping to
    defend those they consider lesser races from the evils that often lurk in
    such places.
  - >-
    Although most of these winged sentinels prove wise and knowledgeable about
    those who would seek to do evil in their lands, many races find lammasus
    arrogant, dismissive, and patronizing, taking umbrage at their superior
    attitudes and affectations. Such reactions confuse and sometimes insult
    these highly honorable creatures, who seek only to do good and aid those
    weaker than themselves. Lammasus who witness members of other races actively
    combating evil typically prove more sensitive and address such allies as
    equals. Should good-aligned creatures prove their skill and overcome any
    differences of attitude they might have with one of these majestic beings,
    they find a true and noble ally and an invaluable resource for those hoping
    to defeat evil.
  - >-
    Lammasus are quite parental toward those who join their cause, bringing a
    lifetime of experience to any struggle. This often makes them stern, but
    those who know lammasus find them to be extremely caring about those they
    protect. A lammasu eagerly lays down its own life to protect those in peril
    if such a sacrifice might win the day. Most lammasus are 8 feet in length
    and weigh approximately 900 pounds.
