SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Desert Thirst (Su)
    description: >-
      A blue dragon can cast create water at will (CL equals its HD).
      Alternatively, it can destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot
      burst. Unattended liquids are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based
      magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must
      succeed on a Will save (DC equal to the dragon's breath weapon) or be
      destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Electricity Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      An adult blue dragon is surrounded by an aura of electricity. Creatures
      within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the beginning of
      the dragon's turn. An old dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. An ancient
      dragon's damage increases to 2d6.
  - name: Mirage (Su)
    description: >-
      An old or older blue dragon can make itself appear to be in two places at
      once as a free action for a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit
      Dice. This ability functions as project image but the dragon can use its
      breath weapon through the mirage.
  - name: Sandstorm (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a great wyrm blue dragon can create a sandstorm
      centered on itself with a radius of 1,200 feet. Creatures other than the
      dragon inside the storm take 2d6 points of damage per round in addition to
      the normal sandstorm penalties (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 431). This
      sandstorm lasts for up to 1 hour, but can be dismissed by the dragon as a
      free action.
  - name: Sound Imitation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has
      heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive
      check. Spell-Like
  - name: Abilities (Sp)

      Great wyrm-mirage arcana.
  - name: Storm Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      An ancient or older blue dragon can use its breath weapon to create a
      storm of lightning. This functions as call lightning storm, but the damage
      is equal to the dragon's breath weapon. The dragon can call down 1 bolt
      per round as a free action for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is equal to the
      dragon's breath weapon DC. Additional uses of this ability extend the
      duration by an additional 1d6 rounds. Age Category S pecial Abilities

Description:
  - >-
    Blue dragons are consummate schemers and obsessively orderly. In combat,
    blue dragons prefer to surprise foes if possible, and are not above
    retreating if the odds turn against them. They prefer to lair near those
    that they control, sometimes even within the confines of a city.
