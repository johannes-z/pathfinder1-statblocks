SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adamantine Attacks (Ex)
    description: >-
      A zentragt's bite and claw attacks count as adamantine, chaotic, and magic
      for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.
  - name: Eat Metal (Su)
    description: >-
      A zentragt can eat metal to heal itself. For every 5 pounds of iron or
      steel it consumes, it heals 5 hit points. Adamantine, cold iron, mithral,
      or metals with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher heal it double this
      amount. It takes a zentragt 1 minute to eat 5 pounds of metal.
Description:
  - Zentragts are armored, bearlike servitors of Gorum.
  - >-
    Terse, burly, and independent, they are disciplined warriors, and use canny
    tactics whether alone, grouped with their own kind, or part of a legion of
    mixed creatures. They relish opportunities to charge into battle and eagerly
    serve in the vanguard of armies sworn to Our Lord in Iron.
  - >-
    Zentragts quickly grow bored if there is nothing for them to fight, and
    challenge each other-or any creature present that looks like it can handle a
    rough fight-to maintain their high spirits. They work as needed to prepare
    for future battles, hauling materials to build defensive walls or siege
    engines for future conf licts or hunting creatures that consider themselves
    apex predators. They prefer using their magical abilities to enhance
    themselves and share their blessings with those they consider worthy allies.
    Some particularly brazen zentragts have even been known to use magic to
    enhance foes, bolstering their strength or healing their wounds to ensure a
    more worthy battle. Regardless of their foe, zentragts enjoy singing during
    combat (though they aren't particularly good at it), and keep rhythm by
    using their metallic natural weapons as percussive instruments against enemy
    armor.
  - >-
    Zentragts revere metal, seeing all iron and steel as a portion of their
    divine master. To them, the act of eating metal is a form of communion in
    which they replenish their bodies with Gorum's enduring substance. As such,
    they go out of their way to collect rare metals and treat such ritual meals
    with uncharacteristic respect.
  - On average, zentragts stand about 9 feet tall and weigh over 1,200 pounds.
