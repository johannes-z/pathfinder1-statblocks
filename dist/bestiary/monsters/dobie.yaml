SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Size Alteration (Su)
    description: >-
      At will as a standard action, a dobie can change its size between Medium
      and Large. Weapons, armor, and other objects on the dobie's person grow
      proportionally when it changes sizes (objects revert to normal size one
      round after a dobie releases them). When a dobie becomes Large, its speed
      increases to 40 feet, it gains +6 Strength, -2 Dexterity, and +4
      Constitution, and takes a -1 size penalty to AC. A dobie can use this
      ability only in its natural environment. If a dobie leaves its natural
      environment while enlarged, it immediately reverts to its normal size.
      Additionally, an enlarged dobie that takes 10 points of fire damage or
      more from a single fire effect immediately reverts to its normal size. It
      cannot enlarge itself again for 3 rounds after being hit by a fire effect.
Description:
  - >-
    Dobies are forest creatures believed by some to be the offspring of a
    spriggan and a dryad, though most learned sages brush this off as simple
    folklore. They are generally good-natured creatures and aid good-aligned or
    neutral creatures in need. Creatures they encounter destroying their forests
    or slaughtering its denizens are attacked almost immediately without
    question.
  - >-
    Dobies build their homes deep within the forests they protect. Though their
    homes are generally secluded so prying eyes don't disturb them, they always
    fashion them in such a way that allows the dobie to keep a watchful eye on
    its domain at all times. Dobies are solitary creatures; if more than one is
    encountered they are likely a mated pair. Dobies mate for life.
  - >-
    Dobies stand about 5 feet tall but can alter their size to attain heights of
    10 feet. They dress in brightly colored clothes and overcoats of green,
    brown, red, and tan. Dobies can live to be 600 years old, generally reaching
    maturity around age 100.
  - >-
    Dobies enlarge themselves at the start of combat, seeking to gain any
    advantage they can over their enemies, attacking with both weapons and
    spell-like abilities. If the battle is going against a dobie, it uses its
    summon ability to bring forest creatures to its aid and to cover its escape.
