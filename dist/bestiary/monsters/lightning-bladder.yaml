  A roiling, bubble-like creature slowly oozes its way towards you, tiny surges
  of electricity arc through its semi-transparent form, and an acrid stench
  surrounds the creature like a cloud.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      The corrosive acid that covers a lightning bladder dissolves metals and
      organic material, but not stone. Each slam attack deals 1d6 additional
      acid damage. Armor or clothing worn by a creature touched by a lightning
      bladder takes the same amount of acid damage unless the wearer succeeds on
      a DC 20 Reflex saving throw. A wooden or metal weapon that strikes the
      creature takes 1d6 acid damage unless the weapon's wielder succeeds on a
      DC 20 Reflex save. The bladder's touch deals 12 points of acid damage per
      round to wooden or metal objects, but the bladder must remain in contact
      with the material for 1 full round in order to deal this damage. The save
      DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Electrical Discharge (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any hit scored against a lightning bladder with a piercing or slashing
      weapon opens a hole in the creature's acidic membrane, through which
      lightning-like charges of electricity will blast out each subsequent
      combat round. These bolts of lightning inflict 2d6 points of damage
      against a randomly determined opponent (DC 15 Reflex save for half
      damage). The bladder can have any number of such openings before it is
      eventually killed from the damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Lightning bladders are a form of ooze, contained within a thin, membranous
    skin; they resemble massive, half-filled blue water balloons some 5-6 feet
    in diameter.
  - >-
    The inside of the creature is charged with immense electrical potential,
    clearly visible as lightning-like flashes and forks within the bluish-hued
    interior of the shapeless mass. The exterior membrane is highly acidic, and
    the creature will attack by slumping up against its opponents to slam them.
    The more dangerous aspect of a lightning bladder, however, is what happens
    when a pointed or cutting weapon pierces its outer membrane, releasing the
    inner electrical charge.
