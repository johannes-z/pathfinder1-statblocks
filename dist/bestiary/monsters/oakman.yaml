SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Shillelagh (Su)
    description: >-
      Any oaken club or staff wielded by an oakman automatically gains the
      benefits of the shillelagh spell (caster level 5th). The oakman does not
      have to cast this spell to get the benefit; its effects are automatic as
      long as the club or staff is in the oakman's hands. (This benefit is
      already included in the statistics block above.) In anyone else's hands,
      the oaken club or staff functions as a normal weapon of whatever type it
      is.
  - name: Moss (Ex)
    description: >-
      Using his unique knowledge of plants and herbal mixtures, an oakman can
      concoct unusual cakes from tree moss. A typical oakman has 1d6 moss cakes
      of random type on his person. These moss cakes have a variety of effects
      and must be eaten by the target creature to take effect. Saves (where
      applicable) have a DC of 15. Ability Score Damage: The victim suffers 1d6
      points of ability damage to a random ability (determined when the moss
      cake is created). One day after eating the moss cake, if the victim
      doesn't receive a restoration spell, it must make another successful save
      or one point of the ability damage is actually drain. Coloration: This
      moss cake is quite harmless when eaten and does nothing more than cause
      the victim's skin to become spotted. The spots can be of just about any
      color, though most tend to be brown, red, or blue. The spots last for 1
      hour before fading. Healing: This moss cake heals the target as by a heal
      spell cast by a 5th-level cleric. Lethargy: The victim falls into a state
      of apathy and becomes sluggish if it fails a Fortitude save. The effects
      last for 30 minutes. While affected, the victim moves at one-half its
      normal speed and suffers a -2 circumstance penalty to AC and on attack
      rolls, checks, and saves. Pain: Eating this moss cake wracks the victim
      with pain for 1d4 hours if it fails a Fortitude save. During this time,
      the victim suffers a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls, weapon
      damage rolls, and ability and skill checks. Poison: Eating this moss cake
      poisons the victim (ingestion; save Fort DC 15; effect 1d6 Con, cure two
      consecutive saves). Sleep: This moss cake puts the victim to sleep for 1
      hour (as the sleep spell) if it fails a Fortitude save.
  - name: Tree Dependent (Su)
    description: >-
      An oakman is mystically bonded to a single, enormous tree and must never
      stray more than a mile from it. An oakman who moves more than a mile from
      his bonded tree immediately becomes sickened. Every hour thereafter, he
      must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to resist becoming nauseated for an hour.
      An oakman that is out of range of his bonded tree for 24 hours takes 1d6
      points of Constitution damage, and another 1d6 points of Constitution
      damage every day that follows-eventually, this separation kills the
      oakman. An oakman cannot forge a new bond with a new tree; if his tree is
      destroyed, he will eventually sicken and die.
  - name: Tree Stride (Su)
    description: >-
      At will, an oakman can create an effect identical to that of the tree
      stride spell (caster level 5th). Oakmen can only travel through oak trees.
      This ability can be negated or dispelled, but the oakman can restart it on
      its next turn.
Description:
  - >-
    Oakmen are small fey that are said to be the spirits of oak trees. An oakman
    is a foul-tempered curmudgeon, gruff and cantankerous. These grouchy
    creatures are usually seen sitting up on a thick branch in an oak tree
    calling down insults and crude comments to those who pass by. Some say that
    the grumpy old oakmen are the male versions of the beautiful dryads. This
    may or may not be true, but it would certainly explain why dryads would
    rather take human mates. Oakmen are generally content to sit in their trees
    and watch the world go by, venturing out only if their forest is threatened.
    They also enjoy creeping out of the forest to trick some fool human into
    eating magical cakes made from moss and mushrooms just to see what will
    happen to him. Oakmen are scrappy and prone to combat despite their small
    size. They willingly fight if they must, but, like most fey, prefer to use
    magic rather than melee. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.
