    description: >-
      A living creature injured by a botfly swarm's attack must make a DC 14
      Fortitude save or be infested with the swarm's larvae. The larvae may be
      cut out of the host with a DC 15 Heal check, though each attempt inflicts
      1d8 points of damage whether or not it's successful. A cure disease spell
      destroys all larvae without further harm to the host. Botfly larvae:
      infestation; save Fort DC 14; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con
      damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Common to sweltering jungles, warm swamplands, and lazy riverbanks, these
    pestilent fly swarms seek humanoid hosts for their eggs. While not as
    physically dangerous as their giant cousins, implanted botf ly larvae
    typically carry diseases that spread to the host. Infestations Parasites
    such as botf ly larvae cause infestations, a type of aff liction similar to
    diseases. Infestations can only be cured through specific means; otherwise,
    no matter how many saving throws are made, the infestation continues to aff
    lict the target. While a remove disease spell (or similar effect) instantly
    halts an infestation, immunity to disease offers no protection, as the
    infestation itself is caused by parasites.
