SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Spear and Shield (Su)
    description: >-
      At will as a free action, a shield archon can transform his hands into a
      +1 tower shield and a +3 shortspear, or either individually, or back to
      hands again. He cannot transform both hands into shields or both into
      shortspears. A shield archon never takes the typical -2 penalty on attack
      rolls while wielding a tower shield. A shield archon's weapons cannot be
      disarmed, but they can be sundered. If a shield archon loses his spear or
      shield, he can manifest a new one as a full-round action. When a shield
      archon is slain, these two items fade away-they cannot be looted or
      wielded by any other creature.
  - name: Stability (Ex)
    description: >-
      Shield archons receive a +4 racial bonus to CMD when resisting a bull rush
      or trip attempt.
  - name: Transpose Ally (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a shield archon can teleport to the
      location of a willing (or unconscious) ally and immediately teleport that
      ally to the archon's previous position, in effect switching places with
      the ally. The archon must have line of effect to the target.
Description:
  - >-
    Shield archons are the mighty rocks of celestial armies, withstanding waves
    of demons and devils without complaint. Though more than capable of tearing
    apart lesser demons and devils, their true strength lies in their ability to
    shrug off deadly attacks from superior opponents, giving their
    offense-oriented allies time to flank and overwhelm their mutual foes.
    Shield archons are 9 feet tall and weigh 800 pounds.
