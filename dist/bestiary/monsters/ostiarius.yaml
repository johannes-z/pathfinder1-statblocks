Description:
  - >-
    Ostiariuses mind the gate between the world of mortals and the delights of
    the Plane of Shadow. Their role is twofold: admitting their brethren onto
    the Material Plane and-more insidiously- convincing mortals to willingly
    journey with them to their shadowed homeland. They are the emissaries of
    their race, encouraging susceptible mortals to abandon their tired
    philosophies and embrace the possibilities of a realm of inscrutable
    darkness. Most proudly stand over 6 feet tall, though their weights range
    from exceedingly light to grossly heavy.
