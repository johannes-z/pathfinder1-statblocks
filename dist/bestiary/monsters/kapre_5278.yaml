SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blow Smoke (Su)
    description: >-
      Smoke constantly drifts from a kapre's mouth, and as a standard action it
      can exhale a 30-foot cone of smoke. Any creature in the area must succeed
      at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. This is a poison
      effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Confounding Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A magical aura surrounds a kapre, confusing and distracting its foes.
      Within a kapre's aura, the DC of all Survival checks is increased by 15,
      and creatures trained in Survival are no longer able to automatically
      determine true north. On top of this, any creature within a kapre's aura
      must succeed at a DC 21 Will saving throw when it enters the area or take
      a -4 penalty on concentration checks, initiative checks, and skill checks.
      A kapre can suppress this aura at will.
  - name: Tree Meld (Su)
    description: >-
      A kapre can meld with any tree, similar to how the spell meld with stone
      functions. It can remain melded with a tree as long as it wishes.
Description:
  - >-
    Vehement defenders of the unusual locations of the natural world, kapres
    have a complicated relationship with the "civilized" races. Formed of dense
    tree matter, they are as much part of the forest as their botanical
    brethren. Their intimidating physical size, territorial nature, and unusual
    approach to friendship often bring them into conf lict with local tribes and
    aggressive explorers. With slender limbs and thick, gnarled torsos, kapres
    are awkwardly humanoid in appearance, and if not for the soft glow of their
    eyes they could be mistaken for treants. Exceedingly secretive and wary,
    kapres prefer to avoid conf lict, using their imposing size and confounding
    auras to intimidate any would-be invaders. Leaning out of huge trees, they
    blow smoke onto lost explorers, persuading them to flee.
