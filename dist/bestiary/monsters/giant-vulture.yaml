Description:
  - >-
    Larger even than condors, giant vultures dwell only in regions where carrion
    is both large and plentiful, such as the primeval wildernesses where
    megafauna roam. They also flock to regions torn by war, feasting on the dead
    with no concern for allegiance or race. Giant vultures rarely wait for
    wounded creatures to finish dying before they feed, and are much braver than
    most wild animals. A giant vulture, for example, wouldn't think twice about
    swooping down on a heavily armored column of soldiers just to snatch up a
    few wounded stragglers from the end of the line.

    A giant vulture stands more than 13 feet tall, has a wingspan of over 30
    feet, and weighs 500 to 600 pounds.
