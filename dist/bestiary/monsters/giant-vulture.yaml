    description: >-
      Due to their filthy eating habits and constant exposure to decaying flesh,
      giant vultures are harbingers of disease-much more so than the standard
      vulture. Any creature bitten by a giant vulture has a 10% chance of being
      exposed to filth fever, blinding sickness, or a similar disease (Core
      Rulebook 557). Once this check is made, a victim can no longer be infected
      by this particular giant vulture, though attacks by different giant
      vultures are resolved normally and may result in multiple illnesses. While
      vultures aren't immune to all diseases, they do gain a +4 racial bonus on
      all saving throws against such ailments.
Description:
  - >-
    Larger even than condors, giant vultures dwell only in regions where carrion
    is both large and plentiful, such as the primeval wildernesses where
    megafauna roam. They also flock to regions torn by war, feasting on the dead
    with no concern for allegiance or race. Giant vultures rarely wait for
    wounded creatures to finish dying before they feed, and are much braver than
    most wild animals. A giant vulture, for example, wouldn't think twice about
    swooping down on a heavily armored column of soldiers just to snatch up a
    few wounded stragglers from the end of the line.

    A giant vulture stands more than 13 feet tall, has a wingspan of over 30
    feet, and weighs 500 to 600 pounds.
