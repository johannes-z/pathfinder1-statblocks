  Pallid and horribly gaunt, this enormous but emaciated dragonlike creature has
  two forearms and no wings.
Group: Linnorm
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 3
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a cairn linnorm can expel a
      60-foot cone of acidic bile, dealing 18d8 points of acid damage to all
      creatures struck. In addition, this bile is infused with negative energy,
      and inflicts 1d4 negative levels on all creatures struck by it. A
      successful DC 28 Reflex save halves the damage and completely negates the
      negative levels. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Death Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      Curse of Decay: save Will DC 28; effect the creature takes 1 point of
      Constitution damage per day, and ages at an accelerated rate of 1 year per
      day, eventually incurring all of the penalties of old age but none of the
      benefits (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169).
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 28; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 4d6
      acid damage and 1d6 Con drain; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Description:
  - >-
    Cairn linnorms prefer to dwell in necropolises, amid reaches of burial
    mounds, or in caverns below the scorched earth of legendary battlefields.
    These linnorms particularly relish the flavor of undead flesh-while they
    cannot consume incorporeal undead, regions they haunt are typically barren
    of corporeal undead not canny enough to avoid the cairn linnorm's ravenous
    appetite. An incredibly powerful undead creature might use a cairn linnorm
    as a guardian, manipulating the dragon while it selects a cairn or tomb well
    within the linnorm's territory. While cairn linnorms will not hesitate to
    feed on undead creatures they encounter, some ancient superstition shared by
    all of their kind prevents them from actually entering a tomb or other
    enclosed burial site unless granted permission by the tomb's undead denizens
    or a priest devoted to the religion associated with the site. Likewise, a
    cairn linnorm somehow caught within a tomb large enough to contain it
    prefers not to leave without securing similar permission to do so. These
    limitations are purely psychological, and if pressed (such as by an enemy
    seeking to use a tomb entrance as a defense), a cairn linnorm can break such
    restrictions.
  - A cairn linnorm is 60 feet long and weighs 12,000 pounds.
