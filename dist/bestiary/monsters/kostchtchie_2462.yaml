Description:
  - >-
    Kostchtchie is the demon lord of cold and the prince of wrath; he is the
    epitome of hatred and evil. If there is a demon lord more ruthless and
    malevolent than he, that lord has never made his presence known.
  - >-
    Kostchtchie is hated by all (including other demon lords and princes). He
    moves across his Abyssal landscape with a shuffling gait, and is rarely, if
    ever, encountered alone.
  - >-
    Kostchtchie is revered by some frost giant shamans as a god. Various clans
    pay tribute to him in the form of humanoid sacrifices (made bimonthly,
    except in the winter when sacrifices are made monthly) and often invoke his
    blessing before undertaking a great quest or entering a great battle.
  - >-
    Kostchtchie's Abyssal home is a frigid and mountainous realm of ice, rock,
    snow, and subfreezing temperatures. Unprotected travelers and those
    vulnerable to cold do not last long here.
  - Kostchtchie stands 9 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds.
  - >-
    Kostchtchie fights with his oversized warhammer in battle. He is relentless
    in his attack and seeks to kill all interlopers he encounters.
  - >-
    Kostchtchie completely destroys any creature's body he slays. The body is
    torn to pieces, burned, or devoured by the demon lord or his minions.
  - >-
    Servants of Kostchtchie Followers of Kostchtchie are usually frost giants
    and fiendish frost giants. They are usually fighters or barbarians. Many
    that receive his special blessing find their bodies warped an twisted,
    forever after wracked by pain and filled with rage. Devout followers of
    Kostchtchie are called Ice Lords and must sign a pact of evil with
    Kostchtchie. Ice Lords that cast divine spells can receive spells from
    Kostchtchie and typically have access to two of the following domains:
    Chaos, Evil, and Destruction.
