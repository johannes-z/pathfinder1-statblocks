  - name: Martial Proficiency (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sinspawn are proficient in all simple and martial weapons, armor, and
      shields (except tower shields). Sin-Scent (Su) Sinspawn have scent against
      creatures whose nature reflects the sinspawn's sin. For example, wrathful
      sinspawn can scent creatures using rage effects. The GM should adjudicate
      what creatures a particular sinspawn can scent.
  - name: Sinful Bite (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature bitten by a sinspawn is overwhelmed with sinful thoughts (DC 12
      Will save negates). These emotions are so powerful that the target becomes
      sickened for 1d6 minutes. An affected target that is bitten a second time
      is staggered for 1 round if it fails its saving throw. Calm emotions,
      remove curse, or break enchantment negates the effects of sinful bite. The
      save DC is Charisma-based. This is a mind-affecting effect.

  - >-
    Literally the embodiment of a sin made flesh, they are sentient abominations
    of distilled ectoplasm imprinted with the soul-image of slain creatures that
    possessed an abundance of a particular sin.
