SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A sword spider is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance, except as noted: A keen edge spell affects all of a
      sword spider's sword-leg attacks as if they were slashing weapons.
      Transmute metal to wood slows a sword spider for 1d4 rounds (as the slow
      spell), during which time its damage reduction is negated (no save). A
      magical attack that deals fire damage ends any slow effect on the sword
      spider and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack
      would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the sword
      spider to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as
      temporary hit points. A sword spider gets no saving throw against fire
      effects. A sword spider is affected normally by rusting attacks, such as
      those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      A sword spider's bite injects poison from a hidden reservoir within its
      metal body. Because it is a construct, the sword spider does not naturally
      produce this poison, and its creator must manually refill this reservoir.
      The reservoir holds enough poison for 5 successful bite attacks, after
      which the sword spider deals only bite damage. Refilling the reservoir
      takes 1 minute and provokes attacks of opportunity. The creator can fill
      the reservoir with any injury poison (typically spider venom), though
      acid, alchemical substances, and even stranger liquids have been used.
      Giant Spider Venom: Bite-injury; save DC 14 Fort; frequency 1/round for 4
      rounds; effect 1d2 Strength damage; cure 1 save. Sword-Legs (Ex) A sword
      spider's legs act as longswords, granting it iterative attacks just as if
      it wielded multiple weapons. It cannot be disarmed and a sword spider
      never takes penalties to its attack rolls (for multiweapon fighting) when
      fighting with its sword-legs.
Description:
  - >-
    A sword spider resembles a giant-sized arachnid constructed of steel. Its
    eight spidery legs end in large sharpened blades resembles longswords or
    greatswords. A typical sword spider stands 10 feet tall and weighs 3,000
    pounds.
  - >-
    When activated, a sword spider fights relentlessly and tirelessly to
    vanquish its foes, slashing them with up to four of its sword-like legs.
  - Construction
  - >-
    A sword spider's body is constructed from at least 3,000 pounds of smelted
    steel. The metal must be of exceptional quality, and costs at least 5,000
    gp.
