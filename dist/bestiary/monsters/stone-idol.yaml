SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Inanimate (Ex)
    description: >-
      An idol is effectively a statuette and does little to suggest otherwise.
      Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is
      indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. Unless noted in its
      description, an idol can make use of the majority of its special abilities
      without moving, though the round after it does so observers can make a DC
      25 Perception check to notice minute hints-magical glimmers, minute
      contortions, etc.-suggesting that the idol is actually animate. Overt
      actions, such as an idol moving or attacking, make its nature obvious to
      witnesses, and to others who make a Perception check (as previously noted)
      even 1 round after it moves.
  - name: Preserve Memory (Su)
    description: >-
      Any sentient creature with a Charisma of 14 or higher can copy one of its
      memories into a stone idol. To do so, the creature must remain in contact
      with a stone idol for 1 minute and concentrate on a memory to be
      duplicated. This memory must be 5 minutes or shorter and be of an actual
      event; imaginings cannot be reproduced. After a memory has been
      duplicated, it remains in the stone idol until a new memory is recorded. A
      memory held by a stone idol can be altered via the spell modify memory. A
      memory held within a stone idol can be viewed by any creature that comes
      into mental contact with the construct and by the use of detect thoughts,
      mind-reading effects, or similar abilities, even one redirected by its
      stony mind ability.
  - name: Share Abilities (Su)
    description: >-
      An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect
      itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or
      allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them
      specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are
      marked with an asterisk (*). Skills In addition to the challenge of
      detecting a stationary idol, these constructs gain a +4 racial bonus on
      Stealth checks made to hide amid the materials that comprise their bodies.
  - name: Stony Mind (Su)
    description: >-
      Any divination spell targeting a creature or object within 30 feet of a
      stone idol instead targets the construct. Thus, for the purposes of any
      spell that reveals auras, those affected are treated as being under the
      effects of the spell misdirection, while spells like detect thoughts
      receive nothing more than vague impressions. Should detect thoughts or
      another mind-reading effect target a stone idol that contains a memory,
      the ability user instantly gains the memory held within.
  - name: Suggestive (Su)
    description: >-
      Those fascinated by a stone idol's animal trance or hypnotic pattern
      spell-like ability become highly susceptible to the suggestions of others
      nearby. Any creature can make a suggestion (as per the spell suggestion)
      to a fascinated creature, who must then make a DC 15 Will save or proceed
      to follow the suggestion. Any creature who makes a suggestion is
      understood by the fascinated creature, as per the spell tongues or speak
      with animals. A suggestion lasts for 1 hour, even if a creature is no
      longer being fascinated. A fascinated creature follows only the first
      suggestion it fails its saving throw against and no additional
      suggestions. The DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Rarely seen in civilized lands, stone idols rest among the ruins of ancient
    civilizations, the sole inheritors of incredible secrets and lost lore.
    Sculpted in the images of forgotten lords and mythic beasts, these
    statuettes transfix their foes with a suggestion of what wonders their
    polished eyes might once have witnessed.
