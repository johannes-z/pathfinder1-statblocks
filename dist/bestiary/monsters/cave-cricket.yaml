    description: >-
      Creatures within 20 feet of a chirping cave cricket cannot be heard unless
      they scream. Spellcasters in the area must succeed on a DC 11
      Concentration check to successfully cast a spell. The chirping increases
      the chance of wandering monsters by 30%. The check DC is
      Constitution-based.

      A cave cricket is a natural leaper and gains a +10 racial bonus to
      Acrobatics checks when jumping.
Description:
  - >-
    Cave crickets are larger versions of normal crickets and, much like the
    smaller crickets they resemble, are relatively harmless. The cave cricket's
    chirping can be heard to a range of 300 feet. Cave crickets are about 3 feet
    long.
  - >-
    Cave crickets are mostly harmless, noisy insects and rarely attack living
    creatures. If attacked, a cave cricket uses its powerful legs to kick its
    opponents before hopping away.
