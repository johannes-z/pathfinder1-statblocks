SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Aura of Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      This aura functions as a fear spell (CL 12th). A creature that
      successfully saves against the baba yaga's aura is unaffected by the same
      baba yaga's aura for one day. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC
      is Charisma-based. A baba yaga can suppress or restart this aura as a free
      action.
  - name: Evil Eye (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a baba yaga can crush the will of a foe within 30
      feet that she can see. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or
      take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until
      the evil eye is removed. This is a curse effect. The save DC is
      Intelligence-based. A creature currently affected by a baba yaga's evil
      eye cannot be affected again (by
  - name: the same or a different  Decaying Hex (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a baba yaga can place a hex on any living creature
      within 60 feet. If the creature fails a DC 22 Fortitude save it takes 3d6
      points of damage plus 2d6 bleed damage. A creature that fails its save by
      5 or more also takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage. The bleeding can
      be stopped with a DC 15 Heal check or through the application of any
      magical healing. The save DC is Intelligence-based. Spells A baba yaga
      casts spells as a 12th-level witch (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced
      Player's Guide). They do not gain access to any other witch abilities.
  - name: Swamp Stride (Ex)
    description: >-
      A baba yaga can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its
      normal speed.
Description:
  - >-
    Long thought to be a solitary or unique being (similar to the medusa), sages
    and scholars have come to believe the baba yaga are in fact a race of evil
    crones related to the hag race. Perhaps this theory is accurate, or perhaps
    it is what the true Baba Yaga wants the world to believe; no one is quite
    sure what is true and what isn't when it comes to the baba yaga.
  - >-
    A baba yaga makes its home deep in the darkest and most remote swamps and
    fens. There in the center of the swamp is her home: a large wooden hut
    perched atop two tall and muscular chicken legs. The hut is believed to be
    highly magical, ten times larger on the inside than it appears outside, and
    possibly contain portals to other planes. It is also believed by some to be
    some sort of construct or golem, though no proof of such claims exists.
    Surrounding the hut is a small dark picket fence which holds the skulls of
    the baba yaga's victims. The hut can lower itself to the ground so the baba
    yaga can enter, but it only functions if she chants, and it only functions
    for the baba yaga that dwells there. No other creature has figured out how
    to control the baba yaga's hut.
  - >-
    Adventurers who have seen a baba yaga on the move say she moves through her
    swampy lair at in a giant mortar, steering it with a large pestle in one
    hand, and using a magic broom to sweep all traces of her passing with the
    other. This mortar, rumors say, can only be driven by a baba yaga or high
    level spellcaster, but again, no one is certain what the truth is.
  - >-
    A baba yaga appears as a slightly hunched, old, and hideously ugly crone,
    with a large nose, long sharp teeth, and hands that end in wicked claws. She
    dresses in loose fitting ugly brown cloaks. When moving about in civilized
    areas, a baba yaga often pulls the hood of her cloak over her head, walks
    slowly, and carries a crooked and rotting walking stick.
