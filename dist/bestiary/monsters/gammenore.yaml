Description_Visual: >-
  Spikes of ice jut from the carapace of this stocky crustacean. It scuttles
  sideways on its eight legs with surprising speed, while its two pincers-one
  small and sharp, the other monstrously large- flex in anticipation of combat.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ice Spikes (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a gammenore can force freezing water through pores
      in its carapace to produce long, sharp spikes of ice. These spikes impale
      nearby creatures, dealing 6d6 points of piercing damage to each creature
      adjacent to the gammenore (Reflex DC 19 half). Additionally, the spikes
      shatter easily, embedding shards of ice in the flesh of creatures that
      fail their saving throws against the attack-these shards deal 1d6 points
      of bleed damage each round until the wounds are healed. A gammenore can
      use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Oversized Pincer (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gammenore's pincer attack is a primary attack that deals the indicated
      amount of damage plus 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier.
  - name: Shell of Ice (Su)
    description: >-
      Much of a gammenore's carapace is encased in a thick layer of jagged
      icicles. This shell of ice functions much like spiked armor, dealing 1d8
      points of piercing damage to the target of any successful grapple combat
      maneuver check made by the gammenore. Additionally, this frozen shell
      helps to regulate the gammenore's cold body temperature, granting it
      resistance 10 to fire. The shell can absorb up to 60 points of fire damage
      before melting. Once the shell melts, the gammenore takes a -4 penalty to
      its natural armor bonus, it loses its fire resistance, and it deals no
      additional damage when grappling. A gammenore can reconstitute a melted
      shell by spending time in areas of intense cold. This process takes 2
      hours in a cold environment, 3d10 minutes in areas of severe cold, and
      1d10 minutes in areas of extreme cold.
Description:
  - >-
    The gammenore is a prime example of how Triaxian fauna has adapted to
    survive the planet's long, cruel winters. While other creatures struggle to
    survive the planet's decades-long season of cold and ice, the gammenore
    thrives, turning the might of winter into the very tools of its survival.
  - >-
    Absent its icy armor, the gammenore looks like a large,
    blue-and-white-shelled crustacean. It has a rather wide,
  - >-
    oval-shaped carapace, a pair of powerful pincers, and four pairs of strong,
    articulated legs.
  - >-
    A gammenore's two pincers serve very different purposes. The primary claw is
    monstrously large and extremely strong, and is used to break through ice and
    crush the gammenore's prey. The other claw is smaller, less cumbersome, and
    sharp enough to rend flesh and bone. The gammenore uses this smaller claw to
    tear its victims into pieces small enough to eat, and to perform any
    manipulations too delicate for the large claw. Its eyes are located on short
    stalks that rise from the front of its carapace, allowing it to see even
    when encased in its shell of ice. A gammenore is approximately 8 feet wide,
    and weighs between 2,000 and 3,000 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Despite their resemblance to mundane crabs, gammenores are primarily
    terrestrial creatures, living in water only as larvae and while mating. They
    can be found anywhere ice and snow exists on Triaxus, from the high
    mountains to the low snowy plains, or even atop the ice-covered seas. The
    gammenore is an ambush predator, preferring to conceal itself in snow banks
    or among ice formations and wait for prey to approach. Once a victim is
    within reach, the gammenore erupts from hiding and attempts to grab or
    cripple the target with its large claw. Failing that, it may chase down its
    prey on foot, especially if the victim seems injured or the terrain favors
    climbing over sprinting. When times are lean, a gammenore may resort to
    scavenging or even to stealing food from larger predators, trusting its
    shell to protect it from enemies' reprisals.
  - >-
    When threatened, a gammenore forces freezing water through pores in its
    shell to form a barrier of spikes across its carapace. These spikes break
    and fuse together over time to form a thick sheet of jagged ice over much of
    the gammenore's body, granting it a second layer of defense against attacks.
    A gammenore is able to excrete more water this way than it should
    theoretically be able to carry within its body, leading many scholars to
    conclude that much of the ice is magically produced or conjured. Despite
    this, gammenores seem to possess an unquenchable thirst, spending much of
    their time eating snow and ice. The creatures also prefer to eat their food
    frozen, letting victims' torn bodies freeze before crunching away at their
    meals.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    During Triaxus's harsh winters, gammenores rarely spend much time in each
    other's company, as they are extremely competitive and fight each other for
    food or territory. Their behavior changes drastically as the season begins
    to turn- they become much more companionable as winter's grip on the land
    weakens. As spring nears, gammenores from across Triaxus instinctively begin
    to migrate to the nearest
  - >-
    body of water to mate and lay their eggs. These eggs then go dormant during
    the planet's long summer, hatching as the water temperature begins to drop
    once again. After laying their eggs, gammenores migrate to the coldest, most
    remote parts of the world. This is a time of danger for the civilized races
    of Triaxus, for gammenore migration routes are hardly regular each season
    and often cross through populated areas. In the northern stretches of the
    Allied Territories, inhabitants tell tales of armies of gammenores, over a
    hundred strong, marching through cities and leaving naught but rubble and
    ruin. These stories are most likely exaggerations, as gammenores rarely
    travel in groups larger than nine, but such packs of migrating gammenores
    can still wreak havoc on a community.
  - >-
    At the end of the gammenores' journey, they gather by the hundreds atop the
    tallest mountains and in the deepest caverns of the world to flee the coming
    heat. Near the planet's north pole these colonies can grow into the
    thousands, covering swaths of land in a living blanket of gammenores. Piled
    atop each other, the gammenores extend their ice shells to cover their
    entire bodies, encasing themselves in ice and slowing their metabolisms in
    an attempt to preserve themselves. Precipitation during the tail end of
    winter combines with the gammenore's own supernatural cold to further cement
    the creatures together, forming miniature glaciers and mountain icecaps to
    protect the colony from the heat of the planet's long summer.
  - >-
    This defense is far from perfect and few gammenores survive to the next
    winter. During particularly hot summers, gammenores on the periphery of the
    colony thaw prematurely. These gammenores either die quickly from the heat,
    or stumble into glacial runoff and are washed downstream, becoming
    short-lived menaces to riverside communities. Summertime gammenores react to
    heat dangers as though they were one category more severe-normal
    temperatures count as hot conditions, hot conditions count as severe heat,
    etc. The high temperatures of summer also disorient the gammenores, giving
    them the confused condition. Gammenores in the heat lose their shell of ice
    ability entirely, and produce sprays of cold water from their bodies in
    place of ice spikes, allowing them to attempt a single combat maneuver check
    to bull rush all adjacent creatures once every 1d4 rounds. Reduce the CR of
    a gammenore encountered in the summertime by 2.
  - >-
    Gammenore eggs hatch in late fall, releasing swarms of larvae into the
    waters in which they were deposited. These larvae feed upon each other, and
    on anything the current washes them across, until they mature into adult
    gammenores at the start of winter. Meanwhile, the adults that survived the
    summer chip themselves free from their communal glaciers to seek new hunting
    grounds away from their competitive kin, so that they can feed and restore
    their strength.
