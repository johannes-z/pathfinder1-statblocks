SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Liquid Leap (Sp)
    description: >-
      As long as an omox is in contact with liquid, it can use dimension door as
      a swift action (CL 12th); its starting and ending points must be connected
      by a contiguous mass of liquid.
  - name: Slime (Su)
    description: >-
      An omox's nauseating body is composed of sticky, acidic slime. As an
      attack action, it can hurl a glob of slime (range increment 20 feet). Any
      creature that is struck by the glob must make a DC 23 Reflex save or
      become entangled for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Smothering (Ex)
    description: >-
      An omox can use its grab ability against a creature of any size. When it
      grabs a foe, it attempts to flow over and into the victim's mouth and nose
      to smother it. Each round the omox maintains its grapple, its victim
      cannot breathe or speak. See page 445 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook
      for rules on how long a victim can hold its breath and the consequences of
      suffocation.
Description:
  - >-
    Amorphous beings of living slime, these repulsive demons lurk in fetid pools
    and lakes of filth, eager to drown unwary passersby. When summoned to the
    Material Plane, omoxes typically guard places of sacred filth or waters
    watched over by cults of Jubilex, the demon lord with which these foul
    demons are most commonly associated.
  - >-
    A typical omox stands 7 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds. They form from
    the souls of those who destroyed beautiful things in life, or who befouled
    and desecrated objects of purity.
