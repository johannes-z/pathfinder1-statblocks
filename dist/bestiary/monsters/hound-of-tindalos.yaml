SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Angled Entry (Su)
    description: >-
      Hounds of Tindalos move through the dimensions in ways other creatures
      cannot comprehend. They may use greater teleport (self only) once per
      round as a swift action and plane shift (self only) 3/day as a standard
      action (caster level 10th). A hound of Tindalos can use these powers
      anywhere, but its destination point must be adjacent to a fixed angle or
      corner in the physical environment, such as a wall, floor, or ceiling (as
      determined by the GM); temporary angles created by cloth, flesh, or small
      items are not sufficient. It cannot use these abilities to enter curved
      architecture or open outdoor environments.
  - name: Otherworldly Mind (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any non-outsider attempting to read the thoughts of a hound of Tindalos or
      communicate with it telepathically takes 5d6 points of nonlethal damage
      and must make a DC 18 Will save or become confused for 2d4 rounds. This is
      a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Ripping Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      5d6 slashing damage, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 18 negates. A creature that
      succeeds on its save is immune to that hound's gaze for 24 hours. Damage
      caused by a ripping gaze can be defeated by damage reduction, but it
      bypasses DR/magic and slashing. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Hounds of Tindalos are otherworldly predators from beyond the bounds of
    known reality, usually appearing only when summoned by reckless
    spellcasters. Little is known about their nature outside of blood-spattered
    notes and deranged writings of the nearly insane survivors of their attacks.
    Although possessed of great cunning and cruel intellect, the hounds show no
    evidence of understanding or communicating with mortals. They enter the
    physical world on their own in pursuit of those who have trodden too much
    the netherways beyond time and reality-time travelers (be it physical travel
    or simply divinatory glimpses forward or backward in time) and creatures
    that teleport without regard to how this movement impacts subtle magical
    currents in the multiverse particularly draw their interest.
