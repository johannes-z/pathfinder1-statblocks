  Presented on these pages are base animal statistics for six additional
  familiars beyond those most commonly used by spellcasters-of course, these
  statistics can also be used for normal animals as well. These familiars
  utilize all the standard rules for familiars presented on pages 82-83 of the
  Core Rulebook. Tiny or smaller familiars in this section use Dexterity to
  modify Climb and Swim skill checks.
