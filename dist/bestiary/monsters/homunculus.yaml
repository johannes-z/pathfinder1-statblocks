    description: >-
      A homunculus cannot speak, but the process of creating one links it
      telepathically with its creator. A homunculus knows what its master knows
      and can convey to him or her everything it sees and hears, out to a
      distance of 1,500 feet.
Description:
  - >-
    A homunculus is a miniature servant created by a spellcaster from his own
    blood. They are weak combatants but make effective spies, messengers, and
    scouts. A homunculus's creator determines its precise features; some are
    more refined looking, but most creators don't bother to improve the
    creature's appearance beyond the minimum necessary for functioning.
  - >-
    Homunculi are little more than tools designed to carry out assigned tasks.
    They are extensions of their creators, sharing the same alignment and basic
    nature.
  - >-
    A homunculus never willingly travels more than a mile from its master,
    though it can be removed forcibly. If this occurs, the creature does
    everything in its power to return to this range, as it cannot communicate
    with its master beyond this distance. An attack that destroys a homunculus
    deals 2d10 points of damage to its master. If the creature's master is
    slain, the homunculus goes insane-it loses its Intelligence score, all
    feats, and all skill ranks, and generally claims the immediate surroundings
    as its domain, mindlessly attacking any who intrude upon its lair.
  - >-
    On rare occasions, a homunculus freed from its servitude rises above its
    master's original intent and becomes more than a half-insane construct
    guardian of a long-forgotten lair. In some cases, a homunculus might even
    come to see itself as the rightful heir to its master's legacy, or even the
    reincarnated spirit of the master himself.
  - >-
    Construction A homunculus is shaped from a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake
    root, spring water, and one pint of the creator's own blood. These materials
    cost 50 gp. After the body is sculpted, it is animated through an extended
    magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom,
    similar to an alchemist's laboratory, and costing an additional 1,000 gp to
    supply. If the creator is personally constructing the creature's body, the
    building and ritual can be performed together. A homunculus with more than 2
    Hit Dice can be created, but each additional Hit Die adds +2,000 gp to the
    cost to create.
  - >-
    The person whose blood is used to form a homunculus's body becomes its
    master; it is possible for one person to give blood for the creation,
    another to sculpt the base material, and another to magically animate it as
    a minion for the one who provided the blood.
