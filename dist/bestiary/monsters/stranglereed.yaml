  This tangled mass of thick reeds sways in the breeze. Hidden under the surface
  of the water, a wicked maw of barbs and thorns waits in ambush.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Freeze (Ex)
    description: >-
      A stranglereed can hold itself so still that it appears to be normal
      vegetation. A stranglereed that uses this ability can take 20 on its
      Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a regular patch of reeds.
  - name: Strangle (Ex)
    description: >-
      Stranglereeds have an unerring talent for seizing their victims by the
      throat. A creature that is grappled by a stranglereed can't speak or cast
      spells with verbal components.
  - name: Suffocate (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature that's affected by a stranglereed's strangle ability can't
      breathe and must hold its breath or suffocate.
Description:
  - >-
    An unlikely predator, a stranglereed floats motionless in calm lakes and
    rivers, patiently waiting for prey to approach before lashing out with two
    thick tendrils. This horrifically efficient killer gets its name from its
    uncanny ability to find a victim's throat with its tendrils. Once the
    stranglereed has secured its prey, it pulls its victim beneath the surface
    of the water and directs the victim toward a submerged circular orifice
    ringed with hundreds of gnashing barbs and thorns. Exceptionally voracious,
    the stranglereed never stops feeding, and in desperate times, the
    industrious plant can leave the water brief ly in order to hunt on land.
    These vicious, tenacious plants can even chase down their prey if it breaks
    free of their strong tendrils. Fortunately, a stranglereed can spend only a
    limited amount of time out of water. A stranglereed resembles a patch of
    normal reeds that covers a roughly circular 10-foot diameter area. Submerged
    in the water under this unassuming vegetation lies a large stalk that ends
    in its circular mouth. Its length is roughly 8 feet, from its mouth to the
    tips of its extended reeds. A stranglereed weighs 800 pounds.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Above the calm waters, the stranglereed resembles a large but innocuous
    reedbed. However, underneath the water's murk, a large cylindrical stalk
    bobs in the currents. At the end of this stalk gapes a maw ringed with
    multiple rows of sharp barbs and thorns capable of shredding the flesh from
    prey's bones. Several tendrils grow from under the stranglereed's stalk to
    root themselves loosely into the bed of the lake, oasis, or river where it
    dwells. When the stranglereed detects prey, two tendrils specialized for
    grasping prey shoot toward their target and attempt to grapple it. The
    stranglereed lashes its tendrils around its target's throat and begins to
    asphyxiate the target. Once its hold is secure, it reels the prey into the
    water and into its hungry maw. Over centuries of evolution, the stranglereed
    has developed the ability to extend the range of these lashing tendrils by
    using an effective, if awkward, lunge.
  - >-
    Close inspection reveals that the stranglereed has multiple eyes that
    resemble fuzzy nodules running up its many reed stalks. In fact, over a
    hundred of these tiny orbs can be detected on a typical specimen, and they
    grant the stranglereed a superior sense of sight.
  - >-
    A stranglereed can venture onto dry land for a limited period of time, which
    it does when food is scarce or its prey breaks free from its tendrils and
    flees onto land. Its stalks can change in appearance to match the
    surrounding flora, a process that takes approximately 24 hours. This enables
    the plant to blend in with its surroundings whenever it finds itself in a
    new body of water.
  - >-
    A stranglereed reproduces by expelling seeds that float on air currents much
    like a dandelion's fluff. Those that land on dry earth soon die or are
    scavenged by birds and other small animals. Those that land in water grow
    into full-sized stranglereed stalks within 1 month. A large body of water
    can be home to a cluster of stranglereeds if the food supply can meet their
    demands.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Typically found in warm, slow-moving water, the stranglereed favors sites
    that attract large mammals. Watering holes, sluggish rivers, lakes, and
    especially oases are common feeding spots. While the stranglereed can
    sustain itself on a diet of fish and other marine life, it seems to prefer
    the taste of hot blood washing through its gullet. Possessing an animal
    intellect, the stranglereed quickly adapts to its habitat and soon discovers
    which creatures it can realistically take down and which are better left
    alone.
  - >-
    Osirion, they pose the greatest danger in and around Tephu, where workers
    harvest the abundant papyrus reeds for Tephu's profitable papyrus trade.
    Papyrus harvesters have taken to prodding growths of papyrus with long poles
    to determine whether the reeds are in fact mundane plants or dangerous
    stranglereeds. Some enterprising harvesters even seek out and kill
    stranglereeds to sell to those who use their pulp in the creation of
    guardian scrolls (for more information on guardian scrolls see page 82 of
    Pathfinder Adventure Path #79).
  - >-
    When food is abundant, groups of stranglereeds often entwine their tendrils
    to create a strong matrix that allows them to work together to tackle much
    larger prey. This prey is often torn apart and split among the various
    members of the entwined patch. Entwined stranglereeds seem to release their
    fluff-like seeds more frequently than their solitary brethren. After
    spending years in an entwined state, these plants can sometimes merge into
    one larger creature referred to as a bloated patch.
  - >-
    Variant Stranglereeds Nomads and explorers tell chilling tales of more
    aggressive stranglereeds dwelling in secluded areas of the Inner Sea that
    glory in blood-drinking, paralyze victims, and have gigantic mouths, .
    Fortunately, the tales passed from nomad to nomad are often exaggerated, and
    while stranglereeds that possess some of these qualities do exist, they are
    simply minor variations on the standard stranglereed.
  - >-
    Stranglereed Bloated Patch (CR +1): This variation of the stranglereed has
    the giant creature simple template. Because of its enormous size, this
    variation prefers to swallow its prey whole. The bloated patch's bite attack
    gains the grab special attack, and any creature grappled in its mouth can be
    swallowed whole. The bloated patch gains the following special attacks: bite
    (grab) and swallow whole (4d6 acid damage, AC 16, 14 hp).
  - >-
    Stranglereed Sucker (CR+1): This variation of the stranglereed has the
    advanced creature simple template. In addition, the tendrils of this
    stranglereed are lined with tiny suckers that draw forth the victim's blood.
    This ability not only makes these stranglereeds less likely to lose their
    prey, but also make it easier for them to drink their prey's warm blood.
    Because of this evolution, stranglereed suckers gain an additional +2 bonus
    on combat maneuver checks when grappling and their tendril attacks gain the
    bleed ability (2d6).
  - >-
    Toxic Stranglereed (CR +2): This variation of the stranglereed has the
    advanced creature simple template. When the tendrils of the toxic
    stranglereed strike its prey, its target must succeed at a Fortitude save or
    become paralyzed. The toxic stranglereed's tendrils gain the following
    special attack: paralysis (1d4 rounds, DC 16).
