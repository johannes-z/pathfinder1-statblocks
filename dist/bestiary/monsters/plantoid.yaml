SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alien Plant (Ex)
    description: >-
      Plantoids are extradimensional fungi, and have the same class skills as
      aberrations.
  - name: Moss Tendrils (Ex)
    description: >-
      A plantoid lashes out with several mossy tendrils when it attacks, gaining
      a +1 bonus on its grapple check for each tendril that hit its opponent.
  - name: Control (Ex)
    description: >-
      The tendrils of a plantoid inject a mind-controlling substance, which it
      injects as a free action as part of its grapple check. Anyone touched by
      the mossy tendrils must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or fall under control
      of the plantoid. This otherwise acts like the dominate person spell except
      that the plantoid must touch the target and it functions on any Medium
      humanoid or monstrous humanoid. Control lasts for as long as the plantoid
      maintains contact. The victim also gets another saving throw to resist as
      described under the dominate person spell, and once every 4 hours after
      control is initiated. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Create Servitor (Ex)
    description: >-
      Anyone who remains controlled by a plantoid for more than 24 hours becomes
      a plantoid servitor, all human reason irrevocably lost. A plantoid can
      only control and transform a single creature or servitor at a time.
Description:
  - >-
    Plantoids are creatures from another dimension or plane of existence,
    occasionally summoned forth into the Material Plane. The eyes are not
    magical, but the long strands of moss trailing after the plantoid have a
    very dangerous ability to enslave anyone caught within them. The soft, mossy
    consistency of plantoids makes these creatures immune to blunt weapons. The
    plantoids can snap their mossy beards out like whips, attempting to touch a
    potential victim.
  - Plantoid King
  - >-
    It is rumored that plantoid "Kings" exist, with 10 HD and a limited immunity
    to both spells (SR 11+ CR) and non-magic weapons (DR 5/ magic).
