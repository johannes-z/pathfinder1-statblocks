Description:
  - >-
    The lashunta are the primary race of Castrovel, called "the Green Planet"
    for its steaming jungles. Though the women look like idealized elves or
    humans-save for the twitching antennae sprouting from their foreheads-their
    men are squat, hairy, and broad-shouldered, with a fierce and
    confrontational demeanor. Both genders excel at scholarship, and the race
    boasts a large number of telepaths and telekinetics, in addition to
    conventional magic-users. This ability to create mental or empathic bonds is
    particularly prevalent among female warriors, who form close connections
    with their saurian mounts.
  - >-
    Female lashunta are typically 6 feet tall and weigh 140 pounds. The males of
    the race are usually 5 feet tall and weigh 200 pounds.
