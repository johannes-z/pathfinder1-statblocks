Description:
  - >-
    Tigers stand more than 3 feet tall at the shoulder and are about 9 feet
    long. They weigh from 400 to 600 pounds.
  - >-
    Tigers are usually the top animal predators in their territories, and have
    been known to kill bears, crocodiles, giant snakes, wolves, and even other
    great cats. Even humanoids are far from safe, especially in cases where a
    tiger has developed a taste for humanoid flesh. Tigers prefer terrain with
    plenty of cover and proximity to water as their hunting grounds.
  - >-
    While the tiger itself is a fearsome predator, its strength and ferocity
    pales in comparison to that of the larger dire tiger.
  - >-
    Known to many scholars as the smilodon and to tribal societies as the
    saber-toothed tiger, the dire tiger is invariably one of the region's top
    predators. Its defining feature is a pair of huge incisors that hang down
    like fearsome knives from the upper jaw, protruding menacingly even when the
    creature's mouth is shut.
  - >-
    These immense hunting cats grow to be over 12 feet long and can weigh up to
    6,000 pounds.
