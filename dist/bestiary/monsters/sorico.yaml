  - name: Dust Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a move action, a sorico can shake loose a cloud of
      dust and sand from its coat that fills its space, providing concealment
      for 1 round. A light wind disperses this cloud immediately. Any creatures
      sharing a sorico's space when it uses this ability must succeed at a DC 13
      Fortitude save or they become staggered for 1 round as they cough and
      sneeze. Creatures that don't breathe are immune to this effect. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Also called dustshroud rabbits, soricos dig out warrens in the desert sands,
    where they remain protected from the elements and predators alike. These
    communal animals live in vast tunneling colonies like ants, each working
    endlessly to provide for the warren. They dig tunnels and burrows, shoring
    up the sides of the passages with sticky saliva that hardens into a
    temporary cement. Since they constantly toil in their warrens, their tawny
    fur collects fine dust and sand particles. As an instinctive means of
    defense, soricos shake themselves violently, which loosens the sand and
    creates a distracting cloud of dust that allows them to escape from
    predators. Soricos measure 3 feet long, stand 2 feet tall, and weigh 100
    pounds. Those who hunt soricos find their meat delicious, comparable to that
    of a farm-raised rabbit.
