SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Entangle (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a balor lord strikes a Medium or smaller foe with its whip, the balor
      can immediately attempt a grapple check without provoking an attack of
      opportunity. If the balor wins the check, it draws the foe into an
      adjacent square. The foe gains the grappled condition, but the balor does
      not.
  - name: Lifedrinker (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever the balor lord slays a living foe, it receives the benefits of a
      heal spell (CL 20th). This ability can activate up to once per round.
Description:
  - >-
    Even more terrible than the typical balor are those who do not call a demon
    lord their master, but instead are masters themselves. A balor lord
    typically rules over a region no larger than half the size of the realm in
    which it resides (as only full demon lords can command the rule of an entire
    Abyssal realm), and even though most balor lords rule much smaller regions
    (generally areas comparable in size to a single continent), their power is
    vast indeed. A balor lord is typically a CR 21 to CR 25 monster (a range
    shared with the various unique nascent demon lords, with the range of CR 26
    and above being the domain of the demon lords themselves), and as such
    serves quite well as the final villain in a long-running campaign. The
    majority of balor lords have several levels of barbarian, fighter, or ranger
    (although ranger balor lords never form bonds with animals), but some
    instead have levels of bard, rogue, sorcerer, or wizard. Cleric balor lords
    are unknown, as they see themselves as objects of worship, not the other way
    around, although rumors persist of powerful balor clerics that directly
    serve demon lords or even evil gods. In addition to any benefits a balor
    lord might gain from its class levels, all balor lords possess one
    additional unique ability over and above those granted by its race and
    class. Listed here are three sample balor lord abilities, but these samples
    are by no means the entirety of the strange powers a balor lord might wield.

    Lifedrinker (Su)Whenever the balor lord slays a living foe, it receives the
    benefits of a heal spell (CL 20th). This ability can activate up to once per
    round.
  - >-
    Master of Magic (Su) The balor lord has additional spell-like abilities (20
    spell levels' worth of 1st-4th level spells usable at will and 20 spell
    levels' worth of 5th-8th level spells usable 3 times a day).
  - >-
    Soul Swallow (Su)As a standard action, the balor lord can inhale the soul of
    a living creature within 30 feet. The target must make a Fortitude save (DC
    10 + 1/2 balor lord's racial HD + the balor lord's Charisma modifier) or
    die. The body of a humanoid creature killed in this manner immediately
    transforms into a demon under the balor lord's command (a babau, succubus,
    or shadow demon, according to the balor lord's whim).
