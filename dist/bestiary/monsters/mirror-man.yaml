Description_Visual: >-
  Tall and lean, this hooded figure resembles a human until the terrible face
  beneath the cowl is revealed-nothing but a featureless mirror, reflecting a
  hard, cold world.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alert Master (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a mirror man can send a brief message to a creature
      it is familiar with (typically its master). This effect is similar to the
      sending spell, but it takes only a standard action, the communication is
      one way, and the target cannot respond to the sending.
  - name: Mirror Sight (Ex)
    description: >-
      A mirror man has no eyes, but is capable of visually perceiving through
      the use of blindsight, darkvision, and low-light vision.
  - name: Scrying Focus (Su)
    description: >-
      Mirror men are specifically created to interact with the spell Irriseni
      mirror sight (Pathfinder Adventure Path #67 73) in special ways. The
      construct's mirrored face can serve as a known mirror, allowing the caster
      to see from the perspective of the construct's face with normal sight. The
      caster may also communicate telepathically with the mirror man. As a swift
      action, the mirror man can choose to remember and record up to 1 minute of
      what it sees. This memory is visual only and can be viewed remotely
      through Irriseni mirror sight or played back across its face. The mirror
      man can only retain 1 minute of images; when its memory is full, old
      memories are erased so it can remember new ones. The caster may interact
      with the mirror man's soul mirror even after the construct body is
      destroyed as long as the face itself remains unbroken. If the construct
      has not been destroyed, an opponent must succeed at a sunder attempt
      targeting the mirrored face to break the mirror. The mirrored face is
      considered a separate weapon with a hardness of 1 and hit points equal to
      the mirror man's Hit Dice. If the construct has been destroyed, the
      mirrored face can be smashed as a standard action.
  - name: Soul Mirror (Su)
    description: >-
      The soul of a mirror man is bound within its mirrored face. As long as the
      face remains intact, it can be affixed to a new construct body using the
      same cost to create a new construct. Once a soul is bound to a mirror, the
      soul continues to learn, and if the mirror is later affixed to a new body,
      the soul retains any memories from its previous bodies. Susceptible to
      Mind-Affecting
  - name: Effects (Ex)
    description: >-
      The self-aware and autonomous nature of a mirror man makes it susceptible
      to mind-affecting effects, despite the fact that it is a construct.
Description:
  - >-
    At a glance, mirror men are easily mistaken for humans. They are tall,
    slender, and graceful and mask their true selves in fine hooded cloaks
    appropriate to Irrisen's eternal winter. Nevertheless, their grace is the
    product of precision, not elegance, and their hooded garments serve to
    obscure an inhuman countenance. A mirror man has no eyes, nose, or mouth.
    Its face is a featureless mirror, affixed atop a lifeless body. Behind this
    mirror is a vacant hole left behind when the body was prepared for its
    current use.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Mirror men are constructs whose origin is less than a century old, and are
    typically found in larger Irriseni cities such as Whitethrone and
    Algidheart. Just as guardian dolls are animated with the souls of children,
    mirror men get their spark from adults-usually criminals. They are created
    to be the spies and assassins of the White Witches, and their construct
    nature makes them utterly loyal to the Jadwiga. Mirror men are cunning,
    merciless, and determined in the execution of their orders. Underneath their
    garments they resemble zombies, or even flesh golems. All unnecessary
    internal organs and fluids have been removed, and what remains is wrapped in
    cold muscle and skin of a grayish hue that is magically maintained and
    self-repairing. No eyes remain within their skulls, but the soul trapped
    within the mirror can sense all movement nearby.
  - >-
    While some golems and constructs are simple replacements for guards and
    protectors, the mirror men of Irrisen represent a very specific design. They
    are intended to investigate, spy, and report, and are created with abilities
    carefully selected to help them fulfill these purposes. Even their ability
    to magically create light serves to allow the witches to see better while
    peering through their looking-glass faces. Mirror men are trained to be
    familiar with nobility of the region, to detect forgeries, and to
    investigate crimes. There remains a flaw in their creation, however- any
    caster of Irriseni mirror sight can peer through the face of any mirror man
    she's familiar with. The White Witches of Irrisen often assume foreigners
    don't know their secrets, but nothing save tradition prevents an outlander
    from learning the spell. A mirror man can't attempt to resist an unwanted
    connection, and its only recourse when used as an ambulatory sensor for
    someone unauthorized is to cover its face and send a warning to the witch
    who governs it.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    For centuries, the Iron Guard observed and recorded events in Whitethrone;
    its members nominally served the Jadwiga but their true allegiance was to
    Baba Yaga-a fact that did not go unnoticed by the descendants of the 14
    queens. Under Elvanna's reign, the mirror men were created to act as the
    eyes and ears, not of the Iron Guard, but of the White Witches themselves.
    For decades, the Jadwiga Elvanna maintained that the role of the mirror men
    was to provide additional oversight of the kingdom, but with the recent
    usurpation of Baba Yaga, the mirror men's role as the White Witches' secret
    police has become evident. Mirror men have broad authority to question,
    search, and arrest anyone but the Jadwiga themselves. Even with telepathy,
    mirror men avoid self-expression as much as possible whenever a gesture or
    pointed finger will suffice. In Whitethrone, it is universally understood
    when a mirror man jabs a finger at someone, followed by a tap on the open
    palm of their other hand, it means the citizen should stand still and allow
    himself to be viewed through the unsettling visage of the mirror man.
  - >-
    There is no love lost between the mirror men and any of Irrisen's monstrous
    citizens (or the Iron Guard, for that matter). The constructs' presence only
    fuels an atmosphere of paranoia and distrust as the monsters are left
    wondering who might be watching them as well as the native Ulfen slaves.
  - Construction
  - >-
    The creation of a mirror man requires a single living creature (usually
    human), which is killed during the process. Its manufacture requires costly
    alchemical reagents and a mirror faceplate crafted specifically for the
    creature. The creature's soul is bound to the mirror, which prevents it from
    continuing to the afterlife and protects it from being resurrected or raised
    from the dead. Most of the original creature's memories are expunged, but
    mirror men retain many of their originals skills; consequently, the most
    effective mirror men are former career criminals and foreign spies. The
    creation process is excruciating to the victim, and creating a mirror man
    constitutes an evil act.
