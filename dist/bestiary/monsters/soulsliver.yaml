SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Throes (Su)
    description: >-
      When a soulsliver is killed, its body explodes into jagged glass shards
      that deal 2d6 points of piercing and slashing damage to creatures within a
      20-foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 12 half). The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Mirror Travel (Su)
    description: >-
      At will as a standard action, a soulsliver can crawl into any mirror as if
      it were a door or window, instantly transporting itself to another mirror
      within 500 feet as if using dimension door (caster level 7th). It can
      remain within that mirror indefinitely, or on its next turn crawl out or
      use this ability again. Its compression ability allows it to enter or exit
      Diminutive or larger mirrors. It can only exit a mirror if it is using
      change shape to take a specific creature's form.
  - name: Perfect Copy (Su)
    description: >-
      When a soulsliver uses change shape, it can assume the appearance of a
      specific individual. However, it is always the mirror image of the person
      it copies, which might give away that something is wrong.
Description:
  - >-
    A soulsliver is an extradimensional shapechanger that lurks in the
    half-dimensions behind mirrors. It watches creatures on the Material Plane
    through ref lective surfaces, assumes their likeness, then crawls through
    the mirror to kill and feast upon its prey. Whether they are bizarre
    offshoots of the doppelganger race or originate from some aberrant magic
    used to create a demiplane, soulslivers are responsible for many unsolved
    murders, and their mirror travel makes them hard to catch. A soulsliver
    causes trouble for a short while in its assumed form, then retreats through
    the mirror to its home plane. Its native plane is an aspect of the Plane of
    Shadow, with reversed and grossly distorted creatures and scenery from the
    Material Plane.
