Description:
  - >-
    Swordtooth sharks are highly aggressive carnivores that spend most of their
    time hunting and killing. Swordtooth sharks are found in both freshwater and
    saltwater, and while most dwell in the large expanse of the world's oceans,
    some take to underground rivers and lakes where the fish are plentiful and
    other predators are rare. Swordtooth sharks, like their brethren, are pure
    killing machines, highly aggressive when hungry, and extremely territorial.
    A typical swordtooth's territory can cover several square miles.

    Swordtooths, like some other sharks, are not required to be in perpetual
    motion. They often rest on the bottom of the ocean's floors staying
    motionless for up to 24 hours. When resting, a swordtooth is highly attuned
    to its surroundings and always has its eyes open and focused on anything
    moving near it. Because of their resting habits, some swordtooths have
    developed ambush tactics, lying in wait on the ocean floor for prey to swim
    nearby before striking with blinding speed.
  - >-
    The average swordtooth shark is 10 feet long and weighs 350 pounds, but can
    grow to lengths of up to 20 feet and weigh over 500 pounds. A swordtooth
    shark has three rows of razor-sharp teeth, pointed lower teeth for gripping
    its prey and serrated upper teeth for tearing flesh and muscle. Smaller prey
    is usually swallowed whole, while large prey is torn into large chunks
    before being eaten. Occasionally a swordtooth is cut open and a small amount
    of treasure spills out; remnants of a previously digested meal. A swordtooth
    has an average lifespan of 20-30 years while those that have migrated
    underground have an average lifespan of roughly 20-25 years.
