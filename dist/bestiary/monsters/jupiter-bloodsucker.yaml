      By making a successful grapple check (with a +2 bonus for every vine-leaf
      attached to a foe at the beginning of its turn), a Jupiter bloodsucker can
      cover a grappled opponent's nose and mouth. An opponent caught in this way
      must hold its breath or begin suffocating (see suffocation in the
      Pathfinder Core Rulebook). A vineleaf attached in this way does not drain
      blood.
Description:
  - >-
    The Jupiter bloodsucker, or vampire plant, is a small, seemingly ordinary
    plant. A creature looking closely at the roots may notice that the stems are
    transparent and that blood seems to course through them (DC 15 Perception
    check from 5 ft. or less to notice). On the bottom of each leaf are many
    small, sharp thorns. These are used to attach to a victim and drain its
    blood. The Jupiter bloodsucker attacks with its leaves in combat, attempting
    to grapple and pin a foe. A grabbed opponent is drained of blood by the
    thorny leaves. At the same time, one leaf covers the victim's face,
    attempting to smother it.
