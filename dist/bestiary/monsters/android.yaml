SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Constructed (Ex)
    description: >-
      For the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as a
      ranger's favored enemy and bane weapons), androids count as both humanoids
      and constructs. Androids gain a +4 racial bonus on all saving throws
      against mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, and stun effects, are
      not subject to fatigue or exhaustion, and are immune to disease and sleep
      effects. Androids can never gain morale bonuses, and are immune to fear
      effects and all emotion-based effects.
  - name: Emotionless (Ex)
    description: >-
      Androids have problems processing emotions properly, and thus take a -4
      penalty on Sense Motive checks.
  - name: Nanite Surge (Ex)
    description: >-
      An android's body is infused with nanites. Once per day as an immediate
      action, an android can cause her nanites to surge, granting a bonus equal
      to 3 + the android's character level on any one d20 roll; this ability
      must be activated before the roll is made. When an android uses this
      power, her circuitry-tattoos glow with light equivalent to that of a torch
      in illumination for 1 round.
Description:
  - >-
    Of the numerous wonders and horrors that emerge from the technological ruins
    of Numeria, the androids who periodically crawl from the wreckage are among
    the most eerie and amazing. Though they appear to be almost human, these
    artificial wonders are of a completely foreign and utterly alien nature.
  - >-
    Androids are created, not born, and come into the world fully mature. The
    strange, alien "forges" in which new androids are created are hidden in
    strange ruins in Numeria, and most androids have little to no memories of
    these regions. Strange circuitry-like markings that look like faintly
    glowing tattoos, a faint metallic sheen to the eyes, and watery, almost
    translucent red blood are all ways to tell an android from a human-providing
    its awkward mannerisms haven't revealed the truth already.
  - A typical android is 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.
  - ANDROID CHARACTERS (16 RP)
  - >-
    Androids are defined by their class levels-they do not have racial Hit Dice.
    All androids have the following racial traits.
  - >-
    +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma: Androids have swift ref lexes
    and are very intelligent, but have difficulty relating to others.
  - >-
    Exceptional Senses: Androids have darkvision to a range of 60 feet and
    low-light vision. They also gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks.
  - 'Constructed (2 RP): See above.'
  - 'Emotionless (-1 RP): See above.'
  - 'Nanite Surge (3 RP): See above.'

    Languages: Androids begin play speaking Common. Androids with high
    Intelligence can choose any languages they want (except secret languages,
    such as Druidic).
