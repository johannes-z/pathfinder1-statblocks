Description:

    The shark is a relentless eating machine, a creature evolved over the course
    of eons to do one job perfectly-hunting. Sharks have achieved a special
    place in the lore of most seafaring races, who view them as devils,
    monsters, and the wrath of the gods. The shark presented here is a
    10-foot-long, 300-pound blue shark. Smaller sharks exist, although these are
    not dangerous. The same cannot be said of larger sharks, such as the
    following (you can create stats for these sharks by applying the indicated
    simple templates). Hammerhead Shark (CR 3): This shark has a distinctive
    hammer-shaped head. It is an advanced shark. Tiger Shark (CR 3): Larger than
    the average shark, the ravenous tiger shark is a giant shark. Great White
    Shark (CR 4): One of the most notorious maneaters of the sea, the truly
    immense great white shark is an advanced giant shark.
