SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Deafening Roar (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a slag worm moves at least half of its speed in a single round it
      creates a grinding roar of metal on metal from its body. Creatures within
      50 feet that hear this grinding roar must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude
      save or be deafened for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Intense Heat (Ex)
    description: >-
      A slag worm's body generates intense heat. Anything within 10 feet of its
      body takes 4d6 points of fire damage each round. A DC 30 Fortitude save
      reduces the damage by half. Any weapon that strikes a slag worm must
      succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or melt into slag. (Magic weapons gain
      their enhancement bonus to their save.) A creature striking a slag worm
      with a natural attack or unarmed takes the same 4d6 points of damage each
      time an attack hits. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Fire Absorption (Ex)
    description: >-
      Fire deals no damage to a slag worm. Instead, the slag worm absorbs the
      effect and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points the effect would
      otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the slag worm to
      exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit
      points.
  - name: Susceptible to Rust (Ex)
    description: >-
      Attacks that cause rusting (such as a rusting grasp spell or the touch of
      a rust monster) deal 2d6 points of damage to a slag worm.
Description:
  - >-
    Slag worms burrow endlessly through the elemental Plane of Earth, Elemental
    Plane of Fire, and Plane of Molten Skies, occasionally forcing through weak
    points into the material planes where they burrow deep beneath the earth,
    devouring raw iron deposits to keep their internal furnaces burning. Because
    of this they have been known to devour entire companies of heavily armored
    dwarves and orcs, mistaking their gear for a new vein of naturally occurring
    iron salts.
  - >-
    Slag worms average about 40 feet long and weigh about 60,000 pounds, though
    specimens as large as 100 feet or more have been rumored to exist. Its
    massive form radiates abysmal heat and when the worm opens its maw, fires
    can be seen burning and raging in its interior. They are intelligent
    creatures (more so than their appearance of a big dumb worm would lead one
    to believe) and can speak though they rarely choose to converse with other
    races.
  - >-
    A slag worm erupts from the ground seeking to eat anything wearing iron,
    steel, or other metal armor or equipment. It attacks such creatures with a
    great ferocity, generally disregarding other enemies until the worm is
    heavily injured or forced away by magic.
