Description:
  - >-
    The grave mount is the insult to all that is good and holy when a paladin's
    steed is returned from the dead to wreak havoc upon the world. These undead
    creatures are rare and usually created when a death knight rises from the
    grave to ride the steed he owned in his former life, though a few
    necromancers are also able to raise a grave mount given time and study.
  - >-
    Grave mounts stand 5 to 6 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh between 800
    and 1,000 pounds.
  - >-
    A grave mount begins melee with its breath weapon. Once engaged, it uses its
    hooves and bite attack to battle its opponents.
