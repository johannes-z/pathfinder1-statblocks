SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Assimilation (Su)
    description: >-
      When an elemental earth dragon slays an opponent, it dehydrates the flesh
      with its breath weapon and pulverizes the bones. The residue is then
      absorbed into the dragon's body. An assimilated creature can only be
      restored to life using wish, miracle, or true resurrection, but even then,
      there is a 50% chance that such powerful magic fails.
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      An elemental earth dragon's breath weapon is a 50 ft. cone of scorching
      sand and gravel.
  - name: Earth Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      An elemental earth dragon gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if
      both it and its foes are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne
      or waterborne, the elemental earth dragon takes a -4 penalty on attack and
      damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the stat block.)
  - name: Freeze (Ex)
    description: >-
      An elemental earth dragon can hold itself so still it appears to be a
      statue. An observer must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to notice
      that the elemental earth dragon is really alive.
  - name: Meld into Stone (Ex)
    description: >-
      An elemental earth dragon can meld its body with any stone surface large
      enough to accommodate its entire body. This is a standard action and has
      an unlimited duration (the dragon can stay melded as long as it desires).
      It otherwise resembles the meld into stone spell (caster level 20th).
Description:
  - >-
    Elemental earth dragons are the strongest of the elemental dragons. Using
    their great stone tail or earthen claws, they can destroy almost anything in
    short order. The majority of their time is spent burrowing through the Plane
    of Earth devouring gems, minerals, and silicate life forms. On occasion,
    they are summoned to the Material Plane by evil (and foolish) spellcasters
    who usually live just long enough to regret their mistake. Elemental earth
    dragons are evil (perhaps the most evil of the elemental dragons in addition
    to being the strongest) and despise most other forms of life. They rarely
    associate with other creatures, though a few have been known to have
    dealings with the occasional earth elemental. Elemental earth dragons cannot
    enter water; they must burrow under it or walk around it. The average
    elemental earth dragon is 30 feet long. Its roar can be heard up to 5 miles
    away. Elemental earth dragons prefer to attack from ambush and secret rather
    than using a direct frontal assault. An elemental earth dragon lies in wait
    using its freeze ability or meld into stone ability and springs to attack
    when its prey comes into range. They are also fond of burrowing into the
    ground and surfacing under their prey, thereby gaining total surprise. Slain
    opponents are processed and absorbed into the body of the elemental earth
    dragon. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
