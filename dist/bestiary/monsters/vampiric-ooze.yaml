  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoid slain by a vampiric ooze becomes a zombie in 1d4 rounds.
      Spawn are under the command of the vampiric ooze that created them and
      remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities
      they had in life.
  - name: Sunlight Vulnerability (Ex)
    description: >-
      Exposing a vampiric ooze to direct sunlight staggers it on the first
      round, and it is destroyed utterly in the next round if it cannot escape.
Description:
  - >-
    The vampiric ooze is thought to have been created by a great undead
    spellcaster using ancient and forbidden magic. Some believe the vampiric
    ooze was formed when an ochre jelly slew a vampire and absorbed it. It can
    alter its shape so as to appear up to 12 feet long and 6 inches thick; it
    can also compress its body to slip through cracks as small as 1 inch wide.
  - >-
    It spends its time slithering along floors, walls, and ceilings, or if above
    ground, hunting its prey at night.
  - >-
    A vampiric ooze attempts to envelop and constrict its prey, dealing negative
    levels with its slam attack.
