Description:
  - >-
    A gharros looks like a cross between a large human and an even larger
    scorpion. They serve as guards, soldiers, shock troops (and even assassins
    sometimes) to some of the minor nobles and lesser demon lords of the Abyss.
    They hate all goodness and seek to destroy it at any opportunity through
    whatever means available.
  - >-
    A gharros is about 8 feet tall and 10 feet long and weighs around 1,500
    pounds.
  - >-
    Gharros are very aggressive in battle and seek to kill the strongest
    opponent first. They wield their battleaxes in combat and sting with their
    deadly tails, all the while sprinkling the fight with their spell-like
    abilities.
  - >-
    Unless ordered to do so, gharros never take prisoners in battle. They fight
    to the death (either their death or their opponent's).
