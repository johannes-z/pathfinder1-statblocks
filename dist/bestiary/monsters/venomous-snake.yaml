Description:
  - >-
    Countless species of poisonous snakes dwell in the wild, their bites capable
    of bringing down creatures much larger than themselves. Snakes of the size
    presented here are thankfully rarer than their smaller kin, but many species
    of rattlesnake, cobra, and similar reptiles can grow to this size. Venomous
    snakes are generally far more aggressive than constrictor snakes, and even
    larger variants do exist: you can create stats for a king cobra, for
    example, by applying the advanced and giant simple templates to the stats
    given above.
