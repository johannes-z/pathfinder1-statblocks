  - name: Unluck (Su)
    description: >-
      When a golden cat selects an "owner" it grants that creature good fortune.
      Three times per day, so long as the golden cat is within 40 feet, the
      owner can reroll one die roll and take the most favorable result. Only one
      die can be rerolled each round. This ability is a power of the cat, not
      the owner, though the owner can simply telepathically communicate its
      desire to the cat. A golden cat cannot be forced to activate this ability
      if it does not wish to do so (unless magically compelled). Each time the
      golden cat activates this ability and the owner rerolls a die, all other
      creatures (including the owner's allies) within 40 feet of the golden cat
      must reroll one die roll and take the least favorable result each time.
Description:
  - >-
    These fickle creatures are highly sought after due to their magical ability
    to grant luck to one fortunate enough to be selected as an owner.
  - >-
    Such owners are known to spend extravagant amounts of wealth keeping the
    golden cat lavishly protected and comforted. Despite this, golden cats have
    been known to grow bored with an owner and strike out on their own in search
    of a new owner to bestow its good luck upon.
  - >-
    While prized by their owners for the luck they bestow, golden cats are
    equally despised by the owner's allies for the bad luck they bring.
  - >-
    Golden cats tend to lair in forested areas or hilly terrain, usually near
    civilized lands where the population is the greatest (it makes finding an
    owner easier). They favor humans and elves as owners above all other races,
    disdaining the less civilized races such as orcs, half-orcs, goblinoids, and
    so on. A golden cat never takes one of the aforementioned races as an owner.
  - >-
    A golden cat appears as a normal cat with rich golden fur and green eyes.
    Like all cats, a golden cat enjoys catching mice, rabbits and small birds.
    They tend to avoid attacking things larger than themselves unless cornered
    and defending themselves. Even then, they seek escape as soon as possible.
