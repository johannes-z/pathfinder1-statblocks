SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ink Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      A tojanida can emit a 30-foot-radius sphere of ink once per minute as a
      free action. The ink provides total concealment in water, and persists for
      1 minute. If used out of the water, the jet of ink is a line 30 feet long,
      and creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or be
      blinded for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Tojanidas are bizarre natives from the Plane of Water that resemble mixes
    between monstrous crabs and enormous snapping turtles. Originally elemental
    beings of water, tojanidas were bound into their strange forms long ago for
    unclear reasons, and no longer know how they might eventually return to
    their pure and formless state. Determined to preserve their pride, the
    grotesque tojanidas ply the waters of the planes seeking hedonistic
    pleasures- especially culinary ones-and the adoration of other races.
    Loquacious when addressed with the proper respect, they make excellent
    heralds and emissaries for more powerful beings, and often enjoy posing as
    such even when operating on their own. When riled, however, tojanidas make
    fearsome opponents, violent and eager juggernauts with snapping jaws and
    clacking pincers.
  - >-
    Adult tojanidas are roughly 6 feet long and weigh several hundred pounds.
    When threatened, a tojanida can retract its limbs most of the way into its
    shell, which is an irremovable part of its body. The ring of eyes completely
    encircling the tojanida's shell along its rim makes the creature extremely
    difficult to catch by surprise. While tojanidas adore eating, as they find
    flavor and texture to be two of the most fascinating senses, they don't
    actually need to consume food, instead drawing sustenance directly from the
    currents of arcane energy all around them via the magic of their shells.
  - >-
    Blessed (some might say cursed) with extremely long racial memories,
    tojanidas wander the oceans and lakes of innumerable worlds, attempting to
    find unusual physical pleasures or conversation capable of distracting them
    from the insufferable ennui and apathy born of remembering their ancestors'
    experiences. Though the tojanidas themselves may not appreciate the burden
    of memory, adventurers and scholars often seek the use of a tojanida's
    recalled lore.
