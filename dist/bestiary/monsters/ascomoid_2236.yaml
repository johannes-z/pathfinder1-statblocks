SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Spores (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per round, an ascomoid can fire deadly spores in a 30-foot line. Upon
      impacting a solid surface, the spores billow into a cloud that fills a
      20-foot radius. The cloud lasts 1 round before dispersing. Creatures
      caught within the cloud must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d6
      points of Constitution damage and become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. A
      successful save negates the Constitution damage but not the nauseated
      condition. Once a creature saves against this ability it is immune to the
      same ascomoid's spores for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Ascomoids are subterranean fungus monsters that exist on a diet of living
    creatures. Ascomoids feed by sitting atop a slain creature and absorbing its
    body fluids into its own form. Creatures slain in this manner appear as
    rotting husks. They generally avoid light and the surface world, though they
    have no adverse reaction to sunlight or bright light.
  - >-
    The typical ascomoid lair is a large, damp, dark, natural cavern with a
    single entrance and exit. Bones of its victims are strewn about the lair.
  - >-
    The monster itself does not collect treasure, so any such valuables found in
    its lair are the only remaining possessions of those its has killed.
  - The average ascomoid is 10 feet wide and weighs 300 pounds.
  - >-
    An ascomoid attacks by rolling over its opponents or slamming into them.
    Though mindless, the ascomoid reacts to those that attack it by firing
    spores at those opponents.
