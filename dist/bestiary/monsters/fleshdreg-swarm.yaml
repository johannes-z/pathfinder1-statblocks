Description:
  - >-
    Fleshdreg swarms form from scraps and leftovers of malformed fleshdregs and
    incomplete sinspawn. These foul, misshapen creatures pour out of runewells
    by the hundreds, seeking sinful flesh to destroy. Little more than pests,
    these swarms attack indiscriminately. Some malfunctioning runewells and
    other fleshvats produce nothing more these days than swarm upon swarm of
    these pests.
