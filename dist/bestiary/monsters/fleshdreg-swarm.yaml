    description: >-
      A fleshdreg swarm's swarm damage is considered magical for the purposes of
      overcoming damage reduction. Sin-Scent (Su) Fleshdreg swarms have scent
      against creatures whose nature reflects the fleshdreg swarm's related sin.
      For example, a wrathful fleshdreg swarm can scent creatures using rage
      effects. The GM should adjudicate what creatures a particular fleshdreg
      swarm can scent.
Description:
  - >-
    Fleshdreg swarms form from scraps and leftovers of malformed fleshdregs and
    incomplete sinspawn. These foul, misshapen creatures pour out of runewells
    by the hundreds, seeking sinful flesh to destroy. Little more than pests,
    these swarms attack indiscriminately. Some malfunctioning runewells and
    other fleshvats produce nothing more these days than swarm upon swarm of
    these pests.
