Description:
  - >-
    An amoeba swarm is a mobile group of amoebas, each about the size of a coin.
    Giant amoebas may cleave off tiny portions of their substance, which can
    then become amoeba swarms. At other times, a giant amoeba can spontaneously
    transform into a swarm, usually if the giant amoeba is starving or in an
    area with a high concentration of magic. Likewise, a well-fed amoeba swarm
    may fuse into a single giant amoeba.
  - >-
    When an amoeba swarm is found in the vicinity of a giant amoeba, the two
    oozes ignore each other. A giant amoeba in the space of an amoeba swarm
    takes no damage from the swarm's attacks and does not run the risk of
    becoming distracted as a result of being in the swarm.
