Description_Visual: >-
  Devoid of a head, or any features at all save for four short, clawed legs,
  this creature's body looks like a large, glistening brain.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Body Thief (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, an
      intellect devourer can reduce its size, crawl into the mouth of a helpless
      or dead creature, and burrow into the victim's skull to devour its brain.
      This is a coup de grace attempt that inflicts 8d4+3d6+8 points of damage.
      If the victim is slain (or already dead), the intellect devourer usurps
      control of the body and may use it as its own, as if it controlled the
      target via a dominate monster spell. The intellect devourer has full
      access to all of the host's defensive and offensive abilities save for
      spellcasting and spell-like abilities (although the intellect devourer can
      still use its own spell-like abilities). A host body may not have been
      dead for longer than 1 day for this ability to function, and even
      successfully inhabited bodies decay to uselessness in 7 days (unless this
      time is extended via gentle repose). As long as the intellect devourer
      occupies the body, it knows (and can speak) the languages known by the
      victim and basic information about the victim's identity and personality,
      yet has none of the victim's specific memories or knowledge. Damage done
      to a host body does not harm the intellect devourer, and if the host body
      is slain, the intellect devourer emerges and is dazed for 1 round. Raise
      dead cannot restore a victim of body theft, but resurrection or more
      powerful magic can.
  - name: Vulnerable to Protection from Evil (Ex)
    description: >-
      An intellect devourer is treated as a summoned creature for the purpose of
      determining how it is affected by a protection from evil spell.
Description:
  - >-
    Thought by some to be invaders from another dimension or planet, the
    sinister intellect devourers are certainly one of the world's cruelest
    races. Incapable of experiencing emotions or wallowing in the sins of
    physical pleasure on their own, intellect devourers are forced to steal
    bodies in order to indulge their gluttony, lust, and cruelty. Stories tell
    of entire cities of these creatures deep underground, where host bodies are
    worn like clothes to hideous orgies and vile feasts. Lone intellect
    devourers often dwell in ruins or caves on the edge of a civilized region so
    they can make periodic forays into town to "shop" for an attractive new
    body.
  - An intellect devourer is 3 feet long and weighs about 60 pounds.
