SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Absorb Body (Su)
    description: >-
      A corpse orgy can absorb the physical body of any creature it has reduced
      to 0 or less hit points by moving over it and remaining in contact with it
      for at least one full round. An unconscious or dying opponent can make a
      DC 25 Fortitude save to prevent the absorption. A dead opponent gets no
      saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based. When it absorbs a body,
      the corpse orgy gains 12 temporary hit points. A creature whose body is
      absorbed can only be raised or resurrected if the corpse orgy that
      absorbed its body is slain and the corpse in question is recovered.
      All-Around
  - name: Vision (Ex)
    description: The corpse orgy sees in all directions at once. It can not be flanked.
  - name: Pain Shriek (Su)
    description: >-
      Twice per day, as a standard action, a corpse orgy can unleash a piercing
      shriek from the various heads captured in its form. This shriek deals 10d6
      points of sonic damage to all creatures within a 40-foot radius around the
      corpse orgy. Affected creatures can make a DC 22 Fortitude save for half
      damage. Creatures that cannot hear do not take this damage. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A corpse orgy is truly a disgusting creature easily mistaken for a pile of
    rotten corpses. In truth, the creature is a conglomeration of creatures it
    has killed and absorbed into its body. As parts of the corpse orgy rot away,
    it replaces them with freshly slain prey.
  - >-
    A corpse orgy makes its home in deep subterranean caverns and dungeons. Here
    it can usually find sanctuary amongst the bone pits and corpse piles of
    other underground denizens where it bides its time, casually adding fresh
    "meat" to its obscene framework. In times when food is scarce (which is
    almost never as there is always a fresh supply of Underdark dwellers or
    adventurous surface dwellers to whet its appetite), the creature may journey
    to the surface world to hunt for food. A corpse orgy is not picky when it
    comes to its diet. If something is living and breathing, it's a perfect
    target for the corpse orgy.
  - >-
    A corpse orgy is a large, undulating mass of rotting corpses, sinew, bones,
    blood, muscle, mucus, and organs. It resembles an ooze in nature and has no
    discernible features (other than the corpse parts that make up its form). No
    one has ever successfully communicated with a corpse orgy.
  - A corpse orgy lies in wait for solitary beings to tread too closely.
  - >-
    At the last moment it lashes out murderously with kicking legs, hammering
    fists and butting heads in an attempt to quickly slay its prey and add its
    body to its own mass. It often uses its various arms to grapple an opponent,
    holding it tightly while hammering it with its fists.
