SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      An aswang can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the aswang
      establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of
      Constitution damage. The aswang heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary
      hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points
      equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood.
  - name: Corpse Scent (Ex)
    description: >-
      An aswang can detect corporeal undead within 100 feet. It can detect fresh
      corpses (creatures killed within the last two hours) to a range of one
      mile.
  - name: Deceiving Sound (Su)
    description: >-
      An aswang can produce a â€˜tik-tik' sound from its throat that seemingly
      originates from up to 100 feet away from the aswang's actual location.
      Creatures hearing this sound can attempt a DC 16 Perception check to
      pinpoint the aswang's true location.
  - name: Devour Heart (Ex)
    description: >-
      An aswang's bite attack threatens a critical hit on an 18-20. If an aswang
      kills a foe with a critical hit, it can tear out the victim's heart as a
      free action. An aswang that devours a victim's heart gains a +4 bonus to
      Strength for 1 hour. Devouring multiple hearts does not increase this
      bonus. Such a victim cannot be restored to life by a raise dead spell
      (though resurrection and true resurrection can still revive the victim).
      Any creature that witnesses this event must succeed on a DC 16 Will save
      or be shaken 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Vulnerability to Garlic (Ex)
    description: >-
      Aswangs cannot tolerate the odor of garlic, and will not enter an area
      laced with it. It doesn't harm an aswang-it merely keeps it at bay.
Description:
  - >-
    Aswangs are extremely malevolent undead with a taste for blood. These
    creatures drink the blood of both the living and the recently dead;
    including devouring the victim's heart should it still be intact. Aswangs
    generally haunt graveyards and ruins, but can be found just about anywhere.
  - >-
    Aswangs sleep during the day and venture out at night. Sunlight doesn't harm
    aswangs; they just prefer to hunt at night. Many aswangs prefer to dwell in
    cities where they have their pick of victims. These aswangs make use of
    their shapechanging ability to appear human and blend in with the
    population. Aswangs sleep on grave dirt or in coffins filled with grave
    dirt. Sages debate whether this is by necessity or simply a ritual performed
    by aswangs.
  - >-
    Aswangs disorient potential victims by using their deceiving sound ability
    hoping to catch them unaware. In combat, aswangs attack with their claws and
    nasty bite. Aswangs that kill their foes devour the heart, though not during
    combat. They are smart enough to wait until all opponents are dead or
    fleeing.
