Description:
  - >-
    in desolate swamps, bogs, and marshlands. Their diet consists mainly of
    large insects, vermin, plants, berries, and aquatic varieties of the
    aforementioned things. Some, prefer a diet of meat to plants, and feed
    mainly on marsh animals such as alligators, crocodiles, and the occasional
    adventurer. Bog turtles are diurnal creatures and spend the nighttime hours
    sleeping in their lairs.
  - >-
    Giant bog turtles are solitary creatures; rarely is more than one ever
    encountered. Mating season is the only time more than one is encountered and
    it is short, one month during the spring. The female lays a clutch
    consisting of 1d3+3 eggs. The eggs are buried in swamp mud and hidden from
    predators and those that would steal them. The female stays near the eggs at
    all times except when eating or hunting. Gestation lasts about 3 months
    before the eggs hatch. Newborn bog turtles grow rapidly and are
    self-sufficient within one year. Young reach maturity around four years of
    age.

    A giant bog turtle is about 20 feet long. Younger bog turtles have light
    stripes ringing their shell. As they age, the stripes slowly fade.
  - >-
    A giant bog turtle lies silently, drawn into its shell waiting for prey to
    pass near. At a distance greater than 30 feet, its shell resembles a large
    mound of earth or foliage and is often mistaken for such. Once prey moves
    within range, the giant bog turtle snaps its head out and attempts to
    swallow a foe. In deeper water, it opens its mouth and draws in water,
    plants, rocks, and pulls swimmers close enough so it can use its bite and
    attempt to swallow the creature.
