Group: Turtle

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Capsize (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant bog turtle can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as
      a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the
      result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher.
      For each size category the ship is larger than the bog turtle's size, the
      giant bog turtle takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.
  - name: Current (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a full round action, a giant bog turtle can induce a strong current by
      opening its mouth and inhaling large quantities of water. This strong rush
      of water lasts for 5 rounds and affects all in a cone-shaped area to a
      range of 100 feet. Creatures and objects of up to Large size are pulled
      toward the bog turtle at the rate of 20 feet per round. Affected creatures
      can make a Swim check (DC 30) to resist the current. A swimming creature
      cannot take 10 on its Swim check. The check DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Shell (Ex)
    description: >-
      If it is severely threatened a giant bog turtle can completely withdraw
      into its shell, leaving it almost completely impervious to attack. When
      withdrawn, a giant bog turtle gains the benefit of cover (+4 AC against
      melee and ranged attacks). Since it cannot move when withdrawn into its
      shell, a bog turtle does not gain the +2 bonus to Reflex saves normally
      granted by cover.
Description:
  - >-
    in desolate swamps, bogs, and marshlands. Their diet consists mainly of
    large insects, vermin, plants, berries, and aquatic varieties of the
    aforementioned things. Some, prefer a diet of meat to plants, and feed
    mainly on marsh animals such as alligators, crocodiles, and the occasional
    adventurer. Bog turtles are diurnal creatures and spend the nighttime hours
    sleeping in their lairs.
  - >-
    Giant bog turtles are solitary creatures; rarely is more than one ever
    encountered. Mating season is the only time more than one is encountered and
    it is short, one month during the spring. The female lays a clutch
    consisting of 1d3+3 eggs. The eggs are buried in swamp mud and hidden from
    predators and those that would steal them. The female stays near the eggs at
    all times except when eating or hunting. Gestation lasts about 3 months
    before the eggs hatch. Newborn bog turtles grow rapidly and are
    self-sufficient within one year. Young reach maturity around four years of
    age.
  - >-
    A giant bog turtle is about 20 feet long. Younger bog turtles have light
    stripes ringing their shell. As they age, the stripes slowly fade.
  - >-
    A giant bog turtle lies silently, drawn into its shell waiting for prey to
    pass near. At a distance greater than 30 feet, its shell resembles a large
    mound of earth or foliage and is often mistaken for such. Once prey moves
    within range, the giant bog turtle snaps its head out and attempts to
    swallow a foe. In deeper water, it opens its mouth and draws in water,
    plants, rocks, and pulls swimmers close enough so it can use its bite and
    attempt to swallow the creature.
