Description_Visual: >-
  A gaunt, gargoyle-like figure passes silently overhead. It has bat-like wings,
  long, cruel talons, and its eyes seem to burn with a cold white fire. Two
  serpentine tails, ten feet long, trail behind the creature as it wheels around
  and dives to attack.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Negative Energy Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round and no more than 6 times per day, as a standard action, a
      grimshrike can exhale a 30-foot cone of negative energy that functions as
      the channel negative energy ability of an evil cleric whose level equals
      the grimshrike's Hit Dice. This cone deals 3d6 points of damage to living
      creatures (DC 15 Will save for half) or heals 3d6 points of damage on
      undead creatures in the area (no save). If a grimshrike takes levels in a
      class that provides the channel energy ability, its racial Hit Dice stack
      with the levels of that class for the purposes of determining the damage
      dealt or healed and the save DC. This ability counts as the channel energy
      class ability for any feat that requires it. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Gaze of Lost Souls (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures meeting a grimshrike's gaze must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or
      take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage and be paralyzed 1d4 rounds. The save DC
      is Charisma-based. This is a gaze effect.
Description:
  - >-
    Grimshrikes are native to a dark demiplane about which little is known other
    than its terrible history. The place was once vibrant and full of life every
    bit as diverse and beautiful as the Material Plane. Centuries ago, however,
    all that changed. Something rent the boundaries between that placid
    demiplane and the Negative Energy Plane. Dark energies spilled forth
    unchecked, fouling the very essence of which the demiplane was created. In a
    matter of hours, all life in that plane ceased to exist. The primary
    inhabitants of the demiplane, a race of twin-tailed gargoyles, were
    reanimated as the tortured servants of the nightshades. Grimshrikes are
    often given as rewards to powerful necromancers who have performed some
    service of the nightshades. An army of zombies or skeletons is made all the
    more frightening by presence of grimshrikes urging them on and bolstering
    their strength.
  - A grimshrike is about 7 feet tall and weighs 350 pounds.

    To look into the eyes of a grimshrike is to invite madness. A grimshrike is
    forever tortured by the horrible vision of death and agony that befell its
    home plane. It can temporarily relieve itself of the vision by mentally
    transferring the vision into the mind of a living victim with but a gaze. A
    grimshrike attacks first with its gaze, attempting to bring down the most
    powerful opponents as quickly as possible. In combat, it concentrates its
    attacks on clerics and paladins first, before moving to fighters and arcane
    spellcasters. In melee, a grimshrike tries to remain out of reach of its
    opponent, lashing with its tails or further weakening its opponent with its
    foul breath weapon.
