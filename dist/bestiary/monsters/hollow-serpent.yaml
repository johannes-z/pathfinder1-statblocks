SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Channel Negative Energy (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a hollow serpent can channel negative energy in a
      30-foot burst as a 16th-level evil cleric. This ability requires no divine
      focus. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Desiccation Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A cloud of moisture-draining dust fills the air in a 30-foot radius around
      a hollow serpent. Living creatures within this area must make a DC 26
      Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength damage as water is leached
      from their flesh. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot
      be affected again by the same hollow serpent's desiccation aura for 24
      hours. Creatures without fleshy bodies are immune to this aura, while
      creatures with the aquatic or water subtypes take a -4 penalty on the
      saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based. Life-Draining
  - name: Coils (Su)
    description: >-
      A hollow serpent seethes with negative energy capable of sapping the life
      force of creatures trapped within its coils. Every time a creature takes
      constriction damage from a hollow serpent, it gains one negative level.
      The hollow serpent also gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative
      level it bestows.
  - name: Lifesense (Su)
    description: >-
      A hollow serpent notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just
      as if it possessed the blindsight ability.
  - name: Swift Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a hollow serpent takes a full-attack action, it can make two bite
      attacks instead of just one.
Description:
  - >-
    Crafted from the shed skins of great snakes by serpentfolk necromancers and
    other foul spellcasters, hollow serpents are plagued by an eternal hunger
    they can never sate. The act of draining energy from living creatures blunts
    these supernatural pangs, driving the hollow serpent to constantly seek new
    prey.
  - >-
    A hollow serpent is a difficult undead to create-most of them were crafted
    by a long-forgotten god of the serpentfolk and not by mortal spellcasters at
    all. The exact methods by which a mortal might create a hollow serpent are
    obscure, but most scholars have come to the conclusion that the use of
    powerful artifacts or the aid of a demigod may be required for such a feat.
  - A hollow serpent is 15 feet long and weighs 500 pounds.
