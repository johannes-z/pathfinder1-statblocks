  - name: Extending Jaw (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant dragonfly nymph can extend its jaws with surprising speed. Not
      only does this extend the nymph's reach with its bite attack, but during
      the surprise round, a nymph gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls with its
      bite.
Description:
  - >-
    Giant dragonf lies lay clutches of eggs in swampy terrain or areas of
    standing water. Their young, called nymphs, voraciously eat carrion and
    small prey, growing and maturing rapidly until they sprout fully functional
    wings and become adult dragonf lies.
