Description:
  - >-
    Despite their monstrous appearances, mongrelmen are generally hardworking
    and peaceful creatures. A mongrelman can produce offspring with any
    humanoid, mixing bloodlines in strange ways to create hardier crossbreeds.
    No two mongrelmen look the same. One may have a face that is half hobgoblin,
    half lizardfolk, with one human-like foot and one cloven hoof, while his
    sister may have elven ears, a dwarven beard, orc tusks, and clawed hands.
    Each mongrelman usually has characteristics from at least a half-dozen
    different races.
  - >-
    This strange mixture enforces mongrelmen's place in the edges of the world,
    for they are shunned by all who fear their twisted appearance. Mistaken as
    enemies by all, mongrelmen prefer to be left alone.
  - >-
    Most mongrelmen live below the surface of the world in hidden caves far from
    civilization. These creatures pride themselves on their survival skills, for
    the bowels of the earth are no place for weaklings.
  - >-
    Other foul and intelligent races who claim dominion in the underworld take
    mongrelmen as slaves (particularly morlocks), finding this deformed race's
    docile nature and hardworking attitude makes them extremely useful as tools
    of labor. In this role, mongrelmen still fall back on their pride of
    survival, slow to rebel and patiently waiting for the overthrow of their
    masters.
  - >-
    Mongrelmen dwelling on the surface sometimes live amid the hustle and bustle
    of cities, sequestering themselves in ghettos and sewers to avoid notice.
    Urban mongrelmen may rely on begging and pickpocketing to get by, but most
    form rural communities near trading routes.
  - >-
    Despite their varied physical forms, most mongrelmen average 5-6 feet tall
    and weigh between 150 and 250 pounds on average. A tragically short lifespan
    limits the creatures' population growth-mongrelmen rarely live past 35
    years.
