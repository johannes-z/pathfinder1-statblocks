  - >-
    Raccoons are small nocturnal omnivores that live in all but the warmest and
    coldest forests. They prefer to dwell near lakes and rivers, where their
    primary nourishment consists of fresh-water shellfish, frogs, lizards, and
    berries. Males often travel up to four or five miles from the lair in search
    of food while females tend to stay closer, especially if there are young
    raccoons in the den. They make their dens in trees or caves, mines, burrows,
    buildings, or sewers. Those found in populated areas feed on leftover or
    discarded food and trash. When food is scarce, raccoons in any environment
    often resort to eating the remains of dead animals. Raccoons mate in the
    spring, gestation usually lasts about 60 days, and bear 1d8 live young (only
    about half of which survive to adulthood) which stay with their mother for
    about a year. The kits are capable of hunting on their own after only 3
    months, however. Females reach maturity after about 1 year; males after
    about 2 years. Raccoons are smart, curious animals that have a reputation
    for mischief. It is not irony that gave the raccoon a bandit-like mask. In
    combat a raccoon engages in an intimidating display of shrill growls,
    stamping feet, and puffed up fur. Raccoons have sharp, strong teeth and use
    them well if cornered. Like all small mammals, however, raccoons prefer to
    avoid actual combat if at all possible. Familiar As a familiar, a raccoon
    provides its master with a +3 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks. Copyright
