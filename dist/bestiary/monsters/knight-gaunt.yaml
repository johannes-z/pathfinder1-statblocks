  This desiccated creature resembles a once proud knight fallen from grace. Its
  armor reveals its former station. The creature's eyes burn red and its hands
  end in wicked claws.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Smite Good (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a knight gaunt can smite good. As a swift action, the knight
      gaunt chooses one target within sight. If this target is good, the knight
      gaunt adds its Charisma bonus on its attack rolls and adds its Hit Dice on
      all damage rolls made against that target. If the target is an outsider
      with the good subtype or a good-aligned creature with levels of cleric of
      paladin, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack is doubled.
      Regardless of the target, smite good attacks automatically bypass any DR
      the creature might possess. Additionally, the knight gaunt gains a
      deflection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus to AC against attacks made by
      the target of the smite. The smite good remains in effect until the target
      of the smite is dead or until 24 hours have passed.
  - name: Weapon Attunement (Su)
    description: >-
      A knight gaunt gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with any
      melee weapon it wields. Additionally, it gains the bleed special attack
      with any melee weapon it wields.
Description:
  - >-
    A knight gaunt is an undead creature created when a paladin falls in battle.
    Other than a few fleeting thoughts perhaps of the martial training they
    received in life, these creatures have no memories of their former lives. A
    knight gaunt often wears the armor it wore in life and wields the weapons it
    carried into its last battle before rising as undead.
  - >-
    Knight gaunts are most often found in the employ of death knights serving as
    companions or knights-in-training. Others wander the world seeking out
    goodness wherever they find it, squashing it beneath their steel-booted heel
    and putting the righteous to their blades. Paladins and clerics of good
    alignment are hated by many knight gaunts for they represent everything the
    knight gaunt isn't, and perhaps once was or once strived to be.
  - >-
    A typical knight gaunt stands 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds. It wears
    the armor it wore when alive and still carries the weapons it wielded in
    life. Its skin is ash gray in color and its eyes are milky white with fiery
    red pupils.
  - >-
    A knight gaunt fights with bladed weapons in battle, preferring longswords,
    greatswords, and axes to all others. Only when disarmed does it resort to
    using its claws. A knight gaunt that retains its mount (that is undead now
    as well) or procures some undead steed to carry it into battle wields a
    lance in addition to its other weapons. In battle, a knight gaunt is
    relentless, attacking with its blades until all of its foes are vanquished.
