    description: >-
      When a lava lurker is slain, its body implodes, creating an extinguishing
      vacuum. All creatures within a 5-foot-radius burst take 8d6 points of cold
      damage (Reflex DC 20 half). In addition to the damage, every affected
      square is targeted by quench (CL 10th). This also targets all fire effects
      and magic items that create and control flame. If the lava lurker is
      killed in a pool of magma, it solidifies the rock within the area of
      effect,

      Vulnerable to Water (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a significant amount of water- such as the contents of a large bucket,
      the liquid created by a create water spell, or a blow from a water
      elemental- strikes a lava lurker, the lava lurker must succeed at a DC 20
      Fortitude save or be staggered for 2d4 rounds. A lava lurker that is
      immersed in water is automatically staggered and must succeed at a DC 20
      Fortitude save each round or be petrified (this DC increases by 1 on each
      subsequent round), reverting to its molten stone form once the water is
      gone.
Description:
  - >-
    Territorial swimmers through the molten veins that crisscross the hottest
    depths of mortal worlds and the Elemental Plane of Earth, lava lurkers claim
    active magma flows and the fiery lakes within smoldering volcanoes as their
    homes. Most are content to stay within such burning depths, threatening only
    those foolish enough to wander close to such obviously deadly natural
    hazards. But occasionally, during volcanic eruptions or other explosive
    geological events, lava lurkers are forced from their comfortable homes,
    becoming unwilling riders on blazing rapids. While these disasters rarely
    threaten lava lurkers' elemental forms, they do often force the creatures
    into-or worse, strand them in-areas they find uncomfortably cool.
  - >-
    Dull-witted lava lurkers eagerly sow fires and throw magma as they wander
    semi-aimlessly, doing what they can to create more comfortable surroundings
    or seeking other nearby warm places-like furnaces or bonfires-as they try to
    find their way back to active volcanic flows. They care little for
    non-elemental creatures, being baffled and annoyed by the shrill noises such
    creatures make when they're exposed to even the slightest fleck of molten
    rock.
  - >-
    Though lava lurkers live in earth and flame, they die with a chilling inward
    gasp. If slain, the final surge of a lava lurker's animating fires consumes
    the nearby air, creating a momentary vacuum that extinguishes surrounding
    flames. This instantly transforms a lava lurker's body into a perfectly cool
    hunk of rock and often quells lesser flames nearby, if only temporarily.
