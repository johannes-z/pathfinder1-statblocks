  This translucent, shaggy, horned monster shines with an eerie blue light, and

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Touch of Madness (Su)
    description: >-
      The touch of an aoandon causes maddening fear. As a standard action it can
      make an incorporeal touch attack that deals 10d6 damage. Any living
      creature damaged by an aoandon's touch attack must succeed at a DC 24 Will
      save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at this
      saving throw can't be confused again by this aoandon's touch of madness
      for 10 minutes. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    An aoandon is an incorporeal outsider formed from the spirit of a woman who
    died pursuing some ill-fated relationship. An aoandon waits for her chance
    to seek revenge on those who wronged her in her mortal life. If that person
    is dead, she finds a surrogate-someone who reminds her of the wrongdoer-and
    acts out her delusions with unrelenting vindictiveness. These spirits can
    also appear as a result of mishaps with calling spells, but such instances
    are rare.
  - CALLING AN AOANDON
  - >-
    Calling an aoandon requires a paper lantern inscribed with runes and fueled
    by oils costing no less than 5,000 gp. Three or more creatures must chant
    the creature's name for 1 minute, then extinguish the lantern. There's a 1%
    chance per Hit Die the callers collectively possess that the aoandon is
    called. Relatives of the aoandon count as triple their normal Hit Dice. The
    aoandon isn't under the control of its conjurers, and can return to where
    she came from only after she has murdered at least one person she feels is
    responsible for her anguish.
