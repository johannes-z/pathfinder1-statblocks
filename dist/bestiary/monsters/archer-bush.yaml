    description: >-
      An archer bush can loose a cluster of needlesharp thorns at a single
      target within 20 feet as a standard action. An opponent hit by the thorns
      takes 1d8 points of piercing damage. Further, the target takes a -1
      circumstance penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks until the thorns
      are removed (full-round action to remove the thorns).
Description:
  - >-
    The archer bush is a subterranean, semi-mobile plant that gains sustenance
    from the blood of living creatures. Hidden beneath its trunk is the archer
    bush's mouth, which appears to be nothing more than a dark recess or cavity.
  - >-
    An archer bush attacks by firing a cluster of thorns at any creature that
    comes within 20 feet of its location.
