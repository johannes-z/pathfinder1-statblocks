Description:
  - >-
    The Old Man is the herald of Irori, a teacher, mentor, guide, and trainer in
    the service of the god of knowledge, history, and self-perfection. He can be
    patient or irate, confusing or enlightening, lenient or strict, depending on
    what his students need. He often wanders Golarion as a mortal man, bereft of
    his supernatural powers, instructing others and leading by example. If
    attacked when in this limited shape, he usually allows himself to be beaten
    or killed, especially if his "death" would provide a powerful lesson to an
    important student. If slain as a mortal, he simply reincarnates in his
    celestial form, unharmed, and never bears a grudge about it.
  - >-
    The Old Man's true form is that of an elderly human man, perhaps of Tien or
    Vudrani ancestry but never clearly identifiable as such. He is typically
    bald and wiry, and usually wears a long white moustache or beard. Though he
    appears frail and sometimes supports himself with a cane, crutch, or staff,
    he is incredibly strong and can move with an alien grace when he so chooses.
    He may dress in a simple robe, an elaborate ceremonial garment, or a simple
    loincloth.
  - >-
    He is often accompanied by one of five animals: a turtle, monkey, ox,
    rooster, or pig.
  - >-
    When not acting on Irori's behalf, the Herald of Irori keeps busy with
    tending to animals, planting gardens, meditating, practicing martial arts
    forms, swimming, and quipping with students.
  - >-
    The Herald of Irori stands just over 5 feet tall and weighs about 120
    pounds.
