Description:
  - >-
    The ebon ooze is a cousin of the black pudding. It has an affinity for
    negative energy, and tends to dwell in locations near undead and evil
    priests. Unlike most oozes, an ebon ooze is intelligent, and takes great
    pleasure in stalking and devouring living creatures. Although it is not
    harmed by sunlight, the ebon ooze finds it painful, and usually takes
    shelter in a dark, shady location if outdoors during the day.
  - >-
    Ebon oozes are ambush predators, using terrain to their advantage to conceal
    itself until prey draws near. If it feels it clearly outmatches its prey, an
    ebon ooze may choose to forego grabbing and killing it outright, instead
    stalking and toying with it. However, when facing a clearly superior
    opponent, the ebon ooze is not afraid to retreat, and generally tries to
    have some means of escape should a fight go against it, such as a deep,
    narrow crevice or the bottom of a deep pool.
