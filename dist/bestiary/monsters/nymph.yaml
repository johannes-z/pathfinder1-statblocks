SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blinding Beauty (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability affects all humanoids within 30 feet of a nymph. Those who
      look directly at a nymph must succeed on a DC 21 Fortitude save or be
      blinded permanently. A nymph can suppress or resume this ability as a free
      action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Inspiration (Su)
    description: >-
      A nymph can choose an intelligent creature to inspire and serve as a muse
      by giving that creature some token of her affection (typically a lock of
      her hair). As long as the nymph retains her favor for this creature and as
      long as the creature carries the nymph's token, the creature gains a +4
      insight bonus on all Will saving throws, Craft checks, and Perform checks.
      A bard who has a nymph for a muse in this way can use his bardic
      performance for an additional number of rounds per day equal to his nymph
      muse's Charisma modifier. The nymph retains a link to her token and its
      carrier as if she had cast a status spell on the carrier. The nymph can
      end this effect at any time as a free action. A single nymph may only
      inspire one creature at a time in this manner. Spells A nymph casts spells
      as a 7th-level druid, but cannot swap out prepared spells to cast summon
      spells.
  - name: Stunning Glance (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a nymph can stun a creature within 30 feet with a
      look. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Fortitude save or be stunned for
      2d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Unearthly Grace (Su)
    description: >-
      A nymph adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on all her saving
      throws, and as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.
  - name: Wild Empathy (Su)
    description: >-
      This works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except the nymph
      has a +6 racial bonus on the check. The nymph's effective druid level is
      equal to her HD for determining her total modifer to the check.
Description:
  - >-
    Many have lost their lives in vain search of the beauty of the nymph, and
    many more to the madness and obsession their grace has upon minds and bodies
    unprepared for their companionship. Yet the nymph herself is not a cruel
    creature-a guardian of nature's purest places and most beautiful realms, she
    treats those who respect her and her abode with kindness, and may even favor
    someone who takes her fancy with magical gifts. Yet those who would seek to
    abuse or harm her or her home quickly find that behind her beauty is a
    fierce protector more than capable of defending her charge.
