SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dehydration Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A salt elemental's aura draws moisture from an area centered on itself.
      Living creatures within range take damage (damage is detailed with each
      elemental) each round they remain in the area. A successful Fortitude save
      reduces the damage by half. This effect is especially devastating to
      plants, animals, and aquatic creatures, which take a -4 penalty on their
      saving throws. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Earth Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A salt elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it
      and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or
      waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls.
      These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the
      elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These
      modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)
  - name: Salt Poisoning (Ex)
    description: >-
      Anyone hit by a salt elemental's claw attack is sickened for 3 rounds + 1
      round per Hit Dice of the salt elemental. A successful Fortitude save
      negates this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Vulnerability to Water (Ex)
    description: >-
      A salt elemental submerged in water that covers at least half its body
      takes 1d6 points of damage each round until it escapes. Damage from
      water-based attacks (such as the slam attack of a water elemental) deal
      +50% damage to a salt elemental.
Description:
  - >-
    Salt elementals inhabit regions rich in salt upon the Plane of Earth. Some
    believe they originated on a pocket plane somewhere near the energy planes
    and Plane of Water; perhaps an Elemental Plane of Salt. Salt elementals,
    avoid large expanses of water at all costs, knowing exposure to such a large
    quantity spells disaster.
  - >-
    Salt elementals spend most of their time wandering their realm and often
    make forays into other planes (except the Plane of Water), seeking creatures
    on which to feed. They are particularly fond of plants, which are extremely
    vulnerable to their dehydrating ability.
  - >-
    A salt elemental generally appears as a humanoid with no discernible
    features, though they can take other forms, and some do, preferring to
    appear in the shape of large animals or giant vermin (usually beetles).
