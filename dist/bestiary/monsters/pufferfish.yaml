      Pufferfish aren't equipped attack other creatures, but foes that strike a
      pufferfish with an unarmed strike or natural attack risk being poisoned by
      the fish's toxic spines, and must immediately save against the
      pufferfish's tetrodotoxin.
Description:
  - >-
    Pufferfish (or "puffers") are a category of poisonous fish that dwell in
    warm coastal waters. Pufferfish have the ability to rapidly fill their
    stomachs with water or air, causing their bodies to balloon out and make the
    poisonous spikes on their skin more pronounced. While certain aquatic sharks
    and other animals have adapted to eat pufferfish, the puffer's tetrodotoxin
    (typically delivered via the spines on the fish's skin, though prevalent
    throughout its organs as well) remains highly poisonous to humans and most
    mammals. Puffers come in a large variety of sizes and varieties, and most
    range from 6 inches to 2 feet in length and weigh between 5 and 30 pounds.

    Certain societies in Tian Xia (particularly in the coastal regions of
    Minkai) regard pufferfish meat as a delicacy. The specially trained chefs
    capable of reliably distinguishing the poisonous parts of the pufferfish
    from the nontoxic parts are highly prized by members of Tian nobility.
