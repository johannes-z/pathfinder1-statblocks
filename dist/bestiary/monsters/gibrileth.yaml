SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Tumors (Su)
    description: >-
      As a swift action, a gibrileth can rip a grapefruit-sized tumor from its
      body with one of its many arms and throw it as a splash weapon with a
      range increment of 20 feet. A direct hit deals 2d6 points of acid damage,
      and deals 1d4 points of acid splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet
      of the target. A creature can avoid the splash damage with a successful DC
      22 Reflex save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Whip Specialist (Ex)
    description: A gibrileth does not provoke attacks of opportunity when using a whip.
Description:
  - >-
    Gibrileths are known as filth demons because their appearance is so vile
    that even other demons find them appalling-including some hezrous. A
    gibrileth's body is composed almost entirely of quivering, globular, acidic
    tumors, save for its batlike wings and the nest of spindly, atrophied arms
    growing from the top of its body. It can walk with a clumsy gait, using its
    long arms, but it prefers to be on the wing. These creatures enjoy spreading
    nausea and sickness, either via their spell-like abilities or through
    violence-in fact, they are one of the primary sources of demonplague
    throughout the Worldwound. Gibrileths particularly relish the taste of
    partially liquefied, diseased flesh, and many keep infected victims in pens
    like cattle for periodic snacking, allowing their sickness to season them
    properly before feeding. Gibrileths rise from the souls of mortals who
    deliberately encourage the spread of disease or sickness, many of whom died
    of disease themselves.
  - >-
    A gibrileth is approximately 10 feet in diameter, with a wingspan of 16
    feet. These foul, bloated demons typically weigh about 2,400 pounds.
