Description:
  - >-
    A desert hermit seeks the solitude in the windswept wastes for two chief
    reasons. First, the hermit finds that isolation allows him to more easily
    experience nature's harsh beauty and raw power, which he seeks to emulate.
    Second, the wide open spaces provide the hermit with the freedom to
    experience the world without interference from human society, which is
    trapped in meaningless competitions to get ahead in a race toward an unhappy
    death plagued by debt, troublesome relationships, and arbitrary expectations
    enforced by shame, discrimination, and even violence.
  - >-
    Desert hermits are often defensive and suspicious when interrupted by
    outsiders. They rarely form druid circles, preferring true isolation. Those
    who forgo their connection to the desert in favor of a bestial ally tend to
    select camels, cobras, jackals, and vultures.
