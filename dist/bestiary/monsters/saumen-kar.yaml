SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Frostbite Brands (Ex)
    description: >-
      A saumen kar's brands infuse the creature with intense cold, so much that
      it gains resistance to fire 20 and its touch deals an additional 1d6
      points of cold damage. A saumen kar's metallic weapons also conduct this
      chill. A saumen kar's brands can be removed by the spell erase as though
      they were magic writing with a caster level equal to the saumen kar's Hit
      Dice. If the brands are removed, the saumen kar loses both its fire
      resistance and its ability to do additional cold damage, until the
      following dawn when the brands re-etch themselves upon its body.
  - name: Snowstorm (Su)
    description: >-
      In mimicry of its unforgiving environment, a saumen kar can transform into
      a living snowstorm of lethal power. This ability lasts as long and
      operates like the whirlwind special attack with the following changes:
      Creatures within the area of the snowstorm take 2d6 points of cold damage
      and 2d6 points of slashing damage and take a -20 penalty on Perception
      checks. A saumen kar gains a fly speed of 40 feet (perfect) while in this
      form.
  - name: Stun (Ex)
    description: >-
      While a saumen kar's horns are not large enough for a gore attack, they
      extend under the skin to form a bony plate. A creature struck by a saumen
      kar's headbutt must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude saving throw or be
      stunned for 1 round.
Description:
  - >-
    This leathery-faced creature stands tall and upright, with long, simian
    limbs and a shaggy coat. Intelligent and powerful, saumen kars are not
    naturally aggressive, but the hostility of their environment forces them to
    defend the land that supports them with ferocity, even to the death. Their
    natural coloration and snow-packed fur make saumen kars almost invisible
    among the drifts of their icy homes, leading many arctic races to refer to
    them as "men of snow." A long-forgotten deal made by their race in its
    infancy still brutally scars the body of each saumen kar, marking them with
    their distinctive frostbite brands-though if this debt is already paid,
    lapsed, or growing ever greater, none can remember. An adult saumen kar
    stands 12 feet tall and weighs almost 2,000 pounds, but the ice and snow
    matted to its fur for both insulation and armor add another 1,000 pounds to
    its bulk.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    These solitary creatures eke out a bitter existence across the equally
    bitter landscape of the Crown of the World, their origins a mystery even to
    themselves. They are nomadic, roaming the wastes to settle temporarily where
    they are lucky enough to find food, shelter, or both. They are omnivorous,
    but the climate dictates that the lion's share of their diet is meat, and
    saumen kars consume the flesh of any creature but their own kind.
  - >-
    Generation to generation, saumen kars pass down the ice crafting techniques
    that supply them with weapons, tools, and art. Occasionally a saumen kar's
    lair contains crude ice replicas of common Erutaki implements, from storage
    jars to skinning tools, or even heavy-lidded ice chests. Finding their
    frozen works among the possessions of another race is rare, however, since
    saumen kar ice artifacts rarely last long outside of arctic environments.
  - >-
    The crude frostbite brands that mark every adult saumen kar's flesh are the
    gruesome expression of an ancient pact with an otherworldly being, still
    honored by saumen kars for both spiritual and practical reasons. The
    specifics of the pact are long forgotten, but some Erutaki elders believe
    the men of snow protect something in the wastes that they have themselves
    forgotten. While the meaning of the brands may have become lost to their
    wearers, scholars of language recognize the runes as a form of ancient
    Giant. Even still, only one well versed in linguistics can identify the sole
    rune still rendered well enough to read: "favored." The runes' powers lead
    many to believe the saumen kars owe their protection to one of the numerous
    powers of the North, such as Hshrha, the Duchess of All Winds; the Empyreal
    Lord Tolc; or entities mysterious to natives of more temperate lands, though
    the implication of the runes being an ancient form of the Giant language
    also creates an unsettling link between these arctic warriors and the
    Deathless Frost, Kostchtchie. Whichever way other races choose to speculate,
    the saumen kars believe the brands' protections come from their reverence
    for the deadly forces of the world's summit, and they display their scars
    proudly, wearing no clothing or armor but the snow matted into their dense
    fur.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    The Crown of the World is an unforgiving place, and the saumen kars have
    learned that survival is best achieved alone or in very small groups. It is
    rare to meet more than one of their kind at a time, although folklore does
    tell of handfuls of saumen kars banding together against a particularly
    serious or wide-ranging threat. Wandering the wastes alone, they throw up
    temporary lairs wherever food or ice cliffs can be found, moving off when
    they have taken what they can from the land. A typical lair is little more
    than a rough-walled igloo or ice cave built by hefting large amounts of snow
    and packing it tight around the hemispheres of ice they create, before the
    magical effect expires.
  - >-
    Saumen kars' antisocial behavior is what keeps them rare, and indeed mating
    is almost incidental, occurring when a male's and favorably disposed
    female's paths happen to cross. New families rarely stay together for long,
    and for a creature with a lifespan of up to 300 years, their offspring grow
    at an alarming rate, and learn to fend for themselves early in life.
  - >-
    Saumen kars worship the land and the powers of the North rather than any
    specific deity, leading to a druidic dominance of their spiritual lives. In
    their final days, some saumen kars travel to sites of great natural beauty
    or power to die in a place where the blackened bones of many generations are
    tumbled together beneath ever-shifting ice and snow. From what little
    outsiders can gather, they are a loosely shamanic people, and some carry
    crude family reliquaries of teeth, bones, and fur for ancestral protection
    and guidance.
  - >-
    Saumen kars speak a dialect of Giant inf luenced by Druidic, though they
    rarely communicate with other races. Some saumen kars, through necessity,
    have picked up smatterings of the Erutaki languages and even a word or two
    of Common, but their knowledge of such languages never extends beyond a
    handful of crude threats and warnings.
  - >-
    Survival in the wastes is about understanding its dangers, environmental or
    otherwise, and despite their primitive, animalistic appearance, saumen kars
    are canny combatants. Over thousands of years their proud race has learned
    patience and silence from the glaciers. Rather than risk a frontal assault,
    they utilize their natural coloration to hide in snow banks and their
    ability to summon powerful ursine aid to scare off enemies or track those
    who trespass upon their lands. Only if interlopers prove a match for their
    summoned allies will they cautiously join the fray, trapping physically
    stronger creatures in icy hemispheres or separating groups with freezing
    planes. They then wade in, the field rearranged to their advantage, to use
    their imposing size, savage axe blows, and incapacitating headbutts to cut
    down weaker opponents, or take snowstorm form to shred dangerous
    spellcasters with blinding, razor-sharp sleet.
