SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Strangulation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A rope golem deals 1d8+3 points of damage with a successful grapple check.
      Because the rope golem seizes the opponent by the neck, a strangled foe
      cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A rope golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. A disintegrate spell
      affects it normally. A rope trick or animate rope spell deals 1d6 points
      of damage to the rope golem per three levels of the spell caster (e.g., a
      6th-level sorcerer deals 2d6 points of damage to a rope golem if it casts
      rope trick or animate rope). A mending spell heals the rope golem of 2d6
      points of damage. Fire-based effects and spells affect it as described in
      its fire vulnerability above.
Description:
  - >-
    Rope golems are constructed from many intertwined and knotted ropes and
    often serve as guardians to lesser nobles, wizards, clerics, and the like,
    protecting a treasure hoard or some ancient knowledge best kept hidden. The
    typical rope golem stands 7 feet tall but weighs only about 100 pounds or
    so. Its long, gangly arms end in noose-like hands. A rope golem can expand
    its shape to fill a 10-foot area or contract its form to fill a space less
    than 2 1/2 feet square. Until it is activated, a rope golem appears to be
    nothing more than a pile of normal ropes. Rope golems cannot communicate.
    Rope golems attack by rolling their ropey appendages into "fists" and
    pummeling a foe. If a rope golem hits, it attempts to slip its noose-like
    hands over its opponent's head and around its neck. If successful, a rope
    golem often maintains the hold until it is destroyed or its opponent is
    dead. Construction A rope golem's body is spun and tied from 200 pounds of
    rope. Special bindings and powders worth 200 gp are used in the process.
