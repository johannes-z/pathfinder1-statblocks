  - name: Control Water (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a mummy of the deep can control water (as the spell, caster
      level 8th).
  - name: Curse of the Deep (Su)
    description: >-
      On a successful grapple check against a creature up to its size, a mummy
      of the deep presses its lips against an opponent's and regurgitates sea
      water into the opponent's lungs. Each round thereafter, for the next 10
      rounds, the victim must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of
      damage that round. Three consecutive successful saves means the character
      has coughed up enough water to shake the effects of this attack and takes
      no further damage. An affected creature can take no actions other than to
      defend itself in any round it takes damage from this ability. At 0 or less
      hit points, the victim falls unconscious. In the next round, he drowns.
      The save DC is Charisma-based. Holding one's breath does not prevent
      drowning (water is already in the lungs). A remove curse, heal spell, or
      successful DC 20 Heal check halts the damage if applied before the
      creature reaches 0 or less hit points.
  - name: Despair (Su)
    description: >-
      At the mere sight of a mummy of the deep, the viewer must succeed on a DC
      15 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the
      save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by that mummy
      of the deep's despair ability for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A mummy of the deep is an undead creature that lairs in the depths of the
    sea. It is the result of an evil creature that was buried at sea for its
    sins in life. The wickedness permeating the former life has managed to cling
    even into unlife and revive the soul as a mummy of the deep. A mummy of the
    deep attacks with its slam attack, attempting to grapple an opponent and use
    its curse of the deep ability. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene
