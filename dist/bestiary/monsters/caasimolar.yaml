SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      By speaking, Caasimolar induces fear in all creatures within 30 feet that
      hear him. Creatures within the area must succeed on a DC 33 Will save or
      be affected as if by a fear spell (CL 20th). If the save is successful,
      that creature cannot be affected again by Caasimolar's fear for one day.
      Other devils are immune to the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
      Caasimolar's Iron Rod: This 6-foot long iron rod functions as a +3 cold
      iron good outsider bane quarterstaff. In addition, it has the following
      abilities: - 1/day-lightning bolt, range 100 ft., 15d6 electricity damage,
      Ref DC 25 for half - 3/day-slay living, touch (with rod), Fort DC 25 or
      die (3d6+20 damage if save succeeds) - Inflict moderate wounds each time a
      creature is hit with the rod, 2d8+10 damage; Will DC 25 for half
Description:
  - >-
    In the centuries when Lucifer ruled Hell, Caasimolar stood beside him as
    President. He was second in command behind only Lucifer himself.
  - >-
    When the Great Uprising occurred Caasimolar was offered a position in Hell's
    new court, but he promptly replied by slaying the messenger and all the
    guards that had delivered the offer. Displeased with his answer, Asmodeus
    cast him out of Hell along with the rest of Lucifer's court when the Great
    Uprising was ended.
  - >-
    Caasimolar is a cruel and malevolent creature and spends most of his time in
    his tower in Lucifer's basalt palace on the plane of Infernus. From his
    tower he enjoys watching the devils torture captured souls, particularly
    human souls. When not delighting himself in the torture of others, he is
    listening to reports from his vast network of spies he has encamped in the
    arch-devils' palaces in Hell. Though Caasimolar is no longer in Hell, little
    goes on there that he doesn't know about. His loyalty to Lucifer has never
    been in question and he keeps a close watch on those that offer advice, aid,
    information, or the like to his master.
  - >-
    Caasimolar is never encountered alone except in his tower. When walking the
    halls of Malefacta (Lucifer's great palace) or tending to duties elsewhere
    in Infernus, he always has a retinue of 1 pit fiend and 2-5 bearded devils
    with him.
  - >-
    When first engaged in battle, Caasimolar uses his fear effect against all
    within range that can hear him. When encountered with his personal retinue
    of devils, he prefers to let them fight, while he hangs back and peppers the
    enemy with slay living effects (from his rod) or cones of cold.
  - >-
    If his enemies force him into battle, he begins by releasing a slay living
    effect against who he deems to be the most powerful foe in the group. If
    this fails, he quickly unleashes a lightning bolt from his rod at the same
    target. If forced to fight close quarter, he relies on his rod's physical
    power as well as its spell-like effects, and he utilizes his spell-like
    abilities.
  - >-
    If the day is lost, Caasimolar summons devils to cover his escape before
    teleporting away to safety.
