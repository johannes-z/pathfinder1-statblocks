Description:
  - >-
    A gambado makes its lair in a 6-foot deep pit. It hides its body with rocks,
    leaves, and anything else in the surrounding area, allowing only its head to
    be seen. Thus, when viewing a hidden gambado, it appears to be nothing more
    than a humanoid skull resting on the ground. When living creatures approach
    the gambado, it strikes.
  - >-
    The gambado is a human-sized creature with a cylindrical torso topped by a
    humanoid skull-like head. Two long arms ending in razor-sharp claws protrude
    from the body. Its torso ends in three long, single-toed feet. Its body is
    gray in color and leathery and can be compressed like a spring. This is its
    primary means of locomotion. By compressing its body, the gambado can spring
    up or forward.
  - >-
    Gambado are solitary creatures by nature, and on the rare occasion that more
    than one is encountered, each will have its own lair and pit from which it
    attacks. The pits are usually close together to maximize their attacks on
    creatures within the area. Any treasure collected by a gambado is stored on
    its pit floor or in a small and well-hidden hole (DC 18 Perception to find)
    in the side of its pit.
  - >-
    Gambados speak no known languages, and it is unknown how they communicate
    among themselves.
  - >-
    A gambado springs to attack any time a living creature comes within 2 feet
    of its lair. It attacks relentlessly with its bite and claws, but does not
    fight to the death. If combat goes against it, it seeks the quickest
    possible means of escape.
