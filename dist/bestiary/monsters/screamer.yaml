Description_Visual: >-
  Racing toward you is a ghostly form like the tattered shreds of a translucent
  pennant. It retains a vaguely humanoid form trailing behind its forward-facing
  head. Hollows mark its eyes above its most distinguishing feature, a gaping
  mouth locked in a perpetual scream-like a maw opening into eternal darkness.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Charisma Drain (Su)
    description: >-
      A screamer causes 1d4 points of Charisma drain each time it hits with its
      incorporeal touch attack. On each successful attack, it gains 5 temporary
      hit points.
  - name: Malevolence (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round, a screamer can merge its body with a creature on the
      Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level
      10th or the screamer's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does
      not require a receptacle. To use this ability the screamer must try to
      move into the target's space; moving into the target's space to use the
      malevolence ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target
      can resist the attack with a successful DC 16 Will save, but the target
      adds (or subtracts) its Charisma modifier to this saving throw roll. A
      creature that successfully saves is immune to that same screamer's
      malevolence for 24 hours, and the screamer cannot enter the target's
      space. If the save fails, the screamer vanishes into the target's body.
      Screamers prefer to use this attack after having made several Charisma
      drain attacks to weaken a target's resistance. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      A screamer cannot be killed through simple combat. If reduced to 0 hit
      points it disappears only to reform 24 hours later. The only way for a
      screamer to be truly laid to rest is for it to die while possessing a host
      body with its malevolence ability. When the body dies, the screamer spirit
      ceases to exist.
  - name: Scream of Hopelessness (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every hour, a screamer can loose a horrific, mournful scream. Any
      living creature within hearing distance of this scream (it can carry up to
      a mile outdoors) must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or become shaken for
      2d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear attack. Creatures that
      successfully save cannot be affected by the same screamer's scream of
      hopelessness for 24 hours. The effects of multiple screamers' screams
      cannot stack. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Suicidal Frenzy (Su)
    description: >-
      If a screamer succeeds in possessing a target with its malevolence
      ability, it immediately begins to make suicidal attacks on the possessed
      body with the body's own weaponry. Each round, the screamer uses the
      body's full attacks to direct its weaponry against itself. It uses the
      possessed victim's attack and damage modifiers and must only succeed on an
      attack against the body's flat-footed armor class. Damage, including the
      possibility of critical hits, is rolled normally. Due to the inhabiting
      spirit, the possessed body continues its attacks even between -1 and -9
      hit points, though only single attacks can be made at this point. If the
      possessed body is made helpless the screamer departs to find another
      target. If the possessed body dies, the screamer's spirit is destroyed as
      it goes to its final rest.
Description:
  - >-
    These terrible undead are the remnant of soldiers who have fallen to the
    horrors of mass conflict and warfare. Whether each of these creatures is the
    remains of a single fallen soldier or a conglomerate of the scarred psyches
    of several such casualties remains up for debate, however what is known as
    that all of these creatures harbor an unending hatred of the living and an
    unceasing quest for the release of death. These mutual drives combine to
    create a horrifying fate for all those unfortunate enough to encounter a
    screamer.
  - A screamer retains no language.
  - >-
    In combat a screamer emits a continual piercing keen which rises in volume
    and pitch to become its scream attack. It uses this in conjunction with its
    charisma-draining touch to wear down its victim and make them susceptible to
    its malevolence attack. A screamer attack that is completely successful
    always ends in the creature's own destruction.
