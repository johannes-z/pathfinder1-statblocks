SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Drown (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a drowning devil can summon murky water into the
      lungs of a single target within 30 feet. If the target can't breathe
      water, it's unable hold its breath and immediately begins to drown. At the
      start of its next turn, the target must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save
      to cough up this water or it falls unconscious and is brought to 0 hit
      points. On the next round, the target must save successfully again or drop
      to -1 hit point and start dying; on the third round it must save
      successfully again or die. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Heavy Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Whenever a creature enters the drowning devil's heavy aura, it must
      succeed at a DC 18 Will save or reduce its speed as if carrying a load one
      step higher or wearing armor one category heavier (whichever is worse),
      and its armor check penalty increases by 2. A creature already carrying a
      heavy load or wearing heavy armor that fails its save can't move as long
      as it remains in the affected area. A creature that saves against a
      drowning devil's heavy aura is immune to that devil's aura for 24 hours.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Slam-injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4
      Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Description:
  - >-
    Called sarglagons in their Infernal tongue, drowning devils take great pride
    in being the best-adapted guardians of Hell's waterways, and are among the
    few fiends who travel the seas and rivers of the multiverse as part of
    larger infernal plots. Even in the air or on the ground, a drowning devil
    moves with a haunting litheness as though it were swimming. A typical
    drowning devil weighs 600 pounds, and can exceed 15 feet from head to tail.
