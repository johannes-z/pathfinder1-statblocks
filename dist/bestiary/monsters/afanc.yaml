Description:
  - >-
    Afancs are the sea monsters that sailors talk about when spinning tales of
    the sea. They are the creatures responsible for entire fleets and crews
    being lost or destroyed. They are thought by many to be the "kings" of the
    sea as most other water-dwellers pale in comparison both in strength and
    size to the mighty afanc.
  - >-
    Afancs are omnivorous hunters of the deep sea, feeding on a mixed diet of
    kelp, coral, sea plants, sharks, whales, various other large fishes, and
    swimmers and sailors unfortunate enough to cross the path of an afanc.
  - >-
    Afancs are sometimes worshipped as sea gods by small towns, villages, and
    seaside communities. Sacrifices to the "Great Whale Gods" include in various
    forms enormous amounts of cultivated sea plants, massive amounts of fish
    that have been netted, young girls or women, and occasionally an entire ship
    laden with criminals who are to be executed for their crimes.
  - >-
    An afanc is generally about 100 feet long though specimens as large as 200
    feet long are thought to exist. Its whale-like body is colored gray or
    sometimes bluish-green and its eyes are always blue. Its tail is extremely
    long and ends in a truncated or flat, square edge. An afanc has a bulbous,
    somewhat flattened head, not unlike that of a great catfish.
