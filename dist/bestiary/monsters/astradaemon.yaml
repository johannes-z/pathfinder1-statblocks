SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Devour Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an astradaemon that begins its turn with a grappled
      opponent can attempt to draw out and consume the soul of its victim,
      killing it instantly. This ability only works on living creatures, which
      may resist with a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw. The save is
      Constitution-based. For every 5 HD of the slain creature, the daemon gains
      a +1 profane bonus on attacks, saving throws, and checks for 24 hours.
      This ability does not consume all of the soul, and pieces of it still
      exist after the daemon completes its feast (enough to be able to resurrect
      the slain victim normally).
  - name: Soul Siphon (Su)
    description: >-
      If a Small or larger living creature dies within 10 feet of an
      astradaemon, the daemon gains 1d8 temporary hit points and a +2 bonus to
      Strength for 10 minutes. These bonuses stack with themselves. Incorporeal
      undead and living spirits traveling outside the body (such as a person
      using astral projection or magic jar) take 1d8 points of damage each round
      within the daemon's aura.
Description:
  - >-
    Believed to be creations of the Four Horsemen, astradaemons live out their
    existence in search of souls to harvest. These deadly creatures are ravening
    planar predators, openly hunting throughout the void for souls on which to
    feed. These voracious creatures are the personifications of death resulting
    from negative energy or level drain. Their vile touch drains life force from
    their enemies, and even perishing near them sates their thirst for life and
    souls.
