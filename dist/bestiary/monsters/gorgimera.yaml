SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A gorgimera has two breath weapons, each of which can be used
      independently of the other (thus it can breathe twice in a given round as
      a single standard action). Dragon A gorgimera's dragon head breath weapon
      depends on the color of its dragon head, as summarized on the table below.
      Regardless of its type, a gorgimera's breath weapon is usable once every
      1d4 rounds, deals 3d8 points of damage, and allows a DC 21 Reflex save for
      half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. To determine a gorgimera's
      head color and breath weapon randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table
      below. 1d10 Head Color Breath Weapon 1-2 Black 40-foot line of acid 3-4
      Blue 40-foot line of lightning 5-6 Green 20-foot cone of gas (acid) 7-8
      Red 20-foot cone of fire 9-10 White 20-foot cone of cold Gorgon A
      gorgimera's gorgon head breath weapon is usable once every 1d4 rounds (no
      more than twice per day), turns a creature to stone permanently, and
      allows a DC 19 Fortitude save to avoid. The save DC is Constitution-based.
      The breath weapon is a 30-foot cone.
Description:
  - >-
    A gorgimera is a chimerical creature with the heads of a lion, dragon, and
    gorgon. It has the hindquarters of a gorgon and the forequarters of lion. It
    is a highly territorial predator whose hunting range often covers several
    square miles around its lair. The creature makes its home inside caves high
    atop mountains or deep inside caverns. A typical lair contains a mated pair
    and one or two young. A gorgimera's dragon head can be that of any of the
    evil dragons (see below). The lion head has no mane, and the scaled gorgon
    head is a deep navy blue with glowing red eyes. A gorgimera prefers to
    attack from ambush. It usually attacks by biting with its lion head and
    dragon head, butting with its gorgon head, and slashing with its front
    leonine paws. In lieu of biting, the dragon head and gorgon head can emit
    their respective breath weapons. Credit The Gorgimera originally appeared in
