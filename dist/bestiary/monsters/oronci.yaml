Description_Visual: >-
  A cruel face and orc features dominate this creature's upper half, while its
  lower quarters bear the sinewy shape of a centipede.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Frenzy (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, an oronci that takes damage in combat can fly into a frenzy
      as a free action the following round. While in this state, an oronci
      cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skill checks,
      but functions as if under the effects of a haste spell. The oronci can
      continue to frenzy for up to 3 rounds, after which it is staggered for 1
      round.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3
      Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Spit (Ex)
    description: >-
      An oronci can spit poison at a target within 30 feet as a standard action.
      This is a ranged touch attack, and can only be performed once every 1d6
      rounds. If the attack is successful, the target is affected by the poison
      just as if it had been injured. The oronci can still poison a target with
      each successful bite attack.
  - name: Undersized Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      Although an oronci is Large, its upper torso is the same size as that of a
      Medium humanoid. As a result, oronci wield weapons as if they were one
      size category smaller than their actual size (Medium for most oronci).
Description:
  - >-
    When drow fleshwarping alchemy is turned and focused upon an orc, the
    obscene result is called an oronci. Upon submersion in a fleshwarper's
    alchemical ichor, the unfortunate orc's legs merge, and its lower body turns
    black and elongates to a length of approximately 15 feet. This new body
    divides into segments, with each segment sprouting a pair of short, sturdy,
    thin legs. Finally, the horror's tusks connect to newly grown poison ducts
    that constantly drip poisonous spittle. The orc's head and upper body stay
    relatively intact as far as fleshwarping goes, though its eyes sometimes
    adopt a dark, vacant stare.
  - >-
    With the exception of the driders, the oronci are among the most useful of
    the obscenities produced by fleshwarping. They embody all the savage
    brutality of an orc warrior, but mounted centaurlike upon an even larger,
    more powerful frame. Being less intelligent than drow, oronci make better
    shock troopers and advance soldiers for drow armies than the dark elves
    themselves. Oronci who have escaped the slavery of the dark elves have
    become favored champions for certain clever orc chieftains. Some oronci even
    overcome their sensitivity to daylight given time, which makes them better
    suited to terrorize the surface lands.
