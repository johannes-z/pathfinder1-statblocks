SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Stability (Ex)
    description: >-
      A raggoth gets a +4 bonus on checks made to resist being bull rushed when
      standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding, or
      otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).
  - name: Tormenting Howl (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a raggoth can loose a piercing howl that affects
      all creatures within 60 feet that hear it. A creature within the area must
      succeed on a DC 17 Will save or become shaken for 2d4 rounds. A creature
      that succeeds on its save is immune to the tormenting howl of that raggoth
      for 24 hours. Multiple uses of tormenting howl do not stack but do
      increase the duration. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Raggoths are aggressive predators with voracious appetites and a killing
    instinct that makes them quite deadly in battle. Though its hunting area
    typically covers only about a mile around its lair, raggoths are known to
    track their prey up to 10 or more miles. Whether this only occurs when food
    is scarce or if the raggoth simply hunts and tracks its prey for the sheer
    thrill of the hunt is unknown.
  - >-
    Raggoths by their very nature are solitary, though sometimes they will work
    together to track down an elusive target or work together to bring down a
    particularly powerful opponent. Typically raggoths working in concert with
    one another are a mated pair.
  - >-
    Raggoth dwell in thick forests and make their home amidst the foliage or in
    shallow caves and caverns. If a mated pair is encountered, there is a chance
    (40%) that 1d4 young are present. Young are born live and are fully
    dependent on their mother for the first year of their life. Around 12 to 18
    months they begin to gain their independence, but do not fully leave the
    lair until they are around 2 years of age. A young raggoth reaches maturity
    around 4 years of age.
  - >-
    A raggoth is about 8 feet long and weighs about 450 pounds. Its fur is jet
    black, its nails and teeth are dull white, and its eyes are dull yellow.
  - >-
    Raggoths are ambush hunters and always use stealth tactics when hunting and
    tracking their prey. When spotted, a raggoth moves slowly toward its target
    and then quickly bursts from its hiding spot at its opponent. If the raggoth
    doesn't fell its opponent in the first round, it lets loose its tormenting
    howl to weaken its prey before attempting to finish it off with its terrible
    claws and bite. A raggoth fights to the death only if cornered or defending
    its lair.
