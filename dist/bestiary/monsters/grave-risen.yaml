Description_Visual: >-
  This rotting, worm-ridden corpse is draped in tattered and loosely fitting
  rags and dented and armor. Blackened eye sockets serve as its eyes, and the
  stench of death clings to its body. Its nails are long and filthy, caked with
  dirt and soil from the grave.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Poisoning (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by a claw attack must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or
      contract blood poisoning. This deals 1 point of Constitution damage to the
      victim per minute until the victim dies or the blood poisoning is healed.
      A neutralize poison or remove disease spell rids the victim of blood
      poisoning, as does a DC 15 Heal check. Multiple wounds to the same foe do
      not result in multiple instances of blood poisoning. The save DC and check
      DC are both Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Grave risen are rotting undead creatures that upon first glance resemble
    zombies. They are created from a normal corpse in an area where the blood of
    a spellcaster is spilled and permeates the ground. The blood fuses with a
    corpse which sometimes animates as a grave risen. These creatures rarely
    wander far from the area where they were risen, preferring the stench of
    death and the serenity of death that lingers in the air.
  - >-
    Grave risen have no love for the living and attack living creatures on
    sight. Living creatures slain by a grave risen are clawed and mutilated and
    then buried in a shallow grave by the grave risen as a mockery of its own
    current existence.
  - >-
    Grave risen do not speak or communicate; only occasionally loosing guttural
    tones from their rotting vocal organs.
  - >-
    Since grave risen are rarely encountered anywhere but cemeteries, burial
    grounds, or the like, they usually begin combat by animating corpses and
    sending them against their aggressors. After animating corpses, the grave
    risen attempts to down its foes with its filthy claws. Slain foes are
    destroyed (as detailed above) and are not consumed by a grave risen.
