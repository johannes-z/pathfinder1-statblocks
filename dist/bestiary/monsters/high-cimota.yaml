Description:
  - >-
    Cimota are the physical manifestations of evil thoughts and actions. They
    exist on the Negative Material Plane, manifesting in the Prime Material as
    cloaked figures. Their existence is always tied to a specific area or
    artifact that is imbued with ancient and highly malevolent evil. A cimota is
    able to manifest itself anywhere within an accursed locale that has given it
    life, or within 300 feet of an evil artifact to which it is attached.
  - >-
    The physical form of a cimota is a floating figure in a monk's cassock.
    Green eyes glow deep within their raised cowls, but their bodies are
    entirely invisible. See invisibility, true sight, or some similar ability to
    see invisible objects will reveal a ghostly, black human figure within the
    cimota's cloak. Cimota are manifestations of evil that may be touched like
    any other creature. They take damage from normal weapons. Their unnatural
    existence allows them to fly on the Prime Material Plane just like an
    incorporeal creature, except that they cannot pass through solid objects.
    When a cimota is destroyed in combat only a few shreds of tattered black
    cloth remain to show that they ever existed.
  - >-
    Cimota are bound to repeat the evil thoughts and actions that created them.
    When they manifest they will endlessly repeat the deeds that spawned them.
    So, for instance, a group of cimota may haunt a ruined temple, re-enacting
    evil rituals. Cimota may guard an unholy site such as a city, forest or
    building. They will fight to the death to defend these places. Cimota who
    are bound to an artifact may act out the intentions of that artifact. A
    cimota might follow the owner of an artifact, for instance, slaying the
    owner's friends and associates while keeping its existence a secret. Within
    the parameters of their creation, cimota are capable of strategy, deception
    and intelligent tactics.
  - >-
    Cimota are created by evil energy. Their supernatural nature gives them the
    ability to fight with two fists or two weapons without penalty, each attack
    landing with the force and accuracy of a single weapon attack. Cimota
    attacks are either a rake of invisible claws or a blow from a fist. They are
    capable of delivering slashing or bludgeoning blows as needed.
  - >-
    Cimota are capable of speaking Common and Infernal. Their voices are either
    hollow, ringing and unnatural, or malevolent whispers. Most often cimota use
    their voices to chant or to shout out dire condemnations at intruders. They
    do not parley and they never negotiate unless it is to deceive mortals to
    their deaths.
