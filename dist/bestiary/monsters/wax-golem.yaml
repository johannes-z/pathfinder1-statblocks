  - name: Conditional Sentience (Su)
    description: >-
      A wax golem constructed to look like a humanoid (whether a particular
      individual or not) has a small chance of gaining sentience and genuinely
      believing it is a living creature. Each week, such a wax golem has a
      cumulative 1% chance of becoming sentient (on the second week the chance
      is 2%, the third week 3%, and so on), to a maximum of 5%. If it does
      attain sentience, the golem gains an Intelligence score of 10, retroactive
      skill points, feats dependent on its Hit Dice, and 1 class level with the
      potential to gain more. If it was crafted to resemble a specific
      individual, it also gains a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks made to
      impersonate that individual. A sentient wax golem ventures into the world
      and tries to live a life similar to that of the person (or type of person)
      it resembles. However, if the sentient wax golem ever encounters the
      person it is modeled after, it attempts to stealthily kill that person and
      take her place. The only way for a sentient wax golem to lose its
      sentience is either to take an amount of fire damage equal to half its hit
      points (which melts its features away) or to be destroyed.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A wax golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell
      resistance, with the exception of spells and spell-like abilities that
      have the fire descriptor. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. • A magical attack that
      deals fire damage slows a wax golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds (no
      save). In addition, for 3 rounds after taking fire damage, every time a
      wax golem uses its slam attack, it deals an additional 1d4 points of fire
      damage due to its molten wax. • A magical attack that deals cold damage
      breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3
      points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing
      would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any
      excess as temporary hit points. A wax golem gains no saving throw against
      cold effects.
Description:
  - >-
    A wax golem is an exact replica of a particular person, composed completely
    of wax. While skilled artists pride themselves on their ability to make wax
    sculptures look lifelike, builders of wax golems go one step further and
    actually bring their art to life. Though eerily silent and unblinking,
    well-built wax golems bear such striking similarity to the subjects they are
    modeled after that some golems begin to think they are in fact that person.
    A wax golem can be constructed to resemble any person or creature.
