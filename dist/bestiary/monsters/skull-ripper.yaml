SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Behead (Ex)
    description: >-
      A skull ripper is an expert at collecting its favorite trophies-skulls.
      Once it has pinned a foe, it can attempt to behead the victim with a
      single gut-wrenching rip of its claws. This attempt is made as part of the
      grapple check to maintain an existing pin, and if successful, deals 4d6+18
      points of damage to the victim. If this damage is enough to bring the
      target below 0 hit points, the victim must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude
      save to resist having its head torn from its body, which results in
      instant death for most creatures. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Dread Visage (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures within 30 feet that can see a skull ripper must make a DC 18
      Will save at the start of their turn in order to avoid becoming frightened
      for 1 round. If the victim recognizes any of the heads affixed to the
      skull ripper's body as having once belonged to friends or allies, that
      victim takes a -4 penalty on the save. A creature that succeeds at the
      save is immune to the dread visage of that particular skull ripper for 24
      hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Su)
    description: >-
      Sting-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4
      Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Skull rippers were once guardians of the dead, the grim custodians of the
    great ossuaries of Thassilon. Although most skull rippers are discovered in
    ancient tombs and sepulchers, occasionally a geological upheaval or massive
    flood destroys a given catacomb or leaves a skull ripper stranded. In these
    cases, the construct emerges and ventures forth into the world above,
    harvesting skulls and causing widespread panic as it searches for a new tomb
    to guard.
