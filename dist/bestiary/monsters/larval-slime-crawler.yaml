  - name: Slippery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A slime crawler exudes a thin, oily film from the glands beneath its mouth
      that leaves a slug-like trail behind it as its moves and provides the
      creature with a +6 racial bonus to Escape Artist checks. A creature
      stepping in a space covered with this slime must succeed on a DC 11 Reflex
      save or slip and fall prone. The slime remains in the area for 1d2 hours
      before losing its potency. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Larval slime crawlers usually mature into this form within two to three
    weeks of hatching, at which time they feed on any living organisms
    encountered. More slug-like at this larval stage, the legs appear as small
    buds or stumps. These legs allow the slime crawler to climb walls and other
    surfaces, albeit slower than a mature slime crawler. Four tentacles sprout
    below its throat, eventually losing their grappling ability and growing into
    the pseudopod-like tentacles of the mature slime crawler.
  - >-
    A typical larval slime crawler is about 6 feet long and weighs about 300
    pounds.
  - >-
    A larval slime crawler attacks with its tentacles, attempting to grab an
    opponent and squeeze it. Slime crawlers have a nasty bite, but prefer to use
    their tentacles in battle.
