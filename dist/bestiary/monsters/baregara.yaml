      A baregara's huge arms allow it to initiate and maintain a grapple without

Description:
  - >-
    Although natives of the Abyss that often serve as minions for powerful
    demons or demon lords, baregaras are not in fact demons themselves. Some
    scholars classify them as "proto-demons"-monsters like bebiliths or xacabras
    that could perhaps someday complete their supernatural evolution into full
    demonic glory, but that have not quite yet reached that end. Of course, to
    the baregara's victims, these debates are incidental. In the Abyss,
    baregaras form small troops just like the apes of the Material Plane. These
    troops are led by the strongest fighter or an individual anointed by a
    powerful demon the baregara troop serves. Rivalries between troops are part
    of a complex hierarchy that is all but incomprehensible to non-baregaras,
    but planar scholars have observed that all baregaras take trophies from
    notable kills, and that these grisly mementos play some role in establishing
    the convoluted social standing of the troop leaders and their followers.
    Even when knuckle-walking on their enormous hands, baregaras stand over 12
    feet high when measured to the top of their horns, and their dense bodies
    can weigh up to 1,500 pounds.
