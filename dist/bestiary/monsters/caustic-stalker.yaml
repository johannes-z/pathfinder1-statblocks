SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      In addition to taking acid damage, any creature harmed by a caustic
      stalker's breath weapon must succeed at an additional DC 18 Fortitude
      saving throw or be affected by caustic creep poison. Caustic
      Creep-inhaled; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4
      Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Chemical Burn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature struck by the caustic stalker, or that strikes it with a
      natural weapon or unarmed attack, is affected as if by the burn special
      attack, but takes acid damage instead of fire damage. The chemical burn
      persists for multiple rounds, just as a normal burn, but can be ended
      early if the affected creature is doused in at least 1 gallon of liquid
      (requiring a full-round action from the victim or another creature) or
      fully submerges itself in water.
Description:
  - >-
    Though caustic stalkers arise from pockets of poisonous gas in the Plane of
    Air, they far prefer to congregate amid the great heat and pressure where
    the Plane of Earth and Plane of Fire meet. These conditions are also common
    in the depths of many worlds on the Material Plane. Caustic stalkers are
    usually content to drift amid the searing rocks and toxic fumes of volcanic
    depths, but occasionally emerge into more spacious areas. When they emerge,
    they are quick to lash out at anything that disturbs their explorations,
    especially if the area is windy.
