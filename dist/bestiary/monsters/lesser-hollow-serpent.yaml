Description_Visual: >-
  An unseen breeze stirs the desiccated scales of this immense snakeskin,
  causing the shedding's frayed, dried edges to flutter with a semblance of
  life. Pinpoints of unholy green light flare behind the intact eye lenses as
  the head starts to rise. The same glow behind those long-dead eyes illuminates
  a gaping mouth and bony fangs. Then a terrifying, painful hiss assaults your
  mind as the serpent slithers forward with a silent, unearthly grace.

      A hollow serpent notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just
      as if it possessed the blindsight ability.

      A hollow serpent deals an additional 2d6 points of damage caused by
      negative energy to victims trapped within its coils. A successful DC 16
      Will save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Among the many manifestations of serpentfolk faith, the hollow serpent
    represents one of the most horrific harbingers of doom. Serpentfolk legend
    suggests Ydersius created the first hollow serpents as protectors and
    guardians for their underground enclaves. But serpentfolk priests soon
    learned how to make more, worshiping and cultivating the skin sheddings of
    monstrously giant snakes with rituals to turn them into engines of
    destruction. Capable of laying waste to entire regions, the hollow serpents
    used their life-draining coils to slay the enemies of the serpentfolk,
    proving particularly effective against the Azlanti empire in the early years
    of the serpentfolk's age-long struggle against humanity. Eventually,
    however, the Azlanti learned to combat these skins with positive energy and
    fire. With the retreat of the mighty snake-god and his people into the
    shadows of the Darklands, serpentfolk priests have hoarded the most potent
    of these defenders as guardians of the hibernation chambers of the
    serpentfolk elite. A typical hollow serpent measures a little over 15 feet
    long and weighs 500 pounds. A lesser hollow serpent is 7 feet long and
    weighs just 90 pounds. Ecology As undead creatures, hollow serpents require
    nothing in the way of sustenance, but their voracious appetite for the
    life-energy of living creatures is well documented in the annals of Azlanti
    and serpentfolk lore. The temporary energy derived from their life-draining
    coils sends most hollow serpents into a feeding frenzy. And their lifesense
    ability helps them search out even the most well-hidden prey. Much like the
    predator snakes they mimic, hollow serpents enjoy the hunt and may stalk
    living creatures for days through the subterranean passageways of the
    Darklands or the ruined cities of the serpentfolk. Only the high priests of
    Ydersius know the proper rituals and ceremonies to infuse a shedding with
    enough divine magic to awaken it into a hollow serpent. However, a hollow
    serpent also possesses the means to create lesser offspring from its own
    desiccated flesh. These lesser hollow serpents are much smaller and limited
    in power, but their undersized nature allows them to venture into
    passageways a larger hollow serpent could never reach. Serpentfolk priests
    have also learned how to create these lesser hollow serpents using snakeskin
    sheddings from normal constrictor snakes, imbuing them with unlife as temple
    guardians. To spawn a lesser hollow serpent, a hollow serpent must undergo a
    molting cycle that lasts 3 months. Prior to this hibernation, it must also
    inf lict no less than nine negative levels on living creatures, storing up
    the temporary energy from these life-draining attacks to pass onto its new
    offspring. Thereafter, the hollow serpent sheds a piece of its own skin,
    which then grows into a lesser hollow serpent. Habitat & Society Hollow
    serpents have little in the way of society or culture of their own. Beholden
    to the snake-god, who grants their existence, they exist only to serve and
    defend the serpentfolk species. Lesser hollow serpents spawned by a hollow
    serpent intuitively stay near their progenitor- somehow interconnected
    through the negative energy and siphoned life forces shared between them.
    Spellcasters who create a lesser hollow serpent on their own may only
    command its loyalty if capable of commanding undead. Creating a Hollow
    Serpent While the first hollow serpents were supposedly created from scales
    shed by beasts favored by the Serpent King himself, and those unholy
    snakeskins can even shed their own lesser offspring over time, serpentfolk
    priests can also create their own lesser hollow serpents. A lesser hollow
    serpent created by a serpentfolk priest requires a more involved process.
    The priest must fill a clay pot with dirt taken from a serpentfolk grave,
    the skin and bones of a giant constrictor snake, an onyx gem worth at least
    250 gp, and a sprinkling of unholy water. Thereafter, a 15thlevel caster
    must cast create undead on the skin stuffed with the other assembled
    reagents.
