SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid Jet (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a sea scourge can shoot a
      stream of acidic juices in a 30-foot line, dealing 2d8 points of acid
      damage to any creatures in the area (DC 18 Reflex save for half damage).
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    On watch at night in warm seas, wise sailors are especially vigilant for the
    hated sea scourge, an ooze that has adapted itself so well to its maritime
    habitat as to become a significant hazard to native oceanic creatures as
    well as to humanoid seafarers. While its typical diet consists of sea
    turtles, dugongs, and other aquatic prey, the sea scourge will feed on
    whatever creatures it can manage to get a hold of, and is known to prey on
    humanoids both in shallow waters and at sea, even going so far as to board
    seagoing vessels. A sea scourge's acid is capable of dissolving wood in
    addition to flesh and bone, making it a particularly dangerous threat to
    most boats. Though it can swim beneath the waves indefinitely, a sea scourge
    more often tends to search the surface of the ocean for prey, camouf laged
    as a large clump of ambergris or other seaborne excretion.
  - Variant Sea Scourges
  - >-
    Most sea scourges are encountered off the western coast of Garund in the
    Arcadian Ocean, but some breeds have been known to stalk other parts of the
    high seas.
  - >-
    Coldwater Scourge (+0 CR): Stalking the watery expanses of the northern
    Arcadian Ocean and Inner Sea, the coldwater scourge is a menace to merchant
    ships and war galleons alike. A coldwater scourge is immune to cold damage,
    and creatures that fail their Ref lex saves versus the scourge's acid jet
    are also staggered for 1 round.
  - >-
    Steaming Scourge (+1 CR): The steaming scourge plagues the open waters of
    the Obari Ocean, sapping the life from unsuspecting marine animals as well
    as unwary fisherfolk and small seaside settlements. A steaming scourge
    possesses additional Hit Dice and the heat universal monster ability, and
    emits so much energy that any water in a 10-foot-radius spread around it
    begins to boil, dealing 1d6 points of damage to creatures that begin their
    turn submerged in it.
