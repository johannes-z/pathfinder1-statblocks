  This fleshy, slug-like creature has two long pseudopods that end in lumps of
  hard, callused flesh, and its whole body sizzles with acidic slime as it
  slides forward through melting stone.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Compression (Ex)
    description: >-
      A delver's boneless body can squeeze through spaces that would normally
      exclude anything larger than a Medium creature; it does not need to make
      Escape Artist checks to pass through such spaces. When it squeezes through
      a 5-foot opening, its speed is reduced to 5 feet until it passes
      completely through.
  - name: Corrosive Slime (Ex)
    description: >-
      The delver's skin is covered in an acidic slime that it uses to dissolve
      stone and defend against enemies. The slime deals 2d6 acid damage to
      flesh, 4d8 damage to metal, or 8d10 to stone or crystal. If the delver
      hits with a natural attack or grapple, it automatically adds its slime
      damage, and the slime continues to deal 2d6 damage per round for the next
      2 rounds. Armor or clothing worn by a creature grappled by a delver takes
      the same amount of acid damage unless the wearer succeeds on a DC 22
      Reflex saving throw. A quart or more of water can wash away the slime. Any
      weapon that strikes the delver takes slime damage, as does a creature
      grappling or attacking the delver with natural weapons (both Reflex half
      DC 22). The saves are Constitution-based.
  - name: Sculpt Stone (Ex)
    description: >-
      A delver can secrete a weaker form of its slime from its tentacles that
      momentarily softens stone rather than destroying it, allowing the creature
      to reshape up to 25 cubic feet of stone as if using stone shape as a
      15th-level caster. This ability has no effect on stone that is protected
      against acid. It can use this ability at will.
Description:
  - >-
    Delvers are enormous gastropods covered with corrosive slime and designed
    for burrowing through stone. Fifteen feet long and weighing several tons,
    they are most commonly encountered deep below ground, particularly near
    underground water sources. Surprisingly intelligent, these juggernauts exist
    to tunnel, surviving off metals- which they find intoxicating, and sometimes
    maddening- and leaving behind smooth, 10-foot-diameter passages.
