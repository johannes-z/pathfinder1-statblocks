SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blend with Stone (Su)
    description: >-
      A lythic can use its Stealth skill even when being observed. As long as
      it's within 10 feet of some sort of stone, a lythic can hide itself from
      view in the open without anything to actually hide behind.
  - name: Earth Glide (Su)
    description: >-
      A lythic can glide through stone, dirt or almost any other sort of earth
      except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves
      behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of
      its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing
      lythic flings the lythic back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round
      unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.
  - name: Fury of the Earth (Su)
    description: >-
      Anytime a lythic suffers more than 50% of its normal hit points in damage
      in a single encounter, it flies into a berserker-like rage. This grants
      the lythic a bonus to its damage rolls equal to one-half its Hit Dice for
      the remainder of the encounter. It cannot end this fury voluntarily but
      continues until all opponents are defeated or have fled.
Description:
  - >-
    Lythics are creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth. There, they spend
    their time in huge underground caverns with others of their race or in the
    company of earth elementals. Some lythics serve the elder elemental lords as
    spies, using their skills of going unnoticed to sneak into the palaces of
    arch-rivals.
  - >-
    Lythics occasionally punch through a vortex or portal and wind up on the
    Material Plane. Other outer planes (save some of the more desolate Abyssal
    planes) hold no interest for the lythic. On the Material Plane, they spend
    their time underground or gliding through mountains, devouring minerals as
    they move along. Occasionally, a lythic's elemental master sends it on a
    mission into the Material Plane.
  - >-
    Lythics are not particularly fond of pechs and generally avoid them or
    attack on sight. They rarely associate with other elemental creatures.
  - >-
    Lythic are not particularly hostile unless threatened. When a party of
    would-be delvers enters its domain, the lythic often trails them by blending
    with surrounding stone. If detected, a lythic usually flees unless attacked.
    Once in combat however, a lythic rarely backs down, and often fights until
    it is killed or its opponents are dead or fleeing.
