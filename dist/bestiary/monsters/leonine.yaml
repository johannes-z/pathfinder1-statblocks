    description: >-
      Lions (including dire lions) do not willingly attack a leonine, though
      they can be forced to do so through magic. If a leonine attacks a lion or
      dire lion, its protection against that creature ends.
Description:
  - >-
    Leonines are nomadic centaur-like creatures, part human and part lion. They
    make their homes upon the warm grasslands and plains of the world, living in
    prides of up to 20 or more individuals. Each pride has a leader, usually a
    fighter of 3rd-5th level. Some prides also have a shaman (a cleric of
    2nd-4th level). Prides are territorial with areas covering up to 5 square
    miles. Prides generally do not encroach on another's territory. In cases
    where territories overlap, bloody battles are fought between the prides with
    the victors claiming rights to the area.
  - >-
    Some particularly evil leonine prides worship Gorson, the Blood Duke (see
    The Tome of Horrors Complete by Frog God Games for details), and sacrifice
    captured humanoids to him. These prides feel a connection to Gorson and some
    believe he is the progenitor of the first leonines.
  - >-
    A leonine stands 7 feet tall and can reach lengths of up to 10 feet long.
    Average weigh is around 700 pounds. Males sport long, flowing hair of black
    or brown and usually wear it braided. A strip of hair runs from the base of
    its neck, down its back, and blends into its lion-like body. Females are
    slightly smaller than males, wear their hair shorter, and do not have the
    strip of hair running down their back. While females generally take care of
    the young, they are just as fierce and effective in combat as males. Young
    leonines are born live and reach maturity within three years. If the young
    are threatened, the entire pride fights to protect them.
  - >-
    Leonines fight with wicked, slightly curved spears and their forepaws. If
    disarmed, they can slash with their clawed hands. They attack from ambush
    when hunting, often tracking their quarry for several miles before springing
    to the attack. Leonines have a longstanding hatred for the tabaxi race and
    kill them on sight.
