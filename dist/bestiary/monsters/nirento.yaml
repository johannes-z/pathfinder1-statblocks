  - name: Hypnotic Display (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a standard action, a nirento can sway and dance in such a
      way that it attracts any who see the tree within a 60-foot radius. Any
      creatures other than nirentos in the area must succeed at a DC 17 Will
      save or become entranced by the nirento's graceful movements, thereafter
      believing the nirento to be a perfectly normal tree. Affected creatures
      become passive for 1d6 minutes and refuse to attack the nirento during
      this time. Affected creatures can attempt a new Will save each round that
      the nirento attacks an ally-if a hypnotized creature is attacked by the
      nirento, it gains a +4 bonus on its Will save to see through the hypnotic
      display. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Nirentos are predatory plants with brutish intelligence, their thorny vines
    able to tear foes limb from limb. A nirento lures prey toward it by swaying
    its branches and vines in a visually stimulating dance, striking at victims
    mercilessly once they are within range of its natural weapons. Slain prey
    then piles up around the tree's base and is absorbed through its roots.
    Nirentos' spongy bodies ensure they absorb most physical blows, though they
    remain susceptible to slashes and cuts, and when so injured, a translucent
    green sap oozes from their wounds. Elder nirentos are individuals that have
    lived for well over a century, and have absorbed nutrients from countless
    victims over the years. A typical nirento is 15 feet tall and weighs 1,000
    pounds, while elder nirentos can reach heights of up to 25 feet and weigh
    over a ton.
