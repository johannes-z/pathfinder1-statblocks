Description_Visual: >-
  These small hairy creatures resemble a cross between a goblin and a child's
  fuzzy play bear. They have wide set glowing golden eyes and long pointed ears
  like those of a donkey. They have a mouth to match their ears, complete with
  buck teeth.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: One with Nature (Su)
    description: >-
      When a phooka is slain through violence, all plants within a 100-foot
      radius of where it fell die and no new ones grow naturally in that area
      for 1 year.
  - name: Tree Stride (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a phooka can enter a tree and move from it to another
      tree with 50 feet as if by a tree stride spell. A phooka can remain inside
      a tree as long as it wishes. This ability otherwise resembles the spell of
      the same name.
Description:
  - >-
    Phookas are tricksters and jokesters. They revel in playing tricks on unwary
    travelers, leading them on merry chases or getting them lost deep in the
    forest. They are not necessarily malicious, however some phooka do lean
    towards evil and murder.
  - >-
    A phooka's trickery may include turning itself into an enchanted pony and
    offer a stranger a ride, only to lead it through brambles and thorns at top
    speed, or to lead travelers to enchanted springs that cause them to fall
    into deep slumber and strip them of all their belongings and clothes, then
    leave behind clues as to where their possessions are hidden.
  - >-
    Phooka are deeply attuned to nature and animals and have a bond with their
    natural surroundings. If slain all plant matter within one square mile of
    the phooka withers and dies.
  - A phooka stands about 3 feet.
