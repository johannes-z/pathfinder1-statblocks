SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature that successfully saves against the hag's breath weapon takes
      half damage and is not blinded.
  - name: Ice Staff (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per week, a winter hag can perform an hour-long ritual to create a
      staff made of black ice that is as hard as steel and functions as a +2
      frost quarterstaff. A winter hag holding her ice staff can use cone of
      cold once per day as a spell-like ability. The staff melts after 1 week.
  - name: Icewalking (Ex)
    description: >-
      This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the hag
      climbs must be icy. The hag can move across icy surfaces without penalty
      and doesn't need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.
  - name: Snow Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A winter hag can see perfectly well in snowy conditions and doesn't take
      any penalties on Perception checks while in snow.
Description:
  - >-
    Winter hags are sadistic crones who haunt winter-blasted plains and
    rime-covered forests. They're exceptionally arrogant, and often use their
    magic to subjugate entire tribes of evil humanoids so they can rule over
    them as queens. These arrangements rarely last more than a few seasons,
    because no creature is truly safe from a winter hag's irrepressible appetite
    for warm, raw flesh. An ambitious winter hag might extort a village by
    causing constant snowfall until they give her children to eat or adults to
    become her slaves. A typical winter hag stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and
    weighs 100 pounds. When a winter hag joins a coven, the coven adds sculpt
    simulacrum and simulacrum to its spell-like abilities, and any member within
    1 mile of the winter hag gains icewalking and snow vision.
