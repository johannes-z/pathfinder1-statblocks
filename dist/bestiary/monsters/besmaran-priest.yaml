Description:
  - >-
    Priests of Besmara are common fixtures on pirate vessels sailing the
    Shackles, simultaneously serving as healers and spiritual guides for
    comrades who often have no time for religion until death is already grinning
    in their faces. While clerics of Besmara often end up captaining ships of
    their own, they usually spend most of their pirating careers as first mates
    or ship's surgeons.
  - >-
    When not needed to confront a more immediate peril, a cleric of Besmara sees
    to the health of the crew, purifying spoiled food and water, healing the
    inevitable injuries sailors acquire in the course of their duties, or curing
    crew members of the diseases so widespread in the tropics and the sordid
    brothels that are a staple of every seaside town. If these duties spare her
    any time, a Besmaran priest goes out of her way to assist others in their
    tasks onboard and learn everything there is to know about running a ship and
    crew, for there is no telling what duties will be required aboard Besmara's
    own Seawraith should the cleric earn a coveted berth in the afterlife. In
    addition, every priest of Besmara is expected to make a pilgrimage to the
    mysterious island called Besmara's Throne at least once in her life, and
    shipmates greeting a cleric upon her return are often struck by the renewed
    fervor with which she sets about her tasks.
