  - name: Invisible in Light (Su)
    description: >-
      In bright light, a hellcat has natural invisibility. In normal light, a
      hellcat has partial concealment (20% miss chance). In dim light, it has no
      concealment. In darkness, a hellcat's flickering glow limits it to partial
      concealment, unless the darkness is magical in nature.
Description:
  - >-
    The hellcat is a devious predator native to the fiery pits of Hell. While
    the hellcat is not a devil itself, it often acts as a guardian or mount for
    devils.
  - >-
    Some might assume that hellcats serve devils as pets, but since hellcats are
    as intelligent as humans, they take offense to the idea that they might be
    anyone's pet.
  - >-
    On its own, a hellcat prefers to spend its time hunting and stalking prey.
    While the hellcat, as an outsider, need not eat to survive, it does enjoy
    eating for pleasure, often leaving significant portions of its kills behind
    for others to find. A hellcat that enters into an alliance with a devil is
    often used as a sort of hunter as a result. Human mortals can use spells
    like planar ally or planar binding to conjure hellcats for similar purposes.
    Those who do so are well advised to treat the hellcat with respect, for
    should any master prove too haughty with his hellcat or treat it as a dumb
    animal, the hellcat nurtures a lasting grudge. In such instances, the
    hellcat goes to great lengths to plan and coordinate revenge on the
    spellcaster, hoping to satisfy its own pride and to provide a lesson and
    example to all those who would deal with their kind.
  - >-
    Though incapable of speech themselves, hellcats understand the Infernal
    tongue of their home plane, and can communicate by telepathy with any
    creature capable of speech. Hellcats are quick to retreat if they are
    clearly overmatched or up against foes they cannot reach, but they never
    forget prey that escapes them, and will often track potential victims and
    try to lead allies (including other hellcats) to them in order to make
    coordinated attacks or ambushes.
  - >-
    The hellcat is only clearly visible in dim light, at these times appearing
    as a skeletal dire tiger with hellish flames burning and flickering along
    the surface of its bones.
  - >-
    Despite this eerie appearance, the hellcat is neither undead nor an
    elemental creature. The "fires" are actually its blood coursing through
    transparent flesh. In bright light, the hellcat's entire body fades away
    into obscurity, while in darkness its glowing blood is muted.
  - >-
    Hellcats are as large as tigers, measuring 9 feet long and weighing 900
    pounds.
