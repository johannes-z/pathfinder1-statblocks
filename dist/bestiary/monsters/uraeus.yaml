Description:
  - >-
    Said to be children of the river goddess Wadjet, uraeuses are known
    throughout the Sphinx Basin as benevolent guardians of the River Sphinx and
    its conf luences and tributaries. They are fierce opponents of any who would
    dare threaten the rivers' ability to serve as travel routes, and never
    hesitate to harry individuals whose efforts are opposed to the goals of
    Wadjet and her worshipers, as well as anyone whose inf luence risks leading
    the rulers of Osirion into folly. Uraeuses sometimes band together in large
    nests to destroy the massive and terrible hetkoshus (see page 54) that
    occasionally threaten the Sphinx and its tributaries, though such attacks
    are met with mixed success. When a nest of uraeuses is too small to handle a
    hetkoshu or other waterway threat, they may seek aid from loyal river
    clerics of Wadjet (see page 62) or renowned Osirian adventurers who respect
    the pharaoh and the old ways. Uraeuses often hunt other dangerous prey such
    as asps, as well, and Osirians frequently tell stories of uraeuses saving
    children from venomous snakes, gars, and even hippopotamuses. In Ancient
    Osirion, some legends claim that during times of unusual danger, Wadjet sent
    throngs of uraeuses to warn the pharaoh of advisors or spies who would lead
    him to folly.

    In addition to their duties as river protectors, uraeuses accept offerings
    to Wadjet from her faithful, including gifts of incense, spices, gold, and
    other tithings. In exchange, they teach Wadjet's flock the wisdom of the
    river and how to best serve Osirian society and its leaders. Patience,
    industry, and a willingness to listen to others are among the qualities they
    seek to instill in supplicants who seek them out. Uraeuses are always
    vigilant in their search for potential leaders for their goddess's church,
    and they keep a keen eye out for supplicants who may possess the gift of the
    river or who would otherwise serve as useful servants for their mother
    goddess.
