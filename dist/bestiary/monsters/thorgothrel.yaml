SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Atavistic Manipulation (Su)
    description: >-
      A thorgothrel can alter a target's genetic structure to induce rapid
      evolutionary regression by dealing Intelligence bleed damage with its slam
      attacks. As the target mentally regresses, it also becomes more feral and
      violent. A target that has taken at least 4 points of Intelligence damage
      from a thorgothrel gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. If a
      thorgothrel spends an hour experimenting on a target rendered unconscious
      due to Intelligence damage, it can make this regression permanent.
      Thereafter, the target's Intelligence score is reduced to 1. This
      regression can be reversed only with heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish.
      At the GM's discretion, the target might change in additional ways to
      reflect its atavistic regression.
  - name: Force Field (Ex)
    description: >-
      A thorgothrel with a silver armature is sheathed in a thin layer of
      shimmering energy that grants 40 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a
      thorgothrel with an active force field is reduced from these hit points
      first. As long as the force field is active, the thorgothrel is immune to
      critical hits. A thorgothrel's force field has fast healing 10, but once
      its hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and can only
      be reactivated if the thorgothrel spends a full-round action and succeeds
      at a DC 15 Disable Device check. If successful, the force field
      reactivates with 1 hit point.
  - name: Force Ray (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a thorgothrel can lose 5 hit points from its force
      field (if it has that many or more remaining) in order to fire a ray of
      force at any target within 100 feet. The ray is a ranged touch attack that
      deals 10d6 points of force damage.
  - name: Poisonous Sublimation (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a thorgothrel without an active force field is in a region with
      breathable atmosphere, it beings to evaporate into a poisonous mist. The
      thorgothrel takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round at the
      beginning of its turn, and the mist expands to fill a 20-foot radius. Any
      living creature in the mist with 6 or fewer HD must succeed at a DC 17
      Fortitude save or be slain. A creature with more than 6 HD takes 1d4
      points of Constitution damage each round while in the mist (Fortitude
      half). A moderate wind disperses the mist in 4 rounds; a strong wind
      disperses the mist in 1 round. This is a poison effect, and the save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Thorgothrels are a spacefaring race of aggressive genetic manipulators. In
    their natural form, thorgothrels are blobs of protoplasm 12 feet in diameter
    that move with awkward undulation. Thorgothrels can extrude pseudopods in
    order to manipulate objects and form simple tools. These pseudopods excrete
    a complex cocktail of chemicals that can force changes to a victim's
    underlying genetic structure.
  - >-
    Weighed down by Golarion's gravity and quick to sublimate into poisonous
    vapor in the atmosphere, thorgothrels find Golarion (and similar planets)
    inherently inimical. A thorgothrel can move about on Golarion only by
    wrapping its body around a frame of silver rods that provides inner support
    and encases the creature in a resilient force field barrier. Despite the
    hazard Golarion's atmosphere poses to these alien creatures, the planet's
    staggering diversity of life presents a veritable cornucopia of beings upon
    which they can perform their genetic experimentations, inching closer to
    their goal of returning all creatures to a primeval, atavistic state.
  - >-
    The silver armature largely determines the exact size of a thorgothrel, but
    a typical thorgothrel stands around 11 feet tall and weighs about 900 lbs.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Hailing from a distant planet with a radically different environment,
    thorgothrels don't fit into Golarion's ecosystem. The environment on
    Golarion is deadly to this spacefaring race, as the planet's comparatively
    low
  - >-
    air pressure causes them to vaporize when exposed to it. Thorgothrels on
    Golarion combat this by remaining continually sheathed in a protective force
    field to avoid fatal dematerialization. Even in the best of conditions, a
    thorgothrel moves slowly. On Golarion, it must wrap its protoplasmic form
    around an artificial skeleton in order to move at a speed greater than a
    crawl. Thorgothrel mathematics are based on a ternary system, which is ref
    lected in their armatures usually having three legs and three arms radially
    placed around a central spine.
  - >-
    Thorgothrels feed on electrical currents and certain metals. The armatures
    thorgothrels create in order to provide mobility are made of
    electromagnetically charged and refined silver, and thus contain all of the
    nutrients the creatures need to survive for several months. Without an
    armature, a thorgothrel requires an ounce of silver per week to survive.
    Thorgothrels don't require true sleep, and the torpor they enter in the long
    years of travel between planets in their strange ships provides them with
    sufficient rest to remain active for months at a time.
  - >-
    Thorgothrels communicate telepathically, and consider verbal communication
    to be the sort of anathema that drives their work toward retrogressive
    development.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    The thorgothrel race were once humanoids. The greatest of their scientists
    and philosophers concluded that evolutionary advancement was a danger to the
    universe as a whole, and that life in its most primitive state was safest
    for all creatures. The thorgothrels began a great spacefaring crusade to
    subjugate other planets and force regressive evolution on the planets'
    denizens via genetic manipulation. Thorgothrels take pride in devolving
    entire planets into primitive life forms, and slaughter those races that put
    up too much of a struggle against their "great work."
  - >-
    As the thorgothrels "improved" world after world, they also manipulated
    their own genes. While maintaining their intelligence and skill at genetic
    manipulation, the race regressed its form to that of sentient blobs of
    protoplasm. Thorgothrels buttress the weaknesses of these new bodies, such
    as low mobility, with technological solutions. Although silver armatures and
    defensive force fields are the most common artifacts of thorgothrel science,
    rumors from other worlds tell of thorgothrels that occupy gargantuan walking
    machines or psychic field projectors powerful enough to render entire cities
    docile.
  - >-
    Their great crusade has caused the once numerous thorgothrel race to
    dwindle, but the race's fervor to enforce regression still continues on many
    far-f lung planets. A few decades ago, thorgothrel explorers discovered
    Golarion and were staggered by the abundance of advanced life found on this
    world. However, Golarion's unfavorable environment and great distance from
    the thorgothrels' homeworld has so far stymied a full-scale assault. To
    date, only a few daring adventurer-geneticists have come to Golarion. To
    avoid attracting wide public attention, these thorgothrels pursue their
    regression experiments in isolated locations, such as lonely wastelands,
    border outposts, or hidden valleys. Thorgothrels carefully dissect failed
    experiments in order to hone their craft, but usually set successfully
    regressed victims free. Rumors of remote areas where animals or people have
    suddenly "gone wild" or "turned feral" may indicate a thorgothrel's
    presence.
  - >-
    Thorgothrels are arrogant and prone to overconfidence. Most thorgothrels
    encountered on Golarion have visited dozens of other worlds, and they
    consider even the most advanced of Golarion's creatures to be evolutionary
    mistakes that must be corrected or exterminated. This gives thorgothrels
    little reason to communicate with other races, which in turn feeds into
    their intellectual and philosophical mandate to act however they see fit.
