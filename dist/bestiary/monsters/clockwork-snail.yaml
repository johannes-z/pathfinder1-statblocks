SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Eidite Trail (Ex)
    description: >-
      A clockwork snail can release a noxious trail of poisonous ooze, coating
      any surface it treads upon with viscous liquid eidite. Any square that the
      clockwork snail moves through while this ability is active is covered in a
      nonmagical web effect that acts in all ways as the spell (DC 16 negates),
      but also has a chance of infecting whoever touches it with eidite sickness
      (see page 19). A clockwork snail can activate or deactivate this ability
      as a swift action, and can cover a total of 40 squares per day, though
      these squares need not be consecutive. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Improved Charge (Ex)
    description: >-
      A clockwork snail excels at charging into enemies; it can move up to
      triple its speed when using the charge action, and ignores any effects of
      difficult terrain while charging.
  - name: Tracks (Ex)
    description: >-
      A clockwork snail's tracks allow it to climb even sheer surfaces with
      ease, granting it a +16 racial bonus on Climb checks instead of the usual
      +8 for having a climb speed, and it can make attacks with its upper body
      normally even while climbing.
Description:
  - >-
    Although their upper bodies resemble the clockwork soldiers from which their
    forms were no doubt inspired, these mechanical monstrosities are in fact a
    horrific blend of gastropod and clockwork, fusing the cruelest aspects of
    calculated war machinery and the foul influence of eidite.
  - A clockwork snail is 12 feet tall and weighs 2,000 pounds.
  - >-
    Construction The creator of a clockwork snail must start with crafted
