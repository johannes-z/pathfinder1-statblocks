    description: >-
      A thorny's body is covered with sharp wooden thorns. Any creature
      attacking a thorny with a non-reach melee weapon or with natural attacks
      takes 1d4+2 points of piercing damage from the thorny's sharp thorns. A
      creature that grapples with a thorny takes this same damage each round.
Description:
  - >-
    Thornies are the pets and companions of the vegepygmies. They are rarely
    encountered outside of a vegepygmy tribe or hunting party.
  - Vegepygmies often use them to hunt prey.
  - >-
    Thornies reproduce by planting egg-like seeds (that the female lays) in the
    ground. Three to six months later, a small tree sprouts, buds, and from
    these buds are born the thornies. An average thorny tree is capable of
    producing 1d6+4 thornies. The tree dies once it buds and the thornies
    "hatch." Credit The Thorny originally appeared in the First Edition module
