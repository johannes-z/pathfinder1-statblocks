SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cold Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      The touch of an asrai is supernaturally cold. All damage dealt from an
      asrai's natural attacks is cold damage. This ability is constant, but the
      asrai can suppress or resume it at will as a free action.
  - name: Water Dependent (Su)
    description: >-
      An asrai can survive on land for 1 hour per 2 points of Constitution.
      After that, it begins to suffocate. Lost Constitution points are
      immediately restored if the asrai returns to the water. If its
      Constitution reaches 0 it dies, collapsing into a puddle of water.
Description:
  - >-
    Asrai dwell in crystal clear lakes, ponds, and rivers. They can be found in
    any large body of water far from civilized lands. Most asrai spend their
    time frolicking and playing in the lake they call home, dancing among the
    fish and playfully splashing the various woodland creatures that venture
    near the water for a drink. Asrai are protective of their aquatic homes,
    however, and attack en masse any foolish human so oafish as to not ask their
    permission to enter the water.
  - >-
    Asrai spend most of their time in the water, preferring not to touch land if
    possible. Though they can survive on land for a short amount of time, they
    prefer not to risk such ventures, so any encounter with an asrai is almost
    always in the water. Asrai make their homes in giant seashells or natural
    underwater caves. These homes are usually concealed under a canopy of
    aquatic plants, algae, and seaweed so potential enemies cannot easily find
    them.
  - >-
    Asrai are closely related to pixies and thought to be a relative, though
    they do not possess wings. Male asrai are thought to exist, though none have
    ever been encountered.
  - >-
    An asrai only engages in combat if its body of water is threatened, or if
    any intelligent creature other than a fey enters the water without
    permission.
  - >-
    Once in combat, an asrai prefers to attack with its magic, using its
    chilling touch only as a last resort. If it faces overwhelming odds, an
    asrai seeks escape, often using its fog cloud or obscuring mist ability to
    cover its exit.
