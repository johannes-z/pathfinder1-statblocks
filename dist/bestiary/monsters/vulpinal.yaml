SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Calm Emotions Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A vulpinal's aura acts like a calm emotions spell with a radius of 30
      feet. Any creature entering this area must make a Will save (DC 16) to
      resist the effect. A creature that makes its save is immune to that
      vulpinal's aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Among the smallest of the agathions, vulpinals tend to be the most outspoken
    and friendly of their kind, and also the most far-ranging across the planes.
    A vulpinal looks like a humanoid fox, often with brilliantly colored fur
    (usually red or red-brown, though silver is not uncommon) and a tail as long
    as its height. As the bards and sages of the agathions, they dress in
    functional clothing, typically embellishing a single article to show their
    creativity and personality. Most appear to be adults, though others look
    more like fox kits (with shorter stature and larger eyes) while some look
    much older (leaner, with gray fur on the muzzle, chest, and tail). Their
    hands are humanoid in shape, with tiny clawed fingers.
  - >-
    A typical vulpinal prefers a life of solitary travel, though they have been
    known to pair up or travel in groups if they find like-minded individuals
    who have much to teach and share. They are particularly fond of lillends,
    and these winged azatas can easily carry the child-sized vulpinals, giving
    vulpinals many opportunities to share stories. Indeed, for a vulpinal, there
    are few greater pleasures than sharing their knowledge-acting as sages of
    the planes, teaching songs and dances from exotic places, and composing
    poems about beautiful places in the natural world. Though they are gentle by
    nature, they fight to defend beauty, especially if their magic can bolster
    the more martial celestial races.
  - A vulpinal stands about 3 feet in height and weighs 50 pounds.
