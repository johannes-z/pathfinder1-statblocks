  blue skin, small fangs, and tiny dark horns that protrude above its
  crimson-colored eyes.
Group: Demon
Source: Tome of Horrors Complete
Description:
  - When an incubus mates with a human female, the offspring is a cambion.
  - >-
    Cambions, unlike their "sisters" the alu-demons, are always chaotic evil and
    care little for anyone or anything but their own well-being. They are
    selfish, self-centered, and egotistical. Cambions hate humans and are often
    employed as assassins. Cambions are always male.
  - >-
    Much like alu-demons, cambions are often sent to the Material Plane to
    seduce mortals or tempt them in some way.
  - The typical cambion stands 6 or 7 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds or more.
  - >-
    Cambions are deadly in combat, attacking relentlessly until their opponents
    are dead, often employing various poisons in battle to end the fight
    quickly. If combat goes against it, a cambion retreats, but never forgets
    the opponent that bested him. The cambion waits for the next opportunity to
    present itself so it might exact revenge.
