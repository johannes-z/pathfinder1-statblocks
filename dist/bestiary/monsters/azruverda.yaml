SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid Spit (Ex)
    description: >-
      An azruverda can spit a stream of acid at a target within 60 feet as a
      ranged touch attack that deals 10d6 points of acid damage.
  - name: Vermin Master (Su)
    description: >-
      An azruverda can mentally control to up to 32 HD (twice the azruverda's
      racial Hit Dice) of vermin at any one time through a combination of
      supernatural pheromones and magical manipulation. To control a vermin, the
      azruverda must be able to see it, and it must be within 120 feet.
      Attempting to control a vermin is a standard action-the vermin can resist
      this attempt with a DC 25 Will save. If the vermin fails this save, the
      azruverda can issue a simple mental command like "fight," "come here," "go
      there," or "stand still" as a swift action. Though composed of thousands
      of individuals, vermin with the swarm subtype are vulnerable to this
      ability as well. An azruverda can release a creature from this control as
      a free action. Vermin affected by this ability act normally unless an
      azruverda is actively controlling it, but never attack their master
      azruverda. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Although repulsive in shape, these enormous, human-faced insectoid creatures
    are generally peaceful and serene. Left to its own devices, an azruverda is
    typically content to cultivate fungal gardens in deep underground
    sanctuaries. These gardens are beautiful to behold- masterful combinations
    of fungi, rocks, and other objects arranged in an artistic manner. Although
    generally solitary, azruverdas collaborate when a threat intrudes upon one
    of their underground homes.
  - >-
    Azruverdas stand 16 feet tall on their many legs and weigh close to 4,000
    pounds.
