Description:
  - >-
    A thundershrike is an eagle-like raptor, perhaps in some way related to
    rocs, with a wingspan of upwards of 40 feet. Riding the winds with its
    massive wings spread wide, the thundershrike is thought by some cultures to
    be a herald of the gods of the thunderstorms. Thundershrikes are often found
    in the company of storm giants.
  - >-
    Thundershrikes get their name from their habit of taking to the air during
    powerful storms. Wind and rain follow the wings of a thundershrike.
  - >-
    Often worshipped by barbarians and other wilderness dwellers, the
    thundershrikes are a proud species that view all that they survey as their
    territory. Although they keep their nests in isolated aeries in the high
    mountains, thundershrikes can range several hundred miles in search of food.
  - >-
    Thundershrikes mate for life, and females usually lay a clutch of 2d4 eggs
    in the spring. The eggs hatch in the late summer during the height of the
    storm season. Young remain in the nest for several months before venturing
    out on their own in the world.
  - >-
    Unless it is on the hunt, a thundershrike is content to ride the winds and
    generally leave other creatures alone. If hunting, the thundershrike attacks
    any creature of Large or smaller size that appears tasty.
  - >-
    A thundershrike opens combat with its lightning bolts before swooping or
    diving at a foe. It rarely lands during melee, preferring to attack from the
    air, using its spell-like abilities, and its snatch and hover to pick up and
    separate multiple foes. Female or mated thundershrikes will fight to the
    death to defend their nest or young.
