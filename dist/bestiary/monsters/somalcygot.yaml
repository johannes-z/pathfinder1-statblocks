Description_Visual: >-
  A pair of mandibles surrounds the vertical, tooth-filled maw of this giant,
  multi-eyed flatworm. Four long antennae stretch from its face, twitching and
  flailing rapidly. Along its spiny, chitinous body emerge four tentacles,
  grasping in all directions.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      Every 1d4 rounds, a somalcygot can spit a 60-foot line of acid that deals
      6d6 points of acid damage and an additional 3d6 points of acid damage the
      following round. A successful DC 26 Reflex save halves the initial damage
      and negates all ongoing damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Resistant Evolution (Su)
    description: >-
      Somalcygots have evolved in the harsh, unforgiving vacuum of space and
      developed fortified resistances to the myriad threats found in their
      environment, granting them a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws.
Description:
  - >-
    Somalcygots are incredibly territorial; each claims roughly a mile-radius
    patch of desolate lunar surface as its chosen hunting ground, and only
    enters another's territory to mate. In order to preserve energy between
    meals, a somalcygot enters a trancelike hibernation during which it burrows
    in circles beneath the moon's surface within its territory with unthinking
    repetition. When it detects another creature nearby, the somalcygot awakens
    and enters a blood frenzy to capitalize on the rare meal, fighting
    relentlessly until the prey either is dead or escapes its territory. Only
    rarely do somalcygots pursue prey beyond the boundaries of their claimed
    hunting grounds, a behavior that serves both to preserve energy and to avoid
    needless conflict with other somalcygots that claim neighboring regions.
  - A typical adult somalcygot is 16 feet long and weighs 1,500 pounds.
