SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Captivating Lure (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a kelpie can use a powerful mental attack to lure in a
      single creature within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 16 Will saving
      throw or become captivated by the kelpie, thinking it is a desirable woman
      in mortal danger or (if in hippocampus or horse form) a valuable steed. A
      victim under the effects of the captivating lure moves toward the kelpie
      using the most direct means available. If the path leads it into a
      dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives
      a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril; the
      victim does not consider water a dangerous area, and will enter the water
      even if it cannot swim or breathe. A captivated creature can take no
      actions other than to move toward the kelpie and defend itself, even if it
      is drowning. A victim within 5 feet of the kelpie simply stands and offers
      no resistance to its attacks. This effect continues as long as the kelpie
      is alive and the victim is within 1 mile of the kelpie. This is a
      mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A kelpie is a deadly shapechanging predator that, in its natural form,
    appears as a hideous combination of emaciated horse and sickly humanoid,
    with slimy, transparent skin and long, stringy hair. Its face is long and
    equine, with a mouth filled with jagged teeth.
  - >-
    Few, however, ever see a kelpie in its true form, for kelpies almost always
    encounter other creatures while in disguise as a humanoid, horse, or
    hippocampus, reverting to their true form only after their targets have
    drowned so that they can feast on their victims, leaving behind only the
    heart and liver (as both of these organs are distasteful to most kelpies).
  - >-
    Kelpies can be found in saltwater and freshwater environments, including
    fens, rivers, swamps, and underground pools and lakes. Communities living
    near kelpie lairs believe that folk who die on the water or are killed by a
    kelpie become kelpies themselves.
  - >-
    Kelpies may serve as steeds for aquatic fey or other water monsters while in
    their hippocampus forms, sometimes without their riders ever knowing the
    truth of the steed's sinister nature.
  - A typical kelpie is 6 feet tall and weighs 170 pounds.
