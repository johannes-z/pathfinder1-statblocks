SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Consume Memory (Su)
    description: >-
      When a veiled master bites a creature, it consumes some of that creature's
      memories. The creature bitten must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or
      gain one negative level. A veiled master heals 5 points of damage each
      time it grants a negative level in this way, and also learns some of the
      target creature's memories (subject to the GM's discretion). This is a
      mind-affecting effect. A veiled master can suppress this ability as a free
      action. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Delayed Suggestion (Sp)
    description: >-
      Whenever a veiled master successfully uses dominate person or dominate
      monster on a creature, it can also implant a delayed suggestion that
      triggers when dominate effect ends. Typically, this suggestion (which
      functions as a spell-like ability, CL 20th, Will DC 19 negates) is for the
      previously dominated creature to seek out the veiled master again and
      submit to a new domination attempt, but sometimes, a veiled master
      implants other suggestions (such as a suggestion to attack the first
      person it sees).
  - name: Mucus Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      While underwater, a veiled master exudes a cloud of transparent slime in a
      30-foot-radius spread. All creatures in this area must succeed at a DC 26
      Fortitude save each round or lose the ability to breathe air (but gain the
      ability to breathe water) for 24 hours. Renewed contact with this mucus
      cloud and failing another save extends the effect for another 24 hours.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Runemastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A veiled master is particularly skilled at casting spells that create
      magical writing, such as explosive runes, secret page, or any spell with
      the word "symbol" in its name. It never requires material components or
      focus components when casting such spells, and the save DC of any of these
      spells increases by 1. A veiled master's symbol spells are difficult to
      disarm-the Disable Device DC for these symbols increases by 2.
  - name: Slime (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature hit by any of a veiled master's bite or claw attacks must
      succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or have its skin and flesh transform
      into a clear, slimy membrane over the course of 1d4 rounds. The creature's
      new "flesh" is soft and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as
      long as the condition persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist,
      it dries quickly and the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10
      minutes. Remove disease and similar effects can restore an afflicted
      creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this
      attack. The save DC is Constitution-based. Spells A veiled master can cast
      spells as a 12th-level sorcerer.
  - name: Swift Transformation (Su)
    description: A veiled master can use its change shape ability as a swift action.
  - name: Thoughtlance (Su)
    description: >-
      Four of a veiled master's tentacles end in glowing spheres of light. These
      spheres deal 2d6 points of electricity damage on a touch attack, and also
      blast a creature's mind with waves of mental energy-a creature touched by
      one of these tentacles (regardless of whether the touch deals electricity
      damage) must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or be staggered for 1 round.
      Additional touches increase the duration by 1 round. While a creature is
      staggered in this manner, it must make concentration checks to cast spells
      as if it were experiencing extremely violent motion while casting (DC = 20
      + spell level). The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The aboleths are among the oldest of Golarion's denizens, creatures that can
    trace back their presence in the deepest reaches of the world's oceans to
    times far before humanity came to dwell upon the globe- or before even most
    deities themselves turned their attentions to this tiny sphere of water and
    stone. In those ancient times, elder forces and eldritch entities knew of
    the world. While they were not gods as are known today, even they were
    dismissed and ignored by the aboleth race, for the aboleths knew that what
    the gods could accomplish, so could they, given time. And the aboleths have
    always had time.
  - >-
    During the era of ancient Azlant, when the aboleths manipulated humanity
    like puppets, some of their kind walked among their pets in disguise,
    veiling themselves with magic to appear as humanoids. These were the veiled
    masters, and if one were to make the foolish attempt at imposing human
    constructions on this alien race, the veiled masters would be considered the
    nobility among aboleth-kind. In truth, while the aboleths do treat the
    veiled masters with utmost respect and defer to their decisions, they are
    not regarded as the rulers of the race- even stranger and more dangerous
    entities rule over the veiled masters in the deepest trenches below the sea.
  - >-
    Aboleths are without a doubt skilled at domination and illusion, but the
    veiled masters are the true experts of the arcane. It is they who engineered
    the deceptions and manipulations of ancient Azlant's culture. Their hidden
    gifts and subtle coaxings did much to encourage humanity's first rise to
    glory in that age, and many of Azlant's nations had veiled masters walking
    among them, whispering into their leaders' ears. The people
  - >-
    knew the veiled masters as powerful wizards, and there were murmurs that the
    mysterious cabal was more than human, but few suspected the truth for very
    long. The veiled masters handled such suspicions by doing violence to the
    bodies and minds of those who proved too curious. It was the veiled masters
    who first learned of Azlant's growing hubris-of their beliefs that they were
    greater than their patrons. At first, their punishments were minor, yet to
    the veiled masters' surprise and frustration, these acts only strengthened
    humanity's resolve. In the end, Earthfall was the answer, and as Azlant sank
    below the waves, the veiled masters retreated to the depths as well, content
    for now that the devastation above would serve as a lesson that would never
    be forgotten.
  - >-
    Today, the veiled masters live on. They walk among the humanoid races again,
    watching and waiting. The time to teach a new lesson draws ever closer.
