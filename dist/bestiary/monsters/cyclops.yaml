  A single huge eye stares from the forehead of this nine-foot-tall giant. Below

  - name: Flash of Insight (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as an immediate action, a cyclops can peer into an occluded
      visual spectrum of possible futures, gaining insight that allows it to
      select the exact result of one die roll before the roll is made. This
      effect can alter an action taken by the cyclops only, and cannot be
      applied to the rolls of others.
Description:
  - >-
    Many thousands of years ago, the solemn cyclopes ruled vast kingdoms, yet
    today their glories are long forgotten. What few cyclopes survive seldom
    aspire higher than protecting their lairs and seeking out their next meals.
    This latter task occupies a great deal of their focus, for the monstrous
    appetites and vacuous hunger of the cyclopes control the race's destiny and
    may have led to their original downfall so long ago. The average cyclops
    stands 9 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. Both males and females are almost
    completely bald, with stringy patches of dark hair occasionally hanging down
    from above the ears. A bushy, expressive brow couples with a cyclops's
    massive eye to make the creature's attitude easily known. Cyclopean history
    is a vanishing thing inscribed on the crumbling walls of vine-choked lost
    cities that fell long before even the rise of the elves, when dragons and
    giants ruled a landscape unspoiled by the petty ephemeral races that rule
    today. Because things have fallen so far, a given cyclops is less likely to
    know the near-mythic triumphs of lost ages than even a semi-educated human.
    Ancient records, the oral traditions of other giantish races, and the
    scattered accounts of tribal natives of the southern jungles speak of much
    larger, more primal "great cyclopes," imposing titans with shaggy legs and a
    massive horn above an inquisitive eye. These creatures are thought to have
    been either the leaders or the war beasts of the ancient race, and modern
    cyclopes honor them as elusive, destructive living gods.
