Description_Visual: >-
  Similar in many respects to their swamp-loving kin, river trolls prefer a less
  slimy existence, and prefer to live in forested regions near rivers and
  streams, or under bridges.

Description:
  - >-
    River trolls patrol the banks of large rivers, looking to hunt the forest
    creatures that use the river for sustenance. Very rarely, the river trolls
    are indigent enough to use crude nets or spears to harvest fish and other
    aquatic foods from the river itself.
  - >-
    River trolls are more frequently found as a group, as they are somewhat
    smaller than a normal troll (those only other trolls really notice this).
    They will work together with those of their own kind, but not with other
    common trolls.
  - >-
    River trolls are adept swimmers, and like to lurk underwater for prey near
    bridges, if possible.
