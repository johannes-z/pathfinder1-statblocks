Description_Visual: >-
  This massive creature appears to be a gigantic frog no less than 60 feet long.
  Its body is covered in warts and sores, and each oozes putrid, yellowish
  mucus. Its eyes are red and glow with an inherent evil. The creature's massive
  mouth sports rows of sharpened teeth, each at least as long as a sword.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acidic Hide (Ex)
    description: >-
      Tsathogga's demonic form constantly oozes and drips acid. Creatures
      attacking Tsathogga unarmed or with natural weapons take 2d8 points of
      acid damage each time one of their attacks hits. Any weapon striking
      Tsathogga's acidic body likewise takes acid damage.
  - name: Blasphemous Croak (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, Tsathogga can unleash a piercing croak that affects
      all non-evil creatures within a 100-foot radius as if by a blasphemy spell
      (CL 20th). There is no save against the effects.
  - name: Seeping Darkness (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, Tsathogga can billow forth a cloud of thick, dark fog
      from his skin. This fog spreads to fill a 50-foot radius, 50 feet high.
      The darkness generated by the cloud nullifies nonmagical lights and
      magical lights of 5th level or lower within the area. Furthermore, all
      creatures in the area gain concealment, including those that can normally
      see in such darkness, tough Tsathogga is able to see normally in it. Light
      descriptor spells of 5th level or lower (such as daylight, dancing lights,
      and light) are incapable of brightening the area. This cloud remains for
      10 minutes before dispersing. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud
      in 4 rounds; a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round.
      Tsathogga cannot use this ability underwater. Once the cloud disperses,
      Tsathogga can issue a new one if he desires.
Description:
  - >-
    This foul frog-demon cares less about the machinations of men and power than
    he does about obliterating light and life with the slow oozing sickness and
    decay that he represents. He is the viscous dark evil bubbling up from
    beneath the surface, the foul corruption at the heart of the earth.
    Tsathogga makes his home on both Tarterus and the Abyss, spending equal
    amounts of time in both places. His lair is a vast swamp of filth deposited
    by the River Styx as it flows between the two planes. Tsathogga's main form
    is of a colossally-bloated humanoid frog with spindly, elongated limbs and
    fingers. His corpulent body exudes all manner of foul oils and fluids, which
    leak into the vile swamp in which he lies. He has positioned himself so that
    all of the slime and filth from the River Styx feeds into his gaping, toothy
    maw. He rarely moves and rarely speaks other than to emit an unintelligible
    shrieking. Tsathogga thoughtlessly commands a host of evil creatures,
    notably his own vile frog race, the tsathar (see that entry in this book).
    Tsathogga is 60 feet long and 40 feet tall. He weighs about 200 tons.
    Tsathogga prefers to avoid direct combat simply because he usually has
    better things to do than waste time killing the latest group of would-be
    demon killers. If threatened or attacked, he usually summons his minions to
    battle his opponents. If Tsathogga does enter combat, he almost always
    begins by striking the nearest opponent with his tongue, pulling that foe in
    and swallowing him. If he is near the muck and filth that permeates his home
    plane, he likes to dive or bury himself underneath it so if a swallowed
    opponent does manage to cut his way out of Tsathogga's gullet, he usually
    drowns or suffocates before he sees daylight again. Servants of Tsathogga
    Followers of Tsathogga are the tsathar and some few evil and vile humans or
    giants. He has few other worshippers, though it is rumored that an evil cult
    of sahuagin worships him on the Material Plane. Devout followers of
    Tsathogga are called Lords of the Gaping Maw and must sign a pact of evil
    with Tsathogga. Lords of the Gaping Maw receive spells from Tsathogga and
    are granted access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Destruction,
    Evil, and Water. Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Bill Webb.
