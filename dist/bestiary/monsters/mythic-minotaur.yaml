Description:
  - >-
    A mythic minotaur is but one or two generations removed from the original
    curse-born minotaurs that founded their race. Once created to punish to
    those who disobey or circumvent the orders of the gods, they use their
    innate magic to imprison, stalk, and consume humanoids-especially the
    descendants of the royal line whose blasphemy inspired the creation of this
    new race. Some mythic minotaurs are worshiped as demigods by primitive or
    fear-stricken humanoids, and accept sacrifices of young men and women to
    sate their hunger. They usually have custom armor and weapons appropriate
    for their large, inhuman frames, offered as gifts by worshipers or made by
    enslaved blacksmiths.
