Description_Visual: >-
  The bloated white segments of a maggot's body erupt in a torso of mixed
  feminine and insectile features. Pale humanoid skin and carapace meld together
  beneath a face with segmented eyes and mandibles chittering a song of
  discordant alien clicks and hisses, as overlong carapace claws weave cords of
  thick webbing between them.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Drag (Ex)
    description: >-
      A weaverworm that successfully entangles a victim with its web attack can
      retract the web, dragging the victim into its clutches. Each round, the
      entangled victim can attempt a CMD check to escape. Upon a failed check,
      the weaverworm forcibly drags its victim 20 feet toward it.
  - name: Paralytic Nails (Ex)
    description: >-
      A weaverworm's nails secrete a potent paralytic agent. Any creature
      damaged by its claw attacks must make a DC 19 Fortitude save or be
      paralyzed for 1 round. In addition, the weaverworm's nails break off in
      the bodies of those it paralyzes. A paralyzed creature must make another
      save to avoid being paralyzed again at the beginning of its round, doing
      so every round until the nail is removed as a full-round action. A
      weaverworm's nail can be removed with either a DC 12 Strength check, which
      removes the nail and deals 1d4 points of damage to the victim, or a DC 14
      Heal check, which deals no damage. A weaverworm's paralytic nails don't
      affect any creature that is immune to poison. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Weaver's
  - name: Song (Su)
    description: >-
      A weaverworm can play its webs like a grotesque musical instrument. When
      doing so, all nonweaverworms within 300 feet must make DC 18 Will saves.
      Those who make their saves are unaffected. Those who fail are fascinated,
      and on their turn, move toward the weaverworm by the most direct means
      available. If the path leads into a dangerous area, such as through fire
      or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the
      effect before moving into peril. A victim within 5 feet of the weaverworm
      simply stands and listens. This effect continues for as long as the
      weaverworm performs and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. This is a sonic
      mind-affecting charm effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the
      victim is immune to the same weaverworm's song for 24 hours. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Foul servants of the goddess of disease and gluttony, weaverworms-or simply
    "weavers," as they are often called-are terrifying abominations, combining
    the features of predatory insects, monstrously huge larvae, and deathly pale
    humanoids. Creations of Urgathoa forgotten by their cruel mistress long ago,
    these horrors seek out the dark places of the world, sowing murder and fear
    from the darkness, and all the while raising unnatural songs in praise of
    the goddess of gluttony.
  - >-
    Weaverworms typically measure 18 feet long, though the most bloated weigh
    upward of a ton.
  - >-
    Ecology A weaverworm's lower body is approximately 3 feet in diameter, and
    is divided into numerous segments that secrete a viscous film. The creature
    moves by expanding and contracting these segments, giving it an incredible
    range of motion, as well as the capability to scale surfaces with an ease
    equal to that with which they move across the ground.
  - >-
    Weaverworms are also know for their claws' deadly nails, which function more
    like the stingers or barbs of many insects than weapons alone. These nails
    contain a potent paralytic fluid that passes into the bloodstream of a
    weaverworm's victim, leaving it vulnerable to slaughter and ready for
    consumption. The nails often break off while embedded in the victim's body,
    where they continue pumping the weaverworm's toxins, filling potential meals
    with dose after dose of paralytic excretions. Occasionally, those who
    encounter a weaverworm and flee find themselves paralyzed well after they
    think they've escaped, again falling into the deadly clutches of the
    pursuing abomination.
  - >-
    The flesh of the creature's underbelly is relatively soft and slightly
    rubbery, running in shades of sickly brown flesh to pale blue. The exposed
    carapace is tougher and dotted with thousands of short bristles. Over time
    the weaverworm adjusts to match whatever environment it dwells in. The upper
    portion of the creature has a female body, but one disfigured by insectile
    traits. Such monstrous malformations vary between weavers, though all have
    deadly claws and heads with a terrible assortment of mandibles, pincers,
    spines, and segmented eyes. Typically, these appearances are similar to the
    faces of predatory insects common to the region the weaverworm inhabits,
    with spider features proving most prevalent, but the visages of horrible
    mantises and monstrous annelids also arise in warmer climates.
  - >-
    Habitat & Society Much like larger arachnids, weaverworms are chief ly
    ambush hunters. They live in solitary burrows, near or within old ruins and
    similar places that tend to attract prey. While they tend to avoid colder
    climes, they prove resilient to most extremes of weather and terrain,
    tending to choose somewhat isolated areas where their hunting goes
    unnoticed. Typically, once a weaverworm claims a burrow, she remains there
    for life. In this manner, weaverworms are largely consistent, enough so that
    they frequently catch the attention of primitive humanoids such as goblins,
    orcs, or, in particular, ettercaps who believe them the embodiment of
    various gods or fiends and pay them worship. The relationship between
    weaverworms and their worshipers tends to be brutal, as weaverworms have few
    qualms about eating worshipers who come too close.

    Origins Among the vast libraries of mysteries and ancient legends documented
    and passed on by the faithful of Pharasma is the tale of Lamia of Avalos, a
    seer of Pharasma from a distant land who blasphemed against the goddess and
    was transformed into a beastlike creature denied the judgment promised
    sentient beings in death, as were her sister sibyls. Yet this punishment
    unleashed greater terror than even the Lady of Graves might have imagined.
    Unknown to the furious goddess and her false worshipers, another divinity
    had noticed the tragic drama. Urgathoa, goddess of disease and undeath,
    watched and laughed at the terror wrought by the goddess of prophecy upon
    her vicious servants. Delighted and inspired, Urgathoa went into the world
    to wreak a similar horror.
  - >-
    The Pallid Princess searched the world over, and among her servants living
    and undead, found none who displeased her enough to curse as Pharasma had
    her priestess. So she turned her mind toward granting a rare and terrible
    blessing. Deep in a tangled forest she happened upon a brood of maggots and
    lowly worms, and in them found all she delighted in-filth and disease,
    hunger and life amid the dead. Momentarily delighted, she raised up this
    terrible swarm and molded them and gave them a single body, terrible but not
    unlike her favored daughters.
  - >-
    The result was a monster, a servant of hungers and foul dooms, part
    grotesque insect, part poisonous fanatic. And the goddess was pleased.
  - >-
    Yet Urgathoa is a fickle goddess; her momentary pleasure soon passed, and
    she left her terror in the forest, content to let it praise her, yet
    unwilling to care for its needs or safety.
  - >-
    So the weaverworm crawled through the forest, insane and terrifying, preying
    upon what she could and sowing new generations in fits of atrocity-all the
    while plucking out Urgathoa's praises upon strands of deadly webbing.
