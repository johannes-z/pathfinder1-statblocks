  - name: Phase Lurch (Su)
    description: >-
      An ectoplasmic creature has the ability to pass through walls or material
      obstacles. To use this ability, the ectoplasmic creature must begin and
      end its turn outside of whatever wall or obstacle it's moving through. An
      ectoplasmic creature cannot move through corporeal creatures with this
      ability, and its movement speed is halved while moving through a wall or
      obstacle. Any surface it moves through is coated with a thin, silvery
      mucus that lingers for 1 minute.
Description:
  - >-
    Drawn from energies of the Ethereal Plane, ectoplasm is a vile substance
    resembling thick tangles of slimy linen or dripping goo. It shapes itself
    into the form of an undead creature, creating a host for a soul unfortunate
    enough to be confined within it. The existence of an ectoplasmic being is a
    cruel one, and few souls willingly choose this painful form of undeath. An
    ectoplasmic creature is approximately the same size as the body it inhabited
    in life, though it weighs nearly twice as much, as the ropes of undead
    matter that compose its body are signif icantly heavier than most living
    flesh. Even more so than most undead beings, creatures born of ectoplasm
    live hateful existences, filled with nothing but a lust for destruction and
    suffering. They have no bodily needs and require no sustenance; the only
    thing an ectoplasmic creature feeds upon is its own hatred of the living.
    Once a spirit has passed to the afterlife, it seldom wishes to return at
    all, let alone in a disfigured ectoplasmic body. Spirits that aren't
    powerful enough to come back as ghosts or spectres sometimes return as
    ectoplasmic monsters, particularly when there are no remains of the
    creature's original body for its soul to inhabit in the form of a skeleton
    or zombie. Sometimes, ghosts and other strong undead purposefully draw upon
    ectoplasm from the ethereal realm, yearning for even more power in their
    ectoplasmic hosts. Those who suffer this sorrowful fate, by misfortune or
    choice, are usually stuck in their ectoplasmic prisons until death grants
    them sweet release from this unlife. The transition from death to
    ectoplasmic undeath is a torturous ordeal, as is retaining the horrid form
    into which the creature is reborn. Often, this persistent agony drives these
    beings beyond mad, creating within an insatiable rage akin to that
    experienced by frustrated ghosts and other haunted souls. An ectoplasmic
    creature's burning desperation and embitterment often pushes it toward
    violence: most such beings fling themselves into battle willingly, killing
    to satiate their natural hunger for the suffering of others, while
    simultaneously hoping to be killed and thus freed of their own suffering
    own. Whenever in contact with surfaces (including walls they pass through),
    ectoplasmic creatures leave a trail of a silvery substance that resembles a
    slug's mucus-a trait almost exclusive to these undead. This slippery
    secretion dries within moments, so if its encountered, there is surely such
    a creature lurking nearby. Ectoplasmic beings can inhabit any location,
    regardless of environment or climate. The horrors tend to prowl the areas in
    which they died, and rarely venture outside these areas, as though they were
    anchored there. Though these entities rarely coordinate complicated actions
    with others of their kind, they seem to do so unintentionally at times.
    Their unnatural strength makes ectoplasmic creatures formidable combatants,
    which those not familiar with fighting ectoplasmic creatures would expect by
    looking at them. Fortunately for the wary, the sticky ectoplasm that trails
    behind these undead monsters is a clear indicator of their presence, and
    most experienced clerics can identify the substance at a glance.
