IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bane (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a swift action, a svartalfar can imbue one of its weapons
      with the bane weapon special ability. It must select one creature type
      (and subtype, if choosing humanoid or outsider) when it uses this ability.
      This lasts for 1 hour. This ability only functions while the svartalfar
      wields the weapon.
  - name: Quickened Spell Strike (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a free action after hitting with a melee weapon, a
      svartalfar can cast and deliver one of the following of its spell-like
      abilities through the weapon: chill touch, corrosive touch, force punch,
      frigid touch, or ray of exhaustion. If the attack is a critical hit and
      the spell-like ability deals damage, it deals double damage.
Description:
  - >-
    The ancestors of the svartalfars were exiled from their primordial home for
    grave crimes that no fey will speak of. Fleeing to the Shadow Plane, they
    formed assassin clans, and now they hire their services to any who pay them.
    Their payment must be in secrets, bits of occult science, and obscure
    information to add to their huge, dark libraries in underground warrens
    hidden away on the Shadow Plane. Svartalfars are extremely interested in
    knowledge about the realm of the fey. Many fear the svartalfars are
    searching for a way to finally take their revenge upon those who expelled
    them. These cold, calculating killers are not swayed by whimsy or deeper
    passions. They pride themselves on their pitilessness and inability to be
    bribed or dissuaded from ending a target's life once they've been contracted
    to do so. Once an assassination is paid for, it's the duty of all the
    svartalfars of a clan or cabal to make sure it gets done. If a clan or cabal
    fails, another one will finish the job. Svartalfars seem to feel no love or
    real friendship. All of their actions are committed for practical
    reasons-political gain, procreation, or relieving boredom. Focused and
    utterly unyielding, they are considered by many to be the perfect killers,
    and their tenacity and mastery over magic and shadows are a death sentence
    for anyone who has been marked as their quarry.
