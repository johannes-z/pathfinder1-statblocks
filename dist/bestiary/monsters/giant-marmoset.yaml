Description:
  - >-
    Giant marmosets are larger, more aggressive relatives of the smaller
    marmoset. Their fur is gray or black, with black fur predominant over the
    back and neck. Their tails reach a length of 5 feet and are colored in
    alternating bands of black and pale gray. They sustain themselves on a diet
    of tree saps and gums (using their sharp teeth to gnaw holes in the bark),
    small animals, and various fruits and nuts. Giant marmosets make their homes
    among the trees, rarely touching the ground unless hunting living prey. They
    are, on occasion, tamed by wild tribes of halflings and used as mounts in
    times of war.

    Giant marmosets prefer to attack from surprise, tossing large stones from
    the sides of cliffs at their prey, hanging from branches by their tail and
    swinging down to surprise their prey, or dropping from the trees on their
    unaware foes. They attack using their claws and bite or claws and a tail
    slap.
