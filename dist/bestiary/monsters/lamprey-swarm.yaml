    description: >-
      Any living creature that takes damage from a lamprey swarm must succeed on
      a DC 16 Reflex save. On a failed save, several lampreys have attached
      themselves to the target and the creature takes 1d3 points of Constitution
      damage each round as the lampreys drain blood. This effect continues as
      long as the victim remains in the swarm and for 1d6 rounds after it leaves
      the swarm. The attached lampreys can be killed instantly by dealing at
      least 6 points of damage to the victim (any weapon or energy-based attacks
      work), ending the effect prematurely. A successful DC 16 Heal check
      reduces the duration by 1d6 rounds, ending the effect prematurely. The
      save DC and check DC are both Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A lamprey swarm is a mass of lampreys numbering in the hundreds, possibly
    thousands. These creatures are attracted to living creatures in the water
    and quickly attach themselves to their targeted prey.
  - >-
    Lamprey swarms attack any living prey encountered in their paths, swimming
    over the creature and draining as much blood as possible. When their prey is
    dead, they move on, seeking out a new source of nourishment.
