  - name: Ambush Pit (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant emperor scorpion can spend 1 minute digging itself into the soil
      or other ground debris. It then waits for its tremorsense to detect prey.
      When a creature comes within range, it can erupt from the ground as a free
      action as part of a charge, allowing it to use its pounce ability. When
      dug in, the scorpion has improved cover granting it a +10 bonus on Stealth
      checks.
