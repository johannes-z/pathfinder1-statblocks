  This seething devil deftly wields a vicious, saw-toothed glaive, while below
  its toothy maw writhes a hideous, twitching beard.
Group: Devil

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Beard (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a bearded devil hits a single opponent with both claw attacks, it also
      lashes at the same target with its spiky, filthy beard. The victim takes
      1d8+2 points of damage and must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or
      contract devil chills. The save DC is Constitution-based. Devil Chills:
      Disease-injury; save Fort DC 17; onset 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect
      1d4 Str damage; cure 3 consecutive saves.
  - name: Infernal Wound (Su)
    description: >-
      The damage a bearded devil deals with its glaive inflicts persistent
      wounds that cause 2 points of bleed damage. Bleed caused from an infernal
      wound is particularly difficult to stanch-a DC 17 Heal check stops the
      damage, and any attempt to heal a creature suffering from an infernal
      wound must succeed on a DC 16 caster level check or the spell does not
      function. Success indicates the healing works normally and stops all bleed
      effects on the victim. The infernal wounds caused by a bearded devil are a
      supernatural ability of the devil, not of the weapon.
Description:
  - >-
    Elite warriors in Hell's legions, bearded devils-or barbazus-fight savagely
    in the name of their infernal lords and command mindless hordes of the
    damned into battle. They collect and train with their infernally forged
    glaives among the vaults of Hell's third layer, Erebus, but inevitably
    return to the first layer, Avernus, to serve at the side of the dread lord
    Barbatos.
  - >-
    Barbazus are fond of making charge attacks with their glaives, and try to
    maintain a 10-foot gap between themselves and their foes so they can use
    their signature polearms to great effect. Against a foe that has greater
    reach (or one able to otherwise avoid the devil's favored tactic), they drop
    their glaives and resort to their claws and hideous beards.
  - >-
    At attention, bearded devils stand over 6 feet tall (though their squatting
    battle stances often make them appear shorter) and weigh upward of 200
    pounds.
