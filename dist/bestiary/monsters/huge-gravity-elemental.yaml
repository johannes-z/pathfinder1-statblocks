Description_Visual: >-
  This creature resembles a miniature black hole hovering several feet off the
  ground. It is a circular region of absolute blackness, with a bizarre
  distortion around its edges as it warps light waves. Four spiraling, rotating
  arms of debris and light surround the circular region of darkness. Its facial
  features are small points of light, almost like stars.

  - name: Distortion (Su)
    description: >-
      The manipulation of light waves around a gravity elemental grants it a +2
      deflection bonus to its Armor Class.
  - name: Engulf (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gravity elemental that starts its turn grappling a creature or holding
      and object up to one size smaller than itself can absorb the creature or
      object into its swirling form as a full-round action. An engulfed creature
      or object takes damage equal to the elemental's slam attack each round it
      remains engulfed and can take no action other than trying to break free by
      rolling its CMB vs. the gravity elementals CMD. The gravity elemental
      gains the grappled condition as long as it has a creature engulfed, and it
      can only engulf one creature at a time. A creature that dies while
      engulfed by a gravity elemental is smashed into atoms and can only be
      restored to life by a miracle, wish, or the intervention of a deity. An
      object that is destroyed while it is engulfed by a gravity elemental is
      destroyed forever and cannot be restored. There is a 1% non-cumulative
      chance each round that an engulfed creature or object is sent to a random
      plane.
  - name: Gravity Field (Su)
    description: >-
      A gravity elemental's manipulation of gravity function like the reverse
      gravity and telekinesis spells (CL equal to HD). The maximum weight an
      Elder gravity elemental can lift with its telekinesis is not restricted to
      375 lbs. The effects of the gravity field are centered on the gravity
      elemental and move with it. Additionally, by increasing the pull of
      gravity around itself a gravity elemental can make creatures within a
      certain radius too heavy to move, or crush them to a pulp. Hold: As a
      full-round action a gravity elemental can cause all corporeal creatures in
      its area of effect to become too heavy to move. Creatures in the gravity
      elemental's gravity field must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the
      held condition until the gravity elemental releases them or they break
      free. A flying creature has a -4 penalty applied to the save; failure
      means it is unable to remain airborne and must land. The check DC is
      Strength-based. The gravity elemental can maintain this ability each round
      as a fullround action. The area of effect and save DC depend on the size
      of the elemental. If the gravity elemental maintains this ability, on
      successive rounds a held creature can break free by succeeding on a
      Strength check with a DC equal to the initial Fortitude save. Any
      land-bound creature two size categories smaller less than the elemental
      has its speed automatically reduced by half, even if the Strength check is
      successful. This ability only works on creatures with weight and mass;
      incorporeal and gaseous creatures are immune to this power. Crush: Once
      per day per 2HD, as a standard action, a gravity elemental can increase
      the gravity around itself to crushing proportions. Anything within the
      gravity elemental's gravity field takes bludgeoning damage. A successful
      Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. The area of effect and save DC
      depend on the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Immunity to Missile Weapons (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gravity elemental is immune to any attack from thrown or hurled weapons,
      arrows, bolts, stones, and similar weapons with a size equal to or less
      than its own. Any such ranged attack against a gravity elemental
      automatically fails and the weapon is pulled into the elemental's body.
      Captured missiles orbit the gravity elemental's form as long as it
      desires, and it can release one such missile each round as an improvised
      thrown weapon. The weapon deals its normal damage plus the gravity
      elemental's Strength modifier, and has a range increment of 20 ft. A
      gravity elemental has the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat.
  - name: Immunity to Spells (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gravity elemental is immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and
      effects that depend on weight or mass.
  - name: Perfect Flier (Ex)
    description: >-
      A gravity elemental has perfect control over the forces of gravity, and
      never needs to make a Fly check when attempting a complex maneuver. It
      must still make Fly checks to resist external influences on its flight,
      such as strong winds.
Description:
  - >-
    A gravity elemental embodies the very force that controls and holds together
    the fabric of the universe. The actual elemental is a tiny, superdense ball
    of matter deep within a zone of darkness and spiraling arms of debris that
    comprise the body of the elemental. A gravity elemental has mass and size,
    but no effective weight. Gravity elementals originate on a weird, recently
    discovered plane that scholars affectionately call the Plane of Gravity. The
    elemental's home plane is a flat, rocky place with little life, no known
    water sources, and no plant life or foliage. The plane is always shrouded in
    darkness. Dense pockets of intense gravity and areas of little or no gravity
    dot the barren landscape. Gravity elementals seem to be able to converse
    with others of their kind by manipulating gravity itself. Gravity elementals
    attack primarily by flailing at their opponents with multiple arms, each one
    a mixture of fluctuating fields of micro-gravity and debris that has been
    sucked into its gravity well. These creatures can also attack by adjusting
    the local gravity fields around themselves. Copyright Notice Author Erica
