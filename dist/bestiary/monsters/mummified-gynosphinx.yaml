  Wrapped in strips of linen, this creature with tattered wings looks like it
  used to have the hindquarters of a lion and a woman's face.

Description:
  - >-
    Many ancient cultures mummify their dead, preserving the bodies of the
    deceased through lengthy and complex funerary and embalming processes. While
    the vast majority of these corpses are mummified simply to preserve the
    bodies in the tombs where they are interred,
  - >-
    some are mummified with the help of magic to live on after death as
    mummified creatures. A mummified creature appears much as other mummies do-a
    dusty corpse, desiccated and withered, swathed in a funeral shroud of linen
    wrappings adorned with hieroglyphs-but a spark of malign intelligence gleams
    in its unliving eyes. mummified creatures differ from the standard mummy
    presented in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary with regard to how and why they are
    created. Most standard mummies are created as simple tomb guardians; they
    gain abilities such as an aura of despair and mummy rot, but they usually
    lose their free will, much of their intelligence, and the abilities they
    possessed in life. A mummified creature, on the other hand, retains its
    intelligence, memories, and many of its other abilities. A mummified
    creature does not spread the curse of mummy rot, nor does the sight of it
    paralyze the living with fear, but its touch can reduce a living creature to
    dust and its very presence is frightening. Though slow and clumsy in
    undeath, a mummified creature is nonetheless capable of surprising bursts of
    speed and ferocity. Because of its creation process, however, a mummified
    creature is susceptible to energy damage, though determining an individual
    mummified creature's vulnerability is not always easy. Many mummified
    creatures are created to guard the tombs of important figures, but some
    powerful beings-rulers, high priests, mighty wizards, or even wealthy
    aristocrats-arrange to be transformed into mummified creatures upon their
    deaths. Unwilling to give up their lives and knowledge to the whims of fate,
    these people bind their souls to the dried husks of their dead bodies,
    trading oblivion for endless centuries of unlife. The truly wealthy
    sometimes arrange for their most favored spouses, concubines, servants, or
    guards to be mummified with them, enabling them to hold court in dusty tombs
    in an undead mockery of their old lives centuries after they perished. To
    create a mummified creature, a corpse must be prepared through embalming,
    with its internal organs replaced with dried herbs and flowers and its dead
    skin preserved through the application of sacred oils. Unlike with standard
    mummies, a mummified creature's brain is not removed from its skull after
    death. Injected with strange chemicals and tattooed with mystical
    hieroglyphs, a mummified creature's brain retains the base creature's mind
    and abilities, though the process does result in the loss of some mental
    faculties. Once this process is complete, the body is wrapped in special
    purified linens marked with hieroglyphs that grant the mummified creature
    its new abilities (as well as its weakness). Finally, the creator must cast
    a create greater undead spell to give the mummified creature its unlife.
  - CREATING A MUMMIFIED CREATURE
  - >-
    "Mummified creature" is an acquired template that can be added to any living
    corporeal creature (hereafter referred to as the base creature). A mummified
    creature uses all of the base creature's statistics except as noted here.
  - 'CR: Same as the base creature +1.'
  - 'Alignment: Any evil.'
  - >-
    Type: The creature's type changes to undead (augmented). It retains any
    other subtypes as well, except for alignment subtypes and subtypes that
    indicate kind. Do not recalculate class HD, BAB, saves, or skill points.
  - 'Senses: A mummified creature gains darkvision 60 feet.'
  - >-
    Aura: A mummified creature gains a frightful presence aura with a range of
    30 feet and a duration of 1d6 rounds.
  - 'Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +4.'
  - >-
    Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected.
    As an undead, a mummified creature uses its Charisma modifier to determine
    bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: A mummified creature gains DR 5/- and the defensive
    abilities granted by the undead type.
  - >-
    Weaknesses: The mummification process leaves a mummified creature vulnerable
    to a single energy type. Choose or determine randomly from the following
    list.
  - d10 Energy 1 Electricity 2-3 Acid 4-7 Fire 8-9 Cold 10 Sonic
  - >-
    As a fail-safe in case of rebellion, a mummified creature is subtly marked
    during the ritual process with a hieroglyph someplace inconspicuous on its
    body or wrappings that identifies the particular energy type to which it is
    vulnerable. A successful DC 20 Perception check is needed to find the mark,
    but a successful DC 25 Linguistics check is still required to decipher the
    hieroglyph's meaning.
  - >-
    Speed: Decrease all speeds by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet). If the base
    creature has a flight speed, its maneuverability changes to clumsy.
  - >-
    Attacks: The mummification process hardens the mummified creature's bones to
    a stone-like density, granting the mummified creature a powerful slam attack
    if the base creature has no other natural attacks. This slam attack deals
    damage based on the mummified creature's size (Bestiary 302), treating the
    creature as if it were one size category larger.
  - 'Special Attacks: A mummified creature gains the following special attacks.'
  - >-
    Burst of Vengeance (Su): Despite its slow, lumbering nature, a mummified
    creature is capable of lurching forward to attack with a short but
    surprising explosion of speed. Twice per day as a swift action, a mummified
    creature may act as if affected by a haste spell for 1 round.
  - >-
    Dust Stroke (Su): A creature killed by a mummified creature's natural attack
    or slam attack is disintegrated into a cloud of dust and ash, completely
    destroying the victim's body (as disintegrate).
  - >-
    Abilities: Str +4, Int -2 (minimum 1). As an undead creature, a mummified
    creature has no Constitution score.
  - >-
    Feats: A mummified creature gains Toughness as a bonus feat, and Improved
    Natural Attack as a bonus feat for each of the base creature's natural
    attacks.
  - 'Skills: A mummified creature gains a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks.'
