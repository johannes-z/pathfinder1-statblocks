    description: >-
      A screaming devilkin can howl continuously as a free action. This painful
      howling affects all creatures within 60 feet that hear it. Affected
      creatures must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be dazed for one
      round. The save DC is Charisma-based. The effects of multiple screaming
      devilkin using their scream ability in an overlapping area is not
      cumulative; only one save need be made each round. Conversation, even
      shouting, is inaudible within 60 feet of a screaming devilkin using this
      ability. Spellcasters in the area must succeed on a Concentration check
      (DC 15 + spell level) each time they try to cast a spell. Silence negates
      the devilkin's scream for the duration of the spell.
Description:
  - >-
    Shrill wails echoing through the night signal the arrival of a screaming
    devilkin. Screaming devilkins are smallish beasts, humanoid in appearance
    but with frail and spindly arms and legs. These weak limbs are nearly
    useless for combat and locomotion, but the screaming devilkin makes up for
    this disability with its bat-like wings. Although screaming devilkins are
    fast fliers, they are not particularly agile on the wing. Screaming
    devilkins also have a long, muscular, barbed tail that is their primary
    means of physical attack. It should be noted that despite its appearance and
    name, the screaming devilkin has no connection with outsiders of any type.
  - >-
    A screaming devilkin is a tireless combatant, refusing to back down
    regardless of how the combat is progressing; it always attacks on sight.
  - >-
    It attacks in melee by stabbing with its barbed tail (inflicting piercing
    damage) and screams continuously until it or its opponent is dead.
  - >-
    A typical screaming devilkin is 3 feet tall and has a wingspan of about 5
    feet. Its skin is reddish-brown in color and its eyes are black. Its tail is
    about 2-1/2 feet long.
