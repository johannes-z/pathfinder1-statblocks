Description_Visual: >-
  The vines dangling from the treetops are about as thick as a halfling's leg.
  They sway gently and almost innocently in the breeze, but the wicked barbs
  along their lengths glisten unwholesomely with a reddish liquid. The smell of
  decaying flesh is unmistakable.

Description:
  - >-
    The bloodsoaker vine is a horrid plant that is believed to have its origins
    in the blood-stained fields of the Plane of Agony. Some unknown
    botanist-perhaps one of the N'gathau themselves-supposedly spliced an
    unknown root from that dismal place with the assassin vine to create this
    monstrosity. Several other theories as to this plant's origin abound, but
    this one is the most widely accepted.
  - >-
    The root system of the bloodsoaker vine needs blood to survive in the same
    manner as other plants need water. The vine provides nourishment for itself
    and the host tree from which it dangles by shredding unfortunate forest
    travelers into easily degraded bits. The trees benefit from the meaty
    compost while the bloodsoaker vine-true to the name-hungrily feeds on the
    blood of its victim and any that saturates the nearby soil.
  - >-
    A typical bloodsoaker vine is a mass of roots, vines, and tendrils.
    Coloration ranges from deep greens to various browns, and all colors in
    between. The bloodsoaker vine eventually changes colors to better match its
    surroundings the longer it remains in one location.
  - >-
    Ironically, the bloodsoaker vine produces an orchid-like flower thought by
    many to be among the most beautiful in creation. Far above the carnage
    below, where its tendrils break the forest canopy, delicate pink blossoms
    spread their petals and nourish birds and insects with sweet-smelling
    nectar.
