SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fighter Training (Ex)
    description: >-
      The herald counts its Hit Dice as fighter levels for the purpose of
      qualifying for feats and other abilities.
  - name: Keelhaul (Ex)
    description: >-
      If the herald hits a creature with two or more incorporeal touch attacks
      in 1 round, it can perform a reposition combat maneuver as a free action
      without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the herald moves the target
      into or through a square adjacent to it (including over or under itself ),
      the target takes 1d6 points of slashing or bludgeoning damage (herald's
      choice) for every 5 feet of this movement. If this movement results in the
      target being underwater, the target must hold its breath or begin to
      drown. Alternatively, if the herald can reposition the target to the
      center of its space, it can attempt to force the target into its cargo
      hold and snap the doors shut, holding the target in place as the swallow
      whole ability. The herald can hold up to four Medium or smaller creatures
      or one Large creature with this ability.
  - name: Rush (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per minute for 1 round, the herald can move at a swim speed of 150
      feet, even downward.
  - name: Telekinesis (Su)
    description: >-
      The herald makes ranged attacks by telekinetically hurling objects or
      creatures on its deck as weapons. This ability functions as the spell
      telekinesis (CL 18th). It can use the ability on objects or creatures of
      up to 375 pounds, dealing 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds of the hurled
      object or creature. If the herald attempts to hurl a creature with this
      ability, that creature can resist the effect with a successful Will save
      (DC 18). The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Besmara's herald is Kelpie's Wrath, a haunted ship that is a living being.
    It looks like a storm-battered pirate vessel with the skull and spine of
    some great sea creature mounted on the prow, with eerie lights flickering on
    its deck and streaming from its masts. The ship is the source of many horror
    tales of abandoned ships found in the ocean or spectral ships crewed by
    ghosts, but it is actually an independent creature with a malign, vengeful
    intelligence. On the rare occasions when it comes to the mortal seas at
    Besmara's bidding, it usually does so to punish some buccaneer for a horrid
    blasphemy against the Pirate Queen. Far more often it is left to its own
    devices, sailing mortal waters, the Ethereal or Astral Planes, or strange
    dream-realms in search of plunder, danger, and glory.
  - >-
    The ship's origins are mysterious and legends about it are contradictory. In
    some stories it was originally the flagship of a notorious pirate king who
    swore to forever serve Besmara, and when he finally died she merged his
    spirit with his ship so he could continue his service. Other tales tell of a
    demon-tainted kelpie that grew to a monstrous size and was kept as a beloved
    pet by the goddess like a mad dog until it was slain by adventurers and
    resurrected in this form to continue its predations. Still others speak of a
    devout priest-captain of Besmara who swore to bed no other woman so he could
    service the goddess in the afterlife, but then fell in love with a girl in a
    coastal village; according to this tale, the goddess cursed the priest to
    always roam the sea and never touch land so he would always pine for the
    love he could not have. The ship does not answer queries about its origin,
    and if pressed on the matter it has a habit of grabbing its interrogators,
    diving hundreds of feet under the water, and casually watching them gasp out
    the last of their air before it tears them limb from limb.
  - >-
    The ship is completely animate and needs no crew- it can tie and release its
    lines; raise, lower, and adjust its sails; open or close all of its doors;
    and so on. It moves about foreign objects (such as cargo) using telekinesis,
    and it sometimes does the same to its rare passengers, slamming doors on
    hands or throwing people overboard if it feels a lack of respect. Though it
    has a wheel and rudder, it resists mortal attempts to steer it as if it were
    a mundane ship- something it considers very disrespectful.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Kelpie's Wrath has no need to eat, drink, or even breathe. Because it can
    "swim" in any direction, including underwater, it may be found on the
    surface, cruising deep beneath the sea, or even skimming the bottom of the
    ocean. If facing an opponent it cannot easily defeat, it is likely to
    retreat deep underwater (assuming its foe cannot easily follow) or use
    teleport or plane shift to reach a safe place. It prods old wrecked ships
    for loot, storing its prizes within itself and only relinquishing its
    treasures when the goddess desires something it carries. Many loot caches on
    the sea floor actually belong to the ship, buried and marked in its memory
    for later counting.
  - >-
    When called by mortals, it demands treasure as payment for its services,
    preferring chests full of gems and gold coins. It has a lecherous,
    voyeuristic streak, however, and has been known to lower its price if
    arrangements are made for mortals to perform carnal acts on its decks-while
    it telepathically murmurs approvingly. If properly bribed, it serves with
    grudging loyalty until the task is done, then leaves. It is best suited for
    tasks requiring the destruction or terrorizing of enemy ships or fleets,
    though it can easily transport dozens of people or tons of cargo anywhere in
    the world or even to another plane. It is also willing to serve as a lure or
    decoy, disguising itself as a slow, loot-rich merchant vessel or mysterious
    shipwreck in a cove.
  - >-
    The ship is fully mobile in waterlike environments on other planes,
    including the Ethereal and Astral Planes. It enjoys sailing the "waters" of
    the ethereal sea and raiding xill settlements, or changing through clusters
    of soul-predators in the Astral Plane. It also finds pleasure in the bizarre
    seascape of the Maelstrom and has ventured into watery parts of the Abyss,
    though it is always ready to plane shift if it suspects a trap or a shift in
    the terrain that would trap it.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Kelpie's Wrath sometimes follows Besmara's ship, the Seawraith, at a
    respectful distance on its travels through the planes, like a well-heeled
    dog afraid to attract too much attention to itself. When commanded by the
    goddess, it immediately complies, mixing a need for approval with an abject
    fear of punishment for any perceived disobedience. The ship acts like the
    only thing it cares about is the goddess, and is willing to sacrifice itself
    for her approval-it would swim through lava or acid, or run itself aground
    on a beach of adamantine spikes to please her.
  - >-
    Though the ship has no need of crew, it sometimes offers to save drowning
    sailors in exchange for a number years of service. Those who accept vanish
    and are not seen again-unless the draugr it summons are actually the
    revenant forms of these rescued sailors. Whether these souls think half-life
    at the ship's beck and call is better than actual death is unknown, for they
    do not speak of it. Some pirate-priests believe the ship is searching for a
    soul great enough to take its place, becoming the new mind in charge of the
    living ship and freeing whatever controls it to live again or pass on to
    Pharasma's Boneyard.
