Description:
  - >-
    Mudlords are agile creatures made of living mud. Some are natural elemental
    creatures, and others were created by long-term mixing of earth and magical
    water, such as by an enchanted fountain or pool leaking into the surrounding
    soil. Regardless of their origin, mudlords are xenophobic and highly
    territorial. They avoid contact with humanoid creatures, and go to great
    lengths to ensure their mud-f illed lairs are far from any humanoid
    settlements. If a group of humanoids settles too close to a mudlord enclave,
    the mudlords aggressively attempt to eradicate the humanoid infestation from
    their lands. Because its natural form is a loose pile of mud and it can
    flatten itself even further, a common mudlord tactic is to blend in with a
    swamp, quicksand, or other depression in the earth (using its freeze ability
    to resemble a mud puddle) and wait for intruders to approach. Among their
    own kind, mudlords are rambunctious and playful, engaging in wrestling
    matches, mud-throwing contests, and races. They have been known to ally with
    earth, mud, and water elementals, but consider themselves the superiors in
    these alliances because of their greater intelligence. Exceptional mudlords
    often become druids, oracles, or rangers, and are more tolerant of
    humanoids, often accepting tribute from tribes of boggards, goblins, or
    lizardfolk in exchange for truces. Some arise from contaminated sources
    (such as a demon imprisoned in water) and these might ally themselves with
    fiends, slimes, or other strange creatures. A typical mudlord stands 7 feet
    tall and weighs 250 pounds.
