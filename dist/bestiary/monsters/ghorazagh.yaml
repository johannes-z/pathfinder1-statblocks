SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bloodsense (Su)
    description: >-
      A ghorazagh notices living creatures within 60 feet just as if it
      possessed the blindsight ability.
  - name: Bloodspray (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds, a ghorazagh can unleash a 20-foot cone of blood and
      eldritch enzymes. Any living creature struck by a ghorazagh's bloodspray
      must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or be affected as by the spell slow. A
      slowed creature struck by a ghorazagh's bloodspray a second time must make
      an additional save or be paralyzed. These effects last for 2d6 rounds. A
      ghorazagh can also consciously alter its enzymes, producing a spray that
      removes all effects of this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Chemical Communication (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ghorazaghs can communicate with other ghorazaghs within 60 feet via
      pheromone transmission. In a ghorazagh hive, this range extends to cover
      the entire hive. This is a silent and instantaneous mode of communication
      that only ghorazaghs can understand.
Description:
  - >-
    Ghorazaghs-or gore weavers-f loat like tumorous specters through the
    deepest, most alien cavities of the lightless underground, preying upon the
    wretched vermin of those horrid places. Cunning, with minds and drives
    unknowable and obscene to those of lands above, the gore weavers only
    recently became aware of the fertility and bounty of the surface world and
    are now slowly turning their ebon eyes upward.
  - >-
    While ghorazaghs can digest nearly anything, they are incapable of digesting
    blood. Their digestive systems process flesh, bone, and all other organic
    material, filtering out blood and storing it in large reservoirs within
    their bodies, whereupon the blood is mixed internally with mucus and other
    strange fluids to form a thick, gluelike substance. While a ghorazagh can
    spray this fluid as an attack to impede prey, the primary use of the foul
    substance is as a building material. Ghorazagh hives are constructed
    entirely of this material, which when it dries has the strength of metal
    while retaining a dark red resinlike appearance. A ghorazagh hive is a
    nightmare place as a result-twisting tunnels with an eerily organic
    appearance that can wind for miles on end.
