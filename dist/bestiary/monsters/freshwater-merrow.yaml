Description:
  - >-
    Merrows are best described as the aquatic cousins of ogres. Although their
    green, scaled skin and webbed hands and feet make them appear different,
    merrows are just as cruel, savage, and wicked as their ogre relatives. The
    saltwater variety grows much larger than the freshwater variety, but the
    behavior and society of the two types are otherwise similar. Merrows are
    known for pillaging small fishing villages and towns under cover of night.
    Similar to ogres, merrows have a strong sense of family and typically hunt
    in gangs, preferring to grab a couple of villagers and head back into the
    water rather than sticking around and dealing with armed resistance. Merrows
    have a stronger sense of unity than ogres do, and rarely will the leader of
    a tribe be challenged. When they have chosen a village or town to plunder,
    they attack as a gang and share the spoils. A freshwater merrow is 12 feet
    tall and weighs 500 pounds. Saltwater merrows easily reach 20 feet tall and
    4,000 pounds, and have been known to hunt whales. The two species do not
    often come in contact, but when they do, feuding and conf lict are swift to
    develop.
