Description:
  - >-
    A clubnek is a large flightless bird resembling an ostrich found roaming
    meadowlands and forests. It is primarily an herbivore subsisting on a diet
    of plants and flowers, though it is given to flights of unpredictability
    when it takes the role of hunter and predator.
  - A clubnek stands 7 feet tall and weighs about 350 pounds.
  - >-
    Clubneks are generally nonaggressive unless threatened or frightened, though
    they are known to occasionally have fits of erratic behavior that cause them
    to become quite aggressive. In such a case, they attack until slain or
    driven off. If its prey attempts to flee, the clubnek often runs it down and
    continues combat.
  - >-
    A clubnek attacks by slashing with its claws and stabbing with its hard bony
    beak.
