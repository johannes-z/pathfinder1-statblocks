Description:
  - >-
    Like its cousin the common gargoyle, spitting gargoyles are cruel creatures
    taking great delight in torturing others just to watch their suffering.
    Before closing to attack with their melee attacks, spitting gargoyles often
    dive to use their acid spit attacks initially to soften up their targets.
    Other than the variations mentioned here, they in all other ways conform to
    the standard gargoyle as detailed in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game
    Bestiary.
