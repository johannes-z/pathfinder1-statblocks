  - name: Freeze (Ex)
    description: >-
      A spitting gargoyle can hold itself so still it appears to be a statue. A
      spitting gargoyle that uses freeze can take 20 on its Stealth check to
      hide in plain sight as a stone statue.
Description:
  - >-
    Like its cousin the common gargoyle, spitting gargoyles are cruel creatures
    taking great delight in torturing others just to watch their suffering.
    Before closing to attack with their melee attacks, spitting gargoyles often
    dive to use their acid spit attacks initially to soften up their targets.
    Other than the variations mentioned here, they in all other ways conform to
    the standard gargoyle as detailed in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game
    Bestiary.
