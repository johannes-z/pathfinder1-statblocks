  This crimson horror walks upon six long, thin legs. Its face is neither that

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Draining Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures within 20 feet of a scarlet walker are subject to the
      monster's eerie blood-draining gaze. Affected creatures must succeed at a
      DC 23 Fortitude save or thin streams of blood pour from their eyes,
      flowing through the air and into the eye socket-like pits in the scarlet
      walker's face. This does not impact the victim's vision, but does deal 1
      point of Constitution damage and sickens the victim for 1 round from the
      hideous pain. A creature already suffering from a bleed effect takes a -4
      penalty on the saving throw. This is a bleed effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Bloodsense (Su)
    description: >-
      A scarlet walker can sense living creatures with blood in their veins, or
      undead creatures that feed on blood (such as vampires). This ability
      functions like blindsight to a range of 60 feet.
Description:
  - >-
    The scarlet walker is an alien entity from some other dimension, often
    conjured by the wizards of Thassilon to serve as a minion. Scarlet walkers
    were particularly favored for their adeptness at interrogating prisoners,
    either via torture, or via the creatures' uncanny ability to mentally compel
    both actions and compliance. Once an interrogation was over, the scarlet
    walker's master typically commanded the monster to render the victim insane
    or feebleminded if mere death wasn't appropriate.
  - >-
    Scarlet walkers themselves hail from the nightmare realm of Leng, where they
    walk amid strange, stony deserts and stride through the skies above. No mere
    predators, scarlet walkers build immense hives of coagulated blood and
    tissue in nameless mountain valleys, and the flavors of various creatures'
    blood is an inexhaustible topic of discussion among their kind.
