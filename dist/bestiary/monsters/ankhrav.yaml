SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Spit Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      An ankhrav can spit a 60-foot line of digestive fluid that deals 7d6
      points of acid damage (Reflex DC 21 half). Once an ankhrav uses this
      ability, the acid damage dealt by the ankhrav's bite attack is reduced by
      1d6 for 1 hour. If the ankhrav's bite attack would not deal any acid
      damage, it cannot spit acid. The save DC is Constitution-based. Ankhravs,
      also called "ankheg queens," are fearsome predators most common near the
      Skittermounds. These six-legged beasts are larger than regular ankhegs,
      but the most telling difference between them and drones is the pair of
      razor-sharp, mantislike arms located at the front of the thorax. While
      these arms provide no locomotive aid- their scissorlike edges are too
      delicate to support any weight-these additional appendages allow ankhravs
      to quickly bring down prey that would take ankheg spawn much longer to
      swarm and slay. Ankhravs are rarely encountered alone, and then only when
      a young queen travels from her home nest to establish a new colony. In
      most cases, when they venture from their lairs, ankhravs hunt accompanied
      by ankheg drones.
Description:
  - >-
    Though a significant danger to locals, ankhravs are also a highly valued
    resource for local tribes and the humans of Trunau. While they and their
    spawn wreak havoc on any attempts to build settlements in their territory,
    their sturdy carapaces and valuable organs can be worth a fortune if sold to
    the right alchemist or collector. There are always a few scouts and trappers
    willing to risk the dangers of hunting ankhravs.
  - >-
    Every winter, ankhravs retreat into their hives to give birth to the next
    generation of ankhegs. During this time, each ankhrav is tended to by ankheg
    drones as its flared abdomen produces an incubating egg sac nearly the size
    of its body. Sustaining this sac uses much of the stores claimed by the
    ankhrav's hunting season, and without ankheg servants most ankhravs would
    starve to death, drained by the process of birthing the next generation of
    drones. If an ankhrav has a large hive with scores of drones and plentiful
    food, it may give birth to one or two young ankhravs, which leave their
    birthplace to establish their own hives at 2 years of age.

    A fully grown ankhrav stretches to a length of 14 feet and can weigh as much
    as 4,200 pounds.
