  spaces in between revealing flesh of black stone.
Group: Inevitable
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 2
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fists of Lightning and Thunder (Su)
    description: >-
      A marut's fists strike with the power of a thunderstorm. For any given
      slam attack, a marut can choose whether that attack uses lightning or
      thunder. A lightning attack deals an additional 3d6 points of electricity
      damage, and the resulting flash blinds the target for 2d6 rounds
      (Fortitude DC 26 negates the blindness). A thunder attack deals an
      additional 3d6 points of sonic damage, and the resulting thunderclap
      deafens the target for 2d6 rounds (Fortitude DC 26 negates the deafness).
      The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Behemoths of onyx and golden armor, maruts shake the ground when they walk,
    each thunderous step ringing a death knell for those they've come to take.
    Rarely seeming to hurry, a marut's onslaught is deliberate, purposeful, and
    relentless. Its quarry may impede it or flee, running for decades or
    centuries, but from the initial meeting onward, the target must always look
    over its shoulder with the knowledge that, like death itself, the marut is
    ever at its heels, slowly but surely approaching, bringing balance through
    inevitable oblivion.
  - >-
    Maruts primarily target those mortal souls who have artificially extended
    their lifespans beyond what is feasible for their race, such as liches and
    other powerful magic users. Extraordinary but natural means of cheating
    death are sometimes also punished, such as the magistrate who murders an
    entire starving town to save himself, or those who foresee their own deaths
    via divination magic and are therefore able to avoid them.
  - >-
    Although they are capable of speaking eloquently in any language, and
    frequently gather vast amounts of information from those who are intimidated
    by their mere presence, maruts rarely engage in conversation or strategic
    alliances with mortals. Even on the battlefield, the juggernauts prefer to
    remain silent, knowing that their targets are already aware of their own
    transgressions and that all mortals secretly harbor dreams of immortality.
