SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Command Elementals (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an elemental lord can attempt to gain control of any
      elemental creature of the same element within 100 feet. Elementals receive
      a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10
      + 1/2 the elemental lord's + its Charisma modifier. Elementals that make
      their save are immune to the command of that elemental lord for one day.
      Elementals that fail their saves fall under the elemental lord's control,
      obeying its commands to the best of their ability. An elemental lord does
      not need to concentrate to maintain control over commanded elementals.
      Once commanded, an elemental serves until either it dies, the elemental
      lord dies, the elemental lord dismisses it, or the summoning magic ends
      (if the elemental was summoned). An elemental lord can command any number
      of elementals, so long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed twice the
      elemental lord's Hit Dice. If an elemental creature is under the control
      of another creature, the elemental lord can attempt an opposed Charisma
      check to gain control of the elemental.
  - name: Air Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against
      Susir.
Description:
  - >-
    Susir makes his home hidden among the fog and clouds of the Plane of Air.
    His great airy palace is formed of the same material as the Plane itself and
    swirls and shifts across the great expanse of the Plane of Air. Within his
    palace dwell air elementals of all sizes and ages, invisible stalkers,
    will-o-wisps, and an array of other air-based creatures.
  - >-
    Susir dislikes combat, believing it a boring and mundane activity. If forced
    into battle however, he attacks first using his chain lighting attacks,
    followed by his whirlwind.
