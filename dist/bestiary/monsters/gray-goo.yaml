SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dismantle (Ex)
    description: >-
      Creatures damaged by a gray goo must succeed at a DC 19 Reflex save or a
      random piece of their equipment takes the same amount of damage,
      determined as though the target rolled a natural 1 on a saving throw,
      using the rules for items surviving after a saving throw (Pathfinder RPG
      Core Rulebook 217). In addition, unattended objects in the area of a gray
      goo take damage if the swarm chooses to harm them. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Dispersion (Ex)
    description: >-
      As an immediate action, a gray goo can disperse, spreading itself across
      an area of up to 30 cubic feet. While dispersed, it deals no damage and
      cannot use its other special abilities until it reforms. A dispersed gray
      goo can hide in plain sight (as a ranger in its favored terrain) with a
      +10 bonus and does not take additional damage from area effects. It takes
      2 rounds for a dispersed gray goo to reform.
  - name: Infest (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a gray goo can infest a Medium or larger creature
      (Fortitude DC 21 negates), including constructs and undead. The swarm
      deals double its normal damage to its host each round, but cannot make use
      of its dismantle ability. If the host is reduced to 0 hit points while
      infested, it is reduced to dust and destroyed (similar to a disintegrate
      effect). A gray goo infesting a host can be expelled by any effect that
      cures disease, with a disease save equal to this ability's DC. The save DC
      is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Swarms of weaponized nanites-microscopic robots designed to work in large
    groups to perform varied tasks-roam the Felldales, reducing anything in
    their path to wisps of dust. Called "gray goo" by natives who do not
    understand the true nature of the creature's components, some swarms were
    activated as weapons of mass destruction, while others were originally
    benign swarms that malfunctioned and abandoned their programming. Nanites
    have limited intelligence and potentially respond to commands. Such
    controlled swarms often spare the treasure their victims carry.
  - >-
    Rumors of virulent clouds of gray goo spread throughout Numeria every few
    years. The most recent tale speaks of a self-replicating swarm that uses its
    victims as incubators from which further swarms are born- a harrowing
    prospect if true.
