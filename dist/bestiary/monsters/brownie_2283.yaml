Description:
  - >-
    A brownie is a timid, quiet fey creature that prefers to live only among its
    own kind. Most brownies dwell in pastoral areas untouched by civilization,
    such as deep forests and wild lands far from other creatures.
  - >-
    Brownies are rarely over 18 inches tall. Their hair is always some earth
    tone such as brown, gray, or tawny. Most brownies prefer green or otherwise
    brightly colored clothing. They may be distant relatives of pixies and
    halflings, but this has never been proven.
  - >-
    Brownies avoid combat unless forced. If unable to employ any spells,
    brownies attack with tiny longswords.
