Description:
  - >-
    Though embalming bears could easily be mistaken for beasts brought back from
    the dead, these strange constructs are actually taxidermic bear corpses that
    have been modified so they can walk once again. Embalming bears employed as
    guardians are designed to deliver dangerous doses of embalming fluid with
    strikes from their powerful claws. Few of these creatures exist, and those
    that do are found where alchemy is widely practiced or where mummification
    of pets and guardians is a part of funereal tradition. Embalming bears are
    often created to guard over precious treasures, but some serve less
    significant functions, and are merely trophies preserved by taxidermists and
    animated to decorate macabre halls or guard remote locations.
  - >-
    An embalming bear is different from other animated objects in that the
    process of its creation includes a step that turns the chemicals that
    preserve the taxidermic animal into a weapon. This especially powerful
    embalming fluid is a deadly poison when injected into the injuries of living
    enemies. The main purpose of the liquid, though, is to provide the bear with
    a semifluid mobility normally not afforded to animated objects.
  - >-
    Many embalming bears (such as the one described here) have armor plates
    bolted onto their bodies, typically disguised as pieces of ceremonial armor
    to make the creature look as if it had been used in battle. Though this is
    often just an affectation, some embalming bears actually are honored
    creatures that died in battle and were then turned into eternal servants. A
    typical embalming bear is 7 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds.

    The bear carcass, taxidermy process, and armor for an embalming bear cost
    900 gp in raw materials alone. In addition, the construct must be injected
    with 1,200 gp worth of special embalming fluid.
