Description:
  - >-
    The sight of a carpet of swarming spiders is unsettling indeed-particularly
    when the swarm is made up of spiders each the size of a gold coin and
    possessing bladelike mandibles capable of lacerating flesh with sickening
    ease. A swarm of spiders is a colonial mass of arachnids that relies on
    overwhelming much larger prey with sheer numbers rather than catching
    smaller snacks. While spider swarms spin webs, these webs are incapable of
    catching larger prey and typically serve the swarm as a lair rather than a
    method of capturing dinner.
