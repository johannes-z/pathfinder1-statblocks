SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Genius Loci (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a lar can possess any inanimate object with which it
      comes into contact, thereby animating it under its control. The object and
      lar merge, taking on the statistics of an animated object of the same size
      (see animated objects in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). A lar may possess
      any object of Tiny to Large size. If the animated object is destroyed or
      targeted by dispel good, the lar is expelled and takes 1d6 points of
      damage per size category of the possessed object-1d6 for a Tiny object,
      2d6 for a Small object, and so on. The lar is then free to possess another
      object, if one is available. If a lar is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer,
      it is banished to its statua for 24 hours, after which it is fully healed.
      If the lar does not have a statua, or the statua is destroyed while it is
      at 0 or fewer hit points, the lar is killed.
  - name: Natural Invisibility (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability is constant, allowing a lar to remain invisible even when
      attacking. This ability is inherent and not subject to the invisibility
      purge spell.
  - name: Statua (Su)
    description: >-
      All lares rely on a small stone figure, known as a statua, for survival.
      This figurine serves as a lar's home, resting place, and tie to the
      Material Plane. Lares typically rest within their statua, finding it a
      comfortable place from which to oversee their surroundings. For every
      round a lar spends doing nothing besides resting within its statua, it
      regenerates 1 point of damage. However, being separated from the statua
      for extended periods of time weakens the lar. For every 5 hours a lar
      remains outside of its statua, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage.
      Only returning to the statua can heal this damage. If a lar falls to 0 hit
      points, even from nonlethal damage, it is banished back to the Upper
      Planes. While a lar's statua exists, the connected lar is treated as a
      native outsider. Any attempt to banish the lar-through dismissal or a
      similar spell-merely transports the creature back to its statua. If the
      statua is destroyed, a lar can be dismissed from the Material Plane as
      normal.
  - name: Suggestion (Sp)
    description: >-
      A lar can influence creatures as per the spell suggestion, with some
      variations, at will. First, to influence a creature in this manner, a lar
      must occupy the same square as its target. The lar is considered to be
      able to speak any language and communicate with any creature-even animals
      and vermin (which are usually immune to mind-affecting effects)-for the
      purposes of this effect. The target may attempt to resist a lar's
      suggestion by making a DC 17 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and
      includes a +2 racial bonus.
Description:
  - >-
    Sometimes referred to as "watchsouls," lares are subtle, benevolent spirits
    that prefer to spend their existence on the Material Plane minding the homes
    and fortunes of deserving mortals. Kind but aloof, lares watch over their
    mortal wards and help only when they are most needed. Yet where their homes
    are intruded upon or their charges imperiled, they prove frighteningly
    effective guardians, turning everything in their tiny dominions into living
    weapons. Lares are innately invisible, making the nature of their existence
    something of a mystery. Originating from the Upper Planes, these spirits
    have no true bodies and appear only as vague spectral eddies to those
    capable of seeing invisible beings. Yet while their forms prove vague, their
    blessings are undeniable. Ecology Although formed upon the Upper Planes,
    lares find themselves drawn to the Material Plane. While some seek out
    mortal souls to watch over out of some innate sense of protectiveness,
    others feel a more specific draw, searching out members of specific races,
    nations, heritages, or families. Upon taking up residence in a home of their
    choosing, what motivates and sustains these benevolent spirits is little
    understood. They seem to take sustenance from positive emotions, growing
    weak if left in places with quarrelsome residents or that fall to ruin.
    Lares never seem to die from negative emotions or abandonment, though,
    merely biding their time in the hopes that their dwelling might someday
    again host amenable residents. Habitat & Society Mortals sharing their home
    with a lar often create household shrines to them. These tiny sanctuaries,
    called lararia (singular lararium), serve to house the lar's statuae. Though
    the lar does not require offerings, many families give them anyway, treating
    their spirit with reverence. Over time, the lar might become like a member
    of the family, with the spirit offering advice and taking a keen interest in
    the raising of children and protection of the home. Once a family has been
    chosen, a lar does not leave its dwelling, not even to follow the family
    during extended leaves. The only exception to this is if the family takes
    the statua with them, though this is not a practice lares encourage. Since
    the statuae are their anchors to the Material Plane, lares are insecure
    about exposing them to the outside world where they might be lost, stolen,
    or damaged. Summoning a Lar A tradtion said to have been created and passed
    down since the days of lost Azlant, many families, homes, and even shops and
    public buildings along the Inner Sea invite lares to take up residence,
    seeking the blessings of the divine. Few, however, know when their
    invitations have been accepted, though, as a lar might prove aloof for
    months or years as it gauges its new wards. In order to welcome such
    spirits, families construct tiny effigies called statuae in the shapes of
    honored ancestors, regional heroes, or fanciful creatures, in which the
    spirits might come and reside. These statuae are non-magical effigies,
    typically composed of stone or fine wood and anointed with fine lacquers and
    oils, requiring 2 days, a successful DC 20 Craft check, and 40 gp to create.
    Once created, these Diminuative figures typically have a hardness of 5 and
    10 hit points. If destroyed, a statua may be recreated in this same method.
    Summoning a lar is a more elaborate affair, requiring nightly prayers and
    small offerings of fruit, incense, flowers, and similar gifts to the
    statuae. For each night one prays to the figure for their home or family's
    protection there is a cumulative 1% chance a lar hears and turns its
    attention to the petitioner. This attention doesn't mean that a lar will aid
    a home, but merely that it has heard the prayer, and it might yet decide
    that its philosophies and virtues are incompatible with the supplicant. If
    such is the case, the lar quietly ignores the prayer, and the petitioner's
    chance to gain a lar's attention resets to 0%, all entirely unknown to the
    mortal. When a lar does accept an invitation, it may immediately plane shift
    to the associated statua, claiming it as its own. A lar typically makes some
    subtle acknowledgement that it has come, perhaps slightly altering its
    statua's appearance or lighting candles upon its arrival. It still often
    takes months, even years, for a lar to become intimate with a family and
    make its presence actively known, and some never do. Lares in Golarion Lares
    exhibit extremely variable personalities, and while some prove aloof even
    after centuries, others become gregarious members of their protected
    families. Noted here are just two such dichotomous lares rumored to guard
    sites in Golarion. Uncle Penates: When only the members of the Aphinius
    family of Taldor are present, their home's lar possesses the expensive
    painting within their drawing room. From its hidden statua just behind the
    painting, the boisterous spirit delights in animating the fine oils to make
    it appear as though the paunchy and opulently dressed Taldan nobleman
    pictured is personally relaxing and conversing with the family members
    nearby. None of the family know the nature of the effect, many believing the
    house is haunted by the spirit of their ancestor, but none fear or begrudge
    the presence of kind old Uncle Penates. Wolz: This lar has long lingered in
    the burnt-out ruin of an old stone cottage just east of Windsong Abby in
    Varisia. His wolfshaped statua having fallen beneath a pile of hearth
    stones, Wolz subtly watches over any goodly travelers who come to rest in
    the tiny ruin, lighting a fire, providing water, and warding off danger as
    if they were his long-lost family.
