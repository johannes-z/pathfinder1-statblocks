Description_Visual: >-
  This massive creature resembles a huge dragon composed of air and vapor. Its
  great wings are translucent and look like wisps of smoke. Its eyes are hollow
  sockets of mist though a glint of bright sunlight can occasionally be seen
  dancing across the surface. Its great tail appears as wisps of smoke or vapor
  and seems to trail off into nothingness.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Air Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against an
      elemental air dragon.
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      An elemental air dragon's breath weapon is a 50 ft. cone of superheated
      air.
  - name: Cyclone (Ex)
    description: >-
      By beating its wings rapidly back and forth, a hovering elemental air
      dragon can create a cyclone-like force of wind in a 30-foot radius around
      its body. This cyclone has the following effects: movement through the
      cyclone is one-quarter normal, ranged attacks suffer a -8 circumstance
      penalty in the area, and all nonmagical unprotected flames are
      automatically extinguished. Large or smaller creatures in the area must
      succeed on a DC 27 Reflex save or take 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage
      each round they remain in the area. Medium or smaller creatures in the
      area must succeed on a second Reflex save (same DC) or be knocked prone
      and back 1d4 x 10 feet, taking 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet.
      Flying creatures are automatically grounded in this area. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The Plane of Air is home to many creatures. Yet none are as feared as the
    elemental air dragons. Their great form and majestic aura strike fear into
    the bravest of souls. Elemental air dragons are as evil as their brethren
    (the other elemental dragons) and take joy and pride in swooping over a
    settlement or village and destroying it with their great wing buffet.
    Watching the frightened creatures flee in terror provokes some sort of
    perverse excitement in these dragons. Luckily, elemental air dragons rarely
    enter the Material Plane. Elemental air dragons dislike cloud dragons and
    mist dragons and seek to slay them whenever they are encountered. The
    average air elemental dragon is 30 feet long. Elemental air dragons attack
    by swooping on their prey, unleashing a blast of superheated air, and then
    flying away. An elemental air dragon rarely, if ever, touches the ground. It
    often employs its cyclone buffet to knock more powerful creatures prone,
    then swoops in to blast them with its breath weapon or rend them with its
    claws and bite. Copyright Notice Author Scott Greene.
