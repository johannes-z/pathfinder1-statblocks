    description: >-
      Black Rot: This highly infectious disease affects the skin and muscles of
      the victim, creating an accelerated gangrenous process that turns the
      affected tissue black and eats it away. For every 4 points of Con damage
      sustained by the victim, a random limb is lost and can only be recovered
      by regeneration or similar magic. Black Rot: Swarm- contact; save DC 29
      Fort; onset immediate; frequency 1/ day; effect 1d6 Con damage, 1d6 Dex
      damage, and 1d3 Cha damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Dexterity-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Living diseases are swarms of microscopic organisms, harmful bacteria or
    viruses that have supernaturally gained limited sentience as a cohesive
    swarm under certain exceedingly foul or magical conditions. They seek out
    hosts through which to propagate their contagion. Though they are considered
    swarms, their individual components are so small as to be invisible to
    unaided sight, exponentially smaller than even Fine creatures, and they are
    thus considered one Medium creature. They are only visible at all due to the
    sheer number of individual organisms that comprise the swarm; literally
    billions of them make up a single living disease.
  - >-
    Living diseases offer no resistance to items or creatures entering their
    midst and cannot be physically felt. They make no sound whatsoever. A living
    disease in the dark is terrible indeed, as there is no indication it is
    present until its effects are first felt.
  - >-
    Living diseases neither see nor sleep. Their movements are by pure instinct,
    and they locate potential hosts with their lifesense. Because of their
    resilience and extremely high reproductive rate, the microorganisms of a
    living disease give it fast healing 10.
  - >-
    Though extremely rare, there are many different kinds of living diseases -
    potentially as many kinds as there are diseases. Two in particular are
    described here: festering lung and black rot.
  - >-
    A living disease seeks to surround any potential host it senses. It
    instinctively avoids undead, oozes, plants and constructs, which do not make
    suitable hosts for the spreading of disease. Unlike normal swarms, a living
    disease does not deal physical damage. Instead it exposes any creature whose
    space it occupies at the end of its move to its form of disease.
