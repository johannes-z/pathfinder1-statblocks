Description_Visual: >-
  This creature is about the size of a large gorilla. Its fur is long and
  yellowish-green in alternating splotches. Its shoulders are hunched and it has
  a forward-thrusting, pig-like head. Razor-sharp teeth line its mouth. Its four
  forelimbs sprout from its body-two from the hunched back and the other two
  from high on the hindquarters. A fifth limb grows from the middle of its back.

  - name: Sound Imitation (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a squealer can mimic any animal or magical beast sound
      it has previously heard. Listeners who succeed on a DC 16 Will save detect
      the ruse. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Squealers are carnivorous predators found in dense forests. They are
    voracious creatures and spend a good part of their day hunting food. A
    squealer attacks using its bite and claws. One of its favorite tactics is to
    hide in a tree, grasping a limb with three of its claws. When prey passes
    beneath, it swings down to attack. If it can grapple its prey, it drops from
    the tree, raking with its hind legs.
  - >-
    Squealers communicate with others of their kind using a series of grunts,
    growls, and squeals. They cannot speak any known language. A typical
    squealer stands 9 feet tall and weighs about 400 pounds.
