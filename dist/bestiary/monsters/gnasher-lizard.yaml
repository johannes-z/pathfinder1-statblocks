Description_Visual: >-
  This 10-foot long stone-colored lizard has a large, wide gaping maw filled
  with double rows of dagger-like teeth. Its head is large and flat and sports a
  ridge of hardened bone that runs the length of its head before tapering off
  near the middle of its back. Its four legs end in large, flat clawed feet.

    description: >-
      If the gnasher lizard rolls a natural 20 on its attack roll, and
      subsequently confirms the critical hit, it severs the head of its
      opponent. This attack is effective on creatures up to one size larger than
      the gnasher lizard.
Description:
  - >-
    The gnasher is a deadly predator that often roams up to 3 miles from its
    lair in search of prey. Though its appearance lends to the faÃ§ade of being a
    slow moving lizard, it is in fact, rather graceful and quick. Those that
    make the mistake of assuming the gnasher is slow-moving rarely live to tell
    others of their mistake.
  - >-
    Gnasher lizards make their lairs in stony areas, typically forest clearings
    or mountain terrain, usually near (within several hundred feet if possible)
    a water source. They are carnivorous creatures and highly territorial, even
    attacking their own kind if one gnasher lizard intrudes upon the territory
    of another. Gnashers are solitary creatures and only come together to mate
    (during the spring or early summer months). Mating season is the only time
    more than one of these creatures is encountered together, and once the
    mating ritual is ended, each goes its own way. The female lays a clutch of
    1d4+2 eggs which hatch within 3 months. Young reach maturity within 8 months
    and are left to their own devices.
  - >-
    A gnasher lizard is typically 10 feet long but can grow to a length of 20
    feet or more. A typical gnasher weighs about 1,000 pounds. Though most are
    stone gray, some variants encountered have been colored greenishbrown or
    black. Its long fang-like teeth are razor-sharp and it uses these to tear
    its prey into pieces.
  - >-
    Gnasher lizards typically attack from ambush, using their surroundings to
    conceal themselves and springing out at the last second to catch their
    opponents by surprise. Gnashers attack any creature that wanders into their
    territory, including those larger than themselves, relying on their vorpal
    bite to quickly dispatch such creatures.
  - >-
    When it swallows a foe, a gnasher lizard typically holds it in its stomach
    for several rounds before regurgitating it into its mouth, snapping down on
    it with its razor-sharp teeth and then swallowing it again.
