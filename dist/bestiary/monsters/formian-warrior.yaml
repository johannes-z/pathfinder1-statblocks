    description: >-
      Once a formian warrior has acted in a combat, all allied formians within
      the hive mind are no longer considered flat-footed. When a formian warrior
      attacks a creature in melee, allied formians gain a +2 insight bonus on
      melee attack rolls against that creature until the start of the warrior's
      next turn.
  - name: Deadly Grasp (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a formian warrior has a foe grappled, it deals sting damage when it
      succeeds at a grapple check to damage its opponent.

Description:

    Composing the fighting caste of the hive, formian warriors grow from grubs
    hatched in the flesh of carnivores and similar fierce creatures. All are
    sterile females, although in rare circumstances they spontaneously become
    fertile after the death of their queen. In the rigid hierarchy of the
    formian hive, they rank above the worker caste and below all others. Allowed
    independent initiative to better hone their battle skills, formian warriors
    have more latitude in following commands than many other formians. Owing to
    this latitude, formian warriors are more likely to chafe under hive
    strictures than workers and taskmasters. All formian warriors ultimately
    answer to the myrmarch caste and, through them, to the queen. Beneath this
    layer of command, the warriors have a command structure of their own.
    Formian warriors advance in rank through a complicated formula that
    references their achievements in battle, personal prowess, and years of
    service to the hive. Formian warriors engrave their chitin with insignia
    depicting their rank and notable deeds. A disgraced warrior has her markings
    gouged out and her stinger torn away. Formian warriors stand 7 feet tall and
    weigh 200 pounds. Their carapaces resemble suits of armor as much as
    insects' exoskeletons but cannot be enhanced with magic as if they were
    armor. The striped patterns of a formian warrior vary from individual to
    individual, although formians belonging to the same hive usually bear
    similar markings. Warriors mature quickly and have short life spans,
    becoming too infirm to fight around 15 years of age. Old warriors are
    expected to end their lives for the good of the hive, either by taking on a
    fatal mission or through voluntary starvation. A few of the most exceptional
    warriors receive permission to live out their remaining years as teachers
    and drill instructors, passing their skills on to new generations of formian
    warriors.
