Description_Visual: >-
  From a body like a strange crab sprouts the torso of a praying mantis, clad in
  coral-colored crustacean armor. Swaying hypnotically, it rattles razor-sharp
  claws and raises its long, rapier-like tail stinger.

    description: >-
      The multi-limbed nature of the crab half of the tetrolimulus allows it to
      ignore the effects of uneven or difficult terrain. This does not apply to
      terrain magically manipulated to impede movement.
Description:
  - >-
    A terrifying mix of prehistoric arthropod and heavily armored mantis, the
    tetrolimulus is the stuff of nightmares for shipwrecked and abandoned
    mariners. Plated with a spiny crustacean exoskeleton, the upper body of the
    tetrolimulus is reminiscent of a very robust kind of mantis. Its raptorial
    forelimbs, folded as if in prayer, flash forward with frightening speed and
    precision to brutally slice opponents before they have had a chance to act.
    Captains and mutineers alike are quick to remind their enemies of these
    deadly claws and the creature's other name, the "beach guillotine," for the
    brutal justice it exacts on those put ashore for choosing the wrong side in
    a mutiny.
  - >-
    With somewhat less panache, the tetrolimulus is often described as the
    "sea-mantis" because it resembles a crab's strong legs and shell merged with
    a mantis' powerful arms. Trailing behind is a scorpion's deadly stinger. The
    creature's durable, spiked shell covers five pairs of blade-like legs that
    work together to produce remarkable speeds even through challenging terrain.
    Truly a master of the beaches, the tetrolimulus has caught many mariners off
    guard with a blazing charge over varied terrain, perforating a noiseless
    trail through wet sand, then clattering over rocks with the sound of dice
    thrown across a table.
  - >-
    Its final and most dangerous terror, held upright and waved like a regal
    scepter in combat, is the tetrolimulus's tail stinger. The stinger is razor
    sharp along its outer edge, but its neat incisions are nowhere near as
    dangerous as the poison that coats its blade. Those who succumb to a dose of
    poison-called tetrodotoxin-are soon to be a meal for the sea-mantis. Muscle
    spasms and cramps accompany a gradual slowing of movement, hinting at
    oncoming paralysis and the agony of a neat butchering while still alive for
    easy consumption. One of nature's cruelest poisons, tetrodotoxin is a
    popular tool of the Red Mantis assassins, who appreciate both the poison's
    painful efficacy and the mantis-form of its progenitor.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Out of the water, the tetrolimulus adopts an unusual swaying movement of the
    upper body. Although its purpose is not entirely clear, it is thought that,
    much like the land-dwelling mantis, the movement enhances the creature's
    primitive vision and makes picking out prey by its own relative movement
    easier. It has been suggested that remaining completely still when
    confronted by a tetrolimulus may prevent detection, but none have been able
    to confirm the success of this tactic, and there are none who are confident
    enough of the theory to test it in the field.
  - >-
    Female tetrolimuluses, the hunters of the species, are by far the more
    aggressive. Rarely seen, males live in deeper waters as bottom feeders,
    emerging only in the mating season in early spring. At this time for a few
    days each year, both sexes make great journeys, sometimes of hundreds of
    miles, to return to ancient coastal breeding grounds. Here dominant and
    aggressive females meet and mate with the strongest of the smaller and more
    delicate males. Only a small number of these males get a chance to breed,
    and an even smaller number survive to return to the oceans. The energy and
    effort of their travels exhaust the females, and once they've been
    impregnated, the easiest and closest source of food is the weaker males
    surrounding them. A fertilized female may even continue to exhibit signs of
    availability to encourage more males to approach her- not for reproduction,
    but to satisfy her more immediate hunger.
  - >-
    Young are born at sea, and perhaps as payment for their strength and power
    later in life, they spend their first few months at the bottom of the food
    chain. Without the thick shells of maturity, they are easy prey, which
    contributes a great deal to population control of their species. As their
    shells thicken and harden, they start to enjoy a less harried existence, and
    by 6 months old they start to fight back. They reach maturity in 12 to 18
    months and can live for up to 50 years.
  - >-
    Tetrolimuluses' behavior is largely instinct-driven, but during the breeding
    season the normally nomadic creatures will fight viciously to protect the
    shores of their ancestral breeding grounds. Even male sea-mantises rise to
    combat, though at sea they more commonly flee than risk confrontation.
  - >-
    Females can be found in the area of the Abendego Gulf, from Mediogalti
    Island all the way into the Shackles and as far north as the Sodden Lands.
    Even Rahadoum has seen the occasional tetrolimulus washed ashore to the
    south, where the creatures are feared as the twisted manifestations of
    Achaekek, conjured for worship by the Red Mantis and a stark reminder of the
    folly of religious devotion. There are descriptions of creatures similar to
    the tetrolimulus to the north, even into the Inner Sea, but these stories
    are as old and leaky as the ships of the pirates and traders who tell them
    and no reports of tetrolimuluses along the cost of Cheliax, for example, are
    younger than two generations.
  - >-
    Much of tetrolimuluses' bulk is armor, and despite their size they can
    survive on relatively small quantities of food. In perhaps the only mark of
    intelligence in their species, they try to avoid overfishing, instead
    roaming over several miles of coastline to balance their Ecology. The
    majority of their diet is fish and cephalopods, but they are competent
    trackers and follow hints of habitation on their beaches to devour any
    coast-dwelling mammals foolish enough to find themselves on the beaches,
    including humanoids. Like most animals, tetrolimuluses tend to avoid large
    settlements or areas frequently visited by humans. Remote or inaccessible
    beaches are the females' preferred habitat, but occasionally a powerful
    storm rolling out of the Eye of Abendego can toss them on more popular or
    even populous coastlines. Surprisingly high concentrations of the creatures
    are found around Mediogalti Island and its outlying cluster. Some suggest
    this is due to deliberate cultivation by the Red Mantis, thanks to the
    tetrolimulus's favorable form, but it may simply be because the treacherous
    waters and hidden coves are perfect for their reclusive lifestyle, and the
    frequent mutinies, shipwrecks, and foolish adventurers provide a varied and
    ample diet for the brutal predators.
  - Tetrodotoxin
  - >-
    While none are stupid enough to actively farm sea-mantises, occasionally the
    corpse of one is washed up into the more accessible bays on the coasts of
    the Shackles or Mediogalti Island. Some of the more enterprising residents
    of Ilizmagorti have developed a method of harvesting the cruel tetrodotoxin
    poison, from which the tetrolimulus gets its name, for sale to the assassins
    of the Red Mantis.
  - >-
    A single dose of tetrodotoxin sells for 1,300 gp. Its rarity and potency
    make it a valuable product, and prices outside the Shackles or Mediogalti
    Island can be 50-100% higher.
  - >-
    One dose of poison can be harvested from the corpse of a tetrolimulus,
    provided the lower half of the creature is intact. This requires a DC 25
    Survival check, and even those who usually find themselves competent at
    skinning or gutting creatures struggle with the intricacies of the sharp
    tail stinger. In harvesting the tetrodotoxin poison, those without the
    poison use ability are subject to the standard 5% chance of self-poisoning.
