Description:
  - >-
    Petromins, also known as azure gliders, are desert cliff-top dwellers that
    glide down to snatch prey. As a defense, their coloration is countershaded;
    the blue, sky-like coloration on their undersides makes them hard to notice
    from the ground, while their brown fur helps them blend into desert vistas
    below, hiding them from predatory birds. The fur of petromins is awash in
    sapphire-blue bioluminescence, unnoticeable during the day but distinctive
    from dusk until dawn. Petromins have control over this natural light, which
    allows them to attract the large insects on which they feed. A petromin
    measures 30 inches in length (including a 6-inch-long tail) and weighs 5
    pounds. A spellcaster can select a petromin as a familiar, and the master
    gains a +3 bonus on Stealth checks as a special ability.
