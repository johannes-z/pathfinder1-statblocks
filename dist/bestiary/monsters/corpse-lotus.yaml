SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    description: >-
      A corpse lotus can blend in exceptionally well with vegetated areas when
      not taking any actions. A creature must make a successful DC 20 Perception
      check to recognize a corpse lotus for what it is before the corpse lotus
      attacks the first time.
  - name: Digest Corpse (Su)
    description: >-
      A corpse lotus can consume a corpse to quickly heal damage it has taken.
      As a standard action, a corpse lotus can swallow any corpse (but not a
      skeleton) within reach to grant itself fast healing 5 for 1 minute. Any
      creature killed by a corpse lotus's swallow whole ability automatically
      triggers this ability. A corpse lotus must wait until 1 minute after its
      fast healing has ended before it can use this ability again.
  - name: Preserving Mists (Su)
    description: >-
      Corpse lotuses emanate a fine mist that spreads across the ground to a
      range of 30 feet. Any corpse within this area is affected as if by gentle
      repose.

      A corpse lotus's vines are primary natural attacks with the grab ability.
      A corpse lotus doesn't gain the grappled condition when grappling enemies
      with its vines
Description:
  - >-
    A corpse lotus begins life as a small flowering plant that blooms near
    carrion, but given enough time, it can grow into an incredibly large and
    dangerous monstrosity. This terrifying plant possesses grasping vines
    capable of pummeling opponents before dragging them toward its beaklike maw.
    Always found where prey or corpses are abundant, corpse lotuses have been
    known to grow in dungeons, ruins, and battlefields in addition to more
    typical wooded locales.
  - >-
    Every corpse lotus has a single bulbous flower in its center, similar in
    shape to a lotus flower. The blossom's dark petals are streaked with
    blood-red pigment, and hide an acidic maw in their center. Corpse lotuses in
    different regions tend to resemble the dominant plant species in the
    surrounding area (with the exception of its distinct petals), thus granting
    the plants natural camouf lage and enabling them to hide among the foliage.
    Their vines are thick and convulse violently when grasping at potential
    prey. Corpse lotuses gain their name from the garden of dead bodies that
    frequently surrounds the plant- typically animals or humanoids that strayed
    too close to the lotus. At rest, a corpse lotus can reach 8 feet in height
    and splay its leaves nearly 15 feet around.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Despite being rooted in the ground, corpse lotuses are dangerous predators.
    While they derive sustenance from sunlight and water, their favored food is
    fresh meat, which provides enough nutrition for these plants to reach
    behemoth proportions. Any creature that wanders too near a corpse lotus
    risks being dragged in by the plant's vines toward its hungry center. The
    lotus's enormous, exotically patterned petals guard the flower's gaping maw,
    which is coated in a thick layer of acidic mucus to prevent prey from
    escaping. This mucus exudes a sweet, fruity aroma that attracts many kinds
    of animals toward the lotus.
  - >-
    While the corpses that gradually pile up around a corpse lotus would
    normally eventually block out the plant's sweet odor, corpse lotuses emit a
    fine, supernatural mist that rolls along the ground around them and
    preserves their slain bounty. The mist has no color or aroma, and indeed can
    go completely unnoticed without the aid of magical detection. The anti-aging
    properties of this mist magically halt the process of decay on the collected
    corpses, leaving them in much the same state in which they died. Botanists
    and scholars have attempted to harness the powers of a corpse lotus's
    preserving mist for restorative elixirs and life-prolonging potions, but the
    strange vapors have proven useful only for embalming those already deceased.
  - >-
    The preserved corpses surrounding a corpse lotus also help to attract
    carrion feeders such as vultures, owls, and beetles to the hungry plant.
    Rather than decimating these flying scavengers, however, corpse lotuses have
    evolved to let aerial feeders pass, so that they may inadvertently consume
    corpse lotus seeds and redistribute them near and far. This is the corpse
    lotuses' primary means of reproduction. The fact that corpse lotuses of any
    kind- including the more mundane, miniature variety-can be used to pollinate
    corpse lotus seeds makes this form of reseeding particularly effective.
  - >-
    A corpse lotus's single, large flower sprouts from a tangled mess of vines
    and roots near the center of the plant. The flower's petals are surprisingly
    thick and resilient, guarding the plant both from the elements and from
    anything that may struggle to escape its grasp. Its vast root system extends
    for almost 50 feet into the soil, making the plant extremely difficult to
    uproot, but thankfully also ensuring that the plant is immobile, other than
    its vines. While most of the vines that sprout from a corpse lotus are
    harmless and are merely used to transmit information about the plant's
    surroundings to the center blossom, four larger, much stronger vines extend
    from the flower and allow the lotus to manipulate corpses, snatch prey, and
    defend from attacks. These fibrous vines are roughly 10 inches thick, 25
    feet long, and incredibly difficult to sever.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Corpse lotuses can be found in forests, jungles, and marshes the world over,
    though they thrive in wooded areas that are heavily populated or at least
    close to humanoid settlements. A corpse lotus's seeds are carried in the
    preserving mist that seeps from the plant's base. These seeds cling to any
    creatures that venture too near a corpse lotus, and given enough time create
    a fine film around fallen prey. Practiced adventurers can recognize this
    film as a telltale sign of a nearby corpse lotus.
  - >-
    Depending on the amount of available meat nearby, a corpse lotus may never
    grow into the deadly goliath presented here; many remain small,
    unintelligent flowers. It is possible for a newly sprouted corpse lotus to
    reach its full maturity in a matter of months if it has access to an ample
    food supply. In less desirable situations, it can take up to 6 years for one
    to reach full size.
  - >-
    Upon reaching maturity, a corpse lotus develops a modicum of intelligence on
    par with clever beasts. This intelligence allows the lotus to distinguish
    carrion feeders from prey and to ration its food stores during lean times. A
    corpse lotus deprived of meat may eventually dwindle back down to a mindless
    small flower. Corpse lotuses don't attack other plants, oozes, or constructs
    unless they are attacked first.
  - >-
    Corpse lotuses are not often hunted, but must occasionally be removed from
    heavily traff icked areas. In some cases, bold entrepreneurs or daring
    herbalists cultivate corpse lotuses as personal guardians or as symbols of
    strength. Particularly heinous cultivators may replant corpse lotuses in
    bare dungeon chambers, outf itting the chambers' ceilings with trapdoors
    that drop unsuspecting intruders straight onto these hungry plants.
