    Known to some as sea scorpions, eurypterids are aquatic crustaceans that
    blur the line between their terrestrial cousins and lobsters. Primeval and
    voracious, these vermin range in size from relatively harmless ochre
    eurypterids the size of a dog up to the truly immense spitting eurypterids.
    There are even rumors of yet larger beasts, called whaleeating eurypterids
    by sailors. Regardless of their size, all share one thing in common-an
    aggressive attitude. Eurypterids lash out at anything that might be food,
    and once they've tasted prey, are single-minded in their pursuit. Although
    quite at home in the open sea, most eurypterids are capable of scuttling
    around on land and can exist out of water indefinitely. Unlike rats,
    eurypterids don't spread disease or cause much damage to most cargos-traits
    that have led some captains to experiment with seeding colonies of ochre
    eurypterids in their holds to keep rodent populations under control. Alas,
    one can often tell the ships that use this tactic by the unusually high
    number of crewmen with missing fingers.
