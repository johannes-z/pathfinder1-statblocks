Description_Visual: >-
  Perhaps no creature of the water is feared more than the piranha. Lightning
  speed, coupled with vicious teeth and a pack-slaughter mentality place this
  predator firmly at the top of the food chain. Whether swarming together to
  take down larger prey, or developing wings to attack land creatures, the
  ravenous piranha cannot be stopped.

Description:
  - >-
    This large grouping of piranha is a fearsome sight. While individual piranha
    are frightening enough, the piranha swarm attacks as a single-minded mass of
    predatory fish. With lining speed, a piranha swarm can strip the flesh of a
    Large creature in seconds.
