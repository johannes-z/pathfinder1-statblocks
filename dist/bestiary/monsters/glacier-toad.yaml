Description:
  - >-
    Glacier toads are strange, magical cousins of the more common giant toads.
    None can say for certain whether they were bred, or evolved from exposure to
    elemental energies. Glacier toads have no practical use for most treasure,
    but have a fondness for shiny objects like gems and glowing items.
