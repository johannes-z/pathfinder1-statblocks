SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Constrict (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because it seizes its victims by the neck, a creature in the hangman
      tree's grasp cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.
  - name: Hallucinatory Spores (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a hangman tree can release a cloud of spores in a
      50-foot radius spread. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Will
      save or be affected as if by a charm monster spell for 2d6 minutes.
      Affected creatures believe the tree to be of some ordinary sort (or to be
      a treant or other such friendly tree creature). An affected creature
      becomes passive and refuses to attack the hangman tree during this time.
      This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. An affected creature can attempt a new Will save (DC
      19, +1 per previous save) each round. A creature that makes its save
      cannot be affected by the hallucinatory spores of that hangman's tree for
      24 hours.
  - name: Paralyzed by Cold (Ex)
    description: Cold-based effects paralyze a hangman tree as if by a hold person spell.
  - name: Slowed by Darkness (Ex)
    description: >-
      Spells that generate darkness (such as darkness or deeper darkness) slow
      the hangman's tree (as the slow spell) for 1 round per caster level.
  - name: Vines (Ex)
    description: >-
      The vines of a hangman tree have 10 hit points and can be attacked by
      making a successful sunder attempt. Attacking a hangman tree's vine does
      not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the vine is currently grappling a
      target, the hangman tree takes a -4 penalty on its opposed attack roll to
      resist the sunder attempt. Severing a vine deals no damage to a hangman
      tree.
Description:
  - >-
    Close inspection reveals a scar-like marking on the lower part of the trunk
    of this tree; this is where undigested creatures or gear is expelled after
    digestion. Hidden among the hangman tree's branches and leaves are its
    rope-like appendages that it uses to trap its prey. The hangman tree attacks
    by dropping its noose-like appendages around prey and yanking victims
    upwards. Trapped prey is held until it dies or is dropped into the hangman's
    trunk where it is digested. Credit The Hangman Tree originally appeared in
