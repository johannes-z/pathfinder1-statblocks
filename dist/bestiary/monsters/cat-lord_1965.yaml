Group: Animal Lord
Source: PFRPG Bestiary 3
IsTemplate: 1
Description:
  - >-
    When the gods of nature or powerful spirits desire a champion to defend the
    animal world, they invest a token of their power in a chosen vessel-be it
    animal or humanoid. Traditionally, only one animal lord for a specific
    animal
  - >-
    species is active on a world at any one time, although sometimes, when an
    extant animal lord strays from its charge or otherwise fails, the force that
    created it might create a replacement to send against the fallen animal lord
    to challenge it in a combat to the death, with the victor claiming the right
    to rule or a chance at redemption.
  - >-
    An animal lord does not dwell among humanity-the wild is its domain. How an
    animal lord interacts with a humanoid society largely depends on how that
    society treats the animals of that lord's affinity. Societies that honor and
    respect those animals, even if they use the animals as a food source, earn
    the animal lord's (sometimes grudging) respect, but those who abuse or
    otherwise harm animals of that lord's species find a powerful and ardent
    enemy in the lord.
  - >-
    The cat lord above uses a leopard as the base animal- this particular cat
    lord represents a newly created animal lord. The longer an animal lord
    exists, the higher its level should be.
  - CREATING AN ANIMAL LORD
  - >-
    "Animal Lord" is an inherited template that can be added to any humanoid of
    10 Hit Dice or more, referred to hereafter as the base creature. The animal
    lord also gains the characteristics of one type of animal (of a size no
    larger than one step larger than the base creature's size), referred to
    hereafter as the base animal.
  - 'CR: Same as the base creature or the base animal (whichever is higher) +2.'
  - 'Alignment: Any neutral.'
  - >-
    Type: The base creature's type changes to outsider (native, shapechanger).
    Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.
  - >-
    Senses: An animal lord gains the senses of both the base creature and the
    base animal in both of its forms.
  - >-
    AC: An animal lord gains the base animal or base creature's natural armor
    bonus, whichever is higher, in both of its forms-this bonus is increased by
    +2 to determine the animal lord's actual natural armor bonus.
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: An animal lord gains DR 10/silver. It also gains all of
    the base animal's defensive abilities in both of its forms.
  - >-
    Speed: An animal lord's base speed is that of its base creature form or its
    base animal form, whichever is greater. Animal lords whose base animal has a
    burrow, climb, fly, or swim speed can use that mode of movement even in
    humanoid form, instantly growing the necessary appendages as necessary.
  - >-
    Melee: An animal lord in humanoid form can instantaneously transform parts
    of its body to make all of the natural attacks possessed by the base animal.
    An animal lord typically prefers to use its natural attacks in melee combat,
    but often carries manufactured ranged weapons to diversify its combat
    options as well.
  - >-
    Special Attacks: An animal lord gains all of the special attacks possessed
    by the base animal and can employ them in both humanoid and animal form. It
    also gains abilities determined by its species affinity (see below).
  - >-
    Ability Scores: Animal lords use the higher ability score between the base
    creature and the base animal as their base ability scores, then increase all
    of these ability scores by +4.
  - >-
    Skills: An animal lord gains all of the base animal's racial modifiers to
    skill checks.
  - 'Special Qualities: An animal lord gains the following special qualities.'
  - >-
    Change Shape (Su): An animal lord has two forms-a humanoid and an animal
    form. When an animal lord in humanoid form uses the base animal's defensive
    abilities, movement types, attacks, and other features, the animal lord's
    body instantaneously changes as appropriate to allow the use of that
    ability, growing wings or claws or fangs as necessary. The animal lord can
    use this ability to take the shape of the base animal (as shapechange) as a
    move action.
  - >-
    Dominion (Su): In both forms, an animal lord is treated as if constantly
    under the effects of a speak with animals spell, but this only applies to
    creatures of the animal lord's species affinity (see below). In addition, an
    animal lord can cast charm animal on any animal of its affinity as a
    spell-like ability at will (CL equals the animal lord's HD).
  - Species Affinity
  - >-
    Animal lords can be made from almost any creature of the animal type, but
    most are grouped into larger categories known as species affinities. The
    most common animal lord kingdom affinities are detailed below, but many
    others exist. Animals listed in parenthesis list typical base animals for
    that lord.
