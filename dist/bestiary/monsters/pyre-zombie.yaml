  steps. After a few steps, it bursts into flames that lick its entire body,
  although it does not seem harmed in the slightest bit.

    description: >-
      The pyre zombie may immolate itself 1/day to cause 2d6 fire damage to all
      creatures in a 5 ft. radius for 2 rounds. If a pyre zombie is reduced to 0
      hot points, it immediately explodes for 1d6 points of fire damage in a 10
      ft. radius. Non-Staggered (Ex) Pyre zombies do not gain the staggered
      condition as normal zombies.
Description:
  - >-
    Pyre zombies are the sad, tortured remains of those who were killed just
    before being burned alive. When the soul departed, their body was taken over
    by some malignant spirit. The spirit fortified the body from destruction by
    the fire, and the undead form escape the pyre to wreak its vengeance on the
    living.
  - Pyre zombies are not harmed by fire, but neither do they seek it out.
