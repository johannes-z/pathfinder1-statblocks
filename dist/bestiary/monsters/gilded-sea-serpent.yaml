Description:
  - >-
    One of the rarest of sea serpents, the gilded serpent is known for its
    glittering golden hide, and is often hunted for this skin, and for the
    powerful narcotic that can be made from its venom. In the wild, gilded sea
    serpents live on the most secluded islands and hidden lagoons, where they
    nest in sandy lairs and shallow, sun-warmed waters. Wealthy coastal lords
    have been known to acquire gilded sea serpent eggs or infants and raised
    them captivity. These serpents are usually revered as holy or prized as
    status symbols; captive gilded serpents that are mistreated quickly lose the
    will to live and die. The golden hide of a gilded serpent can be harvested
    and made into a single set of scale mail that fits a Medium or smaller
    creature. This armor is considered masterwork, and has the same properties
    as mithral scale armor. The poison of the gilded serpent can be milked or
    harvested as well, then made into a powerful narcotic drug called golden
    bliss (see sidebar). Gilded sea serpents flee danger when they can, using
    their ability to swim swiftly to evade danger as quickly as possible. If
    cornered or surprised, however, they lash out with their bite, and use their
    constriction attack if their prey is small enough. The venom of a gilded sea
    serpent numbs the flesh to pain and induces a state of catatonic stupor.
    Golden Bliss This drug is made from the venom of a gilded sea serpent. A
    serpent that is milked of its venom produces enough poison to make 2d4 doses
    of golden bliss per day. This requires a DC 15 Craft (alchemy or poison)
    check. When inhaled, the drug produces a euphoric catatonia and provides
    complete protection against mind-influencing magic and psionic incursion.

    Effects 1d3x10 minutes; +4 Charisma, immunity to mind-affecting effects and
    psionic incursion. Damage 4 Wisdom damage Copyright Notice Authors Scott
