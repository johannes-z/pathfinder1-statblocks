Description_Visual: >-
  Patches of fur cover the sickly flesh of this gangly, muscular, hyena-headed
  biped. Its swollen eyes blaze with madness.
Group: Demon
Source: Broken Chains
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Break Bones (Ex)
    description: >-
      Whenever a yaenit scores a critical hit with its bite attack, its opponent
      must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or have its base land speed reduced
      by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet). This penalty remains until the
      affected creature takes any amount of magical healing or is healed with a
      successful DC 20 Heal check. The save DC is Strength-based.
  - name: Hallucinatory Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature coming within 20 feet of a yaenit must succeed at a DC 17
      Will save or succumb to the demon's foul, mind-warping magic. A creature
      affected by a yaenit's hallucinatory aura takes a -2 penalty on Will
      saves, caster level checks, Intelligence-based skill checks, and
      Wisdom-based skill checks for as long as it remains within the aura's
      range and 1d4-1 rounds after leaving the area of effect. This is a
      mind-affecting effect. Whether or not the save was successful, an affected
      creature is immune to the same yaenit's hallucinatory aura for 24 hours.
      The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Violent progenitors of Lamashtu's earthly broods, the yaenit demons' purpose
    is to protect Lamashtu's priestesses and their unholy spawn. Yaenits rise
    from the souls of evil mortals who in life were exceptionally cruel bullies
    and tormentors of weaker companions, associates, minions, and siblings.
    Their resemblance to gnolls is no mere coincidence, as many yaenits take
    form from the spirits of gnolls in the Abyss. Gnolls, for their part, revere
    yaenits as embodiments of Lamashtu's foul will, and worship these demons as
    representatives of both the Mother of Monsters and her unholy designs for
    the devoted gnoll followers who please her.
  - >-
    Terrifying predators, yaenits' deceptively stooped and gangly physiques
    belie the 300 pounds of knotted and powerful muscle tied to their solid,
    black bones. The average yaenit is 6-1/2 feet tall.
