    description: >-
      A stegocentipede raises its spine-plates during combat, and moves rapidly
      back and forth while attacking. Creatures in a space adjacent to a
      stegocentipede must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save each time they attack
      it or take 2d8+2 points of damage from the spine-plates, whether the
      attack was successful or not. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Stegocentipedes are rumored among sages to have come to the Material Plane
    from another plane or dimension, though no proof has been found to support
    this theory. Whatever their origin, they are greatly feared by adventurers
    and other dungeon dwelling denizens for their poisonous bite and sting.
  - >-
    A stegocentipede raises its spines instinctively when it enters combat and
    rushes its prey. Opponents are bitten and stung to death.
  - >-
    A typical stegocentipede is 18 feet long. A stegocentipede ranges in color
    from brown to green.
