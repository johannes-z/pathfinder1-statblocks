    description: >-
      As a full-round action, an alpluachra can crawl into the mouth of a
      helpless creature (no more than three size categories larger than itself)
      and implant itself into the creature's throat. Once implanted, anything
      that the creature ingests is instead consumed by the alpluachra, including
      such substances as elixirs and potions or ingested alchemical items,
      diseases, drugs, or poisons. Once the alpluachra is implanted, the host
      creature begins suffering the effects of starvation and thirst (Pathfinder
      RPG Core Rulebook 444). Due in part to its numbing slime, an implanted
      alpluachra is difficult to detect. Each time the host creature ingests
      anything, it gains an automatic Perception check against the alpluachra's
      Stealth. After the newtlike fey is detected, it can be removed either by
      consuming at least half a pound of salt or a gallon of salt water, by a
      remove disease spell cast on the host creature, or by treating the host
      with a successful DC 15 Heal check. When a Heal check made for this
      purpose fails by 5 or more, the host creature takes 1d6 points of damage.
      If the host attempts to remove the alpluachra by eating salt or drinking
      salt water, it must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or become sickened
      for 1d8 hours from the reaction with the alpluachra. If the alpluachra
      dies or becomes unconscious, it is immediately detected by the host
      creature, and can be removed safely as a full-round action. While
      implanted, an alpluachra is considered helpless.
  - name: Numbing Slime (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature that deals damage to an alpluachra with a natural attack or
      an unarmed strike, comes into contact with an alpluachra, or is host to an
      alpluachra must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or take a -4 penalty on
      all tactile Perception checks, as well as other skill checks requiring
      tactile senses (such as Disable Device and Sleight of Hand) for 24 hours.
      A host creature that fails this saving throw takes the penalty to detect
      the alpluachra implanted inside it. If the host creature succeeds at the
      saving throw, it can't be affected by the same alpluachra's numbing slime
      for another 24 hours.
  - name: Vulnerable to Salt (Ex)
    description: >-
      Half a pound of salt or a gallon of salt water poured over an alpluachra
      or consumed by a creature an alpluachra has implanted itself in deals 1d3
      points of damage to the alpluachra.
Description:
  - >-
    These strange and insatiable fey prowl bubbling brooks, sauntering streams,
    and slow-moving rivers in a constant pursuit of food, but the extremely lazy
    creatures often tire of hunting. Alpluachras find it much easier to slip
    down a sleeping creature's throat, fall asleep, and dream of fantastic
    feasts and warm bubbling pools while its host does the eating for it.
    Because of this, alpluachras always keep an eye on riverbanks, looking for
    creatures napping near waterways. Once they find potential hosts,
    alpluachras stealthily slither up and slide down their snoring gullets. Once
    inside, an alpluachra rests along the walls of the esophagus and devours all
    the food that comes down the host's throat. The host often starves to death
    in the process, as the parasite becomes more ravenous over time. Despite
    their propensity to slowly kill their hosts, alpluachras are slothful rather
    than cruel. They have no concept of the harm they are doing, lazily enjoying
    the benefits while the host is still alive.
