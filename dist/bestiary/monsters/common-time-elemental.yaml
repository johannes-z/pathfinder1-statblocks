SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alter Age (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a noble time elemental can age a creature simply by touching
      it (this requires a melee touch attack). If successful, the target must
      succeed on a Fortitude save or advance forward one aging step (from
      adulthood to middle age, from middle age to old, from old to venerable,
      and so on). If a character ages, he takes all the effects to his physical
      ability scores, but does not gain any of the bonuses to his mental ability
      scores. A venerable creature affected by this ability dies (from massive
      cell death) and cannot be restored to life by mortal magic. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Alternately, a time elemental can use its alter age
      ability to reduce a character's age. If the target is unwilling, the time
      elemental must succeed on a melee touch attack. An unwilling target can
      make a Fortitude save to avoid the effects. If the save fails, the target
      ages one age step backwards (from middle age to adulthood for example) and
      gains all bonuses to physical ability scores from his new age (simply flip
      the penalties listed on the aging table into an equal numbered bonus). A
      character that regresses in age does not reduce its mental ability scores.
      This ability does not affect a character that has died from old age. A
      time elemental can also use this ability to age vegetable matter 10-200
      years (older or younger) or mineral matter 100-2,000 years (older or
      younger). Royal time elementals can use this ability twice per day.
  - name: Cell Death (Ex)
    description: >-
      Damage dealt by a time elemental's slam attack does not heal naturally
      (but it can still be healed magically). Additionally, a creature slain by
      a time elemental can only be raised through the successful casting of a
      miracle, true resurrection, or wish spell.
  - name: Foresight (Su)
    description: >-
      A time elemental can see a few seconds into the future. This ability
      prevents it from being surprised, caught flat-footed, or flanked. It also
      grants the time elemental an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom
      bonus. This ability can be negated, but the time elemental can restart it
      as a free action on its next turn.
  - name: Immunity to Temporal Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      Time elementals are immune to all time-related spells and effects
      (including time stop, temporal stasis, and the like). Note, the time stop
      ability of the noble and royal time elementals can affect those time
      elementals of lesser power (i.e., a noble can affect a common and a royal
      can affect a noble or common). Multi-Manifestation (Su) A time elemental
      exists in several other dimensions at any given time. As a standard
      action, it can bring forth 1d4 of these manifestations to its current
      locale in order to gain multiple attacks that round. Treat each
      manifestation as a separate time elemental with hit points equal to the
      time elemental's current hit points. A manifestation cannot use any of the
      supernatural or spell-like abilities of the time elemental (a
      manifestation does however gain the time elemental's foresight ability). A
      time elemental cannot have more than four manifestations present at one
      time. Because each manifestation is a part of the time elemental that
      called them, a successful attack on the time elemental or any of its
      manifestations deals an equal amount of damage to them all.
  - name: Summon Time Elementals (Sp)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a royal time elemental can attempt to summon 1d4 common time
      elementals with a 70% chance of success or 1-2 noble time elementals with
      a 30% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level
      spell.
  - name: Temporal Displacement (Su)
    description: >-
      By making a melee touch attack against a foe, a noble or royal time
      elemental can remove that creature from the current time stream if it
      fails a Fortitude save. The save is Constitution-based. On a failed save,
      the creature disappears in a flash of white energy. For a number of
      minutes equal to the time elemental's Hit Dice, the displaced creature is
      effectively nonexistent. No form of magic, effect, or force can detect or
      aid such a creature. A displaced creature can attempt a Wisdom check (DC
      equal to the initial Fort DC) on its turn to break the effects and end the
      displacement. The save is Constitution-based. When the effect ends, the
      creature reappears in the same space it was in before being displaced. If
      the space is occupied when the creature returns, it is shunted aside to
      the first open space and takes no damage. A noble or royal time elemental
      can use this ability three times per day.
  - name: Time Jaunt (Su)
    description: >-
      A time elemental can slip through the time stream and appear anywhere on
      the same plane of existence as if by greater teleport. This ability
      transports the time elemental and up to four other creatures within a
      30-foot radius. Unwilling creatures can attempt a Will save to avoid being
      carried away. This ability is otherwise similar to the spell of the same
      name (caster level equal to the elemental's HD). The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Time Stop (Sp)
    description: >-
      Noble and royal time elementals can create an effect identical to a time
      stop spell once per day (caster level equals the time elemental's HD).
Description:
  - >-
    Time elementals are creatures from a plane most sages are unaware even
    exists. A time elemental is a powerful creature formed of pure time and
    matter such as is unknown to even the most learned of sages. It is unknown
    how or why time elementals enter the Material Plane, as they cannot be
    summoned using the standard summoning spells. Time elementals attack by
    forming misty or smoky arms from their forms and lashing at opponents or by
    spraying a fine mist onto their opponents so as to induce aging. Against
    particularly powerful opponents, a time elemental uses its alter age ability
    or (if of the royal sort) summons additional time elementals to its aid.
