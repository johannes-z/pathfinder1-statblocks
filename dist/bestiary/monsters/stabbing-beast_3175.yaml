Treasure: standard
Description_Visual: >-
  This cottage-sized scorpion-man moves with an eerie grace and an intelligent,
  murderous intent.
Group: The Stabbingbeast

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: s Reward (Su)
    description: >-
      If the Stabbing Beast's attack reduces a target to fewer than 0 hit
      points, the Beast immediately gains 2d6 temporary hit points. If the
      attack kills the target, the Beast immediately gains 3d8 temporary hit
      points. Neither aspect of this ability can heal the Stabbing Beast more
      than the maximum hit points of the target. The temporary hit points last
      for 1 hour.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Sting-injury; save Fort DC 26; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6
      Str; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Poison Stream (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Stabbing Beast can force a stream of poison from its stinger at a
      target as a ranged attack. The target must make a successful DC 26
      Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4+1 rounds. This attack has a range of
      180 feet with no range increment. The Beast can make this attack in place
      of a melee sting attack (for example, attacking twice with its weapons or
      claws and once with its poison stream).
  - name: Scorpion Mind (Ex)
    description: >-
      Though the Stabbing Beast is an intelligent outsider, its mind functions
      much like an augmented vermin's brain, granting it a +4 bonus on all
      saving throws against mind-affecting effects.
  - name: Scorpion Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Stabbing Beast can make a single melee attack as a standard action. If
      this attack hits, it deals damage normally, and the target's base land
      speed is reduced to 5 feet for 2 rounds unless it succeeds at a DC 21
      Fortitude saving throw.
  - name: Sudden Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      The Stabbing Beast is adept at moving quickly when its foes are surprised.
      During a surprise round, it may act as if it had a full round to act,
      rather than just one standard action.
Description:
  - >-
    The Stabbing Beast is the herald of Norgorber, the god of greed, murder,
    secrets, and poison. It is an incredibly dangerous predator, a creature of
    immense strength that uses its keen intellect and deadly poison to stalk and
    kill its prey. Its natural form is that of an huge scorpion, but it can also
    assume an armored humanoid shape suitable for stealth or interacting with
    Norgorber's followers. Though its main purpose for coming to Golarion is to
    kill, it has also been called to aid great thefts and bury terrible secrets.
  - >-
    The Stabbing Beast enjoys the company of mortals in the same way that a
    well-fed barn cat enjoys the company of mice. It sometimes "plays" with
    these toys, teaching them secrets of alchemy or assassination, though it
    just as often maims or kills them as it sees fit or according to Norgorber's
    greater plans. It ignores most creatures as if they were unimportant or not
    even alive, bowling over these irrelevant people in its way and casually
    murdering those who make nuisances of themselves.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    The Stabbing Beast is guilty of thousands of killings and has no fear of
    death. It does not believe that anything other than its master can kill it,
    despite mortal records showing that it has been killed in the past;
    Norgorber wiped its memory of these failures when he resurrected his herald.
    Norgorber's herald is normally emotionless and cold, showing no remorse or
    regret for any death or injury. When the cult of Norgorber summons the
    Stabbing Beast, the mortals may present it with several choice targets to
    hunt and slay, though predicting its interests is difficult and the Beast
    may select its own target-or none at all- in exchange for its services. The
    Beast keeps trophies of its kills by covering the corpses in a preservative
    bile, swallowing them in its scorpion form, and regurgitating them when it
    returns to its lair deep beneath the planar metropolis of Axis.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    The herald of Norgorber lives only to serve his dark master, whose mandates
    may come to the Stabbing Beast in a steady stream of evil deeds or
    sporadically and with long periods of dormancy between. When idle for too
    long, it tends to turn off its mind and simply waits in stasis, completely
    inert like a clockwork device that has run down. It reacts to prayers to
    Norgorber as if they were echoes of its master's voice, drawing its
    attention without violence and bringing it to full alertness.
