  - name: Split (Ex)
    description: >-
      An amphisbaena functions normally even if cut in half. If dealt a critical
      hit with a slashing weapon, the creature is cut in half but continues to
      function as two separate creatures, each with half the original
      amphisbaena's current hit points (rounded down). Once split, an
      amphisbaena cannot be split again. If left alone for 1 minute, the split
      amphisbaena can rejoin its two halves and become a single whole creature
      again (add the two creatures' hit points together). If one of the split
      creatures is slain, the amphisbaena can regrow the lost portion over the
      course of a few weeks.
Description:
  - >-
    The amphisbaena is a giant poisonous snake about 10 feet long. It is often
    found lairing near a water source or in dark, damp locations. An amphisbaena
    moves on land by grasping one of its necks with its other head and rolling
    across the ground like a hoop. An amphisbaena is an aggressive and
    territorial creature, attacking any living creatures that wander near its
    lair. It attacks by biting with its poisonous fangs from both of its heads.
