Description:
  - >-
    A rat swarm typically consists of a biting, roiling mass of hundreds of
    disease-ridden rats driven to uncharacteristic heights of aggression by
    fantastic and overwhelming hunger. In such numbers, they become voracious
    hunters, capable of killing a full-grown human with hundreds of bites. Rat
    swarms are often found in the sewers of large human settlements.
  - Rat swarms surround and attack any warm-blooded prey in their path.
