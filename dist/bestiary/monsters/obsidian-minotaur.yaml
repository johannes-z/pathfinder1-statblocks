  claws and its feet are splayed hooves. Small pinpoints of bluish light can be
  seen in its eyes.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, once every 1d4+1 rounds, an obsidian minotaur can expel
      a cloud of gas directly in front of it. The cloud fills a 10-ft. cube and
      lasts for 1 round before dispersing. Any creature in the area must succeed
      on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. The save
      DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Burn (Ex)
    description: >-
      The claws of an obsidian minotaur deal 1d6 points of fire damage each time
      they hit. A creature hit must succeed on a DC 16 Reflex save or take 1d6
      points of fire damage for 1d4+1 rounds as clothes ignite and armor becomes
      searing hot. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      An obsidian minotaur is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that
      allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature as noted below. A transmute rock to mud
      spell slows it (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw,
      while transmute mud to rock heals all of its hit points. A stone to flesh
      spell does not actually change the obsidian minotaur's structure but
      negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.
Description:
  - >-
    The obsidian minotaur is often employed by spellcasters as a guardian or
    killer and can be found performing such tasks. When employed as an assassin,
    the obsidian minotaur is quite effective, first striking fear into the heart
    of its opponent and then slaying it with no thought or consequence. An
    obsidian minotaur stands 12 feet tall and weighs roughly 2,000 pounds. As a
    guardian, the obsidian minotaur activates when trespassers enter an area it
    is programmed to protect. As an assassin, it actively hunts down the
    targeted victim. The creature attacks with its powerful claws, slashing and
    ripping its opponent's flesh. Against powerful foes, it employs its breath
    weapon. Construction An obsidian minotaur is sculpted from 2,500 pounds of
    black obsidian worth at least 3,000 gp. OBSIDIAN MINOTAUR CL 16th; Price
