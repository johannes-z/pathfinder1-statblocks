  mass.
Group: Demon
Source: Tome of Horrors Complete
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid (Ex)
    description: >-
      The acidic body of a greater ooze demon quickly dissolves organic material
      and metal, but not stone. Any melee hit deals acid damage. Armor or
      clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless it makes a
      successful DC 23 Reflex save. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a
      greater ooze demon dissolves immediately unless it makes a successful DC
      23 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based. The greater ooze
      demon's acidic touch deals 23 points of acid damage per round to creatures
      or wooden or metal objects, but the greater ooze demon must remain in
      contact with the object for 1 full round to deal this damage.
Description:
  - >-
    Greater ooze demons attack using their slams or bite and claw attacks. They
    like to grab a foe and hold on, pulling it close to their body where they
    subject it to their acid damage. They are not afraid of charging straight
    into melee, as unaware opponents soon discover their weapons dissolve upon
    contacting the demon's oozy form. Thereafter, the ooze demon vomits on its
    foes, an act that revolts most foes, much to the delight of the greater ooze
    demon.
  - >-
    Greater ooze demons stand 12 feet tall but can reach heights of 20 feet or
    more.
