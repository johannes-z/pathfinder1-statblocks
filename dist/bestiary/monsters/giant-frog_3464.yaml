SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Tongue (Ex)
    description: >-
      A giant frog's tongue is a primary attack with reach equal to three times
      the frog's normal reach (15 feet for a Medium giant frog). A giant frog's
      tongue deals no damage on a hit, but can be used to grab. A giant frog
      does not gain the grappled condition while using its tongue in this
      manner.
Description:
  - >-
    Giant frogs leap into combat using their charge attack. Though giant frogs
    (the smallest variety) may flee or not attack opponents larger than
    themselves, the larger variety (dire, killer, and Abyssal) are ferocious and
    nearly mindless killing machines, attacking everything in sight that is not
    a frog.
