Description:
  - >-
    Dark nagas covet luxury, wealth, and power over others. With bodies covered
    by shimmering, eel-like black scales, dark nagas slither deftly through
    forsaken lands and abandoned ruins, scouring such places for treasures and
    weaker creatures they might force into service. Their forked tongues spread
    only lies, and others whom they can't manipulate they destroy with their
    insidious poison and destructive magical abilities. A typical dark naga
    measures approximately 12 feet long and weighs upward of 300 pounds.
    Arrogant and sybaritic, dark nagas seek to dominate lesser creatures,
    relishing the fear they inspire and power over other beings. While some
    manage to carve indulgent fiefdoms from tribes of goblins, orcs, lizardfolk,
    or other barbarous races, the luster of cosmopolitan fineries proves
    enticing as well, leading some to infiltrate city sewers and slums to gather
    an urban following. They particularly relish morbidly crafted jewelry and
    treasures, often adorning themselves with jeweled bands or taking their ease
    atop piles of treasure. Dark nagas hate others of their kind, especially
    other dark nagas, seeing their brethren as deadly opponents to be dispatched
    swiftly and mercilessly-often rightly so.
