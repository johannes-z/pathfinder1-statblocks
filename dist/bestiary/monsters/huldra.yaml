SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Lashing Tail (Su)
    description: >-
      A huldra's tail slap is a primary attack. In addition, each time a huldra
      damages a creature with her tail slap, she deals 1d4 points of Charisma
      damage, causing her target to grow progressively more deformed and ugly
      with each strike. A successful DC 15 Fortitude save negates the Charisma
      damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Manipulate Luck (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a huldra can manipulate another creature's luck by spending
      a full-round action, during which the huldra must remain in physical
      contact with the target creature. When the huldra uses this ability, she
      must choose whether she is imparting good luck or bad luck. A creature
      granted good luck gains a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws, attack
      rolls, and skill checks, while a creature afflicted with bad luck takes a
      -4 penalty on all saving throws, attack rolls, and skill checks. A
      successful DC 17 Will save negates the effect. Huldras cannot be the
      target of this ability. This effect lasts for 24 hours and is a curse
      effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Huldras are fey creatures that legend claims were originally created by
    troll witches to lure humans into their clutches. Every huldra is aware of
    this tale, finds it insulting, and denies it at length-yet the legend
    persists. There's no greater way to inf lame a huldra to anger than to speak
    about this myth (especially while expressing distrust or contempt for the
    huldra), and the huldras' hatred of all things trollish is well known among
    scholars of the fey and those who regularly encounter the less common fey
    creatures. From the front, a huldra appears to be a beautiful human woman,
    yet two distinctive features mark the huldra as something supernatural: her
    long, foxlike tail, and the fact that she doesn't have a solid back-merely a
    hole that reveals her body to be a hollow, bark-lined shell. Most huldras
    wear their hair long to mask the hole in their backs, and they prefer long
    gowns to hide their tails when interacting with humanoids. Though huldras
    are not ashamed of their status as fey, they react rather negatively when
    someone points out their tails. So long as humanoids are respectful,
    however, huldras tend to be curious about other races, and may aid those who
    pass through their territories by telling them the best places for hunting
    or fishing. Huldras sometimes become enamored of woodcutters or others who
    adventure outdoors, and invite these paramours to share their beds, but such
    romances usually end in disappointment and misunderstanding on both sides.
    Despite their relatively lithe frames, huldras are deceptively strong, and
    stories abound of them performing astonishing feats of strength such as
    straightening horseshoes and tossing aside attackers, and their natural
    weapons are quite potent.
