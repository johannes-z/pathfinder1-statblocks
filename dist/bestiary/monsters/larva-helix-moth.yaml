Description:
  - >-
    Helix moths are solitary creatures, though on rare occasions a mated pair
    might be encountered. The lair of an adult helix moth is almost always above
    ground and usually takes the form of a cave, tunnel, or other such
    structure.
  - >-
    Such places are always well-hidden and difficult to reach. When the time
    comes for a female helix moth to lay her eggs, she hollows out a tunnel in
    the floor of her lair, forms a large chamber at the end of the tunnel and
    deposits her eggs in the chamber.
  - >-
    Helix moth larvae lair in a large, 6-foot-diameter ridged tunnels that
    burrow down into the earth where they eventually open into a large chamber
    at least 20 square feet in size. A thick, gray-white slime coats the
    chamber's floor and walls. Though harmless to living creatures, but
    generally not pleasant to touch or come in contact with. Occasionally (15%
    chance) the secretions of the helix moth larva mix with the slime just
    enough to form a deadly inhalant poison that affects living creatures within
    the chamber. Those breathing the fumes must make a successful DC 15
    Fortitude save or suffer 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A new save must
    be made every minute. Once a successful save is made, that creature cannot
    be affected by the fumes again for one day.
  - >-
    To lay her eggs, the female helix moth uses her acidic secretions and
    sharpened mandibles to tunnel a hole into the ground and hollow out a large
    chamber where she lays 2d4 eggs of greenish-gray color.
  - >-
    The eggs hatch two weeks after fertilization, producing the helix moth
    larvae, though typically only about 50% of the larva live past the first
    day.
  - >-
    Helix moths are normally passive creatures except when hunting. During a
    search for prey, the creature becomes highly aggressive and does not
    hesitate to attack any creature it encounters. A helix moth often journeys
    up to a mile or more away from its lair in search of prey. Slain prey is
    carried back to its lair and devoured over a period of several days. The
    adult helix moth attacks by biting or stinging its prey. Its constant
    droning affects those that combat it, so the helix moth always tries to stay
    airborne and within range where it can use this ability while staying out of
    melee range. Helix moth larvae attack by biting.
