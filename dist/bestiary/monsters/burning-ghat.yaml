Description_Visual: >-
  A humanoid figure stands swathed in smoke, its distinct features obliterated
  by the charred and blackened flesh. Ash perpetually trails from the creature
  as it moves and small patches of burnt skin flake from its body. Its eyes are
  small dots of brilliant crimson fire.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burning Blood (Su)
    description: >-
      When a burning ghat takes damage from a slashing or piercing weapon, its
      flesh bursts open and sprays the attacker with a mixture of burning
      fluids. The attacker must succeed on a DC 14 Reflex save or take 1d6
      points of fire damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Fire Burst (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a burning ghat can unleash a burst of flames in a 20-foot
      radius centered on itself. Creatures caught in the burst take 4d6 points
      of fire damage. A successful DC 14 Reflex save reduces the damage by half.
      The burning ghat is slowed (as the slow spell) for 1d4 rounds after using
      this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Odor (Ex)
    description: >-
      A burning ghat reeks of charred flesh, which can be detected at a range of
      30 feet with a DC 10 Perception check. Creatures with the scent ability
      automatically detect its presence as soon as they come within 60 feet of a
      burning ghat.
Description:
  - >-
    The burning ghat is a rare form of undead created in areas of unusually high
    negative energy when a living creature is put to death by fire for a crime
    it did not commit. Utterly twisted and maddened by its fate, a burning ghat
    is a fearsome creature, consumed with a hatred for the living and seeking to
    end life wherever it finds it. The distinct and pungent stench of burnt
    flesh is often the harbinger of a burning ghat's arrival and is easily
    noticeable within 30 feet of the creature. They can often still be found
    wearing the clothes they wore as they burned to death, if the garments
    survived the flames, though a burning ghat of any great age will usually
    have none.
  - >-
    Burning ghats inhabit remote areas near places where they were put to death.
    They are not bound to this area as some undead seem to be, but they seldom
    wander more than a mile or so away from their death site. Most encounters
    are with a lone burning ghat, but occassionally when more than one innocent
    has been put to the flames, a pack of these creatures can be found. Burning
    ghats are nocturnal pack hunters, feasting on the charred flesh of those
    they encounter and kill. They are seldom found with other undead, preferring
    to keep company with their own kind or operating alone.
  - >-
    A typical burning ghat is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. A burning ghat
    can communicate in the Common tongue and any other language it knew in life.
    Its voice crackles and hisses like a freshly-stoked fire.
  - >-
    A burning ghat attacks with its claws, seeking to slay any living creature
    it encounters. A burning ghat's claws heats the blood of living creatures
    upon contact, causing great pain as it sizzles and boils away into the air.
    It favors burning its victims to death but is content to rend them apart if
    they should prove immune to fire.
