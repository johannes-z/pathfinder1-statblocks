SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Call Storm (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a draug can summon inclement weather to harass its
      opponents. The effects are felt immediately (i.e., there is no gradual
      shift in the weather). Otherwise, this ability is identical to the control
      weather spell (caster level 6th).
  - name: Control Ship (Su)
    description: >-
      A draug has full control over its vessel (wind notwithstanding) so long as
      it remains at the wheel or within 20 feet of the helmsman. Should it leave
      the area, its ship meanders in a random direction until the draug regains
      control. A draug also imbues its ship with special abilities (see Draug
      Ships, below).
Description:
  - >-
    The draug is the vengeful spirit of a ship's captain who died at sea, thus
    being denied a proper burial. If an entire ship sinks at sea with the loss
    of all hands, the ship itself and its entire crew may return as ghostly
    wanderers. The captain usually rises as a draug and his crew rises as brine
    zombies (see that entry). A draug looks as it did in life, wearing the same
    clothes and bearing the same possessions it held at the moment of death. The
    arrival of a draug is often taken as a death portent, for even if it does
    not attack, some dire circumstance is likely to befall the witness. A draug
    often acts as a death token, rising out of the sea and staring at or
    pointing a bony finger at a sailor fated to drown. Draugs are jealous of the
    living and try to bring death and misfortune to them at every opportunity.
    They have been known to suddenly appear in a sea mist and climb aboard the
    ships of the living. A draug's favored form of attack is with its cutlass,
    though if disarmed it uses its claws to attempt to grapple an opponent,
    leaping back into the waves in an effort to drown the unfortunate victim.
    Draug Ships When a ship sinks beneath the waves, it and its entire crew may
    return as ghostly wanderers, especially if the captain and crew had a less
    than scrupulous profession (as pirates, for example). A sunken ship of this
    nature may undergo a transformation from the negative energy and evil
    surrounding it. When this happens, the ship rises from the deep, piloted by
    a draug and manned by skeletons, brine zombies, zombies, and lacedons. The
    ship appears as it did at the time of its demise. The sails are tattered and
    the decks covered with seaweed. When a draug is at the helm, the "ghost
    ship" gains the following powers: Buoyancy (Su) Regardless of the condition
    of the hull, a draug-piloted ship remains afloat in any weather conditions.
    It is not affected by wind of any type (though the draug can still use the
    wind to maneuver and sail the ship) and can even sail against gale-force
    winds. Strong waves may toss the ship about, but will not capsize it as a
    result. Flight (Su) A draug can maneuver his ship to leave the waves and
    take to the air as long as the draug remains on board. This functions as fly
    cast by a sorcerer with a caster level equal to the draug's HD. Immunity to
    Fire (Ex) A draug ship is so waterlogged and infused with negative energy
    that it is completely immune to all fire effects. Copyright Notice Author
