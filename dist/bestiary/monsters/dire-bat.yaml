Description:
  - >-
    The dire bat is usually found lairing in desolate areas, resting in caves or
    other secluded areas during the day and taking to the skies in search of
    prey at night. This immense creature has an average wingspan of 15 feet and
    weighs roughly 200 pounds. The dire bat generally doesn't shelter in groups
    larger than eight, often living a solitary life. A dire bat prefers feeding
    on livestock and herd animals. Dire Bat Animal Companion Starting
