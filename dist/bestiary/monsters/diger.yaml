  - name: Limited Flight (Ex)
    description: >-
      By releasing naturally occurring helium from its body, a diger is able to
      fly for a number of rounds equal to 1 + 1/2 its current Constitution score
      (12 rounds for the average diger). After that, it must land and cannot fly
      again until it has rested for 2 minutes (20 rounds).
  - name: Transparent (Ex)
    description: >-
      A diger is transparent in water. It takes a successful DC 15 Perception
      check to recognize a motionless diger for what it really is.
Description:
  - >-
    Digers are semi-transparent oozes about 9 feet in diameter that live in
    abandoned ruins or underground areas where they spend most of their time
    hunting for food. A diger's gem-like eye offers it a means to lure its prey
    in so it can attack. A character can attempt a DC 15 Perception check to
    realize the gem is not real, but is in fact a part of the creature itself.
  - >-
    Anyone with ranks in Appraise or Craft (gemcutting) can use one of those
    skills instead of Perception to notice.
  - >-
    A diger attacks by hitting a foe with its slimy appendage, or by simply
    waiting, floating unnoticed until an opponent contacts it. Often, a diger
    lies at the bottom of a pool or stream where it is almost impossible to
    detect (+10 on Perception DC). Its gem-like eye appears to be a gemstone or
    jewel embedded in the ground under the water. An opponent that moves to grab
    the gemstone is immediately attacked by the diger.
