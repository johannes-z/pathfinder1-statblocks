Description_Visual: >-
  On lean limbs the color of spilt blood creeps a being of sinister grace. Eyes
  like embers and a sneer full of needle-thin teeth gleam from an unmistakably
  fiendish visage. A pair of crimson wings sprout from the back of the hairless
  humanoid form, fluttering silently like an assassin's cloak, while in one hand
  it clutches the twisted, dagger-like horn of some infernal terror.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Contract Killer (Su)
    description: >-
      A salikotal gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls when attacking a
      specific individual it has marked for death. At the beginning of each day,
      it determines an individual to serve as its target and which one of its
      three vengeances it may make use of that day. It may not change this
      target or ability until the next day. The target may be any specific
      creature the salikotal knows of, even if it has not seen its target
      before. This target is treated as being known to a salikotal for the
      purposes of using its locate creature ability, even if the devil has never
      seen its victim before.
  - name: Sneak Attack (Ex)
    description: >-
      Anytime a salikotal's opponent is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC, or if
      a salikotal flanks his opponent, he deals an extra 3d6 points of damage.
      This ability is just like the rogue's sneak attack and subject to the same
      limitations.
  - name: Suicide (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a salikotal may target itself with a coup de grace
      attack. If the salikotal reduces itself to fewer than 0 hit points-or
      fails to do so but still fails the associated Fortitude save (DC = 10 +
      damage dealt)-the salikotal erupts in a burst of destructive energy. Any
      creature within 15 feet of a salikotal that commits suicide is damaged by
      a blast of metal shards and needle-like scales, taking 6d6 points of
      damage (DC 17, save for half ). The save DC is Constitution-based. Upon
      using this ability, a salikotal is permanently destroyed. This effect only
      takes place if a salikotal willingly ends its own life, not if it is
      killed by outside effects.
  - name: Vengeance (Su)
    description: >-
      While seeking a victim a salikotal prepares itself daily, honing its will
      to effectively slaughter its intended quarry. On a given day, chosen as
      part of its contract killer ability, a salikotal may gain the benefit of
      any one of the following powers, either the one it feels will most aid it
      or whichever one its summoner requests. Only one of these abilities is
      active on a given day, and it only comes into effect when a salikotal
      kills its intended target with a coup de grace. These executions only
      function on living creatures. Fideicide: The victim's soul is immediately
      shunted to a infernal prison on Erebus, the third layer of Hell. The soul
      can be returned to life, but upon casting the spell, the spellcaster
      attempting the resurrection takes an amount of fire damage equal to 1d6 x
      the victim's number of Hit Dice, and must make an immediate concentration
      check (DC 10 + damage delt + spell level) or lose the spell. Necrocide:
      After 1d4 rounds, the victim's body animates as a zombie under the
      salikotal's control. The devil may permanently grant control of the zombie
      to any sentient creature as a free action. Omnicide: The victim's body is
      utterly destroyed, disintegrating without a trace. Its clothing and
      possessions remain unharmed. Only spells that do not require a portion of
      the corpse may return the victim to life.
Description:
  - >-
    Prince-killers and assassins of souls, salikotals serve as the bloody
    chisels by which the lords of Hell subtly shape the mortal world to their
    whims. Soaring through the night on silent wings, these murderous devils
    care nothing for life or reason, knowing only a single, murderous goal.
    Cloaked by shadow and silence, few ever glimpse the sharp features of a
    salikotal, for Hell's death-dealers reveal themselves only amid the haze of
    fading life. Lean, deft hunters, salikotals move like terrible predatory
    birds, each taloned step measured, cautious, and full of deadly intent.
    Protected by an armor of sharp, thin scales, these agile devils universally
    stand 5 feet, 4 inches tall, and weigh 85 pounds, their barbed frames
    supporting the breadth of their 8-foot-wide, bat-like wings. They have full
    control over their slender tails, nimbly manipulating objects and even
    wielding deadly, Hell-forged blades in these dexterous, prehensile
    appendages. Ecology Salikotals rise from the tenebrous reaches of Erebus's
    vaulted heights. Unblinking and endlessly patient, salikotals haunt the
    claustrophobic upper realms of the lightless labyrinth, stealthy and
    watchful but caring little for the doings of intruders or their lesser kin.
    Only the summons of conjurers or the diabolical elite rouse them from their
    eerie aerial stalkings, drawing them forth from the shadows for a chance to
    hone their death-dealing expertise in the name of Hell. Naturally silent,
    salikotals never vocalize even the slightest sound, relying on their innate
    telepathic abilities for communication. Even when using such mental
    interaction, though, the devils prove terse and resistant to conversation.
    For most summoners, a salikotal's only communication is a slow nod
    acknowledging its orders, and a nod in answer to the question of its
    murderous success. Habitat & Society Salikotals have little to do with
    others of their kind, be they other salikotals or other lesser devils in
    general. Emotionless and rigid even beyond the typical disciplines of Hell,
    these assassins realize they exist for but a single reason: to sow death.
    Their cold precision only wavers when they discuss payment for their most
    notorious murderous methods, wherein they demand specific types of gemstones
    in compensation for their grisly work. Few non-devils dare to suppose why
    salikotals request such precise payments, refusing to work for any other
    recompense, but among the damned spread rumors of vast vaults filled with
    glistening jewels, each a fabulous treasure and a representation of a life
    cut short by the blades of Hell. Summoning Salikotals As in all things,
    salikotals prove emotionless when it comes to being summoned. They have
    little reason to purposefully resist or accept a diabolist's call, unless
    ordered to do so by their infernal masters. Once a salikotal is summoned,
    though, only murder interests it. Any Charisma check made as part of the
    spell planar binding to convince a salikotal to undertake a mission other
    than assassination takes a -2 penalty. Once a salikotal has agreed to
    perform a murder for its summoner, it explains the signature vengeances its
    kind can inflict upon a victim and offers to exact one upon its summoner's
    victim for an associated price. The devil requests 1,000 gp for every Hit
    Die its target possesses (intrinsically gauging its victim's prowess), to be
    paid entirely in one of three types of gemstones: ruby for fideicide, onyx
    for necrocide, and jacyinth for omnicide. Salikotals prove exceedingly
    particular in these payments, and if a summoner cannot pay the price in the
    type of gem requested, the devil refuses to exact one of its vengeances. If
    the summoner tries to force a salikotal to use one of its vengeances, the
    devil takes offense and all of the summoner's Charisma-related interactions
    with it in the future take a -2 penalty.
