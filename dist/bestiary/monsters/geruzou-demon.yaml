Description_Visual: >-
  This humanoid appears to stand nearly 4 feet tall and has a horse-like head
  with downward-curving horns jutting from its head. Its mouth is filled with
  long, sharp teeth and its hands and feet end in sharpened claws. A pair of
  large, membranous wings jut from its back and its flesh is sickly gray and
  appears to be covered with a thick layer of slimy mucus.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Slime Armor (Ex)
    description: >-
      The slime excreted by a geruzou grants it a +4 deflection bonus to AC.
      This bonus is already included in the statistics block.
  - name: Spit Slime (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a geruzou can spit a stream of
      slimy goo in a 20-foot line (no range increment). This requires a
      successful ranged touch attack. A creature hit is slowed (as the slow
      spell, caster level 6th) for 6 rounds if it fails a DC 14 Fortitude save.
      The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Geruzou are sometimes called slime demons because their leathery skin
    constantly drips and oozes thick, jelly-like mucus. Like their brethren,
    they are fierce combatants and are often employed as hunters and trackers by
    greater demons. The typical geruzou stands nearly 4 feet tall and weighs
    about 140 pounds. Copyright Notice Authors Scott Greene and Clark Peterson.
