Description:
  - >-
    This relative of the common vulture is most often found in the region of
    Whisperfall Pass. Unlike its scavenging cousin, the Whisperfall vulture is a
    hunter, taking down rabbits and other small game with ease thanks to its
    speed and surprising agility. Hungry flocks of these birds of prey can even
    take down a human adult by sheer force of numbers.
  - >-
    Whisperfall vulture eggs are a delicacy, and those who can find and claim
    them can make a good amount of money selling them to merchants in Urgir.
  - >-
    A mature Whisperfall vulture has an 8-foot-long wingspan and weighs 50
    pounds.
