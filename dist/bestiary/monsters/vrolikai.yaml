SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Black Flame Knives (Su)
    description: >-
      A vrolikai can manifest daggers made of crystallized black flames in each
      of its four hands as a free action. These weapons function as +1 daggers
      that bestow one permanent negative level on a successful hit. A DC 27
      Fortitude negates the negative level, although on a critical hit, no save
      is allowed. The save DC is Charisma-based. Death-Stealing
  - name: Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      1 permanent negative level, 30 ft., Fort DC 27 negates. Creatures slain by
      these negative levels become juju zombies (see page 291) under the
      vrolikai's control. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Madness (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature stung by a vrolikai's tail must make a DC 27 Will save to
      resist taking 1d6 points of Charisma drain and becoming confused for 1d4
      rounds. On a successful save, the victim is instead staggered for 1d4
      rounds as strange visions assault its mind. This is a mind-affecting
      effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Multiweapon Mastery (Ex)
    description: >-
      A vrolikai never takes penalties on its attack roll when fighting with
      multiple weapons.
Description:
  - >-
    A vrolikai is 14 feet tall but weighs only 500 pounds. Unlike other demons,
    it does not form from a sinful soul-it instead manifests from a nabasu demon
    that returns to the Abyss after growing to maturity on the Material Plane.
    Not all nabasus survive this transformation, but those who do become
    powerful indeed-vrolikai usually rule large regions of unclaimed Abyssal
    land, and often serve as assassins or ambassadors to demon lords in need of
    an agent in a distant realm.
