Description_Visual: >-
  Standing just over three feet tall, this bestial humanoid wears filthy,
  tattered robes and has blue-gray skin decorated with strange, coiling stripes.
  Dark fur grows on its head and arms, and its feet end in burning hooves. Its
  eyes glow as red as the flaming sword it wields in one hand, and its breath
  fills the surrounding air with noxious gray smoke.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Boiling Blood (Su)
    description: >-
      A brimorak's blood is boiling hot. It can cough out a hideous amount of
      this scorching fluid as a breath weapon, but the blood also serves the
      demon as a defensive ability. Any creature that damages a brimorak with a
      slashing or piercing melee weapon is sprayed by boiling blood, and takes
      1d4 points of fire damage with each successful hit with such a weapon.
      Creatures using reach weapons are not subject to this damage.
  - name: Burning Hooves (Su)
    description: >-
      A brimorak's hooves burn with fire, leaving scorched hoofprints on wood,
      stone, and most every other solid surface, yet this supernatural fire does
      not set alight surfaces the demon treads upon. It does make it easier to
      track a brimorak, though-Survival checks made to track a brimorak gain a
      +8 circumstance bonus. Brimoraks use their air walk ability to throw
      creatures off their trail, or to leave their prints in strange places
      (like atop roofs) to spread fear and terror. Against a prone foe, a
      brimorak can make two hoof attacks rather than just one.
  - name: Flaming Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a brimorak can infuse a wielded melee weapon (including
      a two-handed weapon, but not a second weapon held in the off-hand) with
      its fiery nature, allowing it to inflict an additional 1d6 points of fire
      damage with the weapon. This fire damage stacks with any additional fire
      damage that the weapon might also inflict. The weapon loses this ability
      if it leaves the demon's grasp.
  - name: Smoke Breath (Su)
    description: >-
      A brimorak's breath manifests as clouds of foul-smelling smoke when it
      exhales. This breath surrounds the brimorak out to a radius of 5
      feet-while the smoke isn't thick enough to obscure vision or choke foes,
      it is enough to sicken breathing foes who are not immune to poison. A DC
      17 Fortitude save grants immunity to a particular brimorak's breath for 24
      hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Although brimorak demons are generally limited to regions of the Abyss where
    fire and smoke hold sway, in those regions they are vast in number. Demon
    lords like Flauros use brimoraks as the primary infantry troops in Abyssal
    armies-although their command of fire makes them less effective against most
    fiends, they are particularly devastating against many other foes.
  - >-
    Brimoraks are small in stature, rarely standing over 3 feet in height, yet
    surprisingly strong for their size. Those who underestimate these demons
    often don't live to learn of their errors, for brimoraks are quick to press
    the advantage against larger enemies after softening them up with fire
    magic. A brimorak's dense musculature and bones result in unexpected weight
    as well-one of these creatures usually weighs nearly 200 pounds.
  - >-
    Ecology Brimoraks form from the souls of arsonists and those who used fire
    in life to torture and kill innocent victims- especially witches, heretics,
    and other such "criminals"-via burning at the stake or on a pyre.
  - >-
    Although a brimorak is not damaged by fire, it still feels the pain of fire
    as long as it lives-the boiling of its own blood is a constant reminder of
    its sins from a previous life. This state of constant pain is alleviated
    somewhat after a brimorak uses one of its fire-based spell-like abilities or
    its breath weapon-while this has no game effect on the demon, the temporary
    relief does encourage it to use its magic and breath weapon as often as
    possible in combat.
  - >-
    Many brimoraks become masochistic creatures as a result of the constant
    pain. In combat they often display little to no regard for their personal
    safety, provoking attacks of opportunity or ignoring obvious foes for the
    chance to hurt a helpless foe. Yet this disregard for safety doesn't descend
    into truly self-destructive behavior-a brimorak with fewer than half its hit
    points becomes suddenly more careful about its actions. Unlike most demons,
    who can teleport at will, brimoraks can only use this powerful spell-like
    ability once per day, and they generally rely upon it to get themselves out
    of peril rather than to ambush foes.
  - >-
    Habitat & Society On the Abyss, brimoraks usually serve more powerful demons
    as taskmasters, thugs, or soldiers. These brimorak demons know little more
    than battle, and when not fighting together against a foe they tend to fight
    each other in an endless conf lict for superiority.
  - >-
    On the Material Plane, however, brimoraks take on a much more authoritative
    role. While most are called via spells like lesser planar ally or lesser
    planar binding in order to serve mortal spellcasters as minions, now and
    then a brimorak escapes control and can remain on Golarion. Freed from
    demonic overlords and binding spellcasters, a brimorak loose on the Material
    Plane understands that it is viewed as a monster and reacts intelligently-it
    does not immediately revert to an orgy of arson and destruction, but instead
    retreats into hiding. Free brimoraks prefer to lurk in rundown slums in
    large cities, in catacombs or sewers, or in remote wilderness regions.
    Typically, a lone brimorak seeks out a tribe of savage humanoids like
    goblins, orcs, gnolls, or barbarians and establishes itself as the dominant
    force for the tribe by killing its leader and several of the tribe's more
    powerful members-whatever it takes to get the tribe's survivors to bow down
    before the demon.
  - >-
    As a result, the majority of brimoraks encountered on the Material Plane are
    encountered as lone creatures serving as the leaders of tribes of fecund and
    aggressive humanoids.
  - >-
    Often, and particularly in the case of tribes of superstitious humanoids,
    the brimorak is regarded as both a chieftain and a god, with tribal adepts
    actually worshiping the demon out of a mixture of fear and ignorance. Of
    course, the brimorak is only too pleased to perpetuate such beliefs by
    requiring frequent sacrifices, using its defensive abilities and spell-like
    abilities to perform "miracles," and periodically punishing its followers
    for real or imagined transgressions. Eventually, the brimorak has the tribe
    so cowed and under his control that he can finally turn to the joys of
    mayhem by ordering the tribe to take up ill-advised crusades against
    neighboring tribes or settlements. The brimorak continues to order these
    attacks on nearby victims until his tribe is destroyed or high-powered
    opponents arrive to stop it. Brimoraks who are finally confronted by foes
    capable of defeating them generally don't stay around to defend their
    followers, but instead simply teleport to some other region, whereupon they
    begin the process anew by seeking a new tribe of doomed savages to rule.
