Description:
  - >-
    A julunggali is a semidivine entity. It watches over sacred and mystical
    places of the world, as well as the remote tribes that respect these
    locations. Young tribal warriors present themselves to the julunggali for
    its blessing, a vision quest, or other rite of passage necessary to become
    an adult in the community. A julunggali is wise and can be entreated to
    perform helpful tasks, such as carving new river channels or pulling water
    into dry wells. But it is also vengeful, and has been known to punish those
    who break social taboos or intrude upon sacred places without permission.
    Those who have undergone rites of passage chosen for them by the julunggali
    face the harshest repercussions if they act wrongly.
