  Layers of translucent, shimmering fins flow along this fish-man's spindly
  body. Tentacles curl below its stately mouth, and its humanlike hands and feet
  end in stubby but sharp claws. Bishop
Group: Bishop

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A bishop's eerie, fishlike appearance evokes feelings of unsettling fear
      in foes within a 30-foot radius. The bishop can use this aura as a free
      action, and any creature within this area must succeed at a DC 16 Will
      save or become shaken for 5d6 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its save
      is immune to the bishop's aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Wisdom-based.
  - name: Stunning Strike (Ex)
    description: >-
      Five times per day, a bishop can stun a creature it hits with a claw
      attack. The targeted creature must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or be
      stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Possessing perhaps one of the strangest appearances of all agathions,
    bishops look as much like fish as they do humans. On their native plane of
    Nirvana, bishop agathions act as liaisons between the celestial generals of
    the lands and seas, though their activity is not restricted to Nirvana
    alone. Bishop agathions perform their duties anyplace their adaptive bodies
    are needed, such as on watery planes or worlds that are wholly aquatic. The
    few mortals who have met these noble creatures report that bishop agathions
    can traverse even the roughest and driest terrain as easily as they can
    glide through the deepest, most isolated oceans. It's believed bishop
    agathions are born from the souls of mortals who led lives of harmonized
    duality on land and at sea-goodly sailors, ocean-hopping priests, or
    kindhearted fisherfolk all are said to be candidates for rebirth as these
    fascinating creatures. Bishop agathions' striking coloration ranges from
    glittering silver to sparkling coral to smoky auburn and green. Layers of
    fine, translucent fins cascade down their bodies, and combine with the
    strange enzymes in their skin to give them the appearance of being
    perpetually wet. Bishops' heads are rounded, tentacles grow like beards from
    their chins, and their eyes-which come in all the colors of the tumultuous
    waves-look like those of a fish, but with a distinguished glint. Bishops'
    bodies vaguely resemble those of humans in shape, but webbing in their hands
    and feet facilitates deep-sea travel. Bishop agathions typically stand about
    6 feet tall and weigh anywhere from 140 to 250 pounds.

    On Nirvana, other agathions respect bishops for their ability to think
    clearly, logically, and with the best interest of all parties in mind.
    Because of this, bishop agathions serve as Nirvana's trusted diplomatic
    liaisons. Bishops also have been known to carry vital messages between
    celestial beings and mortal heroes, who often see agathions through warped
    lenses. Far from being ashamed of their strange appearances, bishops
    consider their bodies to be among the most beautiful and versatile in all
    the planes-a fitting reward for a life well spent in meditation, martial
    mastery, and harmony with the seas. Anyone who suggests otherwise can count
    on incurring a bishop's ill will. Although primarily used as diplomats,
    messengers, and celestial ambassadors, bishops also excel in battle. With
    the power of Nirvana behind them, bishops' claws and nimble fighting style
    eliminate enemies who stand in the way of their missions. More martially
    inclined bishops often choose to wield quarterstaves, many of which are
    enchanted. Bishop agathions don't go looking for fights, but they intervene
    when they come across those imposing cruelty or evil on innocents. Bishops
    particularly abhor piracy and slavery. Legends speak of more than one
    unlucky pirate slave master who, ostensibly mad, spent his final days
    blubbering about the tentacle-beards that destroyed his ship and drowned his
    crew. No one takes these stories seriously except for the few who've become
    acquainted with bishops' complex ways.

    Bishops typically conduct their diplomatic work alone. However, planar
    experts believe that on Nirvana bishops more commonly work in pairs when
    dealing with simple matters of diplomacy or while on courier missions. When
    their missions are especially vital, bishop agathions work in contingents of
    six to eight, engaging in lengthy discussions and lively debate to find the
    best solution to their particular problem. These conferences sometimes last
    a long time, and some of the more hotheaded celestials regard them as a
    great waste of time. These contingents of bishop agathions can, some experts
    believe, cross into the mortal realm, and though such sightings have yet to
    be recorded, philosophical texts from across Golarion seem to reach similar
    conclusions. The few reported bishop agathion sightings in the Inner Sea
    mention only one agathion being seen at a time, and these reports are
    concentrated along the shores of western Varisia, particularly in the
    Varisian Gulf near Magnimar. Outside of the Inner Sea region, the majority
    of reports of bishop agathions come from the other side of the world. Some
    researchers who study the planes believe that a portal to either Nirvana's
    oceans or the Plane of Water lies in the southern region of the Embaral
    Ocean, since both the western coast of Tian Xia and the eastern coast of
    Casmaron report more instances of bishop agathions than does the Inner Sea
    region. Like other outsiders, bishops do not need to eat or sleep while
    spending time on Golarion. Additionally, bishops do not reproduce among
    themselves; each individual is formed from the soul of a good mortal. It's
    believed bishops retain the deep emotions that marked their mortal lives,
    giving them a propensity to fall in love with creatures living outside their
    native plane. Ancient stories speak of bishops who traveled to Golarion for
    missions, only to fall in love with a remarkable member of an aquatic
    species. Some coastal storytellers even claim that merfolk, with their
    otherworldly beauty, descended from such a union, and that sahuagin are
    their corrupted cousins. Predictably, debates about the veracity of such
    claims have raged for as long as these tales have been told. Although few
    known bishop agathions remain on Golarion for any length of time, some
    cultures revere their arrival as an omen of fortune and luck. Those seeing a
    bishop agathion-and being entrusted with its diplomatic knowledge-consider
    the encounter to be the greatest honor one can receive. Therefore, groups of
    eager adventurers have set sail from Varisia over the years, hoping to reap
    the rewards of encountering one of these strange creatures. These seekers
    are inevitably disappointed. Bishops appear to only those with whom they
    have business-or whose evil they witness and wish to stop.
