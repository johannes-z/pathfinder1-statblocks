SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Ethereal Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4
      Str, cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2
      racial bonus. A victim that reaches Strength 0 from an ethereal rat's
      poisonous bite becomes ethereal (as if affected by the etherealness
      spell). The victim remains in this state until at least 1 point of
      Strength damage is healed.
  - name: Ethereal Jaunt (Su)
    description: >-
      An ethereal rat can shift from the Ethereal to the Material Plane as a
      swift action and shift back again as a move action. The ability is
      otherwise identical with ethereal jaunt (caster level 15th).
Description:
  - Ethereal rats, like normal rats, they can be found just about anywhere.
  - >-
    They attack by biting a foe and then jumping to the Ethereal Plane. If badly
    wounded in battle an ethereal rat uses its ethereal jaunt ability to escape
    to the Ethereal Plane.
