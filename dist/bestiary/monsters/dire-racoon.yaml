Description:
  - >-
    Ever the opportunists, these giant procyonids tend to move out of their
    native habitat in the forests to the compost heaps and refuse piles of large
    cities. Food is easier to find there, and in good supply. Dire raccoons are
    not picky, and like their smaller cousins they are omnivorous. Rats, rotten
    food, and even the occasional corpse are all parts of an urban dire
    raccoon's diet. Because of its unsanitary lifestyle and questionable eating
    habits, dire raccoons that live in city trash heaps often carry filth fever.
  - >-
    In its natural habitat, a dire raccoon eats the same foods-although in
    greater amounts of course-as a normal raccoon. They are fond of shellfish,
    berries, and any small lizards or frogs they can catch. Dire raccoons have
    the same mating habits and rear the same number of young as their normal
    counterparts (see the raccoon entry).
  - >-
    In combat a dire raccoon engages in an intimidating display of shrill
    growls, stamping feet, and puffed up fur. Dire raccoons have sharp, strong
    teeth and use them well if cornered.
