Description:
  - >-
    About one out of every 20 drow is gifted with special powers from birth-the
    overwhelming majority of these exceptional drow are female, and as a result,
    drow society tends to be matriarchal in nature. These special births are
    engineered and encouraged among the ruling caste, and are far more likely to
    occur when the mother is of noble heritage. Strangely, the status of the
    father seems not to increase or decrease the chances of a child being born a
    drow noble. Common drow children born to nobles are usually put to
    death-sacrificed to one of the many demon gods to whom the drow offer
    worship. It is rare for a drow noble to be born to common parents, but those
    who are usually murder their parents or family before they come of age in
    order to hide the truth of their base upbringing and to ease the processes
    of joining one of their society's noble houses. Drow nobles are more
    powerful than the majority of their kin, and as such they quickly rise to
    power within their houses. Advancement through the hierarchy of a drow noble
    house is usually accomplished through a combination of assassination,
    seduction, and treachery, leading most drow in power to be overly paranoid.
    Drow Noble Characters Drow nobles are defined by their class levels-they do
    not possess racial Hit Dice. A drow noble's challenge rating is equal to her
    class level. Drow nobles possess all of the racial traits listed above for
    drow characters, plus the following. +4 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, +2
    Wisdom, +2 Charisma, -2 Constitution. Noble drow are very agile, observant,
    and regal. These ability score modif iers replace the standard drow ability
    score modif iers. Spell Resistance: Drow nobles have spell resistance equal
    to 11 + their character level. Spell-Like Abilities: Drow nobles can cast
    dancing lights, deeper darkness, faerie fire, feather fall, and levitate
    each at will, and have detect magic as a constant spell-like ability. A drow
    noble can also cast divine favor, dispel magic, and suggestion once per day
    each. In some cases, a drow noble's spell-like abilities might vary,
    although the level of a particular spelllike ability does not. A drow
    noble's caster level for her spell-like abilities is equal to her character
    level.
