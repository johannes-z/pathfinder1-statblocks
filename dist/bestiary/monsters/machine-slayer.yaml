SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Arc Grenade (Ex)
    description: >-
      An arc grenade is a splash weapon with a range increment of 20 feet,
      generally thrown at a grid intersection rather than a creature. When armed
      and thrown, it detonates at the beginning of the machine slayer's next
      turn. The explosion deals 5d6 points of electricity damage to all targets
      within a 20-foot-radius spread (Reflex DC 15 half). An arc grenade weighs
      1 pound and is worth 750 gp.
Description:
  - >-
    To feed his tribe, he learned to hunt. To keep them safe, he learned to hunt
    machines. This Kellid ranger learned the secrets of fighting the metal
    monstrosities of Numeria from the greatest hunters of his tribe, and now he
    has surpassed and outlived them all. He leads his fellow warriors in battle
    against the robots, fighting with warhammer and arrowheads crafted from
    skymetal claimed from his foes' remains. Whether the machines act
    independently or serve the hated Technic League matters not-all pose a
    threat to the tribe. Of late, rumors have reached the tribe of machines
    crafted into human form, sent to infiltrate the surviving free tribes and
    destroy them from within. The machine slayer keeps a close eye on strangers,
    any of whom might be machines pretending to be humans. Odd behavior risks a
    deadly response. He would rather mistakenly kill a stranger than risk the
    lives of his kinfolk.
