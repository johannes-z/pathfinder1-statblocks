Description_Visual: >-
  This enormous, insectlike creature is covered in downy white fur, broken only
  by glossy black claws and portions of its exoskeleton. A pair of iridescent
  eyes gleams above a horrid three-part mouth that drips viscous fluid.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Coat Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an ursikka can coat its pincerlike claws with its
      freezing viscous saliva. This coating lasts for 1 minute. Any creature hit
      by an ursikka's coated claws or grappled by an ursikka using the Snatch
      feat takes an additional 2d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 22 half).
  - name: Freezing Viscosity (Ex)
    description: >-
      The saliva that drips from an ursikka's mouth is maddeningly sticky as
      well as preternaturally cold. Creatures that take damage from an ursikka's
      bite attack must succeed at a DC 22 Reflex save or become entangled for
      1d4 rounds. While entangled, creatures take 2d6 points of cold damage
      (Reflex DC 22 half). An entangled creature can break free before the end
      of this duration by succeeding at a DC 19 Strength check or by dealing 15
      point of damage to the encasing saliva with either a slashing weapon or
      with fire damage. Using fire to remove the saliva damages the entangled
      creature as well. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Hibernation (Ex)
    description: >-
      Ursikkas can enter a state of hibernation for an indefinite period of
      time, typically until Triaxus's long summer subsides. An ursikka surrounds
      itself with its spittle, which hardens into a cocoon. While hibernating,
      an ursikka doesn't need to drink or eat. The cocoon has hardness 10 and 60
      hit points, and is immune to fire damage. As long as the cocoon remains
      intact, the ursikka remains unharmed in its hibernation. An ursikka must
      use its attacks to break free from its cocoon.
  - name: Spit (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, an ursikka can spit a 60-foot line of its saliva.
      Creatures struck by this saliva take 8d6 points of cold damage and risk
      being entangled. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage and
      negates the entangled condition. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Like enormous, nightmarish praying mantises, ursikkas roam the Triaxian
    wilderness during the wandering planet's winter years. These vicious,
    short-tempered predators rule primeval environs by default, being among
    Triaxus's largest, hungriest beasts. Ursikkas' towering height, which can
    reach 25 feet, is mostly due to the long, slender walking legs on which the
    creatures skitter with an eerie speed that belies their hulking size. A
    long, bloated abdomen accounts for most of the beasts' 20 feet of length.
    Ursikkas' thoraxes anchor their grasping forearms, which each end in sharp
    pincers capable of shearing flesh from bone like hot knives cutting through
    butter.
  - >-
    Ursikkas' white, shaggy fur covers the majority of their bodies, and their
    three-part maws can open wide enough to swallow a human whole. The freezing,
    sticky fluid that drips from their gnashing jaws aids this activity even
    further.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Ursikkas are specifically suited to their home planet's long winter season.
    Their impossibly cold bodily fluids, which allow them to thrive in subzero
    temperatures, grant them equally cold saliva that helps the beasts kill
    their prey as well as digest it. Further, the property that keeps ursikkas'
    spittle liquid at its freezing temperature also makes it incredibly sticky-a
    quality that aids the creatures in combat and when preparing for Triaxus's
    hot summer years.
  - >-
    During their planet's long winter, ursikkas terrorize Triaxus's large swaths
    of uncivilized land in endless quests for food. The ravenous creatures
    require several tons of raw meat each week to survive. Although they prefer
    to eat the flesh of large, cold-blooded creatures, hungry ursikkas pursue
    any viable prey, particularly victims that seem sluggish and easy to catch.
    When the end of winter approaches, the huge quantity of food they consume
    fuels an increased production of saliva, which they use to prepare their
    summer abodes.
  - >-
    During Triaxus's summers, ursikkas live inside cocoons constructed from
    their own saliva. In the weeks before the change of seasons, ursikkas choose
    an inconspicuous locale-such as inside cave complexes or even holes of their
    own construction-in which to spend the long summer. The creatures then
    tirelessly weave their spittle around their bodies until they're fully
    covered. In 24 hours, the chemicals in the spittle harden it into an
    impenetrable sheath that protects ursikkas from Triaxus's brutal summer
    heat. Shortly after their spittle-cocoons harden, the beasts go dormant and
    do not awake until the temperature returns to a more tolerable level.
  - >-
    Although ursikkas are known for aggressiveness during the entirety of
    winter, they are at their most volatile right before and right after
    dormancy. An ursikka that is interrupted while weaving its cocoon
    immediately attempts to kill the intruders. An ursikka whose cocoon is
    broken during the summer emerges similarly enraged; ursikkas that defeat the
    creatures responsible for waking them attempt to reconstruct their cocoons,
    but as spittle production ceases during hibernation, those efforts often
    fail. Some Summerborn Triaxians actively seek out the cocoons of slumbering
    ursikkas, knowing they can defeat the exposed beasts relatively easily.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    With their ruthless predatory skills and voracious appetites, ursikkas
    typically live solitary existences. However, in places where prey is
    abundant-such as the wilds of the Drakelands and in the Allied
    Territories-ursikkas sometimes live in pairs or, rarely, in small hives of
    three to 10. In such cases, ursikkas still hunt alone. Triaxian scholars
    note that the creatures don't hesitate to kill each other should one steal
    another's meal.
  - >-
    In accordance with their long life cycles, ursikkas mate infrequently. Once
    or twice each winter, the larger females of the species typically seek out
    mates as determinedly as they hunt prey. Afterward, each female lays one
    enormous, fertilized egg made of a secretion similar to the creatures'
    hardened saliva. After a 5-year gestation period, the egg hatches. If
    ursikka parents are even aware of their offspring, though, their behavior
    does not indicate it.
  - >-
    According to scholars, young ursikkas grow to maturity in fewer than 10
    years. One disturbing speculation indicates that adult ursikkas sometimes
    enjoy the flesh of their younger counterparts-and may actually hunt juvenile
    members of their own species if prey becomes scarce. Whether this behavior
    is simply a way for adult ursikkas to survive or a warped way for them to
    retain their territorial dominance is unknown.
  - >-
    Although they are very long-lived, ursikkas rarely live through more than
    two Triaxian winters. In the planet's most isolated territories, where few
    predators or stalwart hunters threaten them, ursikkas typically die of old
    age during their dormant period; ursikka carcasses swathed in shimmering,
    deteriorating cocoons are not uncommon in these frontiers. In more populated
    areas, ursikkas' lifespans are shorter, especially given the hardy,
    cold-forged winter cultures that hunt the creatures for protection, thrills,
    and sometimes meat. Indeed, the warriors of the most populous nations of the
    Allied Territories consider a slain ursikkas' claws, mandibles, and bulbous
    eyes the ultimate hunting trophies. Some even make furred armor from
    ursikkas' durable exoskeletons.
