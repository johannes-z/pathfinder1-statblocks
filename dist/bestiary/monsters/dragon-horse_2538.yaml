Description_Visual: >-
  This creature resembles a horse with a smooth coat of scintillating blue hues
  that seem to flicker and wash over its body in waves as it gallops through the
  air. Its deep sky blue hooves do not touch the ground as it moves. The mane
  and tail of a dragon horse is of purest white and flows out behind it in an
  elegant cascade.

  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)

      its breath weapon once every 10 rounds (1/minute).
  - name: Flying Charge (Ex)
    description: >-

  - name: Plane Shift (Sp)
    description: >-
      A dragon horse can enter the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, Elemental Plane
      of Air, or the Material Plane. This ability transports the dragon horse
      and up to two other creatures, provided they are on its back.
Description:
  - Dragon horses are beautiful, graceful creatures, peaceful and reclusive.
  - >-
    They spend nearly all their time aloft among the clouds, rarely deigning to
    set foot on solid ground. Being peaceful creatures, dragon horses dislike
    combat and seek to avoid it, unless pressed. In melee, a dragon horse
    attempts to deal nonlethal damage to its opponents. Unconscious opponents
    are not further attacked.
  - >-
    The name "dragon horse" is something of a misnomer, as these creatures have
    no relation to true dragons. They are, in fact, more closely related to the
    noble ki-rin. Dragon horses are creatures originally from the Elemental
    Plane of Air that have decided, for reasons unknown to anyone but
    themselves, to reside more or less permanently in the Material Plane.
  - Dragon horses visit the Elemental Plane of Air frequently, however.
  - >-
    Dragon horses are solitary creatures, but a mated pair will often remain
    together to raise their young. They have no need or desire for material
    possessions and so keep no treasure.
  - >-
    Training a Dragon Horse Dragon horses are highly prized as steeds, but they
    are notoriously difficult to train. They have a very free spirit and do not
    tolerate captivity, thus only juvenile dragon horses have any chance of
    being tamed mounts.
  - >-
    Dragon horse foals have the Young template, and mature to adult size after
    10 years. A captive foal can be raised only by a good being and doing so
    requires 10 years and a Handle Animal check (DC 30) every 6 months.
