Description_Visual: >-
  This woman-shaped cloud of swirling black-and-white energy flickers like
  lightning, with raw magical power playing about her fingertips.
Source: AP 41
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Adaptive Life Force (Su)
    description: >-
      When subject to any effect, the Arcanotheign is always treated as the most
      favorable alignment subtype pertaining to that effect (for example, if in
      the area of a holy smite, the Arcanotheign counts as a good creature,
      which means she takes no damage from the spell). Though she is a living
      creature (for the purpose of harmless spells such as deathwatch and detect
      undead), she counts as either a living creature or an undead creature,
      depending on which outcome is more favorable to her (for example,
      rendering her immune to both circle of death and undeath to death).
  - name: Alter Objects (Su)
    description: >-
      At will, the Arcanotheign can transmute nonliving objects into different
      shapes (as fabricate), transform solid materials into other materials
      (such as wood into stone or stone into metal), or imbue physical objects
      with temporary life (as animate objects). These transformations last 1
      minute before reverting to their previous state, though the herald can
      extend this duration as long as she concentrates and remains within 1,000
      feet of the transformed object. When animating objects, she prefers to
      create lifelike animals out of earth, stone, or wood, and can sustain up
      to four Large creatures at a time (treat as normal animals, except the
      animal's natural armor increases by +5, its type changes to "construct,"
      and it gains construct immunities). The Arcanotheign must be within 100
      feet of the object to use this ability, and can only maintain one type of
      transformation (alter shape, alter material, or animate objects) at a
      time.
  - name: Corporeal Form (Ex)
    description: >-
      As an immediate action, the Arcanotheign can take physical form, losing
      her incorporeal special quality and subtype and her deflection bonus to
      AC, but gaining a Strength score of 20 and a natural armor bonus equal to
      her normal deflection bonus. She can remain in this form indefinitely or
      revert to her incorporeal state as a free action (this happens
      automatically if she is knocked unconscious). This ability allows her to
      pretend to be a mortal and physically manipulate objects. In this form she
      looks like a tall woman with pale, gray, or black skin.
  - name: Eldritch Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      The Arcanotheign's ranged touch attacks are incorporeal touch attacks that
      deal 4d6 points of damage and an additional effect chosen by the herald. A
      saving throw (DC 25) negates the additional effect (the exact type of save
      depends on what effect the herald chooses); a creature hit by two blasts
      in the same round suffers an increased effect if it fails both its saves
      against the eldritch blasts. The possible effects are the following: Bleed
      (Fortitude): The creature takes 10 points of bleed damage. Increased
      effect: The creature is disintegrated. Dement (Will): The creature is
      confused for 1 minute. Increased effect: The creature goes insane (as
      insanity). Displace (Fortitude): The creature teleports (as dimension
      door) 5 feet in a random horizontal direction at the end of its turn each
      round for the next 10 rounds. Increased effect: The creature is banished
      as if under the effect of a maze spell. Ignite (Reflex): The creature
      takes 2d6 points of fire damage. Increased effect: The creature catches on
      fire, taking 4d6 points of fire damage every round on the herald's turn
      for the next 10 rounds. The DC to extinguish the flames is equal to the
      save DC of the eldritch blast. Paralyze (Will): The creature is paralyzed
      as if by hold monster. Increased effect: The creature is slowed (as slow)
      when the paralysis ends or is broken.
  - name: Energy Channel Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      The Arcanotheign's aura is charged with energy, whether acid, cold,
      electricity, fire, negative, or positive. The herald can change the energy
      type, suppress her aura, or reactivate her aura once per round on her turn
      as a free action. If the energy is positive or negative, it acts like
      channeled energy from a cleric, and the herald decides the effect of the
      channel (positive energy could heal living creatures or harm undead;
      negative energy could heal undead or harm living creatures). The aura's
      effect is always 2d6 hit points (Reflex DC 25 negates). A creature that is
      struck by the herald's incorporeal touch attack takes this damage in
      addition to the normal touch attack damage, and it gets no saving throw
      against this extra damage. The herald can use her Selective Channel feat
      to exclude creatures from the effect of her aura, regardless of the aura's
      energy type.
  - name: Resistance to Divine Power (Su)
    description: >-
      The Arcanotheign has resistance 30 against damage caused by divine power,
      such as the non-fire damage from a flame strike spell.
Description:
  - >-
    The Arcanotheign is a mysterious creature serving the mad god Nethys.
    Because her creator sends her to Golarion on missions to heal, destroy, or
    spy, she is familiar with creatures of the mortal world, yet still very much
    an outsider, and she is fascinated by the intricacies of mortal interactions
    and history. In her natural, incorporeal form, she is a storm of magic,
    immediately recognizable as a creature of the arcane and divine. Ever
    curious, she often asks personal, direct questions of those she is sent to
    interact with, even as she repairs their wounds or tears their souls from
    their bodies. Sometimes she is told to assume a physical form, and lives
    among humanoids as a mysterious oracle for days or weeks, observing those
    near her and giving cryptic answers to those who dare approach her. She
    stands just over 7 feet tall, and has a habit of floating a few inches above
    the ground instead of walking. Ecology The Arcanotheign understands she is
    foreign to mortal life and mortal needs. She enjoys experiencing new aromas
    and tastes; someone wishing to get on her good side should bring her
    strongly scented flowers, a tasty meal, or some other physical object that
    may be new to her experience, even if humans would think it stinks or is
    inedible. She is interested in animals, and if she spends much time in the
    same place, she may "adopt" those living near her, especially orphaned ones.
    Some in the church suspect that her attention can cause mutations in these
    creatures, either directly or in its offspring, creating strange hybrids or
    magical creatures. The Arcanotheign has a lesser interest in children,
    though if a lost child finds its way to her, she is more likely to protect
    it or return it home than to ignore or harm it. Some of these children
    develop sorcerous power, typically with the arcane or destined bloodline.
    Habitat & Society As a supernatural creature created in a moment of lucidity
    by an insane, omniscient god, the Arcanotheign is often left to her own
    devices when her master does not need her, and wanders Golarion and the
    planes searching for new sensations and meaning to her existence and that of
    the multiverse. She is a lonely creature and welcomes those who would speak
    to her as part of a normal conversation rather than an attempt to get
    information from her. Her affection for animals is related to this; they are
    simple creatures who make no demands of her, and her habit of animating
    giant bears, lions, and other animals out of earth, stone, or wood
    represents her respect for animals she has known in the past ages.
