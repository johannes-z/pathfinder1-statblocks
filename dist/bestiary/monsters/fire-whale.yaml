SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Hold Breath (Ex)
    description: >-
      A fire whale can hold its breath for 8 x its Constitution score before it
      risks drowning.
  - name: Scalding Blast (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full round action, a fire whale can release a blast of superheated
      air from its blowhole that scalds or burns those contacting it. The
      cone-shaped blast has a range of 60 ft and deals 12d6 points of damage. A
      successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage. The save DC is
      Constitution-based. Once a fire whale uses this ability, it must wait 1d4
      rounds before using its scalding blast again. After using this ability
      four times, the fire whale must submerge for at least two full rounds
      before it can use it again.
Description:
  - >-
    All manner of fiery aquatic life swims the Sea of Fire, including the
    majestic fire whales. These 30-foot long mammals are relatively peaceful
    creatures, though if provoked they quickly become deadly adversaries. Fire
    whales generally spend their time feeding on elemental invertebrates that
    move along the bottom of the Sea of Fire. When feeding, the fire whale dives
    to the bottom, flips on its side, and swims along, running its head through
    the fiery and oily sea floor scooping food into its mouth. Fire whales
    generally take in enough food to sustain themselves for 4 months (during
    breeding season). Late in the year (by Material Plane standards) fire whales
    gather for their mating ritual. During this time as many as 7 fire whales
    can be encountered together. Sages are unsure as to the purpose of the
    "extra" fire whales, but each spends its share rolling and milling with the
    others during this ritual. Gestation for fire whales is generally 11 months
    after which time the mother gives birth to 1d2 calves. While the calves are
    growing, both they and the mother spend most of their time in the shallower
    ends of the Sea of Fire. After nearly 7 months, they migrate to deeper
    waters and most calves swim away and become independent. Young reach
    maturity around 6 years of age. Fire whales are hunted by various races for
    their meat, blubber, and oil. Of the races that hunt them the most are the
    salamanders, volcano giants (see their entry in this book), and the efreet
    of the City of Brass. Fire whales are generally peaceful creatures and
    rarely attack unless threatened. If forced into combat, a fire whale attacks
    with its bite and tail slap. Surface creatures that threaten a fire whale
    are subjected to its scalding blast attack. Copyright Notice Author Scott
