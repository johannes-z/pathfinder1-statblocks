Description_Visual: >-
  This ghostly crusader floats just above the ground. Its translucent form would
  be harder to see if not for the twin motes of hellish red light staring out
  from behind its helmet.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Agent of Despair (Su)
    description: >-
      A fallen's attacks can weaken a creature's resolve. Any creature that
      takes damage from a fallen's attacks must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or
      take a -4 penalty on saving throws against fear. If a creature that has
      immunity to fear fails this saving throw, its immunity is temporarily
      suppressed. This effect lasts as long as a creature still suffers damage
      taken from a fallen's attacks. This effect is removed if the creature is
      healed of all damage inflicted by a fallen. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Curse of the Unburied (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a fallen can demand that a good-aligned cleric, paladin, or
      cleric whose deity is opposed to the creation of undead locate its remains
      and perform a funeral for it on holy ground (through specific use of
      consecrate or hallow). The target must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or
      take a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, the target can
      attempt a new saving throw; success keeps the target from accruing an
      additional -2 penalty to each of its ability scores. No ability score can
      be reduced below 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed
      immediately upon completing the funeral rites for the fallen. The target
      does not need to complete the rites personally, but it is responsible for
      seeing that they're carried out. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Phantom Armaments (Su)
    description: >-
      A fallen possesses a semblance of the gear it carried in life. A fallen's
      weapons and armor are formed of force, allowing the fallen to make
      physical attacks and wear protective armor. Though solid and formed of
      force, this gear cannot be disarmed or removed from the fallen. Arrows
      fired from the fallen's longbow vanish after dealing damage to their
      target.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Su)
    description: >-
      A fallen is tied to the place where it fell in battle or the location
      where its remains were dragged after it fell in combat. Unless slain
      permanently, it reforms there 2d4 days later. A fallen is permanently
      destroyed and its soul is released when funeral rites lasting at least 1
      minute are performed on its remains while on consecrated or hallowed
      ground.
  - name: Touch of the Grave (Su)
    description: >-
      All of a fallen's melee and ranged attacks deal an additional 2d6 points
      of negative energy damage.
Description:
  - >-
    The fallen were once sworn champions of the previous four crusades against
    the Worldwound to whom fate has perpetrated a cruel trick. Unable to receive
    Pharasma's judgment and receive whatever reward awaits them in the afterlife
    for the deeds they performed in life, they are the grim, ghostly remains of
    the men and women they once were. However, the fallen's original goal of
    valiantly marching into the Worldwound to save Golarion from the demonic
    tide has washed from their tortured minds, and is replaced instead by pain,
    sorrow, and hatred. Their fall in battle remains the greatest disappointment
    in their souls. Most fallen are still adorned in the battered and breached
    armor they died in and armed with the weapons they once carried into battle.
    Sentient and suffering, the fallen wander the Worldwound in search someone
    to end their misery by performing last rites.
  - >-
    At a glance, a fallen might be mistaken for a well-armed ghost or spectre,
    but even casual study reveals that their fiery eyes are not vacant, and
    they're anything but mindless. In battle, fallen move in an efficient and
    deliberate manner, and they are absolutely silent until they deign to speak
    in raspy, sepulchral tones.
  - Ecology

    Upon death, a soul normally enters the Great Beyond and travels to the
    Boneyard, and once there, travels to an appropriate Outer Plane to become a
    petitioner. Whatever fate befalls that petitioner, whether it is destroyed
    or its energies are released to create an outsider, it never returns to the
    Boneyard again. Spiritualists speculate that the Abyssal energies pervasive
    throughout the Worldwound have altered the planar structure of the region in
    such a way that in very rare cases, typically among the strong-willed, some
    souls instinctively react as if were on an Outer Plane already and never
    depart for the Boneyard. These are the fallen.
  - >-
    The fallen are spontaneously created, and are similar to ghosts but for one
    crucial difference-the fallen have no remaining unfinished business to tie
    them to the Material Plane aside from receiving a proper burial. Like many
    other types of undead, the fallen have an aversion to sunlight. They are
    incapable of becoming corporeal, but can open and close doors, hurl objects,
    and otherwise manifest their displeasure through the use of telekinesis, and
    their ghostly weapons still strike true and deal damage since they are made
    of force. A fallen can even shroud itself in darkness so tangible that most
    demons cannot penetrate it. When funeral rites are conducted upon the place
    where they died, the infusion of positive energy scours away the Abyssal
    taint. This localized restoration of the natural cosmological order allows
    the soul of the fallen to escape to the Great Beyond and thus receive
    judgment.
  - >-
    Though they were crusaders in life, fallen typically avoid the demons of the
    Worldwound unless they happen upon an injured or distracted one. Their shame
    at dying by demonic claws and their tortured existence hinders their ability
    to strike at the demons in their current state. When fallen encounter
    mortals, they typically plead for release from their condition through
    burial. They don't give the mortals much time to decide for themselves,
    instead using their abilities to compel the mortals into service-or slaying
    them in anger and frustration.
  - Habitat & Society

    The fallen desire nothing but release from the Material Plane. Existence is
    agony and horror for the fallen, a state that they cannot end themselves.
    They are not evil for evil's sake, but their situation fills them with
    uncontrollable rage and they cannot help but resent the living and act
    selfishly to end their plight. Some fallen lie to would-be rescuers,
    promising to reveal great treasure near the place they died. Others attack
    outright if not helped, take hostages, or threaten reprisals against family
    members or other innocents. That the Worldwound is too dangerous for most
    adventurers is inconsequential to them-for when did the fallen ever waver
    when duty called? Some simply go mad and cannot be reasoned with. The most
    tragic and desperate of the fallen are those that cannot remember where they
    died.
  - >-
    Their dark nature notwithstanding, the fallen understand enough about the
    reality of their situation to call upon clerics and paladins to help them.
    They can manage to hold back their rage in these situations and refrain from
    attacking the one who can help end their plight, but this doesn't stop them
    from attacking a cleric's companions. Likewise, the fallen do not hinder
    those affected by their curse of the unburied ability.
