  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A coral golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature, as noted below. • Any spell with the
      water descriptor heals a coral golem 1d6 points of damage per level of the
      caster (maximum 10d6). • Transmute rock to mud slows a coral golem (as the
      slow spell) for 1d6 rounds (no save). • Transmute mud to rock increases
      the golem's bleed damage to 2d6 for 3 rounds. • Soften earth and stone
      causes a coral golem to lose its damage reduction for 3 rounds.
Description:
  - >-
    Coral golems are constructs made entirely of colonies of living coral drawn
    from the ocean. While their sharpened appendages are capable of performing
    tasks that require meticulous precision, they are equally useful in martial
    combat. Wizards and sorcerers employ coral golems to collect delicate
    specimens of plant life from local beaches, spear and retrieve fish from the
    ocean for meals, and protect valuable locations such as their masters' homes
    or veins of minerals and other potent resources. A coral golem is 9 feet
    tall and weighs 1,000 pounds.
