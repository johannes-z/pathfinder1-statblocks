  The air around this strange, pale animal sparks with erratic flashes of static
  electricity, its body constantly twitching as if filled to capacity with the
  energy. It suddenly perks up, alert and seemingly ready to bolt.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      On the Material Plane, a raiju typically assumes the form of a badger,
      cat, giant rat, monkey, weasel, or wolf (as per beast shape II) to blend
      in with native wildlife. Even in these forms, however, it typically has
      pale coloration and lightninglike patterns.
  - name: Electric Body (Su)
    description: >-
      As an immediate action, a raiju can transform itself into a ball of living
      lightning. While in this form, the raiju gains the incorporeal subtype and
      incorporeal quality. It only takes half damage from corporeal sources if
      they are magical (it takes no damage from nonmagical weapons and objects).
      Additionally, it sparks with electricity while it is in this form. Any
      creature that touches the raiju with a natural or unarmed attack or whose
      square the raiju passes through during its movement must succeed at a DC
      17 Reflex save or take 2d6 points of electricity damage. The save DC is
      Dexterity-based. In normal weather, a raiju can remain incorporeal for a
      number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice, though it can remain
      incorporeal for as long as it pleases during a thunderstorm.
  - name: Shocking Burst (Su)
    description: >-
      Besides dealing normal slashing damage, the claw and tail of a raiju are
      considered to have the shocking burst weapon special quality. They deal
      1d6 extra points of electrical damage on a normal hit and an additional
      1d10 points on a critical hit.
Description:
  - >-
    Raijus are beings of living electricity that cross the border between the
    mundane world and their native plane, a region of the Plane of Air alive
    with endless thunderstorms. Raijus can be involuntarily hurled across the
    dimensions by a powerful lightning bolt originating in the Plane of Air, or
    might be called by magic users to do their bidding. When the weather is
    calm, raijus are quiet, and assume the forms of Tiny or Small animals such
    as cats, raccoon dogs, monkeys, or weasels. As weather gets worse, however,
    so do their tempers. In their real form, raijus appear as lean, foxlike
    creatures with long, sharp claws and luminous eyes, shrouded by crackling
    electricity. These swift, even panicky, creatures are charged with the
    electricity of their native realm, and those who touch them risk receiving a
    deadly shock. In times of great distress, they transform entirely into
    living electricity, a force that few barriers can contain and even fewer
    creatures can survive the passage of.
  - >-
    In their natural forms, raijus measure about 3-1/2 feet long and weigh 40
    pounds, but they often take the form of small mammals when not on the Plane
    of Air. They can be still recognized as raijus in this form, however, as
    they bear markings suggestive of jagged lightning.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    When they are born on the Elemental Plane of Air, raijus are semi-sentient,
    formless spheres of living electricity. Only after a period of weeks or
    months do they gradually take on a favored form, that of a vaguely rodent-
    or caninelike beast, agile enough to twist and bound amid the endless storms
    and debris that soar through their home plane. Sometimes particularly
    powerful elemental storms, strange eddies of magic, or drifting portals
    bring raijus to the Material Plane. When this happens, invariably during a
    thunderstorm, the creature spends but a little time regaining its bearings;
    it then uses its innate shapechange power to blend in with the local fauna,
    taking on the shape of a local animal-typically a cat, raccoon dog, monkey,
    or weasel. While such raijus constantly seek to return to their home plane,
    they aren't terribly uncomfortable on the Material Plane. When the weather
    is calm, raijus are likewise quiet, and remain in their apparently harmless
    animal forms all the time. As weather gets worse, however, they become
    increasingly energetic, racing and soaring about in rampages that
    occasionally prove accidentally destructive. They typically resume their
    natural forms during such storms, reveling in their memories of their home
    plane. Some scholars believe that raijus can return to their native plane
    when lightning strikes them, thus explaining the creatures' eagerness and
    agitation during such weather.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Raijus are extraplanar creatures that have little organization on their home
    plane, roaming and romping as little more than wild animals in their
    dangerous planar wilderness. On the Material Plane, they gravitate toward
    areas where storms are frequent, or where the effects of lightning are
    apparent. This means they frequently occupy the windward sides of mountains
    and wet forests, eagerly making small dens in the trunks of
    lightning-blasted trees or scorched, rocky crevices.
  - >-
    Raijus can live on the Material Plane indefinitely, though all seek ways
    they might return to the Elemental Plane of Air. Those separated from their
    native plane rarely manage to find their way home without the intervention
    of some other being. Although life on the Material Plane often means a raiju
    will never encounter others of its kind again, few seem to realize this
    fact, or, if they do, become despondent over it. Rather, many raijus adopt
    the habits and communities of the creatures they spend the most time
    imitating and live as such creatures-except, of course, during violent
    lightning storms.
  - >-
    Many believe that despite their destructive natures, raijus are good luck.
    This belief comes from the creatures' propensity for finding warm spots to
    nestle into and rest in during the lazy times between storms. One story
    tells of a raiju that found a snug spot in the navel of a sleeping giant.
    The giant was exhausted after a day of tromping on a local town and stealing
    away an entire year's harvest of rice, so it didn't even notice the sleeping
    creature. When the giant finally awoke and felt the dozing creature's claws
    on its belly, it flew into a panicked rage. The sudden activity startled the
    sleeping raiju, and it immediately summoned a storm and called down
    lightning, which promptly electrocuted the giant-killing the villain on the
    spot. When the curious townsfolk saw the brief, explosive storm nearby, they
    stopped rebuilding their homes and came to investigate. What they found was
    a charred giant and a sleepy raiju, nestled amid their stolen rice. Raijus
    have been considered lucky spirits ever since, though many refuse to sleep
    face up during lighting storms lest their bellies seem like a comfortable
    place for a raiju to rest.
  - Kaenju
  - >-
    This rarer variant of the raiju dwells upon the Plane of Fire, in regions
    filled with smoke and wracked by firestorms and endless volcanic eruptions.
    Just as their kin from the Plane of Air, kaenjus may visit mundane worlds
    during volcanic eruptions or when huge fires devastate towns or forests. A
    kaenju is very similar to its cousin, but its substance is made of fire
    instead of lightning.
  - >-
    Defensive Abilities: Kaenjus have the fire subtype (immunity to fire,
    vulnerability to cold) and resistance 10 to lightning. Special Attacks: A
    kaenju's tail and claws are considered flaming burst weapons.
  - >-
    Special Qualities: All kaenjus' supernatural abilities are based on flame
    instead of lightning, and have the same effects but deal fire damage instead
    of electricity damage. Also, instead of a raiju's spell-like abilities, a
    kaenju can cast produce flame at will, and flaming sphere and quench 3 times
    per day.
