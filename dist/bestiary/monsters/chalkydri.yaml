Description:
  - >-
    Chalkydris spend most of their time on the Ethereal or Astral Plane or on
    one of the many Elemental Planes, usually acting on behalf of some deity of
    good. Chalkydris are militaristic and often lead small retinues of other
    celestials against the infernal armies. When not serving in such roles, they
    are found acting as protectors or escorts to visitors on the good-aligned
    planes. Sometimes, a chalkydri is sent to the Material Plane by its deity to
    watch over a favored worshipper. When traveling the Material Plane, the
    chalkydri often takes a form more acceptable to humanoids.
  - >-
    Chalkydris appear as powerful, agile humans 6 to 7 feet tall with coppery
    skin, red or blonde hair, and copper-colored eyes. Two sets of large
    feathery wings (four wings total) protrude from their back at shoulder
    level. Their wings are glossy white with copper tips. Chalkydris wear tunics
    or robes of varying colors, usually crimson, copper, green, silver, or gold.
  - >-
    Chalkydris enjoy combat and one is never without its +2 flaming longsword
    and at least two +2 flaming javelins. A chalkydri opens combat by hurling
    one of its javelins at a foe before moving into melee to battle with its
    longsword. While in combat, it utilizes its spell-like abilities to their
    fullest extent. If a chalkydri is overwhelmed in battle, it summons
    celestials to its aid or uses its plane shift ability to escape. If slain,
    the chalkydri's weapons explode in a blinding flash of fire.
