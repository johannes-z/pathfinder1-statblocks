Description:
  - >-
    A mythic ettin is descended from a sordid lineage of mythic hill giants,
    mythic stone giants, and at least one mythic orc. Angrier, filthier, and
    stronger than other ettins, it is a leader of its kind, and is better at
    keeping a band or colony together for months or years.
