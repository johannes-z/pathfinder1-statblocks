Description:
  - >-
    The mighty kronosaurus is a relentless hunter that, once it picks up a
    potential meal's scent, rarely stops seeking its prey until its appetite is
    sated. A kronosaurus's diet consists of everything from large fish and
    sharks to small whales, giant squids, and sea turtles. Remains of other
    giant saurians have reportedly been found in the stomachs of those rare
    kronosauruses that are killed by hunters or wash up dead on shore. Unlike
    other reptiles, a kronosaurus does not lay eggs, but instead births its
    young live. The young kronosauruses stay with their mother for less than a
    year before parting ways and hunting on their own. A fully grown kronosaurus
    can reach lengths of up to 50 feet and weigh as much as 40,000 pounds.
