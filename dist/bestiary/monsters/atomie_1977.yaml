Description:
  - >-
    Atomies perceive themselves as larger than they actually are. Like pups
    standing up to a full-grown cur, atomies never back down from aggression,
    and take tremendous pride in defeating and humiliating foes larger than
    themselves. Atomies find great pleasure in shoring up the odds in a fight
    against larger foes. They make use of their reduce person spell-like ability
    as an offensive measure, hoping to shock and humiliate humanoid opponents,
    giving them a chance to make a killing jab. Atomies employ their
    invisibility spell-like ability to get in close and make sneak attacks
    before darting back out of reach.
  - >-
    In lands thick with fey, atomies often serve as border sentries or
    bodyguards to nymphs, dryads, or other more powerful fey creatures. While
    atomies prove only passable in their ability to defend such creatures, other
    fey accept their fealty out of respect and perhaps with a bit of mirth as
    well. Atomies enjoy their time as honor guards, but often grow bored and
    leave their posts in search of adventure.
  - >-
    These nimble creatures adore swordplay and practice with their blades
    endlessly. Atomies often travel their lands seeking adventure tinged with
    mischief. Sensitive to bullying and oppression, atomies revel in turning the
    tables on a cruel mayor or tormenting dishonorable mercenary bands. Atomies,
    enamored with tales of epic duels and the defeat of great evils, sometimes
    follow adventuring parties and eavesdrop on their nightly tales by the
    campfire. If a warrior in the group tends to boast of his swordplay, an
    atomie rarely resists the urge to humble him by sabotaging his equipment or
    invisibly reducing him and challenging him to a duel.
  - >-
    Atomies get along well with grigs, and it is not uncommon to see the two
    types of creatures banding together for defense or companionship. Some sages
    claim the two creatures share a past link, pointing out their similar
    insectile wings. Anyone questioning an atomie or grig about this theory is
    greeted with bouts of shrill tiny laughter. An atomie stands just under a
    foot tall and weighs 2 pounds.
