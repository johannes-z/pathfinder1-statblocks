SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Thunderbolt (Su)
    description: >-
      A thunderbird can fire a ray of thunder and lightning from its outspread
      wings as a standard action. This attack has a range of 200 feet with no
      range increment, and requires a ranged touch attack to hit. A creature
      critically hit by a thunderbolt is stunned and deafened for 1 round if it
      fails a DC 22 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Storm Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A thunderbird is surrounded by a 100-footradius spread of severe winds
      that blow out from the center, dissipating swiftly at the limit of the
      aura's range. In this area, ranged weapons (but not siege weapons) take a
      -4 penalty on attack rolls, Fly checks are made at a -4 penalty, and
      exposed flames are extinguished. Small creatures must make a DC 10
      Strength check (if on the ground) or a DC 20 Fly check to move toward the
      thunderbird, while Tiny or smaller creatures can be knocked backward (1d4
      x 10 feet if they are on the ground and fail a DC 15 Strength check, or
      2d6 x 10 feet if they are flying and fail a DC 25 Fly check). Creatures on
      the ground that are pushed back take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10
      feet, and flying creatures that are pushed back take 2d6 points of
      nonlethal damage regardless of the distance they are pushed. In addition,
      once every 1d4 rounds, a bolt of lightning strikes a random creature
      (other than the thunderbird) within the area of its storm aura. This bolt
      of lightning deals 12d6 points of electricity damage (DC 22 Reflex
      halves). The save DC for the lightning bolt is Constitutionbased, while
      those for resisting the wind effects are fixed.
  - name: Stormsight (Ex)
    description: >-
      A thunderbird ignores all vision penalties and concealment from weather
      effects, including those created by fog cloud, obscuring mist, and similar
      spells.
Description:
  - >-
    Thunderbirds bring the storm on their wings. In times of drought, they are
    welcomed with joy and celebration.
  - >-
    In other times, they are placated with gifts in hopes that they might leave
    quickly before flooding begins. When angered, thunderbirds can call down
    hurricanes and lay waste to entire villages, so in regions where these birds
    dwell, many villages maintain extensive rituals designed to appease and
    honor the local thunderbirds.
  - >-
    Thunderbirds nest near the base of waterfalls, where the constant thrum of
    crashing water prepares the hatchlings for a life at the heart of a storm.
    Once the chicks have hatched, their parents carry the offspring to nests at
    the top of mountains, where the young are struck by their first bolts of
    lightning and learn the mysteries of the storm.
