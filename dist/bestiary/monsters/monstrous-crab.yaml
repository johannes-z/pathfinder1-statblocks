    description: >-
      Monstrous crabs can survive out of the water for 1 hour per point of
      Constitution. Beyond this limit, a monstrous crab runs the risk of
      suffocation, as if it were drowning.
Description:
  - >-
    Monstrous crabs are omnivores and spend most of their time combing the ocean
    floors for food. Many act as vegetarians and sustain themselves on a diet of
    algae, fungus, and water-based plants, while others act as scavengers or
    predators. Some have been known to actively hunt giant clams and snails (the
    monstrous crab pries the shell open and devours the fleshy innards). Still
    others prefer to dwell in coastal waters and prey upon land-based creatures
    that wander too close to the shoreline. Monstrous crabs are often hunted as
    food by other races (particularly humans and sahuagin). Credit The Monstrous
