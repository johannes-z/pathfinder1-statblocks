Description:
  - >-
    Made up of smoke, blood, and gold, raktavarnas are the least of the
    rakshasas-they are born not from humanoids, but from the souls of rakshasas
    who failed utterly in their previous incarnation and who are thus reborn
    from a serpent's egg.
  - >-
    These terrors drift through society, passing from hand to hand as weapons or
    strange tokens from foreign lands, curiosities brought home by traders and
    emissaries and given to leaders as tribute. In this manner the raktavarnas
    gain entry into corridors of power throughout the world, and what they see,
    their foul masters know. A raktavarna's servitude to a master ends only when
    its master decrees, or (more commonly) upon the master's death. Little
    disconcerts raktavarnas more than having no master, and when they are cast
    adrift in this manner, they seek a replacement as soon as they can.
  - >-
    A 7th-level lawful evil spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can gain
    a raktavarna rakshasa as a familiar.
