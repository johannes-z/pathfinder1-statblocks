  - name: Latch (Ex)
    description: >-
      Clockwork soldiers have specially designed hands that easily grasp and
      lock onto weapons and objects. A soldier can attempt to disarm or grapple
      as a standard action without provoking an attack of opportunity, and it
      receives a +2 bonus on disarm checks. In addition, it receives a +2 bonus
      to CMD against attempts to disarm it.
  - name: Proficient (Ex)
    description: A clockwork soldier is proficient with all simple and martial weapons.
  - name: Standby (Ex)
    description: >-
      A clockwork soldier can place itself on standby as a standard action.
      While on standby, a clockwork soldier cannot move or take any actions. It
      remains aware of its surroundings but takes a -4 penalty on Perception
      checks. Time spent on standby does not count against the soldier's
      wind-down duration. A clockwork soldier can exit standby as a swift
      action-if it does so to initiate combat, it gains a +4 racial bonus on its
      Initiative check.
