Description:
  - >-
    The axe beak is a prehistoric flightless, carnivorous bird that resembles a
    7-foot tall ostrich. It is an aggressive hunter and has a strong, thick neck
    and a sharp beak. The axe beak makes a honking noise that can be heard
    clearly up to one-half mile away. An axe beak lair contains 1d4 eggs worth
    50-80 gp each. Hatchlings fetch the same value on the market.
  - >-
    The axe beak attacks by kicking with its clawed feet and biting with its
    beak. It is a very aggressive hunter and runs down its prey should an
    opponent flee. If extremely hungry, an axe beak attacks until it or its prey
    is dead.
