Description_Visual: >-
  This is a nightmarish plant consisting of a bulbous root and several vine-like
  tendrils, each ending in hollow, needle-like points. Woody limbs as thick as a
  human's leg sprout from the trunk. Its leaves are a vile greenish color, and
  constantly drip a sticky, foul-smelling sap.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Blood Drain (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bloodsuckle that grapples a foe can drain blood, dealing 1d4 points of
      Constitution damage each round that the hold is maintained. Once it has
      dealt 8 points of Constitution damage, it releases victim so it can use it
      again later as a food source. Bloodsuckles never kill those they have
      transformed into hosts unless they are extremely hungry.
  - name: Create Host (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bloodsuckle that strikes a living target with a tendril injects a
      special poison sap into the victim that requires a DC 18 Will save, or the
      victim is transformed into a host. This acts as a dominate monster spell
      (caster level 8th) with no limit on its duration. Immunity or resistance
      to poison applies normally to this sap. The save DC is Constitutionbased.
      A victim that becomes a host returns to the plant whenever it calls. It is
      normally used by the bloodsuckle for feeding purposes, but if the plant
      comes under attack may be summoned for defense. A host with an
      Intelligence score of 3 or higher that is commanded to act in a manner
      inconsistent with its alignment (such as attacking allies) is allowed
      another Will save with a +4 bonus to break the bloodsuckle's control.
  - name: Host Sense (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bloodsuckle automatically senses the location of any hosts within 100
      feet.
  - name: Seed (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per month, a bloodsuckle can generate a walnut-sized seed that it
      implants in a host's body. The host wanders off and 1d4 days later, the
      seed breaks open growing a new bloodsuckle inside the host. Each day a
      host remains implanted with this seed, it takes 1d4 points of Constitution
      damage. When its Constitution reaches 0, the host dies and a new
      bloodsuckle erupts from the corpse and takes root. A remove disease spell
      destroys the seedling.
  - name: Summon Host (Ex)
    description: >-
      As free action, a bloodsuckle can generate a high-pitched whine that only
      its hosts can hear. A host that hears this call proceeds immediately at
      its highest rate of speed and in the most direct route toward the plant.
      The whine can be heard by a host within 2 miles of the bloodsuckle.
Description:
  - >-
    Bloodsuckles are semi-intelligent and immobile plants that gain nourishment
    from the blood of living creatures. Unlike other carnivorous plants, the
    bloodsuckle maintains a group of living hosts that it gorges itself on.
    Bloodsuckles are found in forests, swamps, and rolling hills in climates
    where the temperate is mild. They are never found in cold climates, but a
    variety of this plant is thought to exist in warmer regions. When a
    bloodsuckle detects movement within 30 feet, it sends out its long,
    vine-like tendrils towards the disturbance. If the tendril strikes a living
    target, it injects sap into the victim which brings it under the plant's
    control. A bloodsuckle can automatically detect the presence of one of its
    hosts within 30 feet, and does not attack it. Rather, it lets the host draw
    close so it can embrace it with its tendrils and consume its blood.
    Creatures that are not hosts of the bloodsuckle that come within 10 feet are
    attacked by its woody limbs. Copyright Notice Author Erica Balsley.
