Description:
  - >-
    The dungeon dragon is a curious creature that gets amusement by watching
    other beings engaged in life and death struggles. To this end, a dungeon
    dragon sets up a labyrinthine lair, setting traps and populating it with
    monsters. Younger dungeon dragons tend to lair in natural caverns to ease
    the burden of construction. Older, more experienced dungeon dragons have
    been known to construct their own sprawling subterranean complexes, even to
    the point of hiring on dwarf work gangs and swearing them to secrecy. Once
    the construction and refurbishing of its lair is complete, the dungeon
    dragon transforms itself into a humanoid and ventures into the surrounding
    countryside. There it spreads rumors and tales of this horrible catacomb in
    hopes of luring adventurers forth so it may watch them via its crystal ball.
    Young dungeon dragons often spend years living among humanoids, even to the
    point of joining adventurers involved in dungeon delves. On such adventures,
    the intrepid dungeon dragon takes notes regarding the devious traps and
    monsters it encounters so that it can add such things to its own lair. Oddly
    enough, although a dungeon dragon goes to great pains to amass a treasure
    hoard, it cares little for material wealth. Rather, it uses the treasure it
    gathers as bait in its dungeon to lure in adventurers and provide it the
    entertainment it so greatly desires. Watching adventurers explore its
    catacomb is the only real treasure a dungeon dragon desires. The only
    material possession a dungeon dragon will risk its life to save is its
    crystal ball. Without this vital piece of equipment, all of the dragon's
    labor is in vain. A dungeon dragon in its natural form prefers to flee any
    combat. It likes to watch other creatures engaged in fights for life, not
    itself. If forced into melee, it swats at opponents with its powerful claws
    and bite. A dungeon dragon is proficient in the use of all simple and
    martial weapons and light and medium armor and shields. Copyright Notice
