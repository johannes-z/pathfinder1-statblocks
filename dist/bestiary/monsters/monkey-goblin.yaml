  - name: Prehensile Tail (Ex)
    description: >-
      All monkey goblins have long, flexible tails that they can use to carry
      objects. They cannot wield weapons with their tails, but the tails do
      allow them to retrieve small objects stowed on their persons as a swift
      action.
Description:
  - >-
    Monkey goblins are an offshoot of the goblin race adapted for life in the
    high leafy canopies of Golarion's tropical forests. Equipped with ratlike
    prehensile tails, monkey goblins are as at home in the trees as they are on
    the ground.
  - >-
    Monkey goblins lead a savage lifestyle, and many take levels in the
    barbarian class, though warriors and fighters are also common among the
    race. While spellcasting classes are almost unheard of among them, monkey
    goblin shamans in the service of demon lords or other dark gods are given a
    respect by other monkey goblins that borders on fear.
