Description:
  - >-
    Nisps are a race of water-based fey creatures that dwell in swamps, rivers,
    lakes, and seas. They are aggressive hunters and dine on anything they can
    catch and kill. Gray nisps dwell in deeper water, in caves on the ocean
    floor or hollows at the bottom of sizeable lakes. They are isolative and
    territorial. They are also smart enough to realize how dim they are, and
    this realization makes them irritable and unpredictable. They have a keen
    sense of smell, and immediately investigate creatures that stray too close
    to their lair. Their curiosity usually takes the form of pulling apart
    intruders to see how they are built. Though technically sentient, nisps do
    not reason the way most creatures do. They have no concept of love, duty, or
    hatred, though they do seem capable of nearly insatiable curiosity and
    malice. This fearsome creature is 9 feet tall, with light gray skin and a
    white underbelly, and weighs well over 300 pounds. It has large, wicked
    talons and an unusually large mouth, filled with dagger-like teeth. Gray
    nisps surprise intruders if they can. They may start with their spell-like
    powers, or engage directly in melee; they may even attempt to speak with
    intruders, though their innate stupidity usually results in increasing
    frustration, and finally a burst into action. Copyright Notice Author Scott
