SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Charm (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day, a kelpie can produce an effect identical to the charm
      monster spell (caster level 9th). The target can make a DC 17 Will save to
      avoid the effects. If the save fails, the victim believes the kelpie to be
      a very beautiful and attractive creature, and attempts to move as quickly
      as possible toward the kelpie. The kelpie can automatically grapple a
      charmed foe and attempts to drown the victim. A charmed foe does not
      resist the kelpie's embrace, and the drowning attempt does not allow an
      additional save. Female creatures are immune to the kelpie's charm
      ability; only males can be affected. The charm is negated if the victim
      dies, the kelpie dies, or dispel magic, greater dispelling, miracle, or
      wish is cast on the victim. If the save is successful, the target cannot
      be affected by that kelpie's charm or charm touch for 24 hours. The save
      DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
  - name: Charm Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      On a successful slam attack, a kelpie's target must make a DC 17 or be
      charmed as described under the charm ability above. This effect does not
      stack with that ability.
  - name: Reshape Form (Su)
    description: >-
      A kelpie's natural form is that of a mass of dark green seaweed. It can
      assume three other forms. The first is a Small or Medium female humanoid.
      The second form is a hippocampus (see that entry). The third form is a
      Large green horse. In each form, the kelpie retains all of her special
      abilities. She does not truly alter her form (such as shapechangers do),
      she simply reshapes her body. In all of her forms, the kelpie's skin/fur
      has a greenish cast, and her features are slightly distorted. The kelpie's
      ruse can be detected if an opponent who is not charmed succeeds on a DC 10
      Perception check.
  - name: Telepathy (Su)
    description: >-
      A kelpie can communicate telepathically to a range of 1 mile with any
      creature she has touched.
Description:
  - In their true form, kelpies are indistinguishable from normal seaweed.
  - >-
    They are found in saltwater and freshwater, swamps, fens, and stagnated
    underground pools and lakes. Sages and scholars believe the kelpies were
    created by an evil water elemental goddess. In her human guise, a kelpie
    appears as a beautiful female with long flowing dark hair, emerald eyes, and
    soft, pale skin. She is cloaked in robes of seaweed or wears nothing at all.
    A kelpie often assumes a semi-human form in which her lower torso is
    composed entirely of seaweed.
  - >-
    Kelpies lie in wait for their foes, and when a target moves within range,
    they reshape their form to appear human (in most cases, they take the form
    of a drowning woman) so as to lure the target closer. If the ruse is not
    detected and the opponent moves within 5 feet of the kelpie, she attacks,
    attempting to charm and drown her victim. Drowned foes are taken back to the
    kelpie's lair and devoured.
