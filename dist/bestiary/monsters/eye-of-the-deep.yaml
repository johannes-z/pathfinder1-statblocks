Description_Visual: >-
  This creature is a 5-foot wide orb dominated by a central eye and large
  serrated mouth. Hundreds of small seaweed-like bristles hang from the bottom
  of its body. Two large crab-like pincers protrude from its body, and two long,
  thin eyestalks sprout from the top of its orb.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Around Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      An eye of the deep's stalked eyes allow it to see in all directions at
      once. It cannot be flanked.
  - name: Eye Rays (Su)
    description: >-
      Each of the creature's eyes stalks can produce a magical ray once per
      round as a free action. The creature can aim both of its eye rays in any
      direction. Each of its eye rays resembles a spell cast by a 12th-level
      caster and follows the rules for a ray (see Aiming a Spell in the Core
      Rulebook). Each eye ray has a range of 150 feet and a save DC of 17. The
      save DC is Constitution-based. Hold Person Left eye-A target struck by
      this ray must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by the
      spell. An eye of the deep will use this ray early in a fight so as to
      disable its opponents. Hold Monster Right eye-A target struck by this ray
      must succeed on a Will save or be affected as though by the spell. This is
      used in the same manner as the hold person ray. Minor Image By combining
      the rays of both eyes, the eye of the deep can replicate the minor image
      spell. It does not have to succeed on an attack roll to use this ray. The
      illusion is generated at any point within range and in the eye of the
      deep's line of sight.
  - name: Stun Cone (Su)
    description: >-
      An eye of the deep's central eye can, once per round, produce a cone
      extending straight ahead from its front to a range of 30 feet. Creatures
      in the area must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be stunned for 2d4
      rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Feats An eye of the deep's
      Flyby Attack feat allows it to take a move action and another standard
      action at any point during the move while swimming. It cannot take a
      second move action during a round in which it makes a flyby attack.
Description:
  - >-
    Eyes of the deep are found only in the deepest parts of the ocean, though on
    occasion one moves too close to the shoreline and ends up beaching on the
    sands. An eye of the deep stranded in this manner dies in 2d4 minutes unless
    placed back into the water.
  - >-
    An eye of the deep floats slowly through the oceans searching for its prey.
    It attacks using its eye rays; then it grasps an opponent with its pincers
    and subjects the victim to its bite attack. An eye of the deep's pincers are
    considered to be primary attacks.
