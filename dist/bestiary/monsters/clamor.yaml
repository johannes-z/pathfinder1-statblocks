SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Natural Invisibility (Su)
    description: >-
      As creatures of living sound, a clamor is naturally invisible, even when
      it attacks. This ability is inherent and is not subject to the
      invisibility purge spell.
  - name: Sound Mimicry (Ex)
    description: >-
      A clamor can duplicate any sound it has ever encountered with perfect
      accuracy as a free action. It can use this ability to duplicate speech,
      music, or any other auditory phenomenon, although sounds with magical
      properties (such as power word spells) lose their magical effects when
      duplicated.
  - name: Sonic Burst (Ex)
    description: >-
      A clamor can emit a massive onslaught of sonic energy as a full-round
      action that can be heard for miles in all directions. Any living creature
      within 100 feet of the clamor must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save
      or be stunned for 1d3 rounds. Furthermore, living creatures within 50 feet
      of the clamor must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save or be
      permanently deafened. A restoration, wish, miracle, or remove
      blindness/deafness spell restores hearing and negates the stunning effect.
      The save DCs are Constitution-based.
  - name: Related Vulnerabilities (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any magical silence effect or effect that creates a vacuum deals 3d6
      points of damage to a clamor and forces it to make a successful Fortitude
      save (DC equal to 10 + spell level + spell caster's appropriate ability
      score modifier) or become panicked for 1 minute. In addition, the
      following spells can affect a clamor in unusual ways. Ghost sound, major
      image, minor image, message, ventriloquism, whispering wind: These
      magically generated + spell level + the caster's appropriate ability score
      modifier) or act as though affected by a confusion spell for a number of
      rounds equal to the caster's level. Sculpt sound: If targeted directly at
      the clamor, this spell deals 1d4 points of damage per caster level. The
      clamor is allowed a Fortitude save for half damage. Alternately, a bard
      (and only a bard) using sculpt sound can attempt to completely control the
      actions of a clamor. The clamor is allowed an initial Fortitude save to
      negate the effect; if it fails, it is controlled as if by a dominate
      monster spell with a caster level equal to that of the bard's class level.
      Shout, sound burst: These spells do no damage to a clamor, but force it to
      make a Will save or be affected as if by a charm monster spell with a
      caster level equal to that of the caster.
Description:
  - >-
    Clamors have a playful kind of intelligence, and they appear to desire
    communication. Being able to mimic any sound they have ever encountered,
    clamors wander the Material Plane emitting a nonsensical cacophony of
    voices, crashes, clicks, roars, and music. Since they are usually invisible,
    most adventurers that encounter a clamor walk away from the creature without
    ever having realized that they had met one.
  - >-
    Many a sentry on duty has heard only his own voice in response to what he
    thought was someone walking around out in the darkness; what he really heard
    was a clamor trying to talk to him.
  - >-
    Bards are fascinated by these odd creatures, and many a bard has gained a
    clamor as a companion of sorts. They have intelligence, and can be trained.
    A bard of at least 5th level that has had prior contact with a clamor is
    capable of communicating with these creatures on a rudimentary basis.
  - >-
    The intelligence of a clamor is just barely above that of a small child, so
    complex communication is out of reach.
  - >-
    Clamors tend to keep at a distance, emitting random noises and "playing
    back" any interesting sound made by the creatures they are observing.
  - >-
    Once provoked to attack, clamors strike at their foes with high frequency
    sonic beams. If cornered or overwhelmed, a clamor uses its sonic burst
    ability before attempting to flee using its speed of sound ability, which
    almost always ensures its escape.
