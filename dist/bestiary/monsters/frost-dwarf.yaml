      When a frost dwarf is in a cold climate, it deals an extra 1d4 points of
      cold damage with both weapons and natural attacks. This does not function
      if the frost dwarf is in temperate or warmer climates.
Description:
  - >-
    Frost dwarves are chaotic and untamed as the glacial expanses which they
    inhabit. Often they have lairs hidden deep beneath snow and ice packs
    burrowed deep into the living stone where they plunder for gemstones and
    metals as any other dwarf. Skilled crafters, frost dwarves trade freely with
    frost giants, constructing many of their massive weapons and armor in
    exchange for loot and protection. They are typically disliked and dismissed
    by their "true" dwarven kin who consider them to be abominations or worse.
  - >-
    Frost dwarves are known for their rudeness and coarse sense of humor. They
    are however famed for their skill at craftsmanship and the enchantment of
    strange and unusual magical items. Most typically frost dwarves are
    worshippers of Thrym and enjoy his taste in puzzles and conundrums. Frost
    dwarf traps are legendary amongst the frozen wastes of the world.
  - >-
    Frost dwarves are proficient combatants and make use of their natural
    surroundings to their advantage. They assault enemies with crossbows from
    distance and use their battleaxe to crush charges. They enjoy surprise and
    prefer to attack using dirty tricks such as unleashing avalanches upon
    unsuspecting travelers, then pick through their frozen carcasses for loot.
    Higher level frost dwarves often ride winter wolves as mounts. It is not
    uncommon for 1-2 of the beasts to be in the company of a frost dwarf squad.

    Frost dwarves are commonly found serving frost giant masters. In their own
    nations they elect a king from the ruling clans. This jarl rules for life
    though does not necessarily establish any form of dynasty. Frost dwarf clans
    organize themselves loosely after the fashion of their mountain and hill
    dwarf cousins, but are more tribal in nature. Frost dwarves keep a semblance
    of military titles amongst the various clans. Frost dwarves are attuned to
    the use of magic and many of their leaders are powerful wizards or clerics.
    They are equally likely to be barbarians.
  - >-
    There are no frost dwarf females. Frost dwarves are born to the union of a
    frost dwarf and dwarf (any), human, gnome, or frost or hill giant. Any child
    conceived from such a union is always born a frost dwarf male and reaches
    full size within a matter of weeks.
  - >-
    Frost dwarf children are often abandoned near known frost dwarf communities
    where it is expected they will be found and cared for or claimed by their
    father's clan. Frost dwarves are often shunned by their maternal parent as
    an abomination, especially among hill and mountain dwarves who likely banish
    the mother from their halls if she survives the child's birth. The exception
    to this rule is that of frost dwarves born to frost giant and jotun mothers.
    In frost giant culture, frost dwarves are considered a sign of good luck.
    They are however still sent to live amongst others of their kind until they
    reach the age of maturity, which is about 50 years old, when they are
    welcomed back amongst the frost giants who sired them.
