SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Burrowing Bite (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a whirlmaw successful hits a Small or larger creature with its bite
      attack, it immediately attempts to start a grapple as a free action with a
      +4 bonus on the grapple check. If the grapple check is successful, the
      whirlmaw's spinning, sawlike mouth immediately begins to burrow into the
      flesh of the creature, dealing 4d6+12 points of damage per round until the
      grapple is broken.
  - name: Dust Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      By rapidly beating the leathery flaps of skin attached along its body, a
      whirlmaw can raise a cloud of debris while using its Hover feat just as if
      it were a Large creature.
  - name: Flying Charge (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a whirlmaw makes a charge attack while flying, it gains a +4 bonus on
      its attack roll (rather than the normal +2 bonus), and does not take the
      normal -2 penalty to Armor Class.
  - name: Keen Sight (Ex)
    description: >-
      A whirlmaw is extremely sharp-sighted. It takes only half the penalty on
      Perception checks for distance, and can see creatures in open terrain
      clearly from up to a mile away.
Description:
  - >-
    Predators of the deep desert, whirlmaws are just one of the many dangers
    posed to those who travel the dry wastes of inner Rahadoum. Little more than
    flying eaters, these creatures rise singly or in flights, and attack all
    other living creatures that enter their territory. They are equally at home
    nestled in shallow burrows beneath sand dunes or resting in the rocky
    crevices of mountains. When they hunt, they soar upon the high thermals and
    keep an eye out for potential prey through the stony orbs that serve as
    their eyes.
  - >-
    These bizarre hunters prefer to burrow into the torsos of their victims and
    consume the blood-rich organs, leaving the corpses' peripheral parts for
    scavengers. Few that encounter these vicious predators live to tell of it.
    The skeletal remains of whirlmaws' victims can be identified by the
    suspiciously circular sections of their torsos missing where the creatures
    burrowed through and consumed the flesh, bone, and organs in their entirety.
  - >-
    The green, gemlike eyes of a whirlmaw are prized by those who seek exotic
    and dangerous treasures in the desert. It is speculated by some that these
    mystical orbs are the source of the whirlmaw's natural fire immunity, and
    alchemists and wizards often use them as components in creating magic items
    that bestow that form of energy resistance.
