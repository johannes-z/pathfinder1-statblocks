    description: >-
      A plague locust swarm causes damage to unattended objects in its space
      each round as though they were creatures, and can even damage normally
      inedible objects.
  - name: Voracious (Ex)
    description: >-
      A plague locust swarm's swarm attack deals double damage to creatures of
      the plant type and to objects made of paper, wood, or other plant
      materials.
Description:
  - >-
    Locust swarms can be found throughout Golarion, but the desert lands of
    Osirion host one of the most destructive types: plague locusts. Swarms of
    plague locusts can strip acres of crops bare in an hour, and can depopulate
    small villages in a day as they move through and devour everything in sight.
  - >-
    Not only do these ravenous pests rend flesh and savage crops, but they also
    are noted for destroying buildings and other property. Plague locust bites
    can scour tiles off roofs and weaken the exposed support beams of sheds and
    stables (to say nothing of what they do to the camels, goats, and horses
    within). Osirians thank the gods that plague locust swarms are rare and only
    stream through in large numbers every few years.
  - >-
    Plague locust swarms in other regions are considered to be the work of the
    demon lord Deskari, especially those found in the northern reaches of
    Avistan.
