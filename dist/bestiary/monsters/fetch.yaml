  - name: Freezing Touch (Su)
    description: >-
      A fetch's touch is supernaturally cold. It deals an extra 1d4 points of
      cold damage with each claw attack.
Description:
  - >-
    When a murdered person is buried on frozen ground, it often returns from the
    grave as a fetch, an evil undead monster with a hatred of fire and the
    living. Fetches seek out living creatures that wander too close to their
    lair, kill them, and often bury them in hope that they rise from their
    frozen resting place as a fetch. Slain foes not buried are dragged to the
    fetch's lair and devoured. Fetches savor the flesh of humanoids and
    monstrous humanoids, in particular humans, elves, and centaurs.
  - >-
    A fetch stands anywhere from 5 to 7 feet tall and weighs between 100 and 250
    pounds. Its clothes are tattered and worn with age and exposure.
  - Its rotting flesh is drawn tight around its bones and flushed grayish-white.
  - >-
    Its hair is scraggly and frozen and ice crystals cover its skin. A fetch's
    eyes are stark blue.
  - A fetch is a ruthless opponent, slashing its foes with its wicked claws.
  - >-
    Fetches always fight to the death, but are smart enough to flee when
    presented with fire, if they cannot attack the opponent wielding the fire.
  - >-
    If a fetch flees from an encounter because of fire, it follows the one who
    presented the fire (lurking in the shadows, hiding in cover) and eventually
    exacts its revenge.
