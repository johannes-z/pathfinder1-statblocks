SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Flame Jump (Sp)
    description: >-
      A peri can enter any fire equal to the peri's size or larger and travel
      any distance to another fire in a single round, regardless of the distance
      between the two. This ability otherwise functions as greater teleport
      (caster level 14th), but the peri can transport only itself and up to 50
      pounds of objects.
  - name: Smoke Sight (Su)
    description: A peri can see through fire, fog, and smoke without penalty.
  - name: Whirlwind Dance (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per day as a full-round action, a peri can spin in an ever-faster,
      whirling dance, transforming itself into a spinning vortex of flame 10 to
      40 feet high for up to 9 rounds. This ability functions as the whirlwind
      ability (DC 26 Reflex save), but any creature that comes in contact with
      the whirlwind or is caught inside it takes 2d6+6 points of fire damage and
      is subject to the peri's burn special attack. The save DC is
      Dexterity-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Peris are a race of celestials native to the good-aligned Outer Planes, but
    they are also often found in the company of mortals on the Material Plane.
    Believed to be the descendants of fallen angels, peris do penance for their
    ancestors' sins before they can earn a place in paradise. As a result, peris
    work tirelessly to aid and support good heroes of the mortal realms in a
    never-ending battle against evil.
  - >-
    Peris hate the evil fiends known as divs, who constantly seek to ruin the
    good works of mortals. Peris often work to repair damage wrought by the
    destructive divs. For their part, the divs take great pleasure in tormenting
    and persecuting peris, locking the fiery-winged celestials in cages of cold
    iron and endlessly torturing them.
