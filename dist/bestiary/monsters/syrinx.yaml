Description:
  - >-
    From lofty monastery-cities entrenched in soaring cliff sides and high
    mountain valleys, the syrinx seek to bring peace to all lands that fall
    within sight of their marbled spires. Erudite and aloof, the owl-like
    scholars embrace art, philosophy, and nebulous faiths, seeking to distance
    themselves from a history of barbarism and ruin. To this end, they seek to
    enslave all lesser races, especially those without wings. Their elitist
    culture rests upon thousands of backs in an elaborate hierarchy of slaves.
    Directly below the syrinx are the strix, a race they magically modified in
    the distant past to serve as warriors and slave masters.
