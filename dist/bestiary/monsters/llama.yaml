  - name: Spit (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per hour, a llama can regurgitate the contents of its stomach,
      spitting the foul material at a single target within 10 feet. The target
      must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Perhaps llamas' most distinctive feature is their long necks. Rival males
    violently bump their necks against one another during fights for dominance
    among the herd, but overall these social animals are remarkably tame.
