SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mucus (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a flail snail can excrete a trail of mucus which covers
      its space and lasts for 10 minutes. This mucus comes in two types: slimy
      and sticky. Slimy mucus covers three squares with the effects of a grease
      spell. Sticky mucus covers the squares with the effects of a web spell.
      Both effects are DC 14. The saves are Constitution-based. Flail snails are
      immune to this mucus. Both types of mucus can be burned way as per the web
      spell.
  - name: Retraction (Ex)
    description: >-
      A flail snail can pull its fleshy parts back into its shell as a swift
      action, increasing its natural armor bonus by +6, but it cannot move or
      attack while retracted. It can return to normal as a free action.
  - name: Slime Rope (Ex)
    description: >-
      A flail snail can turn its mucus into a ropelike strand up to 60 ft. long,
      and can use this rope to hang itself and up to 1,000 extra pounds from the
      ceiling indefinitely, or to lower itself safely at a speed of 20 feet per
      round. It can climb back up this rope at a speed of 10 feet per round.
      Once the snail breaks contact with the rope, the slime decomposes in 1d4
      rounds, after which it cannot be used by the snail or any other creatures.
      While the slime rope exists, other creatures can climb the rope with a DC
      20 Climb check.
  - name: Suction (Ex)
    description: >-
      A snail's foot adheres to surfaces so well that its 10-foot climb speed
      applies even on perfectly sheer surfaces and ceilings, with no chance to
      fall off unless the foot is actively pinned and peeled away as part of a
      grapple.
  - name: Warp Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      Anytime a spell targets a flail snail, there is an 80% chance that it
      produces a random effect instead of affecting the snail. Only spells that
      directly target the flail snail are warped; area effect spells are not
      affected. If a spell is warped, roll 1d10 and consult the following table.
      1d10 Result 1-3 Spell misfires. For the next 1d4 rounds, the caster must
      make a DC 15 concentration check to successfully cast spells. 4-6 Spell
      misfires. The creature nearest the flail snail is affected as if the spell
      had been cast on him. 7-9 Spell fails; nothing happens 10 Spell rebounds
      on caster (as spell turning)
Description:
  - >-
    Flail snails are solitary omnivores found in the deepest recesses of
    caverns, caves, and dungeons. There they sustain themselves on a diet of
    fungus, mold, and rodents. The shell of a dead flail snail can be sold on
    the open market for 3,000-5,000 gp. A flail snail attacks by smashing its
    prey with its mace-like tentacles. It attacks until either it or its
    opponents are dead. Greater Flail Snail A flail snail has one mace-like
    tentacle per Hit Die. Thus, a 6 HD flail snail has 6 tentacles; an 8 HD
    flail snail has 8 tentacles; and a 12 HD flail snail has 12 tentacles.
