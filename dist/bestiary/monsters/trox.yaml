Description:
  - >-
    Trox were once members of a much smaller and more docile race of
    subterranean burrowers, but were long ago enslaved by the duergar and bred
    into useful brutes. Eventually, several clans of trox were able to escape
    their slavers and reach the surface world, though they found the creatures
    above were just as eager to enslave them. Most trox still live a life of
    servitude. A free trox tends to be loyal to its true friends and
    inquisitive, though it can harbor deep grudges and resentments.
