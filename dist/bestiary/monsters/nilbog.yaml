SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Damage Reversal (Ex)
    description: >-
      When struck by any attack that would normally damage the nilbog, it
      actually gains hit points equal to the damage the attack would have
      otherwise dealt. A nilbog gains any extra hit points above its normal
      total as temporary hit points, though it can never have more than twice
      its normal hit points. (Excess hit points are simply lost.). The nilbog
      can only be damaged through the use of curative magic and effects (cure
      light wounds and healing potions, for instance). Curative magic deals
      damage equal to the amount it would normally heal. Spatio-Temporal
  - name: Reversal (Ex)
    description: >-
      A nilbog constantly emanates an aura of confusion in a 20-foot-radius. A
      creature in the area must succeed on a DC 11 Will save or be affected as
      if by a confusion spell (caster level 4th). The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The nilbog is a goblin afflicted with a strange space-time reversal disease
    known as Nilbogism. The disease appears to occur when overly heavy use of
    magic strains the fabric of the space-time continuum and leads to some very
    strange localized events. The disease only affects goblins and is not
    transmitted by them. Nilbogs resemble goblins in appearance and are
    indistinguishable from them. The nilbog favors ambushes, dirty tricks, and
    overwhelming odds to a fair fight. It moves within range of a foe so as to
    affect the creature with its spatio-temporal reversal ability. Nilbog
    leaders tend to be rogues or fighter/rogues. Nilbogs worship various goblin
    gods of evil and can choose two of the following domains: Chaos, Evil, and
    Trickery. Most nilbog spellcasters, however, are adepts. Nilbog adepts favor
    spells that fool or confuse enemies. Nilbogs as Characters Nilbogs are
    defined by class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. Nilbogs have
    the following racial traits. -2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, -2 Charisma. Nilbogs
    are quick but weak and ugly. Small: Nilbogs are Small creatures and gain a
    +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty to their
    CMB and CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks. Fast: Nilbogs are fast
    for their size, and have a base speed of 30 feet. Darkvision: Nilbogs can
    see in the dark up to 60 feet. Skilled: +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks.
    Special Attacks: Spatio-temporal reversal (see above) Special Defenses:
    Damage reversal (see above) Languages: Goblins begin play speaking Goblin.
    Goblins with high Intelligence scores can choose any of these bonus
    languages: Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Gnoll, Gnome, Halfling, Orc. Credit
