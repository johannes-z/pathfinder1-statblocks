SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Attach (Ex)
    description: >-
      When an onwu azu hits with a bite attack, it automatically grapples its
      foe, though the target isn't considered to be grappling the onwu azu. Each
      round the onwu azu is grappling its foe, it automatically deals its bite
      damage.
  - name: Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      An onwu azu can launch itself into the air and glide for up to 1 minute
      (depending on water and weather conditions, at the GM's discretion). When
      gliding, it has a fly speed of 60 feet with clumsy maneuverability and
      gains Flyby Attack.
  - name: Keen Scent (Ex)
    description: >-
      An onwu azu can notice creatures by scent within a 180-foot radius
      underwater and can detect blood in the water at ranges of up to 1 mile.
Description:
  - >-
    Onwu azus are a species of saltwater flying fish that grow to a hefty size
    and have a taste for the blood of warm-blooded animals. They're similar to
    giant flying piranha, and their name roughly translates to "flying death" in
    the dialect of Polyglot spoken along the coasts of the western Mwangi
    Expanse.
  - >-
    Like salmon, onwu azus are born in rivers and migrate downstream to the
    ocean during their adolescence. There, they grow to their adult size and
    develop the ability to swim at incredible speeds and use their wing-like
    pectoral fins to glide above the waves. Onwu azus return to the river where
    they were born to reproduce, and die shortly afterward.
  - >-
    Onwu azus use their glide ability to hunt prey, and although they are
    capable of subsisting on smaller fish and other marine animals, they prefer
    the blood and meat of land-dwelling creatures. After spotting a target,
    schools of onwu azus soar over the waves at great speeds, hurling themselves
    at their preferred food sources and biting with their incredibly sharp
    teeth, employing a suction grip that is difficult to break. Once attached,
    the onwu azus continue biting until their prey is killed. Their bites cause
    continuous bleeding, and most of their victims die from shock and blood loss
    long before the onwu azus reach vital organs. These fish can survive for up
    to 5 minutes out of the water, and if they succeed at killing their prey on
    land, they briefly feed before flopping back into the water to look for
    their next meal.
  - >-
    More than one pirate has been knocked from his ship by a surprise onwu azu
    attack. Rather than just leaping to take a bite of air-breathing prey, the
    fish will often bull rush prey on either a coast or ship's deck, intending
    to knock it into the waiting mouths of the school below. Shallow inlets and
    river mouths in the paths of spawning onwu azus are often littered with the
    remains sailors and explorers who ran afoul of these deadly fish.
    Adventurers who find treasure in such areas would do well to wonder what
    killed any corpses lying beside loot and take appropriate precautions.
  - >-
    Onwu azus grow to over 4 feet in length with fin-spans of over 6 feet, and
    can weigh close to 90 pounds. Their skin is generally dark blue or brown,
    and their pectoral fins are a scintillating red that shimmers in the sun
    with a kaleidoscope of colors.
