IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bladed Slam (Ex)
    description: >-
      The First Blade's slam attacks deal bludgeoning and slashing damage. Its
      slams count as natural weapons or manufactured weapons (whichever is most
      beneficial to it) for the purpose of spells that enhance attacks, and as
      adamantine, chaotic, and magic for the purpose of overcoming damage
      reduction and bypassing hardness.
  - name: Ironsense (Ex)
    description: >-
      The First Blade automatically detects iron objects within 60 feet, just as
      if it possessed the blindsight ability.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Su)
    description: >-
      The First Blade has the same immunity to magic as an iron golem. It can
      lower this resistance for 1 round as a standard action.
  - name: Lord of Battle (Ex)
    description: >-
      The First Blade is proficient in all weapons, and counts as an 18th-level
      barbarian and fighter for the purposes of all prerequisites.
  - name: Rage Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      Willing creatures within 100 feet of the First Blade gain the effects of
      rage automatically, whether they are allies or enemies of the herald.
      Those who choose not to be affected are immune to the aura until they
      leave the area and return.
  - name: Swarm Form (Su)
    description: >-
      The herald can transform into a floating swarm of Tiny sharp metal
      fragments. In this form it has the swarm subtype, cannot make slam
      attacks, gains the distraction ability (DC 28), and can make a swarm
      attack that deals 4d6 points of slashing damage to its targets.
Description:
  - >-
    Said to have been formed from an unthinking sliver of steel dashed from
    Gorum's blade during one of his violent clashes with a god-beast felled long
    ago, the First Blade is a living tool of war. Inspired by Gorum's divine
    bloodlust, the First Blade continues to do battle in the service of its
    divine master. It has been reforged through the eons into a manifestation of
    Gorum's perfect warrior, and now serves as the war god's herald, traveling
    where its master desires. The herald answers only the calls of those who
    please Gorum in battle-weakling priests who beg for salvation from deadly
    foes never have their entreaties answered. Tales tell of the herald
    appearing amid lesser battles and, upon finding them to be mere skirmishes
    or clashes among weaklings, slaughtering all involved in disgust.
  - >-
    The appearance of the First Blade transforms to match a style of armor
    that's impressive to those it will be facing in battle. Regardless of its
    form, it typically stands about 15 feet tall and weighs nearly 5 tons.
