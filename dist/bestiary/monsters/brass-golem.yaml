SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Brass Falchion (Ex)
    description: >-
      A brass golem's falchion deals damage as a Huge falchion, but is actually
      a primary natural attack, not a manufactured weapon, and cannot be
      disarmed.
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      As a free action once every 1d4 rounds, a brass golem can expel a cloud of
      smoke and cinders that fills a 20-foot cube. This functions as an
      incendiary cloud that persists for 1d6 rounds, dealing 6d6 points of fire
      damage (DC 20 Reflex for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Death Throes (Ex)
    description: >-
      A brass golem explodes when it is destroyed. All creatures within 30 feet
      of the golem take 12d8 points of fire damage (DC 20 Reflex for half). The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A brass golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows
      spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function
      differently against the creature. • A magical attack that deals cold
      damage slows a brass golem (as per the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds, with no
      saving throw. • A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow
      effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of
      damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would
      cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess
      as temporary hit points. A brass golem gets no save against fire effects.
