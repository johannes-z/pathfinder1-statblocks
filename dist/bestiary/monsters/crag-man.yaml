SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Pierce (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a crag man can transform its hands into stony points.
      When striking with its hands in this manner, it deals piercing damage
      instead of bludgeoning with its slam attack.
Description:
  - >-
    Sometimes called living stalagmites, crag men are found underground in
    naturally occurring caverns, caves, and other such subterranean places.
  - >-
    They detest sunlight, but are not harmed by it. They are a malevolent race
    of semi-intelligent beings that make their way in the world by means of
    brutality, trickery, and deceit.
  - >-
    Crag men prefer to attack from ambush. They wait, in stalagmite form for
    interlopers to enter their lair. Using their tremorsense ability, crag men
    can pinpoint the location of all intruders and wait patiently until they can
    catch their opponents unaware. At that time, they assume humanoid form and
    attack, pummeling their foes with their powerful fists or changing their
    fists into sharpened, dagger-like points and stabbing their opponents.
  - >-
    If overpowered or outnumbered, a crag man summons a cluster of piercers to
    aid it or cover its escape. Creatures killed by crag men are stored as food
    and eventually devoured.
  - >-
    Crag men communicate with one another through body language and a series of
    low, rumbling moans. Sages are unsure of whether crag men can actually speak
    or understand any other language.
  - >-
    Crag Man Society Crag Men have no formal society structure and exist in
    loose bands or colonies. The leader is the strongest member of the colony
    and rules through intimidation and fear. Crag men are believed to be asexual
    and sages have been unsuccessful in determining their exact means of
    reproduction. No young have ever been encountered, but several "eggs"
    resembling softened stone have been seen, closely guarded, in many crag men
    lairs. Sages believe these "eggs" might shed some light on the crag men's
    means of reproducing-if they could only obtain one of the eggs to examine.
  - >-
    Crag Men detest vilstraks (q.v.) and attack them on sight, showing no mercy
    in battle until all vilstraks are dead or captured. The reason for this
    deep-seated hatred is unknown, but it believed to stem from a war long ago
    pitting a large colony of crag men against an even larger colony of
    vilstraks. Vilstraks are sometimes captured and kept as slaves. Those
    unfortunate enough to suffer this fate are ultimately killed when their
    usefulness expires.
  - >-
    Crag Men have a strong affinity to piercers (see the Hazards Appendix).
    These subterranean horrors are almost always found scattered throughout crag
    man lairs. The crag men are intelligent enough to know exactly where their
    piercer allies are located; piercers, in turn, will not drop down upon a
    crag man except in self-defense.
