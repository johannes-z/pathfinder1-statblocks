SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Weapon Attunement (Su)
    description: >-
      Fyrs have a mystical ability to attune themselves with any weapon they
      wield. A weapon held by a fyr functions as a masterwork item (gaining a +1
      bonus to attack rolls) as long as the fyr wields it. This bonus does not
      stack with the enhancement bonus gained from magical weapons, or the bonus
      gained from a masterwork weapon. This bonus is included in the statistics
      block above.
Description:
  - >-
    Fyr are satyr-like creatures that make their homes in the mountainous wilds
    and dense forests in well-secluded places such as caves or caverns or under
    a covering of thick branches and giant leaves. They are a solitary and
    nomadic race, rarely staying in one place for much longer than a few months
    before moving on. Though always on the move, a fyr can acclimate itself to
    its surroundings very quickly. Most encounters are with a solitary creature
    or a solitary creature and its animal companions.
  - >-
    Fyrs are on good terms with gnomes, druids, treants, elves, and halflings,
    and often trade goods with them or aid them in times of need. Fyr are master
    jewelers, and their trinkets and baubles are highly sought after by some of
    the more civilized races that appreciate fine jewelry. These fey tolerate
    humans and dwarves and likewise trade with them when they near a human
    settlement or dwarven stronghold. Fyr dislike orcs, goblins, bugbears, and
    other goblinoids, and avoid contact with them.
  - >-
    Fyrs prefer to avoid combat if possible, but if their homeland or comrades
    are threatened, they attack. Fyrs use their natural ability to hide
    themselves in their terrain and attack from surprise. Most of the time a fyr
    attacks by butting with its horns, but some prefer a "less animalistic" form
    of combat and use weapons in combat. Favored weapons include a small
    longsword, club, hand axe, and dagger. A fyr does not hesitate to retreat if
    the tide of battle turns against it and usually employs pass without trace
    so it can escape without being tracked. If encountered with its animal
    companions, the fyr directs them in combat against its foes.
