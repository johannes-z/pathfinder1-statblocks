  - name: Dance of Death (Ex)
    description: >-
      A necrophidius can entrance opponents by swaying back and forth. Those
      within 30 feet viewing the dancing snake must succeed on a DC 12 Will save
      or be dazed for 2d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The necrophidius appears to be a great skeletal snake topped with a human
    skull. To the dismay of some (mainly clerics) it is not undead and therefore
    cannot be turned or rebuked. The necrophidius is a construct created by an
    arcane caster to serve as a guardian or assassin. It performs either task
    with great skill, and being a construct, it never questions its duty as
    guard or assassin. A typical necrophidius is 10 feet long. The necrophidius
    opens combat with its dance of death ability; entranced victims are bitten
    and paralyzed. Paralyzed victims are either slain by the necrophidius or
    left to their own accord (depending on the exact instructions given to the
    necrophidius by its creator). Rattler A variation of the necrophidius, the
    rattler is constructed from the skeletal remains of a giant rattlesnake.
    During the creation process, the tail rattle is left intact and magicked to
    create a confusion effect on those that hear it rattle. The rattler uses the
    same statistics as the standard necrophidius except it does not gain the
    necrophidius' dance of death special attack. Instead it gains the special
    attack detailed below. Rattle (Ex) By shaking its tail rattle, the creature
    emits a rattling noise to a range of 30 feet. Those within the area that
    hear this rattle must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or be affected as by a
    confusion spell for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. Construction
    A necrophidius' body consists of a human skull and the skeletal remains of a
    constrictor snake treated with rare oils and powders worth at least 1,000
    gp. NECROPHIDIUS CL 10th; Price 7,500 gp Requirements Craft Construct,
