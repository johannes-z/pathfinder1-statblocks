SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      A zomok's breath weapon is a cone of flying dirt, bark, stones, and moss,
      which takes root as soon as it touches the ground. Creatures may attempt a
      saving throw for half damage. Any creature that fails its save and is
      touching the ground is entangled for 1d6 rounds by this material. A
      creature can break free with a DC 28 Strength or Escape Artist check. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Forest Step (Su)
    description: >-
      A zomok in a forest area may teleport up to 120 feet by moving the essence
      of its being to another forested area. The zomok is cured of 60 points of
      damage when it does this. It may use this ability once every 1d6+1 rounds
      but no more than three times per day. If the zomok has swallowed a foe,
      the foe is left behind when the zomok teleports.
Description:
  - >-
    Zomoks are dragonlike creatures made out of animate plant matter. Native to
    the realm of the fey, they are guardians of mystic forests. Some travel to
    the Material Plane and adapt to its woodlands, defending them against
    massive destruction-forest fires, logging, undead armies, and so on-and use
    their abilities to heal and regrow damaged areas. Rather than having a
    distinct physical body, a zomok is more like a spirit animating a collective
    mass of vegetation, and over time it sheds and acquires new material from
    its environment, changing its appearance to match its current location.
    Zomoks do not need to eat, and any creature they swallow is usually left
    behind as a mashed corpse to decay and provide nutrition for plants. A
    typical zomok is about 18 feet tall and 30 feet long, and weighs 30 tons.
