    description: >-
      When a bloodworm bites an opponent, it secretes a pheromone that mixes
      with the blood and that can be detected by other bloodworms to a range of
      120 ft. This functions on both land and in water.
Description:
  - >-
    Bloodworms are carnivorous hunters with voracious appetites, and though not
    aquatic by nature, prefer a diet of fish, especially smaller sharks and
    dolphins, shellfish, and the occasional swimmer. Hunting occurs whenever the
    bloodworm is hungry-day or night.
  - >-
    A bloodworm's lair is beneath the ground, usually in soft earth near the
    shoreline of lakes and streams. A typical lair is at least as deep as the
    bloodworm is long and terminates in a large round chamber. Here the
    bloodworm dine on captured prey and spawn during mating season.
  - >-
    Bloodworms mate during the late summer months. Young are born alive and kept
    wet by secretions from the larger bloodworms as well as water from nearby
    lakes and rivers. The young do not hunt yet and are cared for by the adults.
    Within a few months the young are strong enough to fend for themselves and
    do so, going out on their own.
  - >-
    Bloodworms are pale and slightly pink in color. They can grow to a length of
    40 feet or more, though most average about 12-15 feet long. The red stripes
    seen along its body are actually a combination of its bodily fluids and the
    fluids of recently devoured prey flowing through the creature.
  - >-
    A bloodworm lies in wait for its prey, most often just beneath the silt and
    sand near shorelines. When it detects a potential meal, the bloodworm lunges
    from its hiding spot, striking with its extended proboscis. Slain prey is
    dragged into its lair and devoured.
