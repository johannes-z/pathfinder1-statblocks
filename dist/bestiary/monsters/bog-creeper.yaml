SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      Three times per day, a bog creeper can spew digestive acid from its mouth
      in a 30-foot cone that deals 2d8 points of acid damage to all creatures in
      the area, with a DC 20 Reflex save allowed for half damage. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Camouflage (Ex)
    description: >-
      Since a bog creeper looks like a plant when at rest, it takes a DC 20
      Perception check to notice it before it attacks. Anyone with ranks in
      Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use one of those skills instead of
      Perception to notice the plant.
  - name: Marsh Move (Ex)
    description: >-
      A bog creeper can move across marshy terrain without incurring any
      movement penalties.
Description:
  - >-
    The bog creeper is a creature native to the thickest, darkest swamps. It
    superficially resembles a man-sized rotted tree trunk sprouting several
    thorny tendrils each about 10 feet long and a single 6-foot long limb. Bog
    creepers are carnivorous, lurking amid dead trees and stumps waiting to
    ambush unsuspecting prey. The shattered boles and stumps make perfect
    camouflage for the sly bog creeper.
  - >-
    Marshes and swamps are home to the bog creeper and it moves through the
    territory with ease; it can swim the waters and shamble across the rare
    patches of dry or swampy ground in pursuit of its prey.
  - >-
    The treasure of a bog creeper is located in its pulpy gullet, and consists
    of the inorganic, indigestible remains and possessions of its victims.
  - >-
    A bog creeper attacks by ambushing its prey, lying in wait for someone or
    something to wander nearby. When prey comes within range, it lashes out with
    its single limb and slashes with its tendrils. It uses its tendrils to grab
    prey and either constrict it or transfer it to its mouth where it bites with
    its toothy maw. A desperate bog creeper can also vomit forth its powerful
    digestive sap in order to dispatch its opponents.
