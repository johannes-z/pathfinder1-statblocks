  - name: Static Discharge (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as part of a move action taken to fly at least 10
      feet, a warmonger wasp's wings can discharge a bolt of electricity to a
      range of up to 60 feet. The bolt explodes upon reaching its target,
      creating a 20-foot-radius burst that deals 6d6 points of electricity
      damage (Reflex DC 15 half).
Description:
  - >-
    Like the more powerful retriever, the warmonger wasp is a construct built
    from the protoplasmic flesh and chaotic fecundity of the Abyss itself.
    Appearing as partially organic, partially metallic, warmonger wasps serve
    the demonic armies as air support in large battles, and the armies of the
    Worldwound are no exception. Their electricity-based explosions work well on
    battlefields where demons and mortals clash, as electrical attacks have no
    effect on demons. It's more accurate to say that warmonger wasps are grown
    rather than constructed, and while the procedure of crafting these foul
    constructs is beyond the ken of mortal crafters, spellcasters can conjure
    them to do their bidding (see below). Warmonger wasps are only intelligent
    enough to understand simple commands, and only ones universally associated
    with battlefield conditions.
  - >-
    In the Worldwound, a large number of warmonger wasps have been left to their
    own devices. These "wild" wasps buzz through the skies, constantly watching
    for any non-demons to swoop down on and attack. Cultists and other
    worshipers of Deskari not escorted by demons are quick to speak in Abyssal
    and show their unholy symbols when confronted by a flight of warmongers. PCs
    eager to do the same can convince the wasps to leave them alone with a
    successful DC 20 Bluff check-provided the attempt is made while speaking
    Abyssal.
  - >-
    A warmonger wasp is about 10 feet long, with a 20-foot wingspan. They weigh
    1,200 pounds.
  - Conjuring a Warmonger Wasp
  - >-
    Although a warmonger wasp is not an outsider, it may nonetheless be conjured
    by either planar ally or planar binding. The spellcaster must take care to
    do so, however, using special rare incenses, the secretions of rare and
    violent insects, and complex diagrams inked on the floor and walls with
    expensive phosphorescent inks, lest the wasp attack the spellcaster upon the
    spell's completion. These components cost 15,000 gp and replace the usual
    costs associated with casting either spell (including planar binding's
    Charisma check requirement).
