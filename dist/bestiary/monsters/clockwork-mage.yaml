Description:
  - >-
    These constructs are the pinnacle of clockwork inventions. An ingenious
    combination of mechanical devices and magical conduits allows a clockwork
    mage to channel the power of a wand into a variety of arcane powers. They
    often serve powerful arcane spellcasters, or as unf linching and
    unquestioning casters to those who wants the benefit of spells without ego
    or free thought. A humanoid figure of mithral and steel, a clockwork mage
    has large crystal ball filled with shifting vapors for a head. It stands 7
    feet tall.
