Description:
  - >-
    The squat, burrowing badger is plentiful in most temperate forests. Most
    species are carnivorous, though some eat a variety of meat, insects, and
    vegetables. The badger possesses a fierceness and natural tenacity, while
    its stubby legs and wide, seemingly portly stature belie the creature's
    actual strength and speed.
  - >-
    A typical badger has dark brownish-gray fur highlighted with white markings,
    such as bands or striped masks about the eyes.
  - >-
    These markings are distinct and vary by species. While generally friendly,
    if threatened or otherwise provoked, badgers can become fierce combatants.
  - >-
    Once engaged with an opponent, they typically fight until slain. In combat,
    they fight with their sharp, needle-like teeth and long, curved claws, which
    they otherwise use for digging.
