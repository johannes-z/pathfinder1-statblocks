Description:
  - >-
    A rock reptile is a 5-foot long chameleon-like lizard that lairs in rocky
    areas such as caves and outcroppings. It is fond of darkness and only leaves
    its seclusion when it is ravaged by hunger. Its chameleon-like hide allows
    it to blend with its surroundings where it is often mistaken for a pile of
    rocks.
  - >-
    Rock reptiles are ambush predators and lie quietly in wait for prey to come
    within range. Once prey is within range, the creature springs from its
    hiding place with blinding speed and bites at its prey.
