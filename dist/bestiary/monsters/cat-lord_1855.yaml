SQ: change shape (human and panther, polymorph)
Environment: temperate forest
Organization: solitary or troupe (Cat Lord plus 3-6 lions or tigers, or 5-8 cheetahs)
Treasure: double standard
Description_Visual: This creature resembles a great black panther with ruby eyes.
Group: Cat Lord
Source: Tome of Horrors Complete
IsTemplate: '0'
SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      The Cat Lord can assume the shape of a human as a standard action. In
      human form, the Cat Lord cannot use his natural weapons or his howl,
      pounce, spit, or rake special attacks but can wield weapons and wear
      armor. Unlike the normal change shape ability, the Cat Lord retains his
      movement modes (and speeds) in human form.
  - name: Feline Passivism (Ex)
    description: >-
      Felines (including dire versions) do not willingly attack the Cat Lord,
      though they can be forced to do so by magic. If the Cat Lord attacks a
      feline, its protection against that creature ends.
  - name: Howl (Su)
    description: >-
      When the Cat Lord howls, all creatures except felines within a 20-foot
      spread must succeed on a DC 24 Will save or be stunned for 1d2 rounds. A
      creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the Cat
      Lord's howl for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Immortality (Su)
    description: >-
      The Cat Lord is effectively immortal and nearly impossible to slay. When
      slain, the Cat Lord's soul reforms on the Astral Plane. Within 9 days, it
      inhabits another feline on the Material Plane and the Cat Lord reforms. No
      form of magic (such as magic that would contain or trap his soul) prevents
      this. To permanently kill the Cat Lord, it is thought that one must
      destroy every feline in existence (so his soul has no creature to
      inhabit).
  - name: Spit (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a ranged attack, the Cat Lord can spit a line of
      caustic saliva at a single target to a range of 30 feet. A creature hit
      must succeed on a DC 24 Reflex save or be blinded. Remove blindness or
      dispel magic (vs. CL 19th) removes the blindness effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    There is only one. The Cat Lord is the Lord of All Felines. His natural form
    is that of a black panther with dark, ruby eyes. He can assume a human form,
    and in this form, he appears as a dark-skinned human with black hair,
    chiseled features, and ruby eyes. In human form, he stands 6 feet tall and
    he almost always dresses in black. The Cat Lord spends his days roaming the
    Material Plane, Astral Plane, and Ethereal Plane. In combat, the Cat Lord
    almost always assumes feline form (if he's not already in that form) and
    attacks with two claws and a bite. The Cat Lord often enters combat with
    both haste and blur in effect. If combat goes against him, he usually
    summons a group of felines to his aid or to cover his escape. Credit The Cat
