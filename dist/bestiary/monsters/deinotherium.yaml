SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Sweep (Ex)
    description: >-
      A deinotherium can sweep a target with its downward-curving tusks and
      knock the victim to the ground. As part of a charge, a deinotherium can
      move up to twice its base speed in a straight line and make a gore attack
      at any point during its movement. If this attack is successful, the target
      is knocked prone and the deinotherium can deal damage with its trample
      attack before continuing its movement.
Description:
  - >-
    Deinotheriums are regal beasts of the same evolutionary family as the
    elephant, though with a shorter temper that far exceeds that of their more
    docile cousins. These creatures are known to attack with very little
    provocation, charging and sweeping a target under their gigantic feet to
    trample it to death. A typical deinotherium stands approximately 12 feet
    tall at the shoulder, measures 25 feet from trunk to tail, and weighs 30,000
    pounds.
  - >-
    While deinotheriums are herbivores, their quick tempers have given them a
    reputation as man-eaters. The downward-swooping tusks under a deinotherium's
    mouth are used to dig for roots and tubers that it can scoop up and devour
    using its prehensile trunk. It also uses its curved tusks to hook tree
    branches and pull them close to allow for easier feeding. The trunk itself
    is much shorter and wider than that of an elephant, and its huge nasal
    passages give the creature an acute sense of smell.
  - >-
    Deinotheriums are not herd creatures, generally grouping only into small
    family packs of a calf and its parents. A mother usually gives birth to only
    a single calf, and will fiercely protect it well into its adult life. The
    father remains with the mother and calf until the calf reaches maturity,
    then leaves to find a new mate.
