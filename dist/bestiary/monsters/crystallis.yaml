  This massive creature appears to be formed of quartz, earth, and crystal and
  stands about 13 feet tall. Its powerful arms and legs end in razor-sharp claws
  that glint and shine like polished steel. Its large rounded head sports two
  sunken crystalline eyes and a gaping toothless maw.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bleed (Ex)
    description: >-
      The razor-sharp claws of a crystallis cause such persistent wounds a DC 19
      Heal check is required to stop the bleed damage. Healing magic works as
      usual.
  - name: Crystalline Claws (Ex)
    description: >-
      A crystallis's claws are extraordinarily strong and are treated as
      adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This is
      a function of the creature itself and if the claws are somehow detached or
      removed (say from a dead crystallis) they immediately crumble into fine
      powder.
  - name: Petrification Cloud (Su)
    description: >-
      A crystallis can breathe forth a cloud of orange smoke as a free action
      once every 1d4+1 rounds. The cloud fills a 10-foot cube in front of the
      crystallis and lasts for 1 round before dispersing. A living creature
      caught in the cloud must succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or turn into a
      crystal, gem-encrusted statue. A stone to flesh spell cannot undo this
      effect, but a wish or miracle can. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Immunity to Earth (Ex)
    description: >-
      Crystallis' are immune to all attacks from earth creatures (creatures with
      the earth subtype). They cannot be affected by an earth creature's melee
      or ranged attacks or any special attack or effect that relies on touch or
      contact. Spell-like abilities and spells that do not require a touch
      attack cast by an earth creature affect a crystallis normally (but see its
      immunity to earth magic below).
  - name: Immunity to Earth Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      Crystallis' are immune to all spells and effects with the earth descriptor
      and all spells of the Earth domain. Additionally, crystallises are immune
      to disintegration magic (a disintegrate spell for example).
Description:
  - Crystallis are massive elementals from the Plane of Elemental Earth.
  - >-
    On their home plane they spend time hunting and feeding on quartz and other
    precious stones. Crystallis are solitary creatures and do not normally
    associate with others of their kind or with other earth creatures. No one
    recalls ever seeing more than one of these creatures at the same time so how
    these creatures mate and reproduce is open for much speculation.
  - >-
    Sometimes a powerful spellcaster binds or summons a crystallis to its plane
    to do its bidding. The crystallis doesn't normally mind such a calling as it
    gives it a chance to hunt, collect, and devour precious stones on other
    worlds.
  - >-
    A crystallis stands 13 feet tall and weighs around 3,000 pounds. Its body is
    thickly built and formed of tightly packed earth mixed with quartz and other
    precious stones and gems.
  - >-
    A crystallis attacks by raking and slashing its opponents with its
    razorsharp claws, while at the same time attempting to position itself near
    as many of its foes as possible so it can use its petrification special
    attack. It readily uses its Power Attack feat to deal as much as damage as
    possible to its strongest enemies.
