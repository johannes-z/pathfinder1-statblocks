SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fast Healing (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hydra's fast healing ability is equal to its current number of heads
      (minimum fast healing 5). This fast healing applies only to damage
      inflicted on the hydra's body.
  - name: Hydra Traits (Ex)
    description: >-
      A hydra can be killed by severing all of its heads or slaying its body.
      Any attack that is not an attempt to sever a head affects the body,
      including area attacks or attacks that cause piercing or bludgeoning
      damage. To sever a head, an opponent must make a sunder attempt with a
      slashing weapon targeting a head. A head is considered a separate weapon
      with hardness 0 and hit points equal to the hydra's HD. To sever a head,
      an opponent must inflict enough damage to reduce the head's hit points to
      0 or less. Severing a head deals damage to the hydra's body equal to the
      hydra's current HD. A hydra can't attack with a severed head, but takes no
      other penalties.
  - name: Regenerate Head (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a hydra's head is destroyed, two heads regrow in 1d4 rounds. A hydra
      cannot have more than twice its original number of heads at any one time.
      To prevent new heads from growing, at least 5 points of acid or fire
      damage must be dealt to the stump (a touch attack to hit) before they
      appear. Acid or fire damage from area attacks can affect stumps and the
      body simultaneously. A hydra doesn't die from losing its heads until all
      are cut off and the stumps seared by acid or fire.
Description:
  - >-
    You can make more powerful hydras by increasing their Hit Dice-each added HD
    increases the hydra's statistics as appropriate, but also gives it one
    additional head and a +1 increase to its natural armor. A hydra's CR
    increases by +1 for each Hit Die it gains. Cryohydra/Pyrohydra (+2 CR):
    Variants of the standard hydra, the cryohydra lives in cold marshes or on
    glaciers, while the pyrohydra prefers deserts or volcanic mountains. A
    cryohydra gains the Cold subtype, while a pyrohydra gains the Fire subtype.
    Each of its heads has a breath weapon (15- ft. cone, 3d6 cold damage
    [cryohydra] or 3d6 fire damage [pyrohydra], Ref lex half ) useable every 1d4
    rounds. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 the hydra's HD + the hydra's Con modifier.
    Although fire attacks cannot prevent a pyrohydra's neck stump from growing
    new heads (since it is immune to fire), 5 points of cold damage does. Acid
    works normally on both hydra variants.
