SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Capsize (Ex)
    description: >-
      A whale can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge
      attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result
      of the captain's Profession (sail0r) check, whichever is higher. For each
      size category the ship is larger than the whale's size, the whale takes a
      cumulative -10 penalty on this CMB check.
Description:
  - >-
    Whales are frequently hunted for their meat and the valuable oil in their
    blubber. Baleen whales have no teeth and attack with a tail slap; toothed
    whales like sperm whales instead attack with a bite. Whale companions are
    smaller species- rules for such companions are the same as those for orcas
    (see page 88 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary.)
