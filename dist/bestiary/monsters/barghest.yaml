Description:
  - >-
    Said to be fiendish relations of all goblinoid races, the hateful barghests
    come to the Material Plane to feed. As they consume the bodies of innocents,
    they grow increasingly powerful. A barghest eventually sheds its skin to
    transform into a greater barghest, at which point it often seeks out a tribe
    of goblins or other creatures to rule.
