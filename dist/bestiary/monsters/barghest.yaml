SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Feed (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per month, a barghest can devour a nonevil humanoid's corpse as a
      full-round action to gain a growth point. It gains a bonus equal to its
      growth point total on attack rolls, CMB rolls, saving throws, and skill
      checks. Its maximum hit points increase by 5 for each growth point it
      gains. For every 2 growth points, a barghest's caster level for its
      spell-like abilities and its CR increase by +1. When a barghest reaches 4
      growth points, it sheds its skin and becomes a greater barghest, losing
      all of its growth points (and bonuses) but gaining the stats presented on
      this page for a greater barghest.
Description:
  - >-
    Said to be fiendish relations of all goblinoid races, the hateful barghests
    come to the Material Plane to feed. As they consume the bodies of innocents,
    they grow increasingly powerful. A barghest eventually sheds its skin to
    transform into a greater barghest, at which point it often seeks out a tribe
    of goblins or other creatures to rule.
