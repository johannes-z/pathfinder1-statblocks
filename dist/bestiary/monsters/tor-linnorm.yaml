SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Breath Weapon (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a tor linnorm can expel a 60-
      foot cone of flame and ash, dealing 24d8 points of fire damage to all
      creatures struck (Reflex DC 33 for half damage). One round after this
      breath weapon is used, the area affected by the attack becomes covered in
      a cloud of thick, scorching smoke that burns both the lungs and eyes,
      dealing an additional 8d8 points of fire damage to all creatures in the
      area. Each creature that begins its turn in the smoke-covered area and
      breathes must make a DC 33 (+ 1 per previous check) Fortitude save each
      round or spend that round choking and coughing. Creatures that keep their
      eyes open for more than 1 round while in the area of the smoke must make a
      DC 33 Fortitude save or go blind for 1d3 hours. The smoke dissipates after
      2d4 rounds. This duration is halved in strong winds and quartered in more
      powerful winds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

      vulnerability to fire and is permanently staggered from the pain of its

Description:
  - >-
    Tor linnorms epitomize the raw and untempered power of their kin. They dwell
    in the tallest volcanic mountains, either in naturally formed caverns or in
    the craters themselves, and rain destruction down upon nearby mountain
    villages whenever the urge strikes them. Tor linnorms are brutes, but as far
    as linnorms go are relatively intelligent. With this intelligence comes an
    overwhelming vanity-unlike other linnorms, tor linnorms enjoy being adored
    and worshiped by lesser creatures, and have been known to delay eating
    prisoners who seem to be particularly cowed by their presence, simply
    basking in their victims' fear.
  - A tor linnorm is 50 feet long and weighs 15,000 pounds.
