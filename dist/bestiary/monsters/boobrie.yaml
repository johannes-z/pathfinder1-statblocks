Description_Visual: >-
  This creature stands taller than a normal human and resembles a crane with
  rich, black feathers that fade to dull gray on its undercarriage. Its bill is
  long, slightly curved, and serrated. Its feet are sharp and sport wicked
  talons that resemble twisted, almost humanoid clawed hands.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      A boobrie can assume the form of a Large heavy warhorse as a standard
      action. In this form, it can run on top of water (including deep water
      such as rivers and lakes) and marshy ground as if it were solid, flat
      terrain. The boobrie is still marsh bound in this form and suffers the
      normal penalties if it moves too far from its environment.
  - name: Marsh Bound (Ex)
    description: >-
      A boobrie can survive away from its marshy home for 1 hour per 2 points of
      Constitution. After that, refer to the drowning rules.
  - name: Wail (Su)
    description: >-
      Once every 2d4 rounds as a standard action, a boobrie can emit an eerie
      wail that deals 4d6 points of sonic damage to all creatures within 40 feet
      that hear it. A DC 18 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half. Further,
      a creature failing its save is paralyzed for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic
      mind-affecting attack. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the
      wail of that boobrie for one day. The save DC is Constitution-based and
      includes a +2 bonus from the boobrie's Ability Focus feat.
Description:
  - >-
    The boobrie, or marsh terror, is a quick-moving, malign, flightless bird
    found haunting desolate and overgrown swamps, wetlands, and marshes. It is
    carnivorous by nature and feasts on a diet of crocodile meat, fish, and
    humans (the last of which is one of its favorite meals). When food is
    scarce, boobrie flocks often war with each other, eating the fallen and the
    slain.
  - >-
    A boobrie flock dwells in thick, overgrown (and usually well-hidden) marsh
    groves. A typical flock consists of more males than females and a number of
    young equal to the combined total of adult boobries. A single dominate male
    acts as the leader of the flock and commands the others of the flock in
    carrying out particular tasks. Boobrie flocks sometimes settle near (but not
    too near) human settlements and conduct raids into the settlements, stealing
    livestock, children, and even lone adults.
  - >-
    Boobries speak broken Common and their own language of hoots, croaks, and
    clicks.
  - >-
    Boobries are vicious creatures with voracious appetites. They are almost
    always hungry and usually attack prey on sight. A boobrie attacks with two
    sharpened talons and a nasty bite from its serrated bill. Slain prey is
    dragged to the lair and given to the young who promptly tear it to shreds,
    devouring as much of the kill as they can. Leftovers are simply discarded
    and left to rot or discarded for other scavengers to claim.
