SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Container (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shipmind dwells within an immobile container of partially organic
      material grown by its Dominion masters. This container functions somewhat
      like a suit of armor for the shipmind. A shipmind container has hardness
      10 and 240 hit points, and can be damaged by sunder attempts. A shipmind
      container that gains the broken quality grants only a +5 armor bonus to
      the shipmind within, and does not allow the shipmind to heal negative
      levels gained during a prolonged period outside of the container (see
      Limited Mobility). The partially crystalline nature of a shipmind
      container makes it vulnerable to shatter spells, and sonic damage bypasses
      the container's hardness and inflicts full damage.
  - name: Immerse (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a shipmind in its container successfully grabs a Large or smaller
      target with one of its slam attacks, it can attempt to drag that target
      into its body as a swift action. To immerse a creature, the shipmind must
      attempt a combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the
      opponent). If it succeeds, the prey is pulled into the container with the
      shipmind and immediately takes 6d6 points of plasma damage (half of which
      is electricity and half of which is fire) and 1d4 points of Intelligence
      damage-a successful DC 24 Fortitude save halves the plasma damage and
      negates the Intelligence damage. A creature that remains immersed takes
      this damage again every following round at the start of the shipmind's
      turn. In addition, an immersed creature is in danger of suffocating. A
      creature can attempt to escape immersion by making a successful combat
      maneuver check or Escape Artist check, as if it were attempting to escape
      a pin. If the shipmind's container has the broken condition, attempts to
      escape in this manner gain a +8 bonus.
  - name: Limited Mobility (Ex)
    description: >-
      Unlike most oozes, a shipmind cannot exist outside of the partially
      organic container it was originally created in-this container serves the
      shipmind as its "skin." While inside its container, a shipmind has a speed
      of 0 feet. When it leaves its container, it gains a speed of 10 feet, but
      loses its armor bonus to AC. A shipmind can exist outside of its container
      for 1 hour without consequences, but at the start of each subsequent hour
      it gains 1 negative level as its body starts to dissolve. These negative
      levels cannot be restored by any means save by returning to an appropriate
      shipmind container, at which point they are removed at a rate of 1 level
      per hour.
  - name: Plasma Bolt (Su)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a shipmind can fire a bolt of plasma at a target
      within 300 feet (no range increment). On a hit, a blast of plasma deals
      10d6 damage, half of which is electricity damage and half of which is fire
      damage.
  - name: Ship Interface (Ex)
    description: >-
      As long as a shipmind is interfaced with a Dominion vessel, it can observe
      events within the ship or within 90 feet of its exterior hull as if via
      clairaudience/ clairvoyance for as long as the shipmind concentrates.
      While concentrating on an area, the shipmind can activate traps or other
      ship systems in the area as a swift action; it can even converse with
      creatures in the area by vibrating the metal and strange membranes in the
      walls.
  - name: Thought Disruption (Su)
    description: >-
      The substance that makes up a shipmind ooze is charged with alien psychic
      energy that is toxic to the minds of most life forms. A creature who
      willfully touches an ooze (via a touch attack, natural weapon attack, or
      unarmed strike) or is struck by its slam attack must make a DC 22 Will
      save or take 1d4 points of Intelligence damage. This is a mind-affecting
      confusion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The enigmatic shipminds are painstakingly engineered creations of Dominion
    fleshfarms, molded and formed over the course of years to pilot the massive
    organic spacecraft the aliens use to navigate the Dark Tapestry.
  - >-
    Intimately bound to their vessels, shipminds oversee the health and function
    of the ships they control. They maintain this single-minded task for as long
    as a thousand years before they must be recycled and rebuilt.
  - >-
    A shipmind resides within a specially designed containers on a craft,
    connected to the ship's greater workings via varying forms of physical
    interface. These oozes generally follow orders from superiors stationed on
    their spacecraft, though coaxing is sometimes necessary in order to get
    these strange creatures to follow direct orders. This is due in part to the
    fact that these engineered creatures are fanatically devoted to the
    Dominion's inscrutable faith, with rigid beliefs regarding orthodoxy. Rumors
    persist of especially radical shipmind oozes going beyond defiance and
    actually slaying their passengers, a task made frightfully easy due to the
    mastery each ooze has over every aspect of its spacecraft's function (such
    as life support and internal security appendages and creatures). Some have
    been known to plunge their vessel into a star or black hole in moments of
    defiance or religious ecstasy, leaving the rest of the ship's crew helpless
    and unable to convince the shipmind to abandon its actions.
  - >-
    As a shipmind reaches more advanced age, it becomes increasingly pedantic
    and difficult to control. Such oozes often demand small offerings,
    sacrifices of lesser creatures, or the powering down of ship's systems they
    deem superf luous or "unpure." At a certain point, the shipmind is recycled,
    poured from its container into vats to serve as nutrients for the
    cultivation of a replacement. Fragments of the previous shipmind's intellect
    and skills carry over into the newly created ooze, ensuring that a sort of
    entrenched memory and institutional knowledge persist through the
    generations.
  - Deteriorating Shipmind(CR-1)
  - >-
    In cases where a shipmind isn't recycled in time, as often happens in
    abandoned ships or in cases where a Dominion crew neglects the shipmind for
    too long,
  - >-
    a shipmind can begin to deteriorate while still within its container.
    Deteriorated shipminds are sometimes encountered on Dominion drop ships
    after the vessel has landed on a planet and been left to rot. In such cases,
    the shipmind slowly goes insane, serving almost as a sort of living haunt
    within the decaying ship and bringing madness and pain to any creatures
    exploring its decks. Most deteriorating shipminds survive for only a few
    years, or a decade at most-in the majority of cases, the Dominion drop ship
    decays into filth and sludge long before then.
  - >-
    A shipmind that is deteriorating has slightly different statistics than the
    typical shipmind. You can create stats for one of these shipminds by
    applying the deteriorating shipmind simple template to the statistics above.
    The quick rules and rebuild rules for a deteriorating shipmind are the same.
  - >-
    Quick/Rebuild Rules: -2 on all rolls (including damage rolls) and to special
    ability DCs. The shipmind's container is broken and has only 120 hit points.
    A deteriorating shipmind can only use its plasma bolt once every other
    round, and gains negative levels at a rate of 1 per round immediately after
    it leaves its container.
