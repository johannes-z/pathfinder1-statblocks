Description_Visual: >-
  Skin pale as a slug's belly, eyes huge and bulging, this thing crawls down the
  wall like a spider, but its shape is hideously humanoid.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Expert Climber (Ex)
    description: >-
      A morlock can cling to cave walls and even ceilings as long as the surface
      has hand- and footholds. In effect, a morlock is treated as constantly
      being under a nonmagical version of the spell spider climb, save that it
      cannot cling to smooth surfaces. This ability doubles the normal +8 racial
      bonus to Climb checks normally afforded creatures with a climb speed to a
      +16 racial bonus.
  - name: Leap Attack (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a standard action, a morlock may make a single attack during a jump. It
      can make this attack at any point along the course of the leap-the start,
      the end, or while in mid-air. While jumping, a morlock does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity for leaving a threatened square.
  - name: Swarming (Ex)
    description: >-
      Morlocks dwell and fight in cramped quarters every day of their lives, and
      as such are quite adept at swarming foes. Up to two morlocks can share the
      same square at the same time. If two morlocks in the same square attack
      the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that foe as if they were
      in two opposite squares.
Description:
  - >-
    Degenerate humans long lost from the world of light, morlocks have regressed
    through years of subterranean dwelling into ravenous, barely thinking beasts
    of the endless night. They no longer remember the civilized lives their
    ancestors led, although many morlock tribes still dwell in the shattered
    ruins of their ancient homes.
  - >-
    Ironically, in many cases morlocks worship the statues left behind by these
    ancestors as their gods. Morlock priests of such ancestor worship have
    access to the domains of Darkness, Earth, Madness, and Strength. A typical
    morlock stands just over 5 feet tall and weighs roughly 150 pounds.
  - >-
    Morlocks move about on two legs at times, but often drop down to a creepy
    four-limbed shuff le when speed or stealth is necessary. Their wiry, often
    emaciated frames mask the strength of their limbs and their swift reactions.
  - >-
    Morlocks typically give birth to broods of three to four babies at a time,
    ravenous creatures born with a full set of teeth and a cannibalistic
    predisposition. The first few weeks of a brood's life must be carefully
    mothered to prevent attrition-it usually takes that long for the morlock
    young to overcome their natural inclination to feed on whatever is closest.
    Morlocks mature quickly, achieving adulthood after only 5 years of life. A
    typical morlock can live to a ripe old age of 60-although the majority of
    their kind die far sooner than that due to violence.
