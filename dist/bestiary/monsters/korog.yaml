Description:
  - >-
    The Korog resemble tall men, but with a head somewhat like that of a
    hairless horse with long teeth, and smoldering, malevolent eyes. Standing
    between 6 and 7 feet tall, The korog are typically quite thin, weighing
    around 150 to 180 pounds. They possess horse-hooves, and natural coloration
    is dull grays and light browns.
  - >-
    Various Korog "castes" exist, with differing abilities, but adventurers most
    frequently encounter the technician and warrior castes.
  - >-
    All Korog technicians carry a silver wand with them at all times for
    self-defense. These wands can be used by non-Korogs, but they carry only
    five charges and can only be recharged in the Korog laboratories beneath the
    earth. Korog warriors may use any weapon or armor, butprefer exotic weapons
    and light armor.
  - >-
    The Korog are the ancient race of beings from which the wizard Iomnogoron
    evolved (see The Spire of Iron and Crystal from Frog God Games for more
    information). Few yet live, but some of these still continue very limited
    operations in the deep, dark places beneath the earth, collecting surface
    essences for their machinations in deep underground strongholds.
Gear: >-
  wand of hold person (CL7th; 5 charges; DC 15); Other Gear masterwork tools,
