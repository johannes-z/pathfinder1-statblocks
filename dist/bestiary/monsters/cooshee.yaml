Description:
  - >-
    Cooshees are large, 200-pound, 4-foot tall hounds. They are known throughout
    the world as elven dogs, for their features resemble those of elves and they
    are often found in the employ of elves (who use them as guards). Though they
    only bark to warn their masters or other cooshees, the bark can be heard
    clearly up to one mile away.
  - >-
    Cooshees attack by biting and tripping their foes. Once down, an opponent is
    grappled and bitten.
