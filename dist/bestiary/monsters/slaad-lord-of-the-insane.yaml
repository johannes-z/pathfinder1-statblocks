      The Slaad Lord of the Insane is not subject to critical hits, and having
      no clear front or back, cannot be flanked.
  - name: Change Shape (Su)
    description: >-
      The Slaad Lord of the Insane can assume the shape of a humanoid as a
      standard action. In humanoid form, the slaad lord cannot use its natural
      weapons and does not deal negative levels. He usually assumes as a human
      male fighter cloaked in black plate armor wielding an iron black longsword
      (purportedly the legendary Black Sword: a +3 cold iron longsword that
      stuns any creature struck, as if by a power word stun spell, for 1d10
      minutes if the victim fails a DC 24 Fortitude save).
Description:
  - >-
    The Slaad Lord of the Insane is one of the most powerful slaad lords in
    existence, and no slaadi questions his authority or rulership, even the
    other slaad lords. The Slaad Lord of the Insane is one of the few slaad
    lords that enjoys traveling the planes and often enters the Material Plane
    disguised as a tall, mystical warrior adorned in black plate armor. In the
    outer planes, he is often encountered in his amoeba form or that of a great
    golden slaad. The Slaad Lord of the Insane generally covers an area about 5
    feet wide and feet tall, but being similar in makeup to an ooze, can flatten
    his form and cover a greater area or squeeze through openings much smaller
    than would normally be allowed. His tentacles are 10 feet long. The Slaad
    Lord of the Insane attacks using his spell-like abilities and slam attacks.
    His natural weapons, as well as any weapon he wields, are considered
    chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. His natural
    weapons are considered epic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage
    reduction. Credit Ssendam, the Slaad Lord of the Insane originally appeared
