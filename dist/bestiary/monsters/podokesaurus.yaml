Description:
  - >-
    Podokesaurus are small, swift-footed pack hunters that feast on a diet of
    meat, often attacking prey much larger than themselves. In such instances,
    they use their overwhelming numbers to bring their quarry down.
  - >-
    An adult podokesaurus stands about 1 foot tall and is around 3 feet long.
    Its long tail acts as a counterweight to keep it upright when it is running
    at a high rate of speed. Skin color varies slightly, but is usually varying
    shades of browns and grays. Its teeth are curved and serrated to aid in
    tearing meat for consumption.
  - >-
    A lone podokesaurus isn't much of a threat, especially to larger opponents.
    In large numbers however, these creatures become extremely dangerous, using
    pack and swarming tactics to attack. Prey that attempts to escape is easily
    run down by the swarming podokesaurus.
