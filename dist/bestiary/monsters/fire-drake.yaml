  - name: Pyrophoric Blood (Ex)
    description: >-
      A fire drake's blood is highly flammable and ignites in a burst of flame
      upon contact with the air. A creature that makes a successful attack with
      a slashing or piercing weapon (including natural weapons) against a fire
      drake must succeed on a Reflex save or take 1d3 points of fire damage from
      the splashing blood.
Description:
  - >-
    Fire Drake Blood The blood of a fire drake can be sealed in an airtight
    container and used as a firebomb, equivalent to a flask of alchemist's fire.
    It can also be used to create temporary flaming weapons.
  - >-
    A weapon coated with fire drake's blood acts as a flaming weapon for 1d4
    rounds (see "Magic Items" in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook)
    or until the first successful hit, whichever comes first.
  - Fire drakes lair in caves and caverns deep within the hills and mountains.
  - >-
    Fire drakes are carnivorous creatures and very territorial, fighting other
    drakes that move into their area. They are tolerant of other fire drakes,
    but view them with suspicion. On occasion, a mated pair is encountered, but
    only in the late summer months or early autumn.
  - >-
    Fire drakes are often mistaken for young or miniature red dragons. A typical
    fire drake is 4 feet long, though it can grow to a length of 6 feet.
  - >-
    Fire drakes prefer to open combat with their breath weapon. Once expended,
    they rely on their bite. Their claws are too small to be effective in
    combat.
