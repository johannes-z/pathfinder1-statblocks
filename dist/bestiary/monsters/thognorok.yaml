Description_Visual: >-

  lashing out with its hairy, wriggling legs.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Acid Web (Su)
    description: >-
      This ability functions like the web universal monster ability, except a
      creature entangled by a thognorok's web also takes 1 point of acid damage
      each round.
  - name: Horrific Appearance (Su)
    description: >-
      Any creature that witnesses a thognorok's horrific appearance could find
      itself overwhelmed with revulsion at the qlippoth's constantly sprouting
      and waving insectile legs, becoming sickened for 1d6 rounds (Will DC 13
      negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2
      Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Description:
  - >-
    Although thognoroks are considered servitor qlippoth of Rovagug, they are
    actually sentient symbiotes that once had the misfortune of dining on the
    Rough Beast's skin, blood, and other fluids. Equally at home on solid ground
    or swimming through toxic liquids, a thognorok hunts and consumes foreign
    materials and creatures that would impede its endless hunger to feed on more
    divine flesh-whether Rovagug's or another deity's.
  - >-
    Because of its tainted connection with the god of destruction, a thognorok
    obeys any telepathic or chemical command transmitted to it by the
    god-whether it be a direct command, or even the orders of a powerful priest
    of the foul god. Thognoroks are rarely directly controlled by Rovagug;
    instead, they're left to their own destructive rampages. The exception to
    this is when they accumulate in vast numbers near planar scars and rifts on
    the Material Plane where the god left some fleck of his terrible carapace or
    dripped vile and blasphemous liquid from his wounds.
  - >-
    In such instances, the thognoroks try to fulfil whatever whim possessed the
    deity at the moment of his ages-old passing, typically the destruction of
    some site of celestial power or other random act of devastation.
  - A common thognorok measures about 5 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds.
