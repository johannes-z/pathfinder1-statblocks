SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mask Symbiosis (Ex)
    description: >-
      A spirit oni can be worn as a mask by a willing Small or Medium creature.
      While worn in this way, the wearer can see through the oni's eyes and
      speak through its mouth, although the wearer retains its own senses and
      voice. The spirit oni remains a separate creature, and must detach from
      its host's face (as a move action) if it wishes to take any action of its
      own (including attacking or using a spell-like ability). While a spirit
      oni is worn as a mask, it grants a +2 insight bonus on its host's
      Perception checks.

Description:
  - >-
    Most oni that emerge on the Material Plane do so into a new body of humanoid
    flesh, yet this is not the case for all oni. Periodically, when an evil
    spellcaster wishes to
  - >-
    engage the servitude of an oni as a familiar, the result is something
    relatively unusual-an oni made flesh directly from its spiritual form rather
    than one who takes the features of a humanoid as its own.
  - >-
    Any lawful evil 7th-level spellcaster who takes the Improved Familiar feat
    can gain a spirit oni as a familiar. The ritual to gain such a familiar
    requires the spellcaster to craft a particularly fiendish and fierce-looking
    oni mask-this does not require a Craft check or any additional expenditure
    of gold, and is assumed to be part of the overall ritual for securing the
    familiar. When the ritual is complete a raw oni spirit is lured into the
    mask, which immediately transforms it into the animate, living creature
    presented here.
  - >-
    While the ritual binds the oni to its new master, it also robs the oni of
    its immediate chance to achieve a human form. As a result, spirit oni are
    foul-tempered and cantankerous creatures, even to their masters. They must
    be regularly reprimanded and disciplined, lest their jealousy and bitterness
    get the better of them.
  - >-
    When a spirit oni's master dies, the spirit oni gains free will and the
    ability to make its own choices-but the spirit oni's innate cowardice and
    dishonor usually prevents it from taking its own life in hopes of returning
    to true spirit form and then returning as a proper oni. Rather than
    extinguishing themselves, such masterless spirit oni seek out more powerful
    oni and offer their services to their superiors, in hopes that they might
    someday be granted a promotion from their lowly state to something more bef
    itting their egos and desires.
