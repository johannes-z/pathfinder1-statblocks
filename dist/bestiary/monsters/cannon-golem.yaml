SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Alloyed (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cannon golem's slam and cannon attacks count as adamantine, cold iron,
      and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
  - name: Blasting Critical (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a cannon golem confirms a critical hit with a slam attack, it can
      make one cannon attack against that target as a free action (as long as
      the cannon is loaded).
  - name: Cannon (Ex)
    description: >-
      The golem's cannon has a range increment of 100 feet and deals 6d6 points
      of bludgeoning and piercing damage on a hit with a x4 critical modifier.
      The cannon's magazine can hold up to 20 cannonballs at a time-reloading a
      single cannonball into this magazine is a standard action for the golem,
      while loading a cannonball into the cannon itself to fire it is a swift
      action; this allows the golem to take two shots per round with the cannon.
  - name: Gun Training (Ex)
    description: A cannon golem adds its Dex modifier to the damage dealt by its cannon.
  - name: Immunity to Magic (Ex)
    description: >-
      A cannon golem is immune to spells and spell-like abilities that allow
      spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against
      it, as noted below. • Any spell with the water descriptor that affects a
      cannon golem renders its cannon unusable for 1 round (no save). • A heat
      metal spell causes the golem's cannon to instantly backfire, dealing 6d6
      points of damage to the golem and staggering it for 1 round (no save).
Description:

    A cannon golem's internal workings are a mechanical labyrinth; its
    extradimensional pockets constantly process new black powder. A cannon golem
    stands 12 feet tall.
  - Construction
