Description_Visual: >-
  The creature is a loathsome cross between a human, a stirge, and an abyssal
  fly. It stands on four stirge-like hind legs and grasps with its humanlike
  forelimbs, which end in chitinous claw-like fingers. It has the wings of a
  stirge, though wrinkled and seemingly useless. Its stirge-like head has
  distinctly human features and is topped with a bristled, backswept mane. Its
  mouth is tiny and filled with fangs, though its nose is long and sharp and is
  used to pierce and draw blood.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Drone (Su)
    description: >-
      At all times, save when using any spell-like abilities, the stirge demon
      drones and buzzes like a fly. All creatures within a 60-foot spread that
      hear it must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or fall into a comatose sleep
      for 1d4 hours. There is no HD limit for this effect and it otherwise
      functions as the sleep spell (CL 10th). Note, the stirge demon can drain
      blood from a sleeping creature without automatically waking it up. In such
      an event, the sleeping creature receives a new Will save (same DC) each
      round the stirge demon drains blood. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    One of the most foul and despicable of all demonkind, the stirge demon hates
    all other demonic races and usually attacks them on sight. It savors the
    blood of vrocks and hezrous, but generally avoids any more powerful demonic
    races. Stirge demons play no role in the Abyssal armies as most demon lords
    and princes find them hard to control and consider them pests to be
    exterminated. Other demons loathe them as well, and usually attack them when
    they are encountered.
  - A stirge demon is about 10 feet long and weighs 800 pounds.
  - >-
    Stirge demons enter combat and attempt to drone as many of their opponents
    to sleep as they can. Creatures that resist are attacked with claws and
    bite. Once the stirge demon has droned all its opponents to sleep, or they
    have fled, it feasts on any sleeping creatures, draining their blood. If
    outnumbered or overmatched, a stirge demon does not engage an enemy. If
    confronted by foes more powerful than it, the stirge demon uses its greater
    teleport to escape.
