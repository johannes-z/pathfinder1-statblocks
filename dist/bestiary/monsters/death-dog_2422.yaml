Description:
  - >-
    Death dogs are two-headed, mastiff-like hounds, nocturnal killing machines
    that hunt their prey without hesitation across the desert sands and
    wastelands. Death dog packs have been known to share territory with little
    friction, although they do engage in dominance battles in leaner times when
    hunting is difficult. Death dogs are strictly carnivores and often attack
    creatures much larger than themselves relying on their sheer numbers to
    bring down larger opponents. Credit The Death Dog originally appeared in the
    First Edition Fiend Folio (Â© TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by
