    description: >-
      For all special abilities and effects, an orog is considered an orc or
      ogre. For example, orogs can use special ogre or orc weapons or magic
      items with racially specific ogre or orc powers as if they were ogres or
      orcs.
Description:
  - >-
    Orogs, also called elite orcs or greater orcs, are the much larger kin of
    normal orcs. They usually reach well over 6 feet tall but closely resemble
    normal orcs in all ways except build: orogs are much stronger and stockier.
    It is believed that orogs are the result of the union of a male orc and
    female ogre. In contrast to lesser orcs, orogs are highly disciplined and
    straightforward. Orogs within an orc community quickly rise to leadership
    positions within their clan, although in orc armies the orogs will segregate
    themselves into all-orog military units. Orog military units are highly
    organized, tactically superior, and far more dangerous than those of normal
    orcs. Such orog units form the vanguard of the army to which they belong.
    Orogs do not separate themselves into their own clans, despite their
    tendency to self-segregate while in an orc army. Orogs speak Orc, and those
    specimens that boast Intelligence scores of at least 10 also speak Common.
    Orogs prefer weapons that deal massive amounts of damage. They try to avoid
    subterfuge, favoring direct combat to any other tactics. Orog as Characters
    Orogs possess racial Hit Dice and may have class levels. Orogs have the
    following racial traits. +6 Strength, +4 Constitution, -2 Wisdom, -2
    Charisma. Orogs are powerful warriors. Darkvision: Orogs can see in the dark
    up to 60 feet. Racial Hit Dice: An orog begins with three levels of
    humanoid, which provide 3d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +2, and base
    saving throw bonuses of Fort +3, Ref +1, and Will +1. Racial Skills: An
    orog's humanoid levels give it skill points equal to 3 x (2 + Int modifier).
    Racial Feats: An orog's humanoid levels give it two feats. Special
    Qualities: Orc/Ogre blood (see above). Languages: Orogs begin play speaking
    Common and orc. Orogs with high Intelligence scores can choose from the
    following languages: Dwarf, Gnoll, Goblin, Terran. Credit The Orog
