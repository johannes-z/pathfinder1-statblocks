SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Absorb Force (Su)
    description: >-
      Once per round, a witchwyrd can use a free hand to "catch" a magic missile
      fired at it. This absorbs the missile and manifests as a glowing nimbus
      around that hand (which is no longer considered free). The energy lasts 6
      rounds or until it is used to create a force bolt. To use this ability,
      the witchwyrd must be aware of the incoming magic missile and cannot be
      flat-footed.
  - name: Force Bolt (Su)
    description: >-
      A witchwyrd can "throw" a magic missile (1d4+1 damage) from each free hand
      as a free action (maximum of two per round). If it has absorbed a magic
      missile, it can throw an additional force bolt that round, expending the
      absorbed energy (maximum of two additional bolts per round).
Description:
  - >-
    Alien merchants that travel between planets and planes, witchwyrds stand 7
    feet tall, weigh 300 pounds, and are covered in hairless blue-gray skin.
    Witchwyrds new to a market or eager to avoid identification during an
    important business deal fold their second sets of flexible arms behind their
    backs and dress in robes, the better to pass as a lessinfamous humanoid
    race. Witchwyrds tend to prefer the driest, warmest regions of the areas
    they visit-perhaps an indicator of their mysterious home world.
