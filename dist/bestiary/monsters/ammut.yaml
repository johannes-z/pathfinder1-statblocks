SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Devour Soul (Su)
    description: >-
      If a creature dies while swallowed whole by an ammut, its soul is consumed
      along with its body. A creature killed in this way cannot be brought back
      to life via any effect short of true resurrection, miracle, or wish, but
      even these spells require the caster to succeed at a caster level check
      equal to 10 + the targeted creature's Hit Dice. If this check fails, the
      caster can't attempt to return the targeted creature to life for the next
      24 hours (though the caster can try again after this period).
  - name: Powerful Jaw (Ex)
    description: >-
      An ammut's bite attack deals 4d6 points of damage plus one and a half
      times its Strength bonus. In addition, its reach with this attack is 5
      feet further than normal and it gains the grab ability when attacking with
      its bite.
  - name: Swallow Whole (Ex)
    description: >-
      An ammut can swallow creatures size Large or smaller with this special
      ability, and can only swallow one creature at a time regardless of the
      creature's size. In addition, creatures swallowed by an ammut are subject
      to its wasting curse.
  - name: Wasting Curse (Su)
    description: >-
      Swallow whole-contact; save Will DC 29; frequency 1 hour; effect 1d4 Cha
      drain. A creature whose Charisma score is reduced to 0 by this wasting
      curse dies; its body is destroyed and it is subject to the ammut's devour
      soul ability as if it had died while within the ammut's gut. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Ammuts are beastly but cunning creatures that consume souls in an attempt to
    satisfy their insatiable hungers. Few ammuts exist, and those that do wander
    the vast deserts of Osirion preying on the souls of any creature they can
    catch. These creatures prefer the taste of thoroughly evil souls or those
    who have experienced full and complex lives. Ammuts show disdain for
    creatures of inferior intelligence, but also tend to leave them alone, as
    they claim their souls are shallow and flavorless. The rarity of ammuts and
    their nomadic nature makes it difficult to determine how long they live, or
    even if they age at all. Ammuts are approximately 20 feet long and 9 feet
    tall at the shoulder. Their rounded and muscular hindquarters makes them
    denser than would be expected for their size, and ammuts can weigh up to 10
    tons.
  - Ecology
  - >-
    Ammuts live among the ruins scattered throughout the Osirian deserts, often
    lairing in abandoned and lost temples of the gods of Ancient Osirion. When
    outside their lairs, ammuts bury themselves in sand to await the arrival of
    a suitable meal.
  - >-
    An ammut is covered in fur ranging from sandy-colored to dark brown, with
    shorter fur on its back and legs, and a long mane behind its head that
    covers its shoulders. Its snout and face are layered in reptilian scales
    that are usually crusted with sand that has partially fused into glass from
    the heat of its breath.
  - >-
    Ammuts never tire, and once an ammut notices a creature that it considers
    suitable prey, it's unrelenting- stalking its prey for hundreds of miles if
    need be before running it down. These terrifying chases generally don't
  - >-
    last long, as the ammut makes use of a high-pitched scream that dazes prey
    long enough to allow the beast to catch and devour them. If that tactic
    fails to net the ammut its meal, it can also use its powerful force of will
    to dominate its prey, using telepathy to convince the victim to approach.
    Creatures that try to hide from an ammut using illusions soon find those
    plans foiled, as ammuts can see through illusions cast by even the most
    powerful mages. The only way to truly escape an ammut once it selects you as
    its quarry is to confront and defeat the beast.
  - >-
    Fire burns within the core of an ammut, and the heat generated by an ammut's
    inner fires can sometimes fuse the sand it passes through into glassy
    depressions in the desert floor. The best desert guides can recognize these
    signs (called "blaze bowls") and avoid areas in which an ammut might be
    lurking.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Ammuts are lone predators, and are so rare their social structures (if any)
    and method of reproduction are unknown. No live specimen has ever been
    caught for observation, because the inner fires of the ammut consume the
    creature's body quickly upon its death, leaving little to be studied besides
    ash and brittle glass formed from fused sand. Every so often, a peddler in
    the markets of Eto or Shiman-Sekh will claim to possess a rare piece of an
    ammut's body (such as one of its teeth or an eye) that they try to sell to
    foreigners and treasure hunters. Most native Osirians know to ignore such
    claims, but outsiders may be gullible enough to buy the extremely expensive
    fakes as souvenirs. One of the few things peddled in these markets that
    actually has a connection to ammuts are pieces of their blaze bowls.
    Sometimes brave explorers come across one of these glassy depressions, and
    remain in the area long enough to try to carefully remove the fused sand in
    one whole piece. More often than not these efforts are fruitless, as the
    brittle glass often crumbles if mishandled.
  - >-
    Because ammuts are so rare, the libraries of Osirion contain records of only
    two-dozen confirmed sightings, though it's likely that many more encounters
    ended with no one left to report the event. Osirian scholars have estimated,
    based more on reports of the telltale blaze bowls than of actual ammuts,
    that there are perhaps twenty to thirty
  - >-
    of the creatures roaming the vast wasteland between the Junira River and the
    River Sphinx, though a single sighting near the Ruins of Tumen suggests the
    ammuts are not confined between those waterways. No record of a peaceful
    encounter with an ammut exists, suggesting that they have no interest in
    anything other than feeding on the souls of those who cross their paths.
  - >-
    The origin of the ammuts is shrouded in mystery, though it's thought that
    they descended from a single creature of their kind that was more powerful
    than all existing ammuts combined. This mythical ammut is sometimes referred
    to in Ancient Osiriani scrolls where it has the position of judging the
    souls of the dead-a role already assumed by Pharasma. Because of this conf
    lict, scholars argue about the creatures' true origin.
  - >-
    Though it is generally agreed that ammuts migrated to Golarion from another
    plane long ago, many scholars disagree on the exact planar origin. Some
    scholars claim that ammuts are perhaps descended from a race of devils,
    while others claim the lineage stems from the divs. The most logical
    association of a fiendish origin is rooted in daemonkind. That ammuts are
    connected with souls and have the ability to utterly consume them certainly
    lends to this hypothesis.
