Description:
  - >-
    Known to many scholars as the gigantopithecus, the dire ape is a much more
    dangerous and bestial creature than the relatively peaceful gorilla. An
    adult male dire ape stands 9 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds.
  - >-
    The dire ape attacks anything that intrudes on its territory, including
    other dire apes not of its troop, and does not break off the attack until
    the trespasser is dead or runs off.
  - >-
    A dire ape makes no displays of toughness or warnings before it attacks- it
    simply leaps into action with little or no provocation, tearing at its
    opponents with claws and teeth. If a dire ape is stymied by a heavily
    armored foe, it attempts to grapple its foe, pin it to the ground, and rend
    it.
