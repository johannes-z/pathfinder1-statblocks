Description:
  - >-
    A narwhal (sometimes called a ghost whale or sea unicorn) is a good-aligned
    creature found swimming throughout the world's oceans. Most narwhals prefer
    colder waters and as such will be more commonly encountered in arctic
    environments. These creatures do not like warm waters and are never
    encountered in such places.
  - >-
    Mistakenly, many who encounter a narwhal believe it to have a horn growing
    from its head. Closer inspection reveals this to be false however. The horn
    is actually a single tooth that grows straight from the creature's mouth and
    can reach lengths of 10 feet or more. Narwhals use this horn to defend
    themselves and their young.
  - >-
    Narwhals spend the majority of their time swimming through the oceans
    feasting upon smaller sea life and plants (including coral, one of their
    favorite meals). A typical narwhal school consists of 2-6 adults and twice
    as many (noncombatant) young. Young narwhals lack the horn that adults have
    (though by age 2 it has grown in).
  - >-
    Narwhals typically average 10 to 12 feet in length, though they can grow to
    a length of 15 feet. A typical narwhal weighs up to 1-1/2 tons. Narwhals
    understand Celestial and Common but cannot speak.
  - >-
    Narwhals are generally non-aggressive creatures only entering battle when
    threatened, when their pod is threatened, or when it sees a good-aligned
    creature in trouble. Upon entering battle, a narwhal uses its horn to spear
    and impale its enemies. When aiding good-aligned creatures (or facing
    evil-aligned creatures on its own), a narwhal uses its bless and magic
    circle spell-like abilities to aid itself and its allies.
