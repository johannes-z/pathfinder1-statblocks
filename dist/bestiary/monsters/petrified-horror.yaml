Description_Visual: >-
  A revolting stack of carnage stands before you. Its delicate silhouette belies
  the true horror that it is. It is as if someone carved a human-sized sculpture
  from the still-living flesh, bone and muscle of a much-larger creature, and
  then somehow gave that figure life.

  - name: Bloodstorm (Su)
    description: >-
      A petrified horror can create a bloodstorm effect (as the spell) centered
      upon itself as a free action once every 2 minutes. The bloodstorm forms a
      whirlwind of blood in a column 25 feet in diameter and 40 feet high. The
      effect has a duration of 12 rounds, requiring those within to make a DC 20
      Reflex save to avoid being blinded while they remain within the whirlwind
      and for 2d6 rounds after leaving it and a DC 20 Will save to avoid
      becoming panicked if less than 8 HD or frightened if 8 HD or above for the
      duration of the effect. Furthermore, creatures fighting within the
      bloodstorm or ranged attacks passing through it take -4 penalty on attack
      rolls Finally, the blood is slightly acidic and deals 1d4 points of acid
      damage per round. The petrified horror is immune to the effects of the
      bloodstorm, including the attack penalties, and the whirlwind remains
      centered on the petrified horror even if it moves. The save DCs are
      Constitution-based. Full details of the bloodstorm spell can be found in
      Relics & Rituals by Sword & Sorcery Studios.
Description:
  - >-
    The name of the petrified horror belies the true nature of this hideous
    construct. For while it is true that the construct is crafted from the
    petrified remains of a Large creature, it is not until the new Medium statue
    is returned to flesh from its prison of stone that the horror is unleashed.
    Until then it just resembles an ordinary statue in whatever shape it was
    sculpted to be and is incapable of action.
  - >-
    This can be quite disconcerting when a delicate ballerina statue suddenly
    becomes a lumbering pile of bleeding meat and bone. Creators of these
    creatures often use them like time bombs, inert until freed by the spells of
    an inquisitive intruder or as part of a trap activated by the intruders.
    They instinctively recognize and avoid harming their creator but have no
    compunctions about destroying anything and anyone else they see.
  - >-
    In statue form, a typical specimen stands 5 to 8 feet tall and, being
    composed of solid stone, weighs anywhere from 1,000 to 1,800 pounds. Despite
    being a typical statue, it does give off a moderate aura of transmutation.
    When the creator or someone else casts stone to flesh or break enchantment
    the construct transforms to flesh and weighs 300 to 500 pounds depending on
    its height. As a construct it is does not require a Fortitude save to
    survive the transformation. Because the petrified horror is constructed from
    a larger creature, it gains the bonus hit points of a size Large construct
    rather than a Medium. Because it has no actual eyes, it sees through
    blindsight rather than with the traditional darkvision and low-light vision
    of a construct.
  - >-
    Despite its lumbering appearance, a petrified horror's newly crafted form is
    quite quick and agile. It moves with a discernable squishing noise and
    leaves a trail of blood and ichor wherever it goes.
  - >-
    Petrified horrors are incapable of speech and do not understand or heed
    commands.
  - >-
    Petrified horrors are typically left in out-of-the-way places by their
    creators, so when activated the damages they cause can be minimized. Once
    released from its stony imprisonment petrified horrors immediately go into a
    rampage destroying all they see, preferring living creatures over inanimate
    objects but content to demolish even inanimate objects if that is all there
    is. As part of their programming, they rush directly into the center of
    whatever group is nearest to them (bull rushing if necessary) while flailing
    with their fists. Once they are in amongst their foes, they use their
    bloodstorm ability as they continue to fight.

    A petrified horror is carved from the petrified form of a Large creature
    which usually costs 10,000 gp to procure. Special masterwork tools for this
    process worth 500 gp are also required and are ruined in the creation
    process. Sculpting the body from the base material requires a DC 25 Craft
    (sculptures) check. Failure means that the petrified creature's form has
    been cracked and ruined and a new Large petrified creature must be procured.
