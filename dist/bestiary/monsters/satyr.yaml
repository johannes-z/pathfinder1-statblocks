SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Pipes (Su)
    description: >-
      A satyr can focus and empower his magic by playing haunting melodies on
      his panpipes. When he plays, all creatures within a 60-foot radius must
      make a DC 18 Will save or be affected by charm person, fear, sleep, or
      suggestion, depending on what tune the satyr chooses. A creature that
      successfully saves against any of the pipes' effects cannot be affected by
      the same set of pipes for 24 hours, but can still be affected by the
      satyr's other spell-like abilities as normal. The satyr's use of his pipes
      does not count toward his uses per day of his spelllike abilities, and if
      separated from them he may continue to use his standard abilities. The
      pipes themselves are masterwork, and a satyr can craft a replacement with
      1 week of labor. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Satyrs, known in some regions as fauns, are debauched and hedonistic
    creatures of the deepest, most primeval parts of the woods. They adore wine,
    music, and carnal delights, and are renowned as rakes and smooth-talkers,
    wooing unwary maidens and shepherd boys and leaving a trail of awkward
    explanations and unplanned pregnancies in their wakes. Though their bodies
    are almost always those of attractive and well-built men, much of the
    satyrs' talent for seduction lies in their talent for music. With the aid of
    his eponymous pipes, a satyr is capable of weaving a wide variety of melodic
    spells designed to enchant others and bring them in line with his capricious
    desires. In addition to their constant frolicking, satyrs often act as
    guardians of the creatures in their forest homes, and any who manage to turn
    the satyr's lust to wrath are likely to find themselves facing down
    dangerous animals surrounding the faun. Still, while satyrs tend to value
    their own amusement well above the rights of others, they bear no ill will
    toward those they seduce. Children born from such encounters are always
    full-blooded satyrs, and are generally spirited away by their riotous kin
    soon after birth.
