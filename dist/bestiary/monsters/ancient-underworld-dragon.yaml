SpecialAbilities:

      The claws of an underworld dragon are made of adamantine, and have the

  - name: Change Shape (Su)

      A young or older underworld dragon can assume any humanoid form three

  - name: Lava Eruption (Su)
    description: >-
      As a full-round action, a great wyrm underworld dragon can burrow through
      the ground up to twice its burrow speed. At the end of that movement, if
      the underworld dragon has use of its breath weapon, it can emerge from the
      ground spouting lava in a 30-foot-radius burst, dealing damage as the
      breath weapon.
  - name: Smoke Vision (Ex)
    description: >-
      A very young and older underworld dragon can see perfectly in smoky
      conditions (such as those created by pyrotechnics).
  - name: Underworld Burrower (Ex)
    description: >-
      An adult underworld dragon gains a 10-foot bonus to its burrow speed. When
      the underworld dragon becomes old and every two age categories thereafter,
      its burrow speed increases by an additional 10 feet.
Description:
  - >-
    Underworld dragons-also called futsanglungs-are calculating, greedy
    creatures that carve great labyrinthine tunnels beneath the world, defending
    their hidden treasures. Preferring the earth to the heavens, they channel
    the fires of the world's core within their twisting, stonelike bodies and
    through flaming breath hot enough to turn granite into slag.
