Description_Visual: >-
  This creature resembles a manta-ray in general outline. It is a bat-like, with
  a long, powerful tail and membranous "wings" with which it effortlessly darts
  through the water. The mouth of a creature is wide, like a shark's, and
  contains multiple rows of razor-sharp serrated teeth. The tip of each wing
  ends in cruel-looking claws.

  - name: Desalination (Ex)
    description: >-
      The touch of a daochyn's tongue wicks away salt and other vital minerals
      from a living opponent, dealing 1d2 points of Constitution damage. A
      daochyn that is grappling with its tongue automatically deals this damage
      each round to the grappled opponent for as long as it maintains the
      grapple. A daochyn that is grappling an opponent with its tongue cannot
      use its bite attack.
Description:
  - >-
    The daochyns (or sea phantoms), are creatures from the Plane of Water. It is
    uncertain how the daochyns manage to cross from their home plane to the
    Material Plane. Sailors' legends say that in the middle of the deepest ocean
    there is a massive waterspout that is the nexus of a permanent gate between
    this world and the Plane of Water. This waterspout has never been documented
    or proven to exist, however, so that tale remains in doubt. The most
    powerful daochyns are sometimes worshipped as gods by seafaring creatures
    such as sahuagin and some clans of merfolk.
  - >-
    Daochyns are in a constant state of motion and never stop swimming.
    Generally an encounter is with a solitary creature, though some do travel in
    pods or family units of up to twelve creatures. Sages are not sure how
    daochyns procreate but encounters with young have been reported (though
    these encounters could in fact be with smaller adult daochyns rather than
    young).
  - >-
    On the Plane of Water daochyns sustain themselves on a diet of small
    elemental fish and other creatures. On the Material Plane, daochyns eat a
    variety of foods ranging from aquatic plants to fish to those swimmers
    unlucky enough to run across a hungry sea phantom.
  - A typical daochyn is 5 feet long and weighs 150 pounds.
  - >-
    In combat, a daochyn lashes out with its tongue, attempting to weaken
    stronger opponents with its desalination attack, while attacking other
    opponents with its tail and raking claws. An opponent that gets too close is
    subjected to a bite from its massive jaws. A daochyn has the ability to
    alter its coloration to appear almost transparent while in water and does so
    if attacking from ambush or attempting to flee.
