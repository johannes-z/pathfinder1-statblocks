  - name: Sonic Screech (Su)
    description: >-
      A mobat can blast an ear-splitting screech that affects all creatures
      (except other mobats) within a 20-ft. radius. The screech stuns any
      creature in the area for 1d3 rounds if it fails a DC 15 Will save. This is
      a sonic mind-affecting effect. Whether or not the save succeeds an
      affected creature is immune to the same mobat's screech for 24 hours. The
      save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The mobat has a wingspan of approximately 15 feet. It is a nocturnal
    creature, cruising silently through the night sky in its never ending quest
    for food. A mobat, like any species of normal bat, has huge ears and an
    upturned snout. Mobats are omnivores, but they often include warmblooded
    prey in their diet.
  - A mobat attacks by biting its opponent using its razor sharp fangs.
  - Surviving prey is subjected to the mobat's sonic screech attack.
