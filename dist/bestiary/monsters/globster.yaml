SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a globster eats a living creature, it only digests a small portion of
      the remains. As the undigested remains accumulate inside of it, the
      globster grows more and more bloated. As a full-round action that does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity, a globster can regurgitate these foul
      remains along with portions of its own mass. Doing so causes the globster
      1d6 points of damage, but creates a new, fully grown globster that
      immediately attacks the nearest non-globster target. A globster can create
      spawn up to once per day, though only after it has fed upon at least four
      Medium-sized creatures (or the equivalent number of creatures of other
      sizes).
  - name: Decompose (Ex)
    description: >-
      A slain globster decays into a mass of goo in the span of 24 hours.
      However, the corpse retains the creature's stench aura for 1d10 days after
      its death.
  - name: Nausea (Ex)
    description: >-
      Any creature struck by a globster must make a DC 18 Fortitude save to
      avoid being nauseated for 1 round. Once a creature makes this saving
      throw, it is immune to further nausea effects from that particular
      globster for 24 hours. This is a poison effect. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A globster is a living collection of half-digested parts from large sea
    creatures such as whales and squid. Passersby usually discover it by smell
    long before they see it. Many unfortunate folk who happen upon a globster
    mistake it for the carcass of a beached sea animal, getting too close before
    discovering the seemingly dead creature is very much alive. For a time,
    sages believed globsters were undead-that they were simply undulating wads
    of rotting flesh animated with a drive to feed. However, globsters are
    actually living creatures.
  - >-
    Globsters usually wash up on a beach or float to the shore to feed on
    terrestrial stock for a few hours before returning to the safety of water.
    Some say the tides and phases of the moon are to blame for the times
    globsters come to land to feed. Globsters reproduce by mixing parts of their
    own foul bodies with the poorly digested remains of their meals.
