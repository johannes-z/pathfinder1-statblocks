Description:
  - >-
    The stone treant is a variant of the treant native to the Plane of Earth.
    They are very rare even there, located in isolated pockets in the plane
    where they tend groves of crystals and natural gem outcroppings. Knowledge
    of their existence has been all but lost, as has the ritual of summoning and
    binding them into service.
  - >-
    A stone treant stands 20-30 ft. tall, with a trunk about 4 ft. in diameter.
    It weighs close to 10,000 pounds.
  - >-
    Stone treants are intelligent, and speak Terran. They generally do not
    bother to communicate with non-earth elemental beings, however.
