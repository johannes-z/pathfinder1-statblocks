    description: >-
      A trapper can try to wrap a creature up to one size smaller than itself in
      its body as a standard action. The trapper attempts a grapple that does
      not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it
      establishes a hold and deals buffet damage each round the hold is
      maintained. Further, a grappled opponent must hold its breath or
      suffocate. Attacks that hit a smothering trapper deal half their damage to
      the monster and half to the trapped victim.
Description:
  - >-
    Trappers are thought to be distant relatives of the lurker above (see that
    entry). Unlike their relatives, however, trappers mimic the floor of a
    building, dungeon, or other structure. By manipulating their body structure
    while covering the floor, trappers can form a box that resembles a small
    trunk or chest. This is usually enough to lure would-be-adventurers to their
    doom.
  - >-
    A trapper waits until its prey is almost centered on its body near the
    "trunk" or "chest" before it strikes. It then quickly folds and wraps its
    body around its unsuspecting prey attempting to smother and squeeze it until
    it is dead.
