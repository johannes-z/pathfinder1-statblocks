SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Death Roll (Ex)
    description: >-
      When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a crocodile can perform a
      death roll upon making a successful grapple check. As it clings to its
      foe, it tucks in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its
      victim. The crocodile deals its bite damage and knocks the creature prone.
      If successful, the crocodile maintains its grapple.
  - name: Sprint (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per minute a crocodile may sprint, increasing its land speed to 40
      feet for 1 round.
Description:
  - >-
    Crocodiles are depicted in many ways in ancient Osirion, but most often they
    are shown in association with the River Sphinx and, more importantly, with
    the god Sobek. Mummified crocodiles are common in crypts that are no farther
    from the river than a single day's walk. Many mummif ied crocodiles have
    baby crocodiles placed on their backs or in their mouths, representing how
    live crocodiles transport and care for their young.
