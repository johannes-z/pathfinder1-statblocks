SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cold (Su)
    description: >-
      A yeti's body generates intense cold, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage to
      any creature that contacts it with a natural attack or unarmed strike, or
      whenever it hits a foe with its claws or rend attack.
  - name: Frightful Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Creatures within 30 feet that meet a yeti's gaze must succeed on a DC 13
      Will save or stand paralyzed in fear for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting
      fear paralysis effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be
      affected again by the frightful gaze of that yeti for 1 day. The save DC
      is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Mysterious and rarely seen (save by victims), the yeti is a towering denizen
    of the loneliest and tallest mountain peaks. Those who dwell upon the lower
    reaches of such storied slopes whisper tales of "abominable snowmen" who
    come down from the heights to raid, taking livestock or even humans as prey
    and leaving behind only monstrous barefoot tracks in the bloodstained snow.
  - >-
    Although yeti stories are accurate in their portrayals of fierce, stealthy,
    and immensely strong creatures, they are not when it comes to ascribing the
    yeti's temperament and source. They dwell in small tribes atop their distant
    mountains, where they are sheltered from contact with most other races.
    Those with violent or cruel natures are usually forced out of tribes to live
    lonely lives as exiles, and without the support of a tribe such yeti are
    often driven to raiding lowlander settlements, thus perpetuating the myth of
    the yeti as a demon made flesh.
  - >-
    The source of such cruel madness can often be traced to a singular
    source-proximity to strange, eldritch dimensions. The yetis' mountain lairs
    rise high in places where the boundaries between this world and others rasp
    thin. It is unclear if the yeti are invaders from these dimensions or
    Material Plane natives inf luenced by otherworldly realms, but it seems
    certain that whatever their origins, the yeti are no friends to those who
    dwell beyond, and may even act as guardians against intrusions from such
    strange worlds into the Material Plane.
