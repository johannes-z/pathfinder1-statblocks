SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animate Plants (Sp)
    description: >-
      A plant guardian can animate any plants of the same type within 180 feet
      at will, controlling up to two such plants at a time. It takes 1 full
      round for the plant to uproot itself, after which it moves at a speed of
      10 feet and fights as a plant of the same type as the one animating it
      (exceptions are noted in each entry below), gaining the plant guardian's
      vulnerability to fire. If the plant guardian that animated it terminates
      the animation, moves out of range, or is incapacitated, the plant
      immediately takes root wherever it is and returns to its normal state.
  - name: Double Damage against Objects (Ex)
    description: >-
      A plant guardian or animated tree that makes a full attack against an
      object or structure deals double damage.
  - name: Plantspeech (Ex)
    description: >-
      A plant guardian has the ability to converse with plants as if subject to
      a continual speak with plants spell, and most plants greet them with an
      attitude of friendly or helpful.
  - name: Needles (Ex)
    description: >-
      The body and limbs of a cactant are covered in the characteristic needles
      of a cactus, and deal 1d4 bleed damage with a slam attack. Any creature
      grappling a cactant or attacking it with a natural weapon automatically
      takes bleed damage.
  - name: Needle Storm (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per round as a standard action, a cactant can release a hail of
      needles in a 30-foot-radius burst. Creatures caught in the area take 7d6
      points of piercing damage and 2d4 bleed damage. A successful DC 18 Reflex
      save reduces the damage by half and negates the bleed damage. A cactant
      can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds, and no more than five times
      per day. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    The cactants are the plant guardians of hot, dry deserts. A cactant
    resembles a large saguaro cactus with thick arms.
