Description:
  - >-
    Giant horseflies are aggressive relatives of the smaller horsefly and
    generally frequent the same type of habitat. Their lairs are always built
    near a source of water and the lair itself is kept damp by water from the
    surrounding ground. A typical nest contains one female and up to 20 males.
    One male is taken as a mate and during the spring or fall months, the female
    lays a clutch of 5-8 eggs. During warmer months or when the temperature is
    extremely high, a flurry of activity can be noticed around the nest as the
    horseflies prepare for the colder months and the female prepares to lay her
    eggs. Young hatch within a few weeks and resemble giant larvae with
    segmented bodies. Each segment of the larvae's body has small protuberances
    that aid in movement.
  - Giant horseflies sustain themselves on a diet of nectar, pollen, and blood.
  - >-
    Their hunting territory typically covers a range of several square miles
    around their nest. Blooded targets usually involve animals, livestock, and
    the occasional humanoid.

    Giant horseflies look like large, black hairy flies. Their bodies are thick
    and their multifaceted eyes are black and dark gold. Wings are translucent
    and their legs are long, bristly and jet black. Females have a slightly
    longer mouth tube than males.
  - >-
    Giant horseflies attack by delivering a painful bite to their opponent. If
    hunting, a giant horsefly attempts to grapple its foe and drain its blood.
  - >-
    Slain prey is left to rot; the giant horsefly only drinks its blood, it does
    not eat its remains.
