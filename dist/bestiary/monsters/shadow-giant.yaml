SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Militant (Ex)
    description: >-
      A shadow giant is proficient in all simple weapons, all martial weapons,
      and one exotic weapon of its choice.
  - name: Shadow Cloak (Ex)
    description: >-
      Because of the shadow giant's connection with the Plane of Shadow, as a
      move action in any illumination other than direct sunlight, a shadow giant
      can cloak itself in moving shadows that act as the spell blur for 1d6+6
      rounds. It can use this ability three times per day.
Description:
  - >-
    Though their kind originated on the Plane of Shadow, several families of
    shadow giants have relocated to the wilder regions of Nidal at the
    invitation of the Umbral Court. They serve as a company of elite shock
    troops, kept a close secret and only used in operations where they are not
    expected to leave any survivors to tell the tale.
  - >-
    Most shadow giants are especially taciturn and keep to themselves when not
    called to duty by the Umbral Court. They keep their own counsel and practice
    their own mysterious religion, whose bloody rituals of autosacrifice and
    cannibalism are presided over by their bone-and-feather-adorned shamans atop
    short-stepped pyramids constructed of dark basalt blocks. On the Shadow
    Plane, families of shadow giants have been known to combine together to form
    greater tribes when times of war are at hand. Such an army arrayed upon the
    field of battle is often enough to make enemies sue for peace with offers of
    gold and prisoners for sacrifice.
