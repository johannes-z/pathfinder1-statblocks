Description:
  - >-
    A mythic manticore is a nightmarish creature, perhaps the result of
    crossbreeding with poisonous drakes, decadent sphinxes, or aberrant
    chimeras. A voracious eater, a mythic manticore may devour an entire corpse,
    as well as its weapons and armor, leaving nothing but a bloody stain on the
    ground and a few organs it finds unpalatable. Any metal bits it eats are
    digested and used to grow its deadly spikes. Some are known to dine on giant
    venomous snakes and spiders with the intent of making their poison even more
    powerful.
  - >-
    A mythic manticore uses its thrown spikes to hold prey in place from a
    distance so it can leap upon it and tear it apart. It is especially fond of
    skewering the wings of a flying creature, forcing it to plummet to the
    ground where it becomes easy pickings. Its weakness-inducing poison makes it
    especially dangerous to winged mounts, as the poisoned creature may find
    itself unable to carry a rider.
