  of a snarling man, and a tail of dripping spikes.

  - name: Skewer (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a mythic manticore confirms a critical hit with a spike, the spike pins
      the target to the ground or a nearby surface. If the target is using
      winged flight, the spike snares its wings. The target is considered
      grappled by the manticore (though the manticore is not considered to be
      grappling) and must escape the grapple to move from its square. A flying
      creature must escape on its turn or plummet to the ground. As a swift
      action, a mythic manticore can expend one use of mythic power to skewer
      all targets hit by its spikes that turn, even if the attacks weren't
      critical hits.
  - name: Spikes (Ex)
    description: >-
      With a snap of its tail, a mythic manticore can loose a volley of four
      spikes as a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike). This
      attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets must
      be within 30 feet of each other. The creature can launch only 24 spikes in
      any 24-hour period.
Description:
  - >-
    A mythic manticore is a nightmarish creature, perhaps the result of
    crossbreeding with poisonous drakes, decadent sphinxes, or aberrant
    chimeras. A voracious eater, a mythic manticore may devour an entire corpse,
    as well as its weapons and armor, leaving nothing but a bloody stain on the
    ground and a few organs it finds unpalatable. Any metal bits it eats are
    digested and used to grow its deadly spikes. Some are known to dine on giant
    venomous snakes and spiders with the intent of making their poison even more
    powerful.
  - >-
    A mythic manticore uses its thrown spikes to hold prey in place from a
    distance so it can leap upon it and tear it apart. It is especially fond of
    skewering the wings of a flying creature, forcing it to plummet to the
    ground where it becomes easy pickings. Its weakness-inducing poison makes it
    especially dangerous to winged mounts, as the poisoned creature may find
    itself unable to carry a rider.
