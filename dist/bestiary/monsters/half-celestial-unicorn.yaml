    *Unicorn ability; see page 269 for details. Most half-celestials are born of
    a mortal who loved a good outsider, but powerful holy magic can also create
    one. Creating a Half-Celestial "Half-celestial" is an inherited or acquired
    template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature with an
    Intelligence score of 4 or more. A half-celestial creature retains the base
    creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: HD 5
    or less, as base creature + 1; HD 6-10, as base creature + 2; HD 11 or more,
    as base creature + 3. Alignment: Any good. Type: The creature's type changes
    to outsider (native). Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves. Armor Class:
    Natural armor improves by +1. Defenses/Qualities: It gains darkvision 60
    feet; immunity to disease; +4 racial bonus on saves vs. poison; acid, cold,
    and electricity resist 10; DR 5/magic (if HD 11 or less) or 10/magic (if HD
    12 or more); and SR equal to CR + 11 (maximum 35). Speed: Unless the base
    creature flies better, the half-celestial flies at twice the base creature's
    land speed (good maneuverability). Special Abilities: A half-celestial gains
    the following. Smite Evil (Su): Once per day, as a swift action, the
    halfcelestial can smite evil as a paladin of the same level as its Hit Dice.
    The smite persists until target is dead or the half-celestial rests.
    Spell-Like Abilities: A half-celestial with an Int or Wis score of 8 or
    higher has a cumulative number of spell-like abilities depending on its Hit
    Dice. Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable once per day. Caster
    level equals the creature's HD (or the caster evel of the base creature's
    spell-like abilities, whichever is higher). HD Abilities HD Abilities 1-2
    Pro. evil 3/day, bless 11-12 Holy word 3-4 Aid, detect evil 13-14 Holy aura
    3/day, hallow 5-6 Cure ser. wounds, neut. poison 15-16 Mass charm monster
    7-8 Holy smite, remove disease 17-18 Summon monster IX (celestials only)
    9-10 Dispel evil 19-20 Resurrection Abilities: A half-celestial gains a +4
    bonus on three ability scores of its choice and a +2 bonus on the other
    three. Skills: A half-celestial with racial Hit Dice has skill points per
    racial Hit Die equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier.
