SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Murmur (Su)
    description: >-
      A lorelei's murmur has the power to infect the minds of those that hear
      it. This effect even influences undead creatures despite their usual
      immunity to mind-affecting effects. When a lorelei murmurs, all creatures
      aside from other lorelei within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 20
      Will saving throw or become captivated. A creature that successfully saves
      is not subject to the same lorelei's song for 24 hours. A victim under the
      effects of the murmur moves toward the lorelei using the most direct means
      available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such as through
      fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end
      the effect before moving into peril. Affected creatures can take no
      actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the
      lorelei simply stands and offers no resistance to its attacks. This effect
      continues for as long as the lorelei murmurs and for 1 round thereafter.
      This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is
      Charisma-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Tentacle-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/ round for 4 rounds; effect
      1d4 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.
  - name: Vortex (Su)
    description: >-
      A lorelei can create a whirlpool as a standard action, at will. This
      ability functions identically to the whirlwind special attack (Pathfinder
      RPG Bestiary 306), but can form only underwater and cannot leave the
      water. A creature must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or be snared by the
      churning waters. The vortex is 20 feet across and 80 feet deep, and deals
      2d8+9 points of damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Description:
  - >-
    A lorelei resembles an enormous, stony sea anemone with a humanlike face
    covering much of its body. Noted for their magical murmurs that entrance
    sailors, the creatures lurk near rocky shoals barely concealed by crashing
    waves or rushing rivers, eager to lure humanoids to their deaths. Also known
    as a "murmur stone" for its rocklike natural camouf lage, a lorelei is a
    solitary creature that shuns peaceful contact with other living things. It
    broods in the shadows of seaside cliffs and ocean trenches, emerging only to
    torment the living. When not pursuing complicated schemes, a lorelei is fond
    of wrecking ships on rocks and luring sailors beneath the surface to drown.
    Some scholars claim that these creatures were once a species of beautiful
    fey cursed by foul forces. This claim is backed by the fact that they behave
    much like nereids, nixies, and sirens. A lorelei stands 9 feet tall, not
    counting the mess of tentacles atop its body, and weighs around 2,000
    pounds.
