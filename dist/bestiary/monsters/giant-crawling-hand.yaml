SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Mark Quarry (Su)
    description: >-
      A crawling hand is assigned a quarry by anointing the hand with a drop of
      the intended quarry's blood. If the hand has no current quarry, it
      automatically gains the next creature it damages as its quarry. Once
      attuned to a target, it becomes aware of the target's location as if under
      the effect of a continuous locate creature spell. The hand gains a +1
      bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks made to seek out
      and destroy the marked quarry. The mark quarry ability lasts until the
      quarry or the hand is slain.
  - name: Pus Burst (Su)
    description: >-
      When damaged by a piercing or slashing melee weapon, a spray of vile pus
      strikes the attacker unless the attacker makes a DC 15 Reflex save.
      Weapons that provide reach protect the attacker completely from a pus
      burst. Creatures struck by pus become nauseated for 1d3 rounds and take
      2d6 points of negative energy damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Some say the origins of the crawling hand lie in the experiments of demented
    necromancers contracted to construct tiny assassins. Other tales tell of
    gruesome prosthetics sparked to life by evil magic, which then developed
    primitive sentience and vengefully strangled their hosts. Regardless, the
    crawling hand is an efficient killing tool.
  - >-
    When not commanded to kill, the crawling hand remains still and can be
    handled and transported safely.
  - >-
    Typically, owners carry them about in small, velvet-lined boxes. Crawling
    hands can also be placed as guardians and programmed with contingency
    commands, such as to hunt down and slay an individual who performs a
    specific task like violating a shrine, opening a warded door, or breaking
    the seal of a casket.
