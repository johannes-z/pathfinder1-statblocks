Description:
  - >-
    Morbid-minded and wretched to look upon, spirit nagas are the witches of the
    naga race, hateful outcasts long shunned for their dark powers and loathsome
    ways. A typical spirit naga is slender, with the scales of a venomous
    serpent and a tangle of greasy hair framing their pale faces. Most measure
    14 feet long but weigh less than 300 pounds. Spirit nagas delight in places
    of death and desolation. Battle-scarred ruins, untended graveyards,
    despoiled forests, and tangled swamps all attract these repulsive creatures.
    Where guardian nagas favor places of innate sanctity, spirit nagas seek out
    places of fundamental corruption, sites they believe to be imbued with dark
    magics. The crypts of long-dead tyrants, the death places of great heroes,
    and the ruins of nefarious keeps all attract these wretched serpents. Most
    spirit nagas believe themselves to be the inheritors of some mysterious dark
    favor, seeing their innate magical talents as evidence of such. Most commune
    with vague powers of death and devastation, working profane rites and
    seeking grotesque auguries from cultic forces. To aid them, spirit nagas
    often use their enchanting gaze, changing victims into fawning fanatics and
    would-be sacrif ices. Spirit nagas occasionally band together in small
    groups-some seeming to mimic the covens of hags. While a particular plot or
    foe might bring these deadly serpents together for a short time, spirit
    nagas are loyal only to themselves, and such alliances always end in deadly
    betrayal.
