Description:
  - >-
    Conshee make their homes in large, open subterranean caverns far from the
    surface world. They spend most of their days mining, collecting minerals, or
    simply enjoying the natural beauty of their surroundings. Conshee don't take
    intrusions lightly and are moved to anger quickly when their homes are
    threatened. The conshee have an intense dislike for mites (see the Tome of
    Horrors Complete) and generally attack them on sight. Captured mites are
    killed almost immediately; very rarely are they ever taken prisoner. Mites
    seem to dislike the conshee equally as much, though captured conshee are
    often kept as slaves or sold back to their conshee clan or family.
  - >-
    Conshee prefer ambush tactics to straight-forward combat, attacking at range
    with their short bows and spell-like abilities. Some conshee also use
    daggers, saps, and other such weapons, allowing them to attack quickly and
    often times unnoticed. Conshee also employ a wide array of traps, snares,
    and pitfalls to injure, confuse, or capture would-be opponents. The
    corridors and passages leading to a conshee lair are often rife with all
    manner of such traps and pitfalls. Conshee often employ natural poisons as
    well, taken from the various plants, leaves, and underground flowers near
    their lairs.
  - >-
    An adult conshee stands about 2 feet tall. It is a small lithe creature with
    grayish skin, a hairless body, and two leathery bat-like wings growing from
    its back. Its hands end in claws, though they are not strong enough to use
    in combat.
