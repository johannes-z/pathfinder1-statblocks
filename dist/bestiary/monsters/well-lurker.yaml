Description:
  - >-
    These creatures make their homes in crevasses and carved dungeon pits. This
    creature has developed a keen natural camouflage making them appear as a
    freshwater well carved into subterranean lairs. The entire well is in fact
    the beast with tentacles and devouring mouth drawn five feet beneath a rocky
    collar which protrudes from the ground.
  - >-
    Well lurkers are opportunistic and passive hunters, rarely seeking out their
    meals; they simply wait for something to wander too close to them and then
    strike. If food becomes scarce or the area around a well lurker's lair
    becomes devoid of life, it uproots itself and moves to a new location.
  - >-
    Such occurrences are rare however as the well lurker can go months without
    eating (and its rare for caves and caverns to go months without being
    explored by adventurer types).
  - >-
    A typical well lurker covers a 10-foot area, though specimens covering as
    much as a 30-foot area have been reported. A well lurker's tentacles are
    deep brown in color and about 10 feet long (longer on larger specimens).
  - >-
    Its maw is dark brown and ringed with many small tentacles. It can draw its
    grasping tentacles into its form and fold its mouth tentacles backwards
    inside its maw, thus appearing for all intents and purposes as an ancient
    stone well.
  - >-
    Animals can detect the unnatural presence of a well lurker and are generally
    nervous in its presence. Unless forced, an animal does not approach closer
    than 10 feet to this creature.
  - >-
    This monster's tactics are simple. It waits for beings to attempt to draw
    water from the apparently bottomless depth before lashing out with
    tentacles, attempting to draw prey into its fanged mouth, biting and
    devouring foes whole. Cutting oneself out from the well lurker is nearly
    impossible as they brace their girth against solid stone, meaning one would
    have to climb out through the mouth of the beast in order to escape certain
    death and painful digestion.
