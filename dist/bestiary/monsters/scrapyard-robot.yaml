SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fall to Pieces (Ex)
    description: >-
      Attacks and effects that deal more than 25% of a scrapyard robot's maximum
      hit points in damage (10 hit points for a standard scrapyard robot) impair
      one of the robot's components. Determine which subsystem randomly by
      rolling 1d6. If the subsystem has already been impaired, there is no
      further effect. 1 CPU: The robot is confused (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook
      566) 2 Fractured Plating: Reduce the robot's natural armor bonus by 3. 3
      Power Core: Attacks against the robot with natural weapons, unarmed
      strikes, or metal weapons deal 1d6 points of electricity damage to the
      attacker, and the robot's slam attack deals an additional 1d6 points of
      electricity damage. The robot shuts down from power loss in 1d4+1 rounds.
      4 Rotary Saw: The robot loses its rotary saw attack. 5 Servos: The robot's
      speed is reduced to 15 feet and its CMD against trip combat maneuvers is
      reduced by 8. 6 Sensors: The robot is blinded.
  - name: Repair (Ex)
    description: >-
      A scrapyard robot can use the inactive bodies of other robots to repair
      damage to itself. Doing so restores 10 hit points and removes one
      condition imparted by its fall to pieces ability per 8-hour period of
      uninterrupted work. Eight hours of repair expends all salvageable parts
      from 1 Medium robot. For each size category a scrapped robot is above
      Medium, the scrapyard robot can perform another 8 hours of repairs using
      that robot's parts. For each size category smaller than Medium scrapped
      robots are, the scrapyard robot requires twice as many robots to complete
      8 hours of work.
  - name: Staggered (Ex)
    description: >-
      The poor construction of a scrapyard robot allows it to take only a single
      move or standard action each round. In effect, it always has the staggered
      condition. A scrapyard robot can move up to its speed and attack in the
      same round as a charge action.
Description:
  - >-
    Pieced together from broken technology, these constructs lack the balance to
    stand upright, the motor control to use their hands (if they have any), and
    the intelligence possessed by advanced robots, but they still retain a
    halting consciousness and the ability to obey simple commands.
