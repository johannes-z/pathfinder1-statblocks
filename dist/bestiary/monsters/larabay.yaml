SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Befuddling Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      Three times per day as a standard action, a larabay can employ a
      befuddling gaze attack in a 30-foot cone. Creatures that fail a DC 21 Will
      save become dazed for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that successfully save are
      dazzled for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Mischief (Su)
    description: >-
      A larabay can channel its magical energy through whatever one-handed
      weapon it wields to mystify and disorient foes. Creatures hit by a
      larabay's weapon must make a DC 21 Will save or take 1 point of Dexterity
      damage and become confused for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Description:
  - >-
    Larabays are capricious fey creatures that gravitate toward coastal regions
    with warm and temperate islands. They are especially fond of toying with
    sailors and fishermen, playing pranks aboard ships or in seaside towns by
    assuming various shapes and using their otherworldly powers of mischief. A
    larabay's idea of fun can quickly become quite serious, however, when its
    love of trickery begins to outweigh its sympathy for humanity, and a
    larabay's well-executed joke may result in a potentially fatal situation for
    those involved. In their never-ending pursuit of a good laugh, larabays have
    been known to employ their supernatural illusions to draw ships and their
    crews into precarious situations such as hazardous waters or hidden shoals,
    and the depredations of a larabay are often only realized after it's too
    late. On land, larabays entice their unknowing dupes off cliffs' edges,
    through monster lairs, or into hidden ravines or pools of quicksand.
  - >-
    Larabays use their shapechanging abilities to craft intricate webs of social
    intrigue, though such schemes are always concocted in an effort simply to
    conduct a masterful hoax, usually resulting in the devastation or heartbreak
    of one or more of the parties involved rather than any concrete gains on the
    fey's part. While larabays have been known to inadvertently perform acts of
    good in the process of gulling cruel-hearted individuals, their
    unpredictable and precarious natures make them difficult allies, and one can
    never be sure just how long a larabay will remain faithful to a particular
    cause before getting bored or whether its companions are simply its latest
    victims.
