Description:
  - The behemoth hippopotamus is a true monster.
  - >-
    Standing taller than an elephant, this animal has few enemies in the natural
    world-even dinosaurs and dire crocodiles avoid fights with them. Making them
    even more dangerous is the fact that they are practically carnivores-while
    not above eating plant matter, they devour carrion or foolish creatures that
    come too close.
