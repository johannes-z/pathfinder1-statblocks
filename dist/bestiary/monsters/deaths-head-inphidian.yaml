SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bite-injury; save DC 21 Fort; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4
      Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based
      and includes a +4 racial bonus.
  - name: Snake Empathy (Ex)
    description: >-
      Snakes, including giant snakes, do not willingly attack a death's head
      inphidian, though they can be forced to do so by magic. If the death's
      head inphidian attacks a snake, its protection against that creature ends.
      Death's
  - name: Head Staff (Ex)
    description: >-
      The staff of a death's head inphidian can hold poisons in a specially
      crafted chamber inside the jewel encrusted snake skull. The chamber holds
      enough poison to deliver three doses. Most death's head inphidians fill
      the chamber with their own poison (use the stats above). In lieu of
      poisoning an opponent struck by the staff, a death's head can command its
      staff to grapple and constrict its target. When a foe is successfully hit
      by the staff, the death's head inphidian can make an immediate grapple
      check as a free action. If successful, the opponent is pinned and takes
      1d6+6 points of bludgeoning damage each round until it escapes. (Use the
      death's head inphidian's statistics above to resolve the grapple and
      escape.) This staff functions only in the hands of a death's head
      inphidian. In the hands of any other creature, it acts as a normal
      quarterstaff. The gem-encrusted snake skull is worth a total of
      1,000-3,000 gp.
Description:
  - >-
    Death's head inphidians may not be the strongest or largest of the inphidian
    races, but they certainly are the most feared and respected; hence the
    reason the death's head is the leader of an inphidian nest. These creatures
    rule by fear and maintain tight control over their nest. Rules, commands,
    judgments, and punishments are all meted out by a death's head and all come
    quickly. As a death's head ages and draws near the end of its life, its
    position is often challenged by other death's heads, all vying for control
    of the inphidian nest. Such challenges generally end in the death of all but
    one death's head inphidian, who becomes the new leader of the nest, after
    the current leader dies (which is often times aided by the death's head in
    waiting). For this reason, as a death's head ages, it is rarely ever
    encountered alone, always having a retinue of other inphidians or giant
    snakes around it at all times.
  - >-
    A typical death's head inphidian stands 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds.
    Its dull blue-green scales darken and fade as it ages. A death's head has an
    average lifespan of 50 years.
  - >-
    A death's head in combat is a fearsome creature, having many tools at its
    disposal-and it uses all of them to the best of its ability. It usually
    opens combat with its spell-like abilities (suggestion or cause fear) and
    then launches into melee with its snake hands and staff. A poisoned foe is
    subjected to its accelerated poison spell-like ability. If overwhelmed, a
    death's head uses its snake staff ability to occupy its opponents while it
    makes its escape.
