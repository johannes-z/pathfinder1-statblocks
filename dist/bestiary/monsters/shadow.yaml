  - name: Strength Damage (Su)
    description: >-
      A shadow's touch deals 1d6 points of Strength damage to a living creature.
      This is a negative energy effect. A creature dies if this Strength damage
      equals or exceeds its actual Strength score.
Description:
  - >-
    The sinister shadow skirts the border between the gloom of darkness and the
    harsh truth of light. The shadow prefers to haunt ruins where civilization
    has moved on, where it hunts living creatures foolish enough to stumble into
    its territory. The shadow is an undead horror, and as such has no goals or
    outwardly visible motivations other than to sap life and vitality from
    living beings.
