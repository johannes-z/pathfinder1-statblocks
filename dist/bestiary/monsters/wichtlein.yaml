SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Fear (Su)
    description: >-
      By scrunching up its face, a wichtlein causes fear in those within 30 feet
      that look upon it. Creatures affected must succeed on a DC 10 Will save or
      be affected by fear (CL 5th). Creatures that save are unaffected by the
      same wichtlein's fear for one day. Creatures with 6 or more HD are not
      affected by this fear. The save is Charisma-based.
  - name: Limited Precognition (Su)
    description: >-
      Wichtlein are immediately aware of upcoming danger, so long as the hazard
      is not deliberately created by an intelligent creature. Thus, a wichtlein
      could sense a coming cave-in, or the approach of a bestial monster, but
      not a raiding party of drow or a miner planning a murder. A wichtlein can
      sense this danger 3d10 minutes before it occurs, and always attempts to
      warn any other intelligent creatures within the area.
  - name: Earth Glide (Ex)
    description: >-
      A wichtlein can move through any sort of natural earth or stone as easily
      as a fish swims through water. It leaves no sign of its passage or hint at
      its presence to creatures that don't possess tremorsense. A move earth
      spell cast on an area containing a wichtlein moves the witchlein back 30
      feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15
      Fortitude save. A wichtlein moving through stone cannot pick up or carry
      anything it finds within the stone; thus, they still spend a great deal of
      their time mining.
Description:
  - >-
    Wichtlein are a race of shy yet helpful fey who primarily dwell in mines,
    caves, and other underground locations. Although they prefer not to be seen,
    they are well known for warning miners and explorers of coming dangers, such
    as cave-ins or approaching monsters. Some communities believe the wichtlein
    are bad omens, actually causing the disasters about which they warn others,
    but this is just a myth.
  - >-
    Wichtlein are about the size of small halflings, and are occasionally
    mistaken for such until the viewer draws near enough to recognize how truly
    ugly the wichtlein is.
  - >-
    Unfortunately while helpful, wichtlein are not especially bright, and
    usually fail to accurately convey the sort of danger approaching. Most of
    the time, wichtlein simply pound on nearby rock and stone to indicate
    danger, a sign that miners are wise to heed.
  - >-
    Individual wichtlein occasionally leave their mines to dwell in and under
    the homes of humans or other humanoids. This happens when a wichtlein
    becomes smitten with a human of the opposite gender, something which occurs
    rather more frequently than might be expected. These "house wichtlein"
    maintain the home, cleaning and repairing to the best of their ability while
    their beloved is away. Such "relationships" most frequently end when the
    wichtlein finally reveals itself to the object of its affections, and is
    usually rejected. Some wichtlein, despite their generally good alignment,
    wreak havoc on the home of the one who rejected it before returning,
    dejected, to its mine.
  - >-
    Wichtlein dislike confrontation, and prefer to flee when possible. If they
    have no opportunity to run, and cannot create such an opportunity with their
    slow and fear abilities, they try to bribe their attackers with knowledge of
    the local mines and caves. (Wichtlein almost always know where to find gems
    and valuable metals.) Only if all else fails do they engage in combat.
