SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Dazing Gaze (Su)
    description: >-
      A cephalophore can make a gaze attack that affects all seeing creatures
      within a 60-foot radius. These creatures must succeed at a DC 16 Will save
      or be stunned for 1 round. Creatures that successfully save are instead
      sickened for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save
      DC is Wisdom-based.
  - name: Dazing Strike (Su)
    description: >-
      A creature struck by the cephalophore's slam attack must succeed at a DC
      16 Will save or be dazed for 1 round. Those who save are instead sickened
      for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is
      Wisdom-based.
  - name: Shatter Weapon (Ex)
    description: >-
      When a character strikes a cephalophore with a weapon, the weapon takes
      3d6 points of damage (apply its hardness normally). A weapon that takes
      damage in excess of its hardness gains the broken condition.
  - name: Statue Form (Ex)
    description: >-
      If a cephalophore stands perfectly still, it is indistinguishable from a
      normal statue. An observer must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to
      notice the cephalophore is alive. If a cephalophore initiates combat from
      this pose, it gains a +6 bonus on its initiative check.
Description:
  - >-
    These construct guardians appear to be looming statues of decapitated
    humanoids, their severed heads held aloft in a gruesome warning or cradled
    in their hands like a precious prize. To benign passersby, these marble
    constructs remain inert, their stone gazes producing only an unnerving sense
    of watchfulness. However, those who attempt to raid or desecrate a
    cephalophore's holy site quickly find that the seemingly immovable statue is
    anything but. Consequently, many adventurers and tomb raiders have come to
    see cephalophores as good omens, for when one finds a cephalophore, a
    dangerous and treasure-filled ruin-hopefully still unlooted-is surely not
    far away. Each cephalophore was constructed to stand guard over a single
    location, typically a tomb or temple. The ravages of time do little to
    diminish the single-minded dedication of these creatures, but the sacred
    edifices to which they are bound seldom stand so firmly against the ages.
    Thus, cephalophores are often found amid ruins or deep in the wilderness,
    standing vigilant guard over a site long forgotten by mortal society. Many
    cephalophores lie buried beneath sandy dunes, overgrown by unchecked jungle
    foliage, or entombed within collapsed caverns. A typical cephalophore stands
    10 to 15 feet tall and weighs 4,000 pounds. Cephalophores are made of solid
    marble, which makes attacking them with standard weaponry inefficient at
    best. Construction

    A cephalophore is constructed from a single block of marble weighing at
    least 4,000 pounds and costing 3,500 gp.
