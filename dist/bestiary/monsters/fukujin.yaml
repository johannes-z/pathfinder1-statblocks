    description: >-
      A fukujin brings good fortune with it wherever it goes. Any allied
      creature that begins its turn within 15 feet of a fukujin gains a +2 bonus
      on skill checks.
  - name: Precise Attacks (Su)
    description: >-
      A fukujin can detect weak points in a foe's defenses as an immediate
      action by succeeding at a DC 15 Perception check. Once these weak points
      have been determined, a fukujin gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls to
      confirm critical hits against that creature for 24 hours. A fukujin can
      inform a single ally within 30 feet of its findings as a swift action,
      granting that ally the same bonus. This bonus cannot be granted to more
      than one creature, even if a fukujin attempts to point out a weakness to
      another.
Description:
  - >-
    Spiritual guardians of ornamental shrubs and miniature trees, fukujin are
    highly regarded among Tians as bringers of good fortune and sound wisdom.
    Fukujins are thought to only come to goodhearted and devoted bonsai
    gardeners, and since bonsai plants are often only cultivated by astute and
    aesthetically minded humanoids, the kami are usually of a similar nature,
    speaking to mortals rarely and always cryptically. Regardless of how much of
    their coveted knowledge they impart upon favored mortals, however, fukujins
    always bring with them a sense of hope and good luck, and almost all within
    close proximity of the kami feel an instant sense of relief.
  - >-
    Fukujins resemble humanoids with tree branches protruding from their bodies,
    most often their heads, and some fukujins possess leafy hair or treelike
    limbs. A fukujin in its physical form is only as tall as its bonsai
    ward-usually only a foot or two-and weighs less than 30 pounds. Ecology
  - >-
    While many see the art of bonsai gardening as humanoids' attempts at
    controlling or forming nature, fukujins ref lect the practice's virtues of
    patience and nurturing. Fukujins maintain that a moment of patience and
    study can reveal multitudes more than years of trial and error, and the
    diminutive beings spread this knowledge wherever they go. While kami do not
    reproduce in any typical sense, fukujins are known to sow seeds of bonsai
    plants in the wake of their footsteps, further delighting communities that
    appreciate such flora. Though assignment of kami remains up to the
    mysterious will of the gods, fukujins do their part in creating numerous
    hosts for these spirits.
  - >-
    The health and strength of the tree branch protruding from a fukujin's head
    is often said to be a good indicator of the skill of the warded bonsai
    tree's caretaker. While the aesthetic values of bonsai trees are often
    completely subjective, the kami spirits are evidence that there is perhaps a
    series of core doctrines bonsai farmers should adhere to when taking care of
    their plants-ideals that a gardener can strive toward to ensure he achieves
    success in his maintenance of the small tree. A poorly trimmed bonsai plant
    may sicken the spirit for a time, for instance, while expert grafting can
    result in a strong or knowledgeable kami. In most cases, however, a kami
    will almost always leave its ward if a bonsai gardener neglects the plant
    long enough or effectively ruins the effort, for though fukujins are
    patient, they have little tolerance for the virtues of negligence and
    wastefulness.
  - >-
    While nearly all fukujins are calm, collected, and patient spirits, the
    beings are by no means all the same, as their physical appearances,
    predispositions, and demeanors are just as often reflections of the
    particular bonsai plant that they watch over. Fukujins who reside within the
    hearts of deciduous trees, for example, tend to be of lighter color as well
    as more airy and spirited than the hardy and resilient fukujins of
    coniferous shrubs, who take on a red, earthy hue. Plant type can also hint
    at particular magical qualities the spirit might have-white-trunked trees
    tend to attract gaunter, more fatalistic individuals, while plants with
    brown or ebon bark inspire kami that are more attuned to the energies and
    mysteries of magic. The tree branch that sticks out of a fukujin's head
    while the spirit is in its physical form is often of the same variety as the
    bonsai tree that the kami protects, though exceptions have been known to
    exist among particularly dual-natured spirits.
  - Habitat & Society
  - >-
    Since their wards are by nature the direct result of humanoid intervention,
    fukujins are naturally social creatures, and most seek to assist their
    humanoid partners in not only cultivating beautiful plants, but
  - >-
    in all spheres of life. Many bonsai gardeners are often content to live in a
    permanent home, establish a family, and live a life of tranquility, and
    fukujins happily provide all manner of advice regarding these domestic
    issues. In other instances, however, fukujins have been known to travel
    alongside particularly adventurous cultivators, humanoids who keep the
    shrubbery and kami spirit in safe and comfortable packs or pouches and
    consult them for wisdom in circumstances both dire and unusual. The
    miniature kami's insights and good luck prove as useful in the heat of
    battle as in the hearthstone, and so humanoids from nearly all walks of life
    seek the favor of these beings.
  - >-
    Bonsai trees are delicate plants and their kami ref lect this fragility.
    What they lack in physical defenses, however, fukujins make up for in grace
    and keen insight, using their natural acumen to avoid and deter hazards
    before they're even encountered. Some might mistakenly see this expert
    passiveness as a manifestation of fukujins' philanthropic ideals and good
    intentions, but more often than not their flightiness is simply what they
    deem to be the wisest course of action. In situations where violence is
    inevitable, fukujins seek the aid of stronger individuals to help protect
    them, true to the tradition of their wards' reliance on humanoid
    intervention and maintenance. Rather than view this reliance on humanoids as
    a weakness, however, most fukujins accept it as part of a long-lasting
    transaction between the two forces, each providing unique benefits to the
    other throughout the relationship. To bolster this partnership, fukujins
    harness healing powers as well as the strength of their insight, ensuring
    that their caretakers remain healthy and able to protect the kami and their
    wards.
  - >-
    While they almost always possess pertinent and useful advice, fukujins are
    known for being reserved under most circumstances, sharing what knowledge
    they have only when it is absolutely necessary, and they never share wisdom
    superfluously. Fukujins are normally individualistic and solitary like the
    plants they watch over, and when they interact with one another they usually
    do so telepathically. What people often perceive as the luck of fukujins is
    often merely the result of wise advice garnered from the spirits, though
    when asked if the kami really are bringers of fortune, fukujins are known to
    remain even more tight-lipped than usual.
  - >-
    Occasionally one might encounter a fukujin in the wild, in lands far from
    the societies and plants where they commonly make their homes. In such
    cases, these miniature kami often claim shrubs, young plants, and even
    whimiscal-looking mushrooms as their wards, grooming nearby groves and
    glades into quiet meditation gardens or into artistic shapes, inviting
    visitors to rest and reflect.
