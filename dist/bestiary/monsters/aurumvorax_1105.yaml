SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Grab (Ex)
    description: >-
      An aurumvorax can grab a foe of up to one size category larger than itself
      (Medium size for most aurumvoraxes). It gains a +8 racial bonus on grapple
      attempts rather than the normal +4 racial bonus afforded by the grab
      ability.
Description:
  - >-
    Aurumvoraxes are very aggressive creatures, and lead solitary lives except
    when they mate. Adults typically claim the hunting area within a mile of
    their warrens, ruthlessly driving away other predators.
  - >-
    In addition to fresh meat, aurumvoraxes are fond of gnawing on metals
    (particularly gold and copper), though whether they do this to sharpen their
    teeth or because of some nutritional need is unknown. Aurumvorax warrens can
    stretch for thousands of feet, often winding deep into the earth. The
    avaricious appetite of aurumvoraxes has earned them the appellation "golden
    gorger" among dwarves, who have lost more than a few miners to the dangerous
    beasts.
  - >-
    In battle, an aurumvorax latches onto its victim with its jaws and gouges
    savage wounds with its claws. It rarely looses its grip before it or its foe
    is dead. It typically attacks the nearest living creature regardless of
    size, and ignores any wounds it suffers at the hands of others until its
    prey is dead.
  - >-
    A typical aurumvorax is only 3 feet long but weighs more than 200 pounds,
    for it is densely packed with muscle and thick, sturdy bones. Its fur is
    golden, while its claws are black and sharp. Its weight relative to its body
    size makes it a poor swimmer, and most dislike crossing water, though they
    can trundle along the bottom of still or slow water if necessary.
  - >-
    Adult aurumvoraxes are impossible to train, but their offspring are valued
    for training as guard beasts.
  - >-
    A healthy aurumvorax kit can be sold for 5,000 gp or more to a discerning
    buyer. Female aurumvoraxes rarely give birth to more than one offspring at a
    time, and are ferociously protective of their young.
  - >-
    An aurumvorax drags its prey back to its lair to consume at its leisure, and
    its bone-midden often contains valuable belongings from past kills. Uneaten
    precious metals, discarded gems, and well-chewed metal items can also be
    found in its warrens. Despite its metallic coloration, an aurumvorax is not
    vulnerable to attacks that target metal, such as heat metal or the touch of
    a rust monster-in fact, aurumvoraxes easily kill and eat rust monsters, and
    some dwarf clans use aurumvorax pets to protect their storehouses against
    them.
