SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Spines (Ex)
    description: >-
      A creature that steps on a dragonfish or strikes it with an unarmed strike
      or a natural weapon takes 1d4 points of piercing damage from the fish's
      dorsal barbs and is subjected to its poison. Melee weapons do not endanger
      a user in this way. A charging or running creature must immediately stop
      if it steps on a dragonfish. A creature that takes more than 2 points of
      damage from a dragonfish's barb has its speed is reduced by half because
      its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts until the barb is
      removed, requiring a DC 15 Heal check at least 1 point of magical healing.
      A failure on the Heal check to remove a dragonfish spine results in 1d4
      additional points of damage.

Description:
  - >-
    A dragonfish is a small, 2-foot long, flat fish that makes its home on the
    bottom of shallow lakes, rivers, or streams. The dragonfish's back is
    covered with long, sharp spines. A dragonfish's dorsal spines carry a
    virulent poison that is delivered whenever an opponent contacts a spine.
    They are non-aggressive and spend their days eating miniscule water
    creatures, insects, and aquatic plants.
  - >-
    Dragonfish are not aggressive and prefer to lie on the bottom of a body of
    water, waiting for a victim to step on it so its poisonous spines penetrate
    the victim's flesh. If forced into melee, a dragonfish attacks with its
    bite.
