Description:
  - >-
    Moles are small rodent mammals that live primarily in burrows underground.
    While many varieties of moles exist, most share common features that include
    subterranean habitats, poor eyesight, and the ability to dig long distances
    with their powerful forelimbs. The typical mole is 6 inches long and weighs
    less than a pound. These familiars are popular choices with ratfolk.
