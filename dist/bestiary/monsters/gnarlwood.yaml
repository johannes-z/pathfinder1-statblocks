Description_Visual: >-
  This creature resembles a treant but instead of the kindly, gentle face of the
  tree-folk its face is twisted into a grim scowl. Its deep-set eyes and jagged
  mouth give it an almost skull-like grimace and its four twisted arms are
  tipped in sharp woody claws. Its leaves are deep green, almost black, and have
  ghostly white markings on them. Behind it, the skeletal remains of unfortunate
  animals shamble through the undergrowth.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Like Abilities (Sp)
    description: >-
      With its animate dead spell-like ability a gnarlwood can animate any
      corpse within 60 feet. Because of their arboreal habitat, most gnarlwoods
      are accompanied by animal zombies and skeletons.
  - name: Unhallowed Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      A gnarlwood emanates an unhallow spell in a 20-foot radius centered on
      itself. Thus, a gnarlwood is constantly protected as by a magic circle
      from good, and the DC to resist positive channeled energy within 20 feet
      of it is reduced by 4 (at the same time the DC to resist negative
      channeled energy within 20 feet of a gnarlwood gain a +4 bonus). This aura
      can be dispelled or negated, but the gnarlwood can restart it again as a
      free action on its next turn.
Description:
  - >-
    Gnarlwoods are grown from the seeds of treants that had the misfortune of
    sprouting in land cursed by an unhallow spell. The good nature of the treant
    is subverted by the very nourishment it gains from the earth, and the evil
    of the spell suffuses into its every fiber. Most gnarlwoods die before they
    are much larger than twiggy saplings, since few creatures of nature can
    survive on a diet of pure evil. Those that do survive grow into menacing,
    twisted mockeries of treants, with four knobby arms that end in cruel barbed
    claws. Gnarlwoods are spiteful, hateful things that seek to destroy
    everything they see. Bereft of any compassion, gnarlwoods tear through
    forests accompanied by the shambling corpses of its victims, rending and
    clawing anything that moves. Some evil druidic temples secluded deep in
    ancient forests are protected by entire groves of gnarlwoods. Unfortunately
    for the worshippers, not even they are spared the psychotic wrath of the
    gnarlwood. A gnarlwood usually begins combat with its protection from good
    in effect (especially when facing good-aligned opponents) and normally sends
    its minions (if any) into battle to distract or soften up its foes. In the
    first round it attempts to use its slay living spell-like ability against a
    creature it deems highly susceptible (usually a wizard or sorcerer since
    they have poor Fortitude saves). In the next round it assaults its opponents
    with its claws, rending any opponent it hits with at least two of its claws.
    It sprinkles combat with its spell-like abilities throughout. During battle,
    if possible, it tries to keep any undead minions it has with it within the
    confines of its unhallowed aura so enemy clerics find it hard to affect them
    with their channel energy ability. A gnarlwood constantly howls and wails
    during battle and always fights to the death. Copyright Notice Author Erica
