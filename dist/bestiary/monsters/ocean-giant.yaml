    description: >-
      When holding its conch, an ocean giant can cast great shout (DC 22)
      instead of shout, and gains Augment Summoning as a bonus feat. If the
      conch is destroyed (hardness 5, 20 hp), the giant can spend 1 week to
      craft a replacement.
Description:
  - >-
    Ocean giants embody the great extremes of the sea. Their skin colors vary
    from deep blue to pale green, and their eyes and hair range from foamy white
    to coral pink. They decorate themselves with the treasures of the sea,
    wearing shell jewelry or scrimshaw, and clothing woven from underwater
    plants, or even salvaged sails. Each ocean giant carries a hand-crafted
    musical horn made from a conch shell, an object of cultural significance
    representing its family history and travels on the vast sea. Many ocean
    giants view themselves as guardians of the sea, its creatures, and those who
    travel the waves, safeguarding their charges from remarkable coral towers.
    Others, however, claim domains measuring thousands of leagues, enslaving the
    beasts and aquatic races within and shattering any ship that dares trespass
    near their citadels of urchins and bones. Adult ocean giants stand
    approximately 22 feet tall and weigh about 15,000 pounds. Most live to be
    about 500 years old.
