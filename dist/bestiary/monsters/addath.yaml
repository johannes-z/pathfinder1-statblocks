SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Bristles (Ex)
    description: >-
      Long bristles cover the addath's spidery legs. With the addath's erratic
      movements in combat, any creature adjacent to and attacking the addath has
      a chance of being hit by the bristles. Each time a creature attacks an
      addath with a melee attack it must make a DC 22 Reflex save to avoid being
      punctured by several bristles. Each time a creature is punctured by these
      bristles, it takes 1d6 points of piercing damage and is exposed to the
      addath's poison. A creature that grapples an addath is automatically hurt
      by these bristles. The save DC to avoid the bristles is Dexterity-based.
  - name: Poison (Ex)
    description: >-
      Bristles or bite-injury; save DC 26 Fort; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds;
      effect 1d6 Strength damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is
      Constitution-based.
  - name: Spider Poison Immunity (Ex)
    description: >-
      An addath is immune to the venom of ordinary spiders, giant spiders, and
      phase spiders.
  - name: Tentacles (Ex)
    description: >-
      The addath's tentacles are always a primary attack for the creature. It
      can transfer a grabbed creature from a tentacle to its mouth as a move
      action.
Description:
  - >-
    The addath is a fearsome subterranean hunter that makes its home in caves,
    caverns, and ruins. It is a highly aggressive predator that paralyzes its
    victim, carries it back to its nest, and devours it at its leisure.
  - >-
    Addaths do not spin webs, but live in large tunnels and chambers or within
    ruined structures that can accommodate their massive size. Addath lairs are
    typically littered with the bones and carcasses of uneaten meals and so
    emanate the stench of death that is easily detectable (and functions as a
    warning to others not to intrude).
  - >-
    An addath stands almost 20 feet tall. Its body is dark in color and covered
    with dark (usually black) hairs. Its legs are long and sleek and covered in
    deadly black bristles. The creature's mouth is located on its underside and
    is surrounded by four long tentacles. The tentacles are slick and hairless
    and either dark brown or black in color. The creature's eyes, tiny and
    almost undetectable are spaced evenly around its central form.
  - >-
    Addaths, when hunting, attack from ambush, usually clinging to an overhang
    or ceiling and waiting for prey to pass beneath. Some prefer hiding in
    shadows and springing out when prey is detected, and still others prefer
    hiding in huge pits and holes, rushing forth whenever their tremorsense
    detects movement in the area. Addaths attack by grabbing their prey with
    their tentacles biting it repeatedly. Addaths try to stay in melee range at
    all times, knowing eventually a creature can't help but contact its
    poisonous bristles.
