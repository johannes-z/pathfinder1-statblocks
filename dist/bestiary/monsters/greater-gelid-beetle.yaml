SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Cold (Ex)
    description: >-
      A greater gelid beetle's body generates cold that deals an extra 1d8
      points of cold damage every time it succeeds on a bite attack. Creatures
      attacking a greater gelid beetle unarmed or with natural weapons take this
      same cold damage each time one of their attacks hits.
  - name: Cold Cloud (Ex)
    description: >-
      Once per minute as a free action, a greater gelid beetle can emit a cloud
      of thick, billowing, icy cold vapors in a 20-foot radius around its body.
      The cloud is extremely thick and prevents effective ranged weapon attacks
      (except for magic rays). Melee attack and damage rolls suffer a -2 penalty
      in the cloud. Each round, on the beetle's turn, the cloud deals 2d6 points
      of cold damage to each creature within it. A successful DC 20 Fortitude
      save reduces the damage by half. The save DC is Constitution-based. The
      cloud lasts 1d4+3 rounds before dispersing.
Description:
  - >-
    Greater gelid beetles are larger, meaner versions of the standard gelid
    beetle. They are almost always hungry and are usually encountered while
    hunting. These beetles enjoy the flesh of cold-dwelling animals such as
    moose, deer, snow leopards, and the like.
  - Greater gelid beetles use their cold cloud when threatened or cornered.
  - >-
    Once the cloud has been released, the beetle either seeks escape (unless its
    hungry) or fights back with its powerful bite. Once its cold cloud
    recharges, the beetle releases it again if it's still in combat.
