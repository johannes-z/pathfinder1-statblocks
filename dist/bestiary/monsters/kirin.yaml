Description:
  - >-
    The noble kirin roam the sky, their feet rarely touching soil. They have a
    stag's graceful body and cloven hooves, a pair of backward-facing horns, and
    a thick mane and tail ranging from golden to brilliant reds or purples in
    the hues of the setting sun. Their hide resembles that of a dragon, the
    scales gleaming ebon or iridescent green.
  - >-
    Rare in the extreme, kirin seldom meddle openly in worldly affairs,
    preferring a subtle hand in overturning the schemes of wicked spirits such
    as hags and oni. The blood of young kirin runs hot, however, and such
    spirited youths may serve as mounts for cavaliers and paladins of clever wit
    and untarnished moral quality.
  - >-
    The wisest and most powerful kirin are known as emperor kirin, having earned
    this title through the respect of their peers and the strength of their
    powers. They resemble standard kirin, except their hooves give off sparks as
    they gallop through the air.
  - >-
