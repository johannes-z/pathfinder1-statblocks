SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Animate Plants (Sp)
    description: >-
      A plant guardian can animate any plants of the same type within 180 feet
      at will, controlling up to two such plants at a time. It takes 1 full
      round for the plant to uproot itself, after which it moves at a speed of
      10 feet and fights as a plant of the same type as the one animating it
      (exceptions are noted in each entry below), gaining the plant guardian's
      vulnerability to fire. If the plant guardian that animated it terminates
      the animation, moves out of range, or is incapacitated, the plant
      immediately takes root wherever it is and returns to its normal state.
  - name: Double Damage against Objects (Ex)
    description: >-
      A plant guardian or animated tree that makes a full attack against an
      object or structure deals double damage.
  - name: Plantspeech (Ex)
    description: >-
      A plant guardian has the ability to converse with plants as if subject to
      a continual speak with plants spell, and most plants greet them with an
      attitude of friendly or helpful.
Description:
  - >-
