SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Yellow Musk Zombie (Su)
    description: >-
      A victim reduced to Intelligence 0 becomes a yellow musk zombie in 1 hour
      under the control of the creeper that created it. If the yellow musk
      creeper is slain before the yellow musk zombie rises, the transformation
      can be prevented by the casting of neutralize poison followed by a heal or
      restoration spell.
  - name: Intelligence Damage (Ex)
    description: >-
      As a free action, a yellow musk creeper can insert hundreds of tiny roots
      into the head of an entranced foe within any space occupied by the
      creeper. An entranced foe does not resist this attack and does not receive
      a saving throw to break free of its entranced state. This attack deals 1d4
      points of Intelligence damage each round. A victim reduced to Intelligence
      0 becomes a yellow musk zombie in 1 hour (see Appendix B).
  - name: Pollen Spray (Ex)
    description: >-
      A yellow musk creeper can spray a tiny cloud of hypnotic pollen at a
      single creature within 30 feet. An opponent hit by the cloud must succeed
      on a DC 14 Fortitude save or be entranced for 1d4 minutes (as by a charm
      monster spell). Entranced creatures can take no action other than to move
      at their normal speed into a space occupied by the yellow musk creeper. An
      entranced creature resists any attempt to halt its progress. A victim
      within a space occupied by the yellow musk creeper stands there and offers
      no resistance to the monster's attacks. The save DC is Constitution-based.
  - name: Rejuvenation (Ex)
    description: >-
      A yellow musk creeper can be killed only if its root is dug up, then
      burned, hacked apart, or otherwise destroyed. Reducing the creeper to 0 or
      less hit points puts it out of commission, allowing excavation of its
      roots. The main root is a Small object with a hardness of 3 and 10 hit
      points. The root can be affected by spells or effects that affect an area
      or targeted by spells that affect an individual target. As long as the
      root remains intact, a yellow musk creeper regrows in about 2 weeks.
Description:
  - >-
    The yellow musk creeper is a slow-moving plant that attacks living creatures
    and feeds on their Intelligence, eventually turning such creatures into
    yellow musk zombies. Creepers can be found in moderate to warm climates or
    underground, and are rarely encountered elsewhere. The actual root of the
    plant is a large bulbous, brown sac that lies beneath the surface of the
    ground where the yellow musk creeper grows. Yellow musk creepers lie silent
    until prey approaches within 10 feet. The small flowers of the creeper then
    puff a musky-smelling fine powder at a single target, attempting to entrance
    the target. If attacked, a yellow musk creeper lashes out with its tendrils.
    Yellow musk creepers are never encountered alone. They always have a retinue
    of yellow musk zombies with them. These zombies will defend the creeper
    against all attacks. Credit The Yellow Musk Creeper originally appeared in
