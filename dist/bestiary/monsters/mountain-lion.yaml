Description:
  - >-
    This quick, elusive, and aggressive hunter is a member of the great cat
    family. Like others of its kind, it is a carnivore and exists mainly on a
    diet of meat. The typical mountain lion diet consists of small animals such
    as mice, squirrels, skunks, shrews, rabbits, porcupines, and gophers.
  - >-
    Mountain lions are known to feed on animals larger than themselves such as
    elk, moose, deer, and even pronghorns. After devouring as much of its kill
    as it desires, a mountain lion buries it, returning to feed on its prey over
    a period of 1d10 days. A mountain lion's hunting grounds often cover an area
    of up to 800 square miles. Mountain lions are also called cougars, pumas, or
    panthers.
  - >-
    Mountain lions mate once every other year, usually in the summer months.
    Typically this is the only time more than one adult mountain lion will be
    encountered. An average litter consists of 1d3 cubs. A mountain lion's den
    is usually found under an overhanging ledge, a crevice in a cliff, a dense
    thicket, or a cavity under the roots of large trees, or occasionally a dry,
    rock-strewn cave.

    Mountain lions stand about two feet tall and are about four to five feet
    long with a two to three foot long tail. A typical mountain lion weighs
    around 125 pounds. It has short, coarse, fur with a white underbelly and a
    black-tipped tail. Its fur color (except its underbelly) is typically brown,
    black, rust, or gray. Its eyes are golden. Newborn cubs have spots and blue
    eyes. The spots rapidly disappear as the cub ages and within nine months the
    spots are gone. Its eyes change from blue to golden within 12-18 months. The
    mountain lion has a lifespan of 18 years.
  - >-
    Mountain lions are ambush hunters and stalkers. They wait in dense
    vegetation or underbrush, or rocky outcroppings for potential prey to wander
    by. When in range, the mountain lion springs to the attack and bites and
    rakes its foe. Mountain lions are excellent hunters and often stalk
    potential prey for several miles before attacking.
