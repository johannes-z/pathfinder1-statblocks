Description_Visual: >-
  Slinking forth on bent limbs and gnarled claws, this twisted abomination bears
  a resemblance to a starved, plague-ridden ape, its form bestial and bent, with
  pallid skin stretched unnaturally over knotted bone. Yet its visage holds a
  greater terror, for amid fangs and milky eyes linger the withered features of
  a living corpse.

SpecialAbilities:
  - name: Create Spawn (Su)
    description: >-
      Any humanoid creature that is slain by a vrykolakas's natural attacks
      becomes a vrykolakas itself in 1d4 days if not blessed and properly
      buried. A blessing might entail either the spell bless or a more mundane
      consecration. A vrykolakas's spawn are free-willed and wild, typically
      remembering nothing of their moment of death and caring nothing for the
      vrykolakas that killed them. They do not possess any of the abilities they
      had in life.
  - name: Feral Possession (Ex)
    description: >-
      Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, a vrykolakas's spirit attempts to
      possess any animal within 100 feet. This ability is similar to the spell
      magic jar but does not require a receptacle and has a duration equal to 1
      hour for every Hit Die the vrykolakas possesses. The target must make a DC
      21 Will save or be possessed. If the possession fails, the vrykolakas
      immediately dies. If the possession succeeds, the animal immediately
      retreats to the vrykolakas's grave, where it attempts to bury itself in
      the earth. If left uninterrupted for 1d4 days, the animal transforms into
      a new vrykolakas with all the same statistics as the original. If
      discovered and slain during this time, both the animal and the vrykolakas
      spirit are destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  - name: Pestilent Aura (Su)
    description: >-
      All creatures that come within 5 feet of a vrykolakas must save to resist
      contracting bubonic plague. Any creature that successfully saves against a
      vrykolakas's pestilent aura cannot be affected by the aura of that same
      vrykolakas for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. Bubonic Plague:
      aura-inhaled; save Fort DC 21; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4
      Con damage and 1 Cha damage and target is fatigued; cure 2 consecutive
      saves.
Description:
  - >-
    A restless and savage form of undead, the vrykolakas knows only rage and
    relishes the suffering of those who failed it in life. Reanimated corpses of
    wicked and vengeful souls denied even the basic burial rites, these
    unreasoning vampire-kin unleash their wrath against the living,
    indiscriminately spreading disease and death among all in their paths. Their
    bitterness at their own disgraced ends drives them to a loathing of all life
    and a jealous desire to see all other living creatures fall to their same
    level of profanity and debasement. Such hardly proves a conscious plot,
    though, but rather a fundamental instinct. Thus, a single vrykolakas can
    devastate an entire village, potentially spawning a host of new vrykolakas
    from their victims. A vrykolakas (the name both singular and plural) appears
    as a terrible, bestial corruption of the being it was in life. Twisted by
    rage and undeath into an animalistic shape, these undead bear the taint of
    death, their bodies lean to the appearance of starvation and pocked with
    evidence of rot and disease. Hunched and twisted, a vrykolakas's bent spine
    is the same length it was in life if straightened, but the feral posture of
    most cause them to slump to a mere 4-1/2 to 5 feet tall. The wasting of
    death also greatly decreases the corpse's weight, reducing even hearty men
    to at least 20 or 30 pounds less than they weighed in life. Ecology Despite
    its savage and decayed appearance, a vrykolakas often passes through towns
    and villages undeterred, due to its supernatural ability to disguise itself.
    With the ability to cloak its terrible shape, a vrykolakas typically appears
    little different than it did in life. Death removes much of the living
    corpse's sense of who it was, though, so vrykolakas rarely reconstruct their
    original appearances with complete accuracy. Thus, family and acquaintances
    often notice the resemblance, but do not readily identify a vrykolakas as
    the resurrected individual. A vrykolakas thrives upon disease and death,
    drawing its vigor from those humanoids it passes near. It walks among the
    living merely to infect them with its grave taint, passing on the subtle
    corruption of death. Its mere touch drains the life from a victim as well,
    stealing from its very essence. A vrykolakas's favored victims typically
    come from among its former family members and friends, which it pursues with
    only half a memory of any previous connection, yet a lingering malice, as
    such former companions failed to prevent its accursed fate. A vrykolakas is
    uniquely bound to the place where it died or its body was originally
    interred. It must return to this site every Starday and bury itself amid the
    earth or stones to rest for 24 hours. A vrykolakas is entirely helpless
    during this period and can be easily destroyed if it can be located. The
    vampire-kin understand this weakness, though, and go to great lengths to
    avoid being followed to their resting places. Habitat & Society Vrykolakas
    typically appear near or in rural areas close to their graves. They walk the
    open streets of villages and hamlets during daylight hours, avoiding direct
    interaction and attention, all the while infecting those nearby and robbing
    them of their vitality. By night they seek to take their revenge more
    overtly, wreaking havoc upon the community, destroying food and property,
    attacking and smothering people in their beds, stealing valuables, and
    generally terrorizing people. Many rural superstitions and prejudices
    against strangers stem from tales of vrykolakas, slipping quietly into town
    or lurking at the edges of a community, spreading death and despair among
    the innocent. The Greek Vampire The vrykolakas (pronounced "vree-
    KO-la-kahss") is an undead creature from Greek folklore. Synonymous with
    revenants, these terrors manifest as humans that have returned from the
    grave to perform some act before they can peacefully rest. Many stories of
    the vrykolakas are not of horrid, evil undead, but of deceased persons
    attempting to return to their former lives, such as the shoemaker who
    returned from the grave to mend his children's shoes, carry water, and chop
    firewood. The more vengeful type of vrykolakas gained stronger belief in
    Greece after the arrival of Slavic immigrants, who brought with them tales
    of blood-drinking vampires and werewolves. The word vrykolakas itself
    borrows from Slavic, derived from the Bulgarian word vukodlak, vuk meaning
    "wolf " and dlaka meaning "fur." This suggests that vrykolakas were somehow
    associated with werewolves, most likely due to the Slavic belief that
    werewolves became vampires after they died. A person could become a
    vrykolakas in a variety of ways. The most common involve a person being evil
    and immoral, an excommunication from the church, or improper burial rites.
    Some thought that eating the meat of a sheep that had been killed or wounded
    by a wolf or a werewolf would turn a person into a vrykolakas. A cat or
    other animal jumping over a dead body could also result in its evil return.
    Curses, such as "may the ground not receive thee," would also condemn the
    recipient to undeath as a vrykolakas. Many also believed that a vrykolakas
    would knock at your door and call your name, but could only do so once. If
    one answered the door, he would die shortly thereafter, and become a
    vrykolakas. For this reason, the superstition that one should not answer the
    door until the second knock still exists in some Greek villages.
